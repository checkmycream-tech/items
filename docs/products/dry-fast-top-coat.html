            <li>The best topcoat I have used in awhile.</li>
            <li>My theory is that it works best with higher-quality nail polishes (like OPI and Essie)</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly three years ago, when I received it, which means I could put my jeans on and off after 15 mins after I applied it.  </li>

            <li>I have experienced severe shrinking and even chips!</li>

            <li>a great buy, for sure!</li>
            <li>BEST TOP COAT AVAILABLE!!</li>
            <li>I had read excellent things about this top coat online, and am so glad I decided to purchase it!</li>
            <li>I was impressed at how quick this nail coat works!</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff supper happy with it</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing and at a great price.</li>
            <li>I just got this, and decided to do a bright neon mani for the summer.</li>
            <li>it also leaves nail color looking bright and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I honestly think this is the best top coat ever.</li>
            <li>It enhances every colour I use, and I&#x27;m delighted to accept the accolades from friends and colleagues</li>
            <li>friend loved it.</li>
            <li>The best way is to get a bead of Seche Vite on the end of your brush, and gently smooth it over your nail.</li>
            <li>That is good.  </li>
            <li>This product is so good it doesn&#x27;t make sense.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Seche Vite for the good work in Chemistry you&#x27;ve done here.</li>
            <li>Goes on good with lots of shine</li>
            <li>It keeps the nails looking so good</li>
            <li>so I figured it must be good.  </li>
            <li>but there isn&#x27;t a good thing I can say about it.</li>
            <li>After reading the good reviews on here I decided to try it</li>
            <li>i would have loved to give this 5 stars because it works, its a miracle topcoat.</li>
            <li>one thing to take caution of is NOT to use too much of a good thing because it will cause the polish to shrink, peel, or chip faster.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite is a good buy</li>
            <li>For a damn good reason.</li>
            <li>I would say after 2-3 minutes of using the Seche Vite and I&#x27;m good to go on with my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product to prolong your manicure no matter who does your nails.</li>
            <li>I use a good quality color</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s good-</li>
            <li>Good polish.</li>
            <li>This is the most incredible product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking into a good gel nail kit myself.</li>
            <li>Now I guess business is so good they sell it everywhere.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time pkg was good</li>
            <li>So, I decided to try this because a friend said she loved it</li>
            <li>and then I read good reviews on it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good with reg. polish for a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to my Essie Good To Go.</li>
            <li>The price is a good price.</li>
            <li>I always loved it and always will.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>good packaging..</li>
            <li>I hoped it would be as good as I read and protect my nails from chipping.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t smell too good, but what nail polish does?</li>
            <li>I was expecting this nail polish to be really good</li>
            <li>Absolutely loved this product.</li>
            <li>brilliant top coat.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>recommend, shipping was good as well.</li>
            <li>A cult fave for good reason.</li>
            <li>good--</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wasn&#x27;t prepared for what a gorgeous finish it puts on your nails:  </li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>I read reviews and thought this would be a superior product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good quality and it prevents my nail polish from chipping.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy it and see if its as good as it says.  </li>
            <li>and I am good to go...</li>
            <li>A truly superior product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen magazines give it good reviews.</li>
            <li>The good thing is, the smell doesn’t linger.</li>
            <li>It has some good qualities</li>
            <li>Smooth, perfect nails every time.</li>
            <li>Mix this with a good polish and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>It also has a really good shine.</li>
            <li>Either way, it did not look good.  </li>
            <li>Good product, good price.</li>
            <li>Shiny, smooth, beautiful!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li>Good for the price.</li>
            <li>And it works really good too.</li>
            <li>Get a good look.</li>
            <li>This was not it, however good it was.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so good</li>
            <li>A great product otherwise and deserving of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>But for the price, it&#x27;s really a good buy.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it lasts a good couple of months (for people like me who do their nails almost every week)</li>
            <li>Not so good protecting the nail polish</li>
            <li>It takes about 60 seconds and you are good to go.  </li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>So I guess it must be good.</li>
            <li>not that good as ads...</li>
            <li>Put it on and within 10 minutes, you are good to go.  </li>
            <li>When I have purchased this product before in a store, I LOVED it:</li>
            <li>But the rest of my nails turned out good.</li>
            <li>All in all though it&#x27;s a good option for the price.</li>
            <li>Makes my nails looks so good and shiny.</li>
            <li>Good but shrinks.</li>
            <li>Good.........</li>

            <li>I polished my nails on a Sunday and by Wednesday they still looked nice.  </li>
            <li>The coat starts peeling iff on its own after a day or two of application.</li>
            <li>Makes my nails look really nice and has lasted two years.</li>

            <li>and it gives a nice, long-lasting finish to a manicure.  </li>
            <li>How does this top coat have so many great reviews?</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best thing ever!!!</li>
            <li>I have acrylics over my own nails</li>
            <li>Came fast, works great!</li>
            <li>I liked the look that it gave to my nails.</li>
            <li>This topcoat is perfect for all manicures and pedicures it leaves your nails looking very shiny</li>
            <li>AND it makes them look nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>Has a nice gloss level as well.</li>
            <li>The absolute best product....</li>
            <li>It adds a nice shine to any color you use.</li>
            <li>So I went and researched and many people had good things to say about this topcoat.</li>
            <li>i have started to do my own nails</li>
            <li>I have been using Out The Door top coat for a couple of years now and swore by it, but this is just as good...</li>
            <li>Gives a nice gloss finish.</li>
            <li>There is evidence that exposure to toluene at work is associated with spontaneous abortion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li>I have purchased over 20 of these and amazon has the best price with fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking around for a good top coat because my nails always seem to chip within a day or two after painting them.</li>
            <li>&#x60;Nice is Nice&#x27;</li>
            <li>It gives it a nice shine, and looks like i came put of a salon.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely--</li>
            <li>all the polish kind of way..</li>
            <li>I also like the nice glossy finish.</li>
            <li>It does have an obnoxious smell, kind of like liquid rubber.</li>
            <li>good stuff :)</li>
            <li>I purchased Seche Vite because I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about it</li>
            <li>Makes my polish stay on longer &amp; looks nice and shiney, I will be purchasing another bottle, as soon as this one, run out.</li>
            <li>It dries fast and works great!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a top coat that prevents your polish from chipping or peeling off than this isn&#x27;t for you because I find that my nail polish does still chip and peel, but hey, the price is good.</li>
            <li>my own nails had a mani once and took it off and redid.</li>
            <li>I still gave this top coat 5 stars since I don&#x27;t believe it promises drying the bottom layers, just the top, and it does a great job of that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had problems with my nail polish peeling &amp; chipping within one day of application, but when I add this top coat, the paint lasts a good 3-4 days.</li>
            <li>I was kind of on the fence about it, but figured I&#x27;d give it a try since everyone raves about it.  </li>
            <li>It looked nice with just that on my nails.</li>
            <li>I got this product after reading a lot about how wonderful &amp; fast drying it is.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been waiting for a good top coat and Seche Vite does not disappoint.</li>
            <li>Good top coat, lasted about one week.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping great product!</li>
            <li>Nothing has ever made my nails look as nice as Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>You know the kind.</li>
            <li>Drys so fast with a almost glass finish its awesome and makes any polish look brighter!</li>
            <li>I heard so many good this about this</li>
            <li>Has a nice shine to it though.</li>
            <li>Aside from that, this polish speeds up your drying time and makes your polish look spectacular.</li>
            <li>I tried so many topcoats over the years and never found one I loved until this product.  </li>
            <li>WHO are these people who write loving reviews of crappy products ?</li>
            <li>And best fast drying to coat</li>
            <li>However, if you are able to handle that type of smell and are use to thicker top coats then this product would be great for you.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice shine.</li>
            <li>Also gives a nice shine.</li>
            <li>My friends parents own a nail salon, and this is all they use.</li>
            <li>Dries sooo fast and perfectly.</li>
            <li>It was so good, I immediately bought four more.</li>
            <li>I sometimes get pedicures or do my own pedicures.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good top coat for a while.</li>
            <li>I like to do my own nails</li>
            <li>Purchased Seche Vite after having done some online research for a really good top coat.</li>
            <li>My nails and toe nails come out nice with this</li>
            <li>but sometime I wonder if this causes the shrinkage in the nail polish on day two but the quality is nice ...</li>
            <li>A must-have for those who paint their own nails.</li>
            <li>Will keep looking for a good top coat.</li>
            <li>Nice coverage</li>
            <li>Dries really fast &amp; makes your nails look great, salon style!</li>
            <li>I bought this because there were soo many good reviews on it.</li>
            <li>This time around I was able to apply a good coat except for one nail that had an excess amount of Seche Vite pool in one corner and</li>

            <li>Lucky me lol.</li>
            <li>look that I love from good top coats.  </li>
            <li>This fast drying top coat provides wonderful shone and extends the length of my manicure.</li>
            <li>It also has a strong odor, so it&#x27;s good to use it in a well ventilated space.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the absolute best top coat I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Best fast drying top coat in the market.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re the type that doesn&#x27;t like strong smells, then this polish wouldn&#x27;t be good for you.</li>

            <li>The one downside is that it has a very strong smell.</li>
            <li>However, whenever I get in the shower, it ends up chipping off very easily.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use this in 3 sweeps over the nail.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>product has a very strong, chemical scent.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This item has a very strong smell.  </li>
            <li>very easy to fade or peel off</li>

            <li>Has a VERY strong odor</li>
            <li>It chips very easy.</li>
            <li>Its a very strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>This stuff has a VERY strong odor</li>
            <li>It also has a very strong scent, so avoid inhaling it.</li>
            <li>when your nail starts to grow out the nail polish on your skin will move with the nail polish on your nail and cause it to peel very easily.</li>
            <li>However, the smell is very strong - almost like a polyurethane smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong.</li>

            <li>topcoat is magic.</li>
            <li>MAGIC, I TELL YOU.</li>
            <li>Okay so I bought a bottle</li>
            <li>I love this top coat.</li>
            <li>Love It</li>
            <li>&quot; look, but I prefer more matte nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never paint my nails without this top coat again.</li>
            <li>I love this top coat.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this top nail coat.</li>
            <li>Makes painting my nails myself WAY more convenient.</li>
            <li>Love this top coat.</li>
            <li>My favorite top coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this top coat for years.</li>
            <li>There is some shrinkage but until I find a better top coat than this</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I will never use another top coat again.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it came with free \\&quot;OPI\\&quot; slippers which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>But I have to say I&#x27;ve had much better results with the Sally Hansen topcoats.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad I tried it out, to see how well it would work.</li>
            <li>I use OPI polish and this top coat now exclusively.</li>
            <li>Miracle top coat.</li>
            <li>This is my 4th bottle of Seche Vite and I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this top coat because it&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li>Sure, many brands have removed the ingredient, but if it were truly unsafe to use for the purpose for which it was intended, it wouldn&#x27;t be allowed in any brand.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite is my go to top coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s my favorite top coat for protecting nail art, as I find it doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear my designs.</li>
            <li>OK, can I give this a MILLION stars?  </li>
            <li>Curiosity got the better of me.  </li>
            <li>It just feels so smooth and nice.  </li>
            <li>I tried this top coat</li>
            <li>and I love love it.</li>
            <li>I am in love.</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle on the spot but the price is much, much better on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>:)    </li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>I was able to do my nails then run out the door with no smearing or smudging.</li>
            <li>I love to paint my nails a striking shade of crimson</li>
            <li>but once I tried it I loved it dries fast and makes a nice shiny coat will be buying again</li>
            <li>If you want to make your life easier, get this top coat.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t top it.</li>
            <li>I would buy again :)</li>
            <li>I like Sally top coat way better than this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found a top coat like this.</li>
            <li>I love this top coat</li>
            <li>depending on how many coats you apply.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see chips for many days.</li>
            <li>Its simply the best!</li>
            <li>I love this top coat.  </li>
            <li>So until I find some miracle formula that never ever chips, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love this top coat.  </li>
            <li>As I continued to use this product over the course of dozens of manicures and pedicures, I grew to love it more and more.</li>
            <li>Seche has been able to pin-point the cause of this thickening</li>
            <li>It happens to ALL nail polishes and top coats.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>AND I LOVE THE SHINE.  </li>
            <li>polishes are more susceptible to peeling when SV has been applied.  </li>
            <li>It seems to happen most in conjunction with OPI polishes.&lt;br /&gt;You may need to replace it sooner than you think.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this product.</li>
            <li>really love the nail polish, but the Toluene bothered me.  </li>
            <li>though I have a problem with the product, I won&#x27;t take away more than one star.</li>
            <li>Ok I kid..</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I got this top coat after reading all the rave reviews on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This top coat works WONDERS.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more.</li>
            <li>This stuff is one of my favorite beauty products.  </li>
            <li>The top coat I put on my toes has lasted over a week.  </li>
            <li>I paid $10 for this and expect a much better product.  </li>
            <li>I never review products but this one really deserves a great one.</li>
            <li>This is THE top coat you need.  </li>
            <li>simply the best.</li>
            <li>, I do my nails more often with this product as the manicure and pedicure lasts longer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the ratings for this top</li>
            <li>so I probably wouldn&#x27;t have needed a top coat, except everyone recommended it.</li>
            <li>I use China Glaze polish, this top coat</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how a top coat can get any better.  </li>
            <li>After reading many reviews I decided I had to try this top coat for myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it ever since and just love its protective aspect</li>
            <li>So many products SAY they do this</li>
            <li>This top coat keeps the color from chipping for up to 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smear nail art like most will.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>&quot; that most polish companies have removed from their lacquers and treatments.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Plan to purchase this Top Coat again.</li>
            <li>I make sure to paint all the way to the tip of the nail and over, and never have any issues.</li>
            <li>To the reviewer that says it&#x27;s garbage that a top coat can be applied incorrectly:</li>
            <li>My friend did her nails at my house and told me she didn&#x27;t like the top coat.</li>
            <li>My favorite top coat.</li>
            <li>three more words</li>
            <li>Shine top coat</li>
            <li>After being thoroughly impressed with what I was reading about this product I finally purchased some.  </li>
            <li>So I looked into gel top coats and UV lights.</li>
            <li>and I gotta say I am in LOVE with it.</li>
            <li>I find that if I topcoat my polish every 4 days with this, my manicure stays better and longer.</li>
            <li>Very happy with it, this is the third time I have bought it.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Seche Vite after so many of my favorite nail blogs mentioned it in passing.</li>
            <li>Love this product and ALWAYS have it on hand.</li>
            <li>My daughters love it too.</li>
            <li>great fast service.</li>
            <li>I apply the top coat</li>
            <li>Some things was ok and others was not.</li>
            <li>great top coat, very shiny and</li>
            <li>Seche Vite is a top coat that I have used for years at the recommendation of my nail salon gal.  </li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>My nails chip after 3 days when I use this as a top coat.</li>
            <li>This top coat was the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite nail products.  </li>
            <li>My home manicure is now lasting a week+ because of this awesome stuff.</li>
            <li>i love it so.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get better than this.  </li>
            <li>All the women in my family love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>Even better than Sally Hansen.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite may work for you as it has for many</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found Out the Door to work much better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Will return to buy &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Therefore, having a way to purchase top quality products so that I can perform my own home manicures is highly important.  </li>
            <li>This is THE go-to top coat for nail professionals.</li>
            <li>I love this top coat</li>
            <li>and I am so pleased that I can find it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>How do you apply a top coat incorrectly??</li>
            <li>But I think that&#x27;s mostly because I use quality polish.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Everyone I let borrow this top coat they always go out and buy it themselves.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Seche Vite top coat from amazon about two - three months ago.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to use it for awhile to give the best review possible.    </li>
            <li>I also recommend making sure you get the sides of your nails.  </li>
            <li>Ican&#x27;t believe people don&#x27;t know about this top coat</li>
            <li>This top coat was ok, but I don&#x27;t understand the hype surrounding it.</li>
            <li>I love this top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this item for quite a while now and was glad I could find it on Amazon at a better price</li>

            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure to not get it on my skin</li>
            <li>I bring it with me whenever having a mani/pedi because it works better than the salons products.</li>
            <li>what can i say, i LOVE this top coat</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just simply THE BEST !!</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best top coat I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Nothing compares to Seche!! :))</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews about this top coat I had to try it.  </li>
            <li>It almost seems like it melts the top layer of polish and helps it to level itself out.  </li>
            <li>have read that it co-operates with some polishes better than others.  </li>
            <li>I had seen it at Walmart many times but knew nothing about it</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Also it has a much better price than at sally&#x27;s .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the shiniest top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that will work OK and not cause your polish to peel using this top coat.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this top coat.</li>
            <li>Winning combination.</li>
            <li>and i thought nothing could top it.</li>
            <li>And within about 15 minutes i was able to clack my nails together without any tack.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>I had seen a lot of reviews on this top coat, so I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li>and I would have to wait about an hour or more</li>
            <li>I love this top coat.</li>
            <li>I have been able to paint on the top coat, brush my teeth, then go to bed, without waking up with sheet marks on my nails.  </li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t use anything else and the price this time was fabulous!</li>
            <li>I love Seche Vite and at the price I got these</li>
            <li>I applied the top coat and waited approx.</li>
            <li>This top coat is my go to ever since i discovered it.</li>
            <li>and i bet you will fall in love with it to when you get to use it.</li>
            <li>but a tip is to make sure to &#x27;wrap&#x27; your nails, or make sure that you coat the tip or edges of your nail and not just the top of the nail.</li>
            <li>Love it and it is all I use now.</li>
            <li>I type all day and can&#x27;t keep nail polish unchipped for more than an eight hour work day but this top coat extended it to two or three days-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of concerned that a cheap replacement was poured in the bottle.</li>
            <li>I really love this top coat.  </li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I love this top coat</li>
            <li>I love it .</li>
            <li>I have been searching everywhere for a top coat that prevents nail polish from chipping.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I sent to my sisters and they also love.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love Seche Vite.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff for toes and finger nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way better to buy here</li>
            <li>top coat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Haven&#x27;t found a better top coat yet.</li>
            <li>I just bought it at Target (for $9.99, so buy it here on Amazon, FOR SURE</li>
            <li>, when I need more, I will buy here no question), and came home to try it out.  </li>
            <li>stay longer.! :)</li>
            <li>It went on thicker than any top coat I had ever used.</li>
            <li>That is why they have a nail polish thinner that they sale, or you can do as many of us do and add acetone until it thins out to your liking...</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE...</li>
            <li>Also the smell is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what most people want.</li>
            <li>so please do your best to use it outside or in well-ventilated areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bring this top coat with me to the nail salon every time.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this topcoat so many times</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>and I am really glad I did.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite top coat ever.</li>
            <li>It works, just saying so more people know :)</li>
            <li>there are too many negatives to make it any good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can spend all this time painting designs etc, follow through with the seche vite top coat</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>Love love LOVE this fast-drying, long-lasting topcoat.  </li>
            <li>but I am so glad I tried it because I LOVE IT!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lovely nails</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a cheapskate, so wish it were cheaper, but this is the most recommended brand by the consumer websites I checked.  </li>
            <li>I love this nail product.</li>
            <li>but I like changing color more often.</li>
            <li>Even if you make sure to paint from edge to edge, after a day, you&#x27;ll see a gap between the edge of the top coat and the skin of your finger.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite is my favorite top coat in the world.</li>
            <li>All you need is one healthy coat to seal in you</li>
            <li>I will probably never, ever use another top coat.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite for years.</li>
            <li>I found my go to top coat, looks like gel and protects against chipping</li>
            <li>Then  on top of that, after one day of having the top coat on, my nails started to chip.</li>
            <li>I have been using this top coat for a while now</li>
            <li>and I must tell you I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like magic.</li>
            <li>Also, this top coat does not streak or smudge the polish underneath in any way.  </li>
            <li>I love how this top coat finishes the look on my nails.</li>
            <li>love love love love it.</li>
            <li>I love this topcoat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nevertheless, this top coat changed my nail-polishing life.</li>
            <li>...let&#x27;s just say that I started out with maybe 20 polishes, but after I found that I&#x27;d actually be able to paint my nails way more often, at any time of day or night, even an hour before going to bed, I now have WELL</li>
            <li>I love my nail salon</li>
            <li>Magic in a bottle.  </li>
            <li>Magic.</li>
            <li>I put on 3 coats of polish and a top coat</li>
            <li>It dries faster than any top coat I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Fastest drying top coat</li>
            <li>have used oil fast drying drops, I wasn&#x27;t truly happy with it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This top coat performs much better than my OPI one.  </li>
            <li>how many layers of polish you&#x27;ve put on to a glassy finish.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to assist any with preventing nail polish chipping, so i might still need to get a non-chip top coat.</li>
            <li>I love this top coat.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try more elaborate designs now.</li>
            <li>like this product OKAY.</li>
            <li>Have been through so many top coats and decided to finally google what was the best.</li>
            <li>My wife loves being able to add a topcoat and speed up the drying process.</li>
            <li>I thought the reviews for this were more BS, and people trying to hype up a product.</li>
            <li>and I have been sent MANY top coats to review.  </li>
            <li>This is above and beyond the best one there is.</li>
            <li>i love love love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>dries fast and leaves nails looking great.</li>
            <li>and it instantly dries them and has a great shine!</li>
            <li>even when I try I always end up touching something accidentally and messing it up.  </li>
            <li>I love this, it def.</li>
            <li>I have ordered 4 more and given them as gift (kept 2)  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended it and I will never not use this now, I fell in love.</li>

            <li>I LOVE THIS TOP COAT .</li>
            <li>atleast 2-3 times a week but with this top cost it is not nessiccary</li>
            <li>I just love to paint my nails</li>
            <li>I was about to drop $100+ on a gel nail kit when I came across this top coat.</li>
            <li>I love this top coat.  </li>
            <li>Better than the driers in salons or spray</li>
            <li>I will try to find something better.</li>
            <li>I have been using this top coat for about 6 months and have been in love with it ever since.</li>
            <li>This top coat also helps with strengthening your nails.</li>
            <li>And make sure you get the thinner, as this starts to thicken as it gets to the end of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>top coat&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>many times I have to redo my polish</li>
            <li>But this top coat is heavenly.</li>
            <li>My nails looks sooo much better with this top coat.</li>
            <li>Why waist the time to paint your nails if you are not using a top coat?  </li>
            <li>Love this product when there&#x27;s about a quarter remaining it hardens.</li>
            <li>Anywho I love how the finish is and no matter the nail polish from $1 to 30</li>
            <li>This is the holy grail of top coats.</li>
            <li>Chips more than I thought too</li>
            <li>This is the top coat you&#x27;ve been looking for, the magical make-it-stay-and-dry-it-fast dream polish people talk about.</li>
            <li>I love painting my nails.</li>
            <li>I love you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-JR-</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll never buy another top coat again.</li>
            <li>There is a reason it&#x27;s a cult favorite.</li>
            <li>After a week or every 3 days apply another top coat</li>
            <li>&amp; then I used the top coat again &amp;</li>
            <li>I have used out the door top coat for years.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Keeps polish on nails looking fresh and glowing for a good two weeks or more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really fantastic addition to any lacquerista&#x27;s collection!</li>
            <li>It chips more and more.</li>
            <li>It brings out the colors and designs and it doesn&#x27;t just make my nails shine, it makes them gleam like the top of the Chrysler building, and seals everything.  </li>
            <li>It adds such gloss and shine, it looks great!</li>
            <li>are better than they have ever been</li>

            <li>Call me conceded, but I love being able to correct people and tell them I got them done myself.</li>
            <li>But this dries faster and glossier than ANY top coat I have ever tried in my life.</li>

            <li>Before I used this top coat</li>
            <li>Bought this on a recommendation from a friend and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>A top coat is supposed to protect the polish, but whenever I use this it chips soon after.</li>
            <li>Love this product, it is my go to top coat.</li>
            <li>This top does what it says it will.</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to buy more of these products.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this has so many five-star reviews.</li>

            <li>I have more colors than I have nails.</li>
            <li>LOVE  </li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>My longtime favorite fastdry topcoat is Jessica Brilliance, which I still use &amp; keep backups of at home at all times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it 3.5 - stunning finish but too many performance problems.</li>
            <li>I remember this product being better.</li>
            <li>I prefer the SALMA HAYEK NUANCE top coat that you find at CVS.  </li>
            <li>but this top coat still doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>My all time favorite top coat.</li>
            <li>The top coat drys to touch in about a minute</li>
            <li>This has been my &#x27;go-to&#x27; top coat varnish for years.</li>
            <li>Shrinkage issues (has been mentioned in many of these reviews).  </li>

            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>It seems to penetrate the polish more and keeps everything in place.  </li>
            <li>This is my fav top coat just for</li>
            <li>Every polish starts to chip within one or two days, but the fact that this one starts lifting off the nail in one layer (peeling) makes it more susceptible to chipping.</li>
            <li>It makes my nails nice and smooth and keeps the nails looking shiny.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I used to like this Top Coat that I purchased 3 bottles.</li>
            <li>After 5+ attempts with this top coat, I have had no luck.</li>
            <li>This works great for fast drying nail polish.</li>

            <li>Definitely my favorite nail product.  </li>

            <li>Will never use anything but this top coat.</li>
            <li>This top coat is a dream.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will ever buy another type of Top Coat.</li>
            <li>the most it lasts is maybe up to 2 days, then the chipping and peeling begins.  </li>
            <li>and then I finished it off with my Seche Vite top coat :)  </li>
            <li>I absolutly love it.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this stuff, and unlike most men, it will never let me down.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li>and this product is the most chip-resistant polish I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never buy anything else as a top coat</li>
            <li>I am a master of impatience, but this top coat beats me to my boredom by drying my nail polish</li>
            <li>I would rather paint more often and skip drying time....</li>
            <li>I had tried a Sally Hansen top coat before this one--</li>
            <li>but this one is even better.  </li>
            <li>but a lot of people use this top coat</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this top coat with OPI, China Glaze, Sally Hansen, Julep, Revlon, and Ulta brand nail polishes and have had no problems.</li>
            <li>With this top coat, I can leave my manicure for 3-5 days without reapplying any more polish.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>, I love how it feels on top.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>I had heard SO many rave reviews about it on YouTube.</li>
            <li>The top coat peeled off the top layer of polish.</li>
            <li>The polish I have on now has been on for 4 days, with just a China Glaze glitter polish on top, and there isn&#x27;t any chipping yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seche Vite is the top dog of topcoats.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s just nothing better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>As a top coat, I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this top coat.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish and will never use another top coat.</li>
            <li>I love collecting polishes, change colors often and love doing home manicures.  </li>
            <li>I am  not expecting to have any chipping with this manicure with a top coat of this quality.  </li>
            <li>my sis told me about this product and it is the fastest drying top coat ever.</li>
            <li>And Most tend to disappoint.</li>
            <li>if it lasts about a week i sometimes do another coat on top to make it shinier again.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s basically the go-to top coat for any nail enthusiast.</li>
            <li>So, I ran out and bought a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is ok.</li>
            <li>It dries polish almost immediately and has a lovely high-shine finish.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this top coat, would buy again in a heart beat. :)</li>
            <li>I am in love.  </li>
            <li>I love painting my nails almost to the point of obsession.</li>
            <li>I guess by the time I put the top coat on</li>
            <li>yet so I can&#x27;t say anything about the longevity of this top coat</li>
            <li>Not going to lie, I don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li>This is my favorite top coat.</li>
            <li>I have gotten compliments on my nails with this top coat.  </li>
            <li>Using this top coat has made my color stay on for over a week with no chips or peels.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different top coats - and this is the best!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This is a great top that dries fast.</li>
            <li>I love this top coat.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fall in love.</li>
            <li>The top coat firms up almost immediately</li>
            <li>Seche Vite is in a class by itself, as most polish fans already know.</li>
            <li>my chosen TC would be and Seche Vite always seemed to be the top runner in top coats.</li>
            <li>After I found this top coat, I will never buy another top coat again.</li>
            <li>This is the fastest drying top coat</li>
            <li>i paint my nails often.. have tried many top coats and none compare to this one.</li>
            <li>Better than gel.</li>
            <li>Nothing dries faster than this top coat.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I watch way too many YouTube videos</li>
            <li>and I see a lot of beauty guru&#x27;s raving about this top coat</li>
            <li>Just be sure to apply polish around tips to seal in color.  </li>
            <li>I think this chips easier than my opi top coat</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found a top coat that dries faster than that.</li>
            <li>Also if you&#x27;re a &amp;#34;picker&amp;#34; like me and enjoying peeling it off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought so many bottles of this stuff I&#x27;ve lost track.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Really smooths out my polish and leaves a great shine.</li>
            <li>Also, after a day or so, I noticed that some of the edges of the top coat was lifting off of the nail polish.</li>
            <li>However after I did more research on it I found out that it contains Toluene :</li>
            <li>Why is this the top selling nail polish?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use to always use the OPI top coat, but this one is so much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper and protects my nails better.</li>
            <li>dries fast and leaves a great shine for days.</li>
            <li>I use this over all of my nail polishes and am always satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Great price, reasonable shipping time, packaged and delivered safely.</li>
            <li>I heard about this top coat on a YouTube channel and figured I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>I will never use another Top Coat...</li>
            <li>As a result, I&#x27;ve tried many on the market.  </li>
            <li>The fact that one must purchase Seche&#x27;s proprietary thinner to be able to get anywhere close to finishing a bottle is a bit deceptive and frustrating.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was surely unnoticable to anyone but myself, but I did find that it sometimes resulted in streaking as well.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>However, I do want to see longer wear with better presentation.  </li>
            <li>This was surely unnoticable to anyone but myself, but I did find that it sometimes resulted in streaking as well.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>

            <li>Nail Envy, OPI, Sally Hensen, Gel Top Coats, Out The Door, etc.</li>
            <li>i had two coats of nail polish and a design with a sparkle top coat.  </li>
            <li>the polish is OK, but I would recommend fixing the smell of the polish.</li>
            <li>I love this, but I am switching to non-toxic nail products.</li>

            <li>However, many people do not experience this problem.</li>
            <li>or it&#x27;s the top coat itself.</li>
            <li>and it goes on much better now.</li>

            <li>I love this top coat.</li>

            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>Top Coat.</li>
            <li>but shipping would have cost more</li>
            <li>This will even make ok polishes pop.</li>
            <li>i love it and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>I thought my friend was lying when she said that a top coat that dries nail polish in</li>
            <li>I also love how it leaves a glossy glass look.</li>
            <li>It is best to reapply after 4 days to provide the same type of protection.</li>
            <li>I love the stuff .</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this top coat since it&#x27;s a cult favorite but didn&#x27;t want to pay salon price in case</li>
            <li>really love Seche Top Coat</li>
            <li>This is definitely the BEST topcoat I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>This top coat does not prolong nail color.</li>
            <li>I apply it as a top coat</li>
            <li>have tried a couple of top coats, from revlon to essie to sally hansen to OPI.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic.</li>
            <li>but most topcoats seem to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes I like to do nail art and paint cute designs.</li>
            <li>When I put this top coat on it flattened out my work-</li>
            <li>in all I love the finish it gives but wish it would stay on longer.</li>
            <li>Love this top coat.  </li>
            <li>I had to try Seche Vite myself before I could believe the hype... and for the most part, it has lived up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Saves EVEN MORE time when you&#x27;re doing your nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but after the 1 day, the nail polish started chipping even faster than without the top coat.  </li>
            <li>I will not buy thing again and will be looking for another top coat.</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d invest in a better top coat....</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s from Amazon you&#x27;re safe.</li>
            <li>no matter how many layers of nail polish you have on.</li>
            <li>I did not experience any &amp;#34;polish shrinkage&amp;#34; or thickening of the top coat as others have stated.</li>
            <li>just okay.</li>
            <li>However this top coat is literally a godsend and will make your nails look like you went to a salon.</li>
            <li>No need to look for another top coat.</li>
            <li>It stays shiny for a week or more.</li>
            <li>I like this top coat.  </li>
            <li>I will never use another top coat.</li>
            <li>I will just stick with my Loreal top coat..</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how this top coat goes on.</li>
            <li>I love this top coat and every friend I lend it to raves about it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I love it.</li>
            <li>, I would recommend it every time for sure</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I used to use China Glaze&#x27;s top coat, but Seche Vite surpasses CG in a way I never could have imagined.</li>
            <li>All in all, I love the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love having polish on my nails, it&#x27;s like an accessory to me.</li>
            <li>and there is something about the brush that is better than most</li>
            <li>Regarding the smell, I feel like every top coat polish</li>
            <li>My favorite nail top coat.</li>
            <li>have seen this at Target, but Amazon&#x27;s prices are always better.</li>
            <li>I cannot explain why this top coat does not work for me when for</li>
            <li>top coat.</li>
            <li>I love painting my nails</li>
            <li>Also, I did not find the smell of the product to be overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li>and I have painted my nails using this as the top coat and went to sleep under the covers without any marks in the morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many times, but it seems to always chip either in the shower, or at school/ work, when I&#x27;m just typing etc.</li>
            <li>but then you get use to it. :-)</li>
            <li>I love how it helps with the chiping though.</li>
            <li>this top coat is awsome</li>
            <li>can polish your nails and put this top coat on and in 5 minutes do anything you want.</li>
            <li>A friend referred this product to me as the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;fastest drying&amp;#34; top coat.</li>
            <li>It works very well for me great product</li>
            <li>used to use OPI top coat</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>&quot; were plausible.</li>
            <li>Glad I gave this top coat another try.</li>
            <li>The top coat was peeling off within a couplehours.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an alternative, buy Sally Hansen&#x27;s Dries Instantly top coat.</li>
            <li>but until there is another top coat that is in any way comparable to this one, I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I started looking for this product after seeing it many times in YouTube videos containing nail art.</li>
            <li>But for setting polish, I haven&#x27;t found a better product yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>AND it&#x27;s way cheaper and more practical than getting your nails done each week.</li>
            <li>It;s the Fastest Drying Top Coat</li>
            <li>Glad I read reviews on this brand</li>
            <li>and I go thru So many bottles as I change my nail art every day .</li>
            <li>Definitely the best topcoat I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Seche Vite Top Coat on Amazon because it was a bit more pricey at every store in my area.</li>
            <li>After trying it out for a while, I bought more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my #1 top coat now.</li>
            <li>I love this top coat.  </li>
            <li>My favorite top coat.</li>
            <li>Where has this top coat been all my life?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Sally Hansen products, Out the Door Top Coat, all of these, and none of them compare.</li>
            <li>You still have to wait a bit before touching your nails to anything but the wait time for me has been drastically reduced.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The edges will shrink in with this top coat.  </li>
            <li>I love you, Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re functioning and digging in your purse within an hour at most.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many top coats and</li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>It gives a yellowish top coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars as a neutral review because it does work but to me health wise at the stake of vanity isn&#x27;t really worth the risk.</li>
            <li>I love this top coat.</li>
            <li>Love this top coat.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have used Seche Vite many times before.</li>
            <li>It works ok</li>
            <li>but I like another brand  that I used better.</li>
            <li>I love this top coat.</li>
            <li>It leaves a wonderful shine and last for many uses.  </li>
            <li>then I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d be pulled from the shelves</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and will definately continue to purchase this item.</li>
            <li>Somehow, when the top coat dries, it shrinks in, pulling the polish with it.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat this top coat.</li>
            <li>Saw this top coat recommended in a magazine and bought it.</li>
            <li>What could be better?</li>
            <li>Love this top coat.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Top Coat.</li>
            <li>I am in love.</li>
            <li>Just apply the top coat when nails are dull.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>But infinitely better than the hours I used to (unsuccessfully) attempt to wait out!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this at a top coat along with Orly Bonder (orange-y with a purple cap).  </li>
            <li>And to top it all off</li>
            <li>Even over MANY</li>
            <li>So like I said, it&#x27;s made of magic.</li>
            <li>and I am able to do ANYTHING without getting smudges/marks in my nails</li>
            <li>cannot say enough about how great this product is!!</li>
            <li>I have heard about this topcoat from all the favorite nail bloggers, so I just HAD to try it</li>
            <li>and I am in love</li>
            <li>I did my nails yesterday using this as a top coat.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>; are my two favorite top coats.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I survived before discovering these two top coats.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing at how fast it dries the polish!!!</li>
            <li>I really like this top coat with all my O.P.I polishes, and I have tried many, It prevents any chipping!!</li>
            <li>I paint my nails in a rush before leaving the house, or nights when I have the bright idea of painting my nails right before bed.</li>
            <li>Its fast drying and it paints on very nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d have even better results if I used a high quality nail polish underneath, but it still did a great job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hands down the best top coat ever!</li>
            <li>Hands down, the BEST top coat I have EVER tried!</li>
            <li>Hands down the best top coat!</li>
            <li>but the price is so much higher!!!</li>
            <li>so I ordered this and was very excited about this.</li>
            <li>I was very excited</li>
            <li>Like everyone else I was VERY excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li>Perfect shine, long lasting topcoat, and the best part is it dries nails ROCK</li>
            <li>flat, just perfect!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good top coat - probably one of the better ones I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Excellent, super fast, super shiny topcoat!</li>
            <li>Great top coat, but my dog was highly allergic to it.</li>
            <li>Love how quickly this top coat dries!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously this top coat dries so fast is just amazing and truly makes everything stand out!</li>
            <li>The service was fast and the quality was amazing for its price thank you! :)</li>
            <li>It holds up pretty well for a good week possibly more.  </li>
            <li>a great product that&#x27;s a decent price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time buying this product it has so many good reviews that I decided to give it a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first got this bottle of top coat, I loved it.</li>
            <li>seems like a pretty good top coat.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m in a hurry and my nails look nice and clean</li>
            <li>Totally awesome, I love this top coat and use it for every single time I paint my nails.</li>
            <li>Be warned it does have a very potent odor, but for chip free nails it is more than worth it!</li>
            <li>High gloss, great addition to that home and salon mani/pedi.</li>
            <li>Great product- highly recommend</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick drying, crystal clear, and it gives you a wonderful glossy finish.</li>
            <li>I even like to put on up to 3 coats of my colored polish, and still this top coat creates a really nice seal that hardens quickly and is not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>this top coat is amazing over chunky glitter and makes it super sparkly and your nails will have a smooth/slick surface.</li>
            <li>I like that this top coat dries very quickly, but I wish it was stronger to keep polish from chipping better.</li>
            <li>This top coat is amazing and dries so quickly.</li>
            <li>..only think it can peel off easily sometimes..must polish on corners or sometimes more than one after a day for better results</li>
            <li>This is the best top coat because my nails are completely dry in minutes instead of hours.</li>
            <li>the best top and dry coat...have been using it for years</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s normally about $10 in stores, so this is a great deal.</li>
            <li>Its also great to reapply another coat (especially at the top) if you are noticing any chipping or rubbing off of the color!</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li>but, man its awesome, my nails are not professionally manicured</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty good stuff.  </li>
            <li>love love love amazon for having this miracle polish available.</li>
            <li>She called me the day after she first used it to complain that it wasn&#x27;t any good because her nail polish peeled off in sheets by morning.</li>
            <li>I can get about a week which is pretty good for finger nails.</li>
            <li>Best buy in a long time.  </li>
            <li>The result is beautiful nails that look like they were professionally done.    </li>
            <li>and I absolutely loved it at first</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at it.</li>
            <li>so so much longer thanks to this top coat: your nail&#x27;s best friend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a fast drying top coat, but when I started getting more into nail art, I wanted to buy a good one.</li>
            <li>This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve used because it dries my nails so fast and makes my life SO much easier.</li>
            <li>Pretty good sealing coat for nails.</li>
            <li>They looked great, super stoked, right?</li>
            <li>Even after the first chip, my nails stayed looking decent for over a week.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li>However, it is not so great if you&#x27;re looking for a protective top coat, the color chipped pretty quickly with this.</li>
            <li>A good top coat, but peels off pretty easily still.</li>
            <li>I am excited to give it a try for myself!</li>
            <li>and I was so excited!</li>
            <li>Its well worth the money though!!</li>
            <li>But SO worth it!!</li>
            <li>Awesome dry time.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I used the nail polish again, and it was dry within seconds, shiny, perfect, no smudge, and just perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and is nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>Love how shiny and strong this glaze is.</li>
            <li>dries quickly and with a nice shine.</li>
            <li>But best thing is it is totally dry in under 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and leaves a nice shine.  </li>
            <li>Dries nails quickly and leaves an amazing shine.&lt;br /&gt;Peals and chips sometimes.</li>
            <li>It dries very quickly, and is a durable top coat.</li>
            <li>I do like it because it dries quickly, but i dont see anything particularly amazing about the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky if my nail polish lasts 24 hours without chipping to be completely honest.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong, and I&#x27;m sure the chemicals are not the healthiest, but this stuff WORKS.</li>
            <li>; top coat works just as well, and has a very mild scent.</li>
            <li>Picking/peeling at the nail polish off your nails, this top coat peels off easily...</li>
            <li>do not get any peeling or shrinkage with this topcoat and it dries quickly and with a nice shine.  </li>
            <li>, in the end, I find that this dries quickly, looks nice, and works with a variety of polishes (both those that are &amp;#34;3 free&amp;#34; and those that are not).  </li>
            <li>This is the best nail dry product ever.  </li>
            <li>does have a strong odor, as most polishes.  </li>
            <li>It goes on nice and glosses, dries quickly but peels off within 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be best if applied when the top color coat is still wet.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s kind of fun to peel off the top coat and still have nail polish on</li>
            <li>But overall good product, not so good receiving it.</li>
            <li>The Seche Vite top coat had the effect of softening any mistakes in the polish and letting the colored polish underneath flow into a more perfectly smooth layer.  </li>
            <li>The glazed look you get on the top of your nails will make almost any manicure look fabulous and feel smooth!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really mind the smell, so its all good things for me :)</li>
            <li>I use this top coat faithfully and love it so much!!!</li>
            <li>Great so far!</li>
            <li>The formula penetrates all the layers of ur polish and dries it super fast that way not to mention the shine it leaves is beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time!!</li>
            <li>(+) Dries nails VERY fast, leaves a beautiful sheen, makes nail color very vibrant!  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast, the price was great, and the product is by far the best fast drying topcoat I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and I&#x27;ve tried just about everyone on the market</li>
            <li>Seche Vite Fast Drying Top Coat is by far the best top coat I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It arrived in a decent amount of time, and is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>It does get more viscous about halfway through the bottle, but I just add some Orly Thinner and it works fine.</li>
            <li>Im sure the product is fine, but I bought basically nothing.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother with other top coats, this one is the best.</li>
            <li>This top coat is perfect for covering, protecting, and drying any other polish you are using.</li>
            <li>Great top coat and super fast drying time</li>
            <li>I have used other top coats for my pedicures but this one is the best.</li>
            <li>is the only top coat that dries flawlessly and quickly</li>
            <li>Love this nail polish - dries all layers so quick!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product since it&#x27;s the most top-rated top coat on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Puts a top coat on like getting a shellac manicure and dries so quickly!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any other top coat since the time I bought this, it&#x27;s my best friend now!</li>
            <li>My manicures typically last about 5-6 days with this top coat (of course a good quality polish helps!)  </li>
            <li>It is magnificent, fine as on the Picture, corresponds to the Description, fast Delivery, high Quality of a product, I am completely satisfied with Purchase</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly, dries SUPER quick, and will make your nails look amazingly shiny for days and days!</li>
            <li>It makes your nails look shiny and bright, and it&#x27;s a high quality top coat.</li>
            <li>It is a nice top coat and it dries very fast.</li>
            <li>Amazing top coat drys very fast .</li>
            <li>Wow, just used and dries very fast with beautiful shiny coat!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased so many brands of top coats that came highly recommended to me, but this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Remember to look at factual sources of evidence, and not automatically assume that someone&#x27;s anecdotal \\&quot;knowledge\\&quot; is somehow more accurate.</li>
            <li>I know many enjoy the \\&quot;glossy\\</li>
            <li>product itself, as most others have mentioned, is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Well, I generally have to do my nails every 3 days, but I have had this manicure for about 5 days, and it is still beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how they manage it, but Seche Vite managed to make a top coat that doesn&#x27;t bond to nail polish (and no, I don&#x27;t use cheap Wal-Mart nail polish</li>
            <li>Some of the top coats I looked at where cheaper than this, and stated here was no use for a UV light.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, dries faster than the speed of light, and NEVER smudges!</li>
            <li>Okay, Seche Vite is cheap.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re attentive to detail, you&#x27;ll notice this top coat shrinks around the edges of the nails.</li>
            <li>so far, the best top coat i&#x27;ve ever used, and the fact that it dries really fast boosts the product.</li>
            <li>I have lots of bottles of cheap top coats that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have to re-do the polish or put on another layer of top coat if I&#x27;m trying to smooth out a spot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Well no, it&#x27;s not reasonable because the product is so wonderful that I would pay 3x the amount I paid.</li>
            <li>Please be advised that this is a top coat, so if you still wear cheap nail polish underneath, it may still chip.  </li>
            <li>This top coat is fabulous.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for painting impatient kids nails:) I find myself saying yes to nail painting more often</li>
            <li>if you nick it, the top coat re-seals itself and becomes smooth again.</li>
            <li>This is a really fantastic top coat.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel it helped keep my nail polish on any longer than a cheap brand top coat.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic top coat.</li>
            <li>love nail art in particular and this is the best top coat I &#x27;ve ever tried: it dries super fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s available in beauty stores for slightly more.</li>
            <li>My package came on top and wrap securely.</li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST fast drying top coat that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Your nail dries real fast with a nice shine coat...</li>
            <li>The top coat is solid and leaves a beautiful finish to my nails.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s what is most important to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product and dries really fast.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if they are good for nails or not.</li>
            <li>I loved this stuff so much I gave a bottle to my mom before I realized it contained the harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>Dies really fast and a good shine.</li>
            <li>The Good: Dries extremely fast.</li>
            <li>The good side of the polish is that it dries fast.</li>
            <li>Price is really good and ships fast.</li>
            <li>I loved it and was ready to rate it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s kind of worth it.</li>
            <li>It dries very easy and quick.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best top coat i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best top coat for the price.</li>
            <li>Hands down, THE best top coat.</li>

            <li>THE best top coat I have ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li>The best top coat ever, hands down.  </li>
            <li>best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used hands down</li>
            <li>I love the shine from this polish and fast shipping too!!!</li>
            <li>dries super fast and looks great</li>
            <li>My nails dry smoothly and look wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Totally in love with the glossy shine, the perfectly smooth coverage, and easy application.  </li>

            <li>This is super fast drying allowing for a great finish on any nail.</li>
            <li>I was a loyal Out The Door top coat user but after trying Seche Vite top coat I don&#x27;t think I will have to continue my search.</li>
            <li>/&gt;All-in-all I would say that it is the best top coat I have ever used (OPI was my previous go-to)</li>
            <li>I like this top coat because it dries super fast,probably one of the fastest drying top coats .</li>

            <li>Great product with super fast shipping</li>
            <li>However, I have noticed that my polish chips much more quickly compared to when I use a cheaper top coat.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s really fantastic and makes at home manicures very accessible.</li>

            <li>The formula is perfect, and holds it&#x27;s shine a lot longer than the other brand I used.  </li>
            <li>so cool!</li>
            <li>You only need one coat over your polish and you are good!</li>
            <li>Dries very fast, beautiful shine, thanks.</li>
            <li>I take this to the salon whenever I get a mani pedi just to make sure my nails are dry when I leave - it is that good!</li>
            <li>I work in New York, and all the professional manicurists say this is the best top coat.</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and easily, dries super fast and the end result looks great.  </li>
            <li>I will be a happy girl when there&#x27;s a fast-dry top coat that doesn&#x27;t have extra shine.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Does thicken in the bottle but can be easily restored with &amp;#34;Restore&amp;#34;.Best price @ Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing manicure product I have ever met in my whole life.</li>
            <li>This is my go to top coat, dries fast, leaves nails looking amazing.</li>
            <li>My issue with this is that it can chip easily.</li>
            <li>It comes off easy with polish remover, not like the glitter polish.  </li>
            <li>I will say that Seche Vite dries very quickly, with no bubbles in the polish</li>
            <li>The shipping was very quick, which is always a plus.</li>
            <li>the one downside is it no longer applies easily.</li>
            <li>This stuff dries really fast and leaves a nice smooth finish!</li>
            <li>They bend and break really easily, and growing them out is a b***h-and-a-half.</li>
            <li>Dries very quickly and truly no marks or smudges on your manicure after.  </li>
            <li>Comes off easily with non-acetone and acetone removers.</li>
            <li>Best REAL fast dry and protective top coat I have tried to date.</li>
            <li>and I got the package very quickly.</li>
            <li>Dries fast and when used with OPI nail polish, my nails stay chip free for a good week or so.</li>
            <li>Actually dries my nails at an incredible speed and keeps them smooth.</li>
            <li>I am a mommy to a very hyperactive toddler and this top coat is amazing for me.</li>
            <li>It is such a great top coat.</li>
            <li>chips and peels easily.</li>
            <li>This makes home manicures so easy.</li>
            <li>So its easy to put ripples in your nails from the polish sliding if you run it over something.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It dries very quickly and even works well with 2 or 3  damp color layers beneath it.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think that a top coat would make a world of a difference on my nails, but it really does.</li>
            <li>and it dries very quickly</li>
            <li>This is a great top coat that makes your polish last days longer and gives any nail color an even look.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I honestly am amazed at how fast this top coat dries.</li>
            <li>As indicated, dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>It gives a great shiny finish, though this doesn&#x27;t last for more than a day, maybe two.</li>
            <li>It seems to come off quite easily and will peel the rest of itself off.</li>
            <li>Your nails chip easily with this stuff.</li>
            <li>Very quick at drying.</li>
            <li>I really need an amazing top coat that seals everything in and keeps chips off.</li>
            <li>but honestly if you want a extremely FAST drying top coat</li>
            <li>It dries fast, and is by far the best on I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>this has easily become a must have for my nails.  </li>
            <li>I am loving this top coat; it really does wonders to the hardest drying nail polish.</li>
            <li>The highlight is that it dries VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>It smooths out the color polish and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries your nail enamel very quick; within seconds.</li>
            <li>It makes the nails look like you put in a lot of work, when it maybe takes five good minutes, just to make sure it&#x27;s completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>Buy with a bottle of Seche Restore because it gets gloppy in the bottle very quickly.</li>
            <li>It makes colors pop and shine and it also allows for glitter polishes to be taken off easily.</li>
            <li>I goes on smooth and really keeps a good finish to prevent chipping.  </li>
            <li>Still an amazing top coat and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>nice polish dries super fast, and nice glow</li>
            <li>I can easily wear my polish for a week before they chip, and that&#x27;s WITHOUT babying them and still doing dishes/etc.</li>
            <li>Easily to peel off.</li>
            <li>I liked that this was a fast drying top coat.</li>
            <li>My nail polish chips easily</li>
            <li>It also dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s not obnoxiously shiny, just an overall great top coat.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t chip easily.  </li>
            <li>This is the best top coat that I have used, and I have used quite a few others.</li>
            <li>It also has the virtue of being very quick drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gel polish is not an option for me because my nails grow very quickly.</li>
            <li>But, it is easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does have a somewhat strong smell.</li>
            <li>It has a strong odor, but that does not affect the quality.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t get over the strong smell.  </li>
            <li>It is durable and strong.</li>
            <li>Also, the odor on this stuff is SOOO strong.</li>
            <li>I was about 10 feet away from it and the chemical smell was so strong</li>
            <li>She said she loved it because it made a so-so DIY manicure look put together and gave a nice lasting gel effect to nails.</li>
            <li>It makes your nails strong while its on.</li>
            <li>It keeps my manicure strong longer.</li>
            <li>She said she loved it because it made a so-so DIY manicure look put together and gave a nice lasting gel effect to nails.</li>
            <li>The top coat is super fast drying and leaves your manicure looking glossy and gorgeous and protected.</li>
            <li>Feels strong.</li>
            <li>Strong chemical smell</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews about Seche Vite before I ordered and used it, so I was well-prepared for shrinkage, peeling, and strong odor.</li>
            <li>but yes, the odor is strong and does linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want</li>
            <li>Smells strong</li>
            <li>This is by far a superior top coat...</li>
            <li>However the smell is really strong.</li>
            <li>(-) Smells strong, doesn&#x27;t prevent chipping, thickens up and requires additional nail polish thinner  </li>
            <li>It does have a strong odor, however.</li>
            <li>and I loved the fact that it gives such a nice shiny finish</li>
            <li>Although (I can tolerate this), there is a really strong smell once I used it.</li>
            <li>The most important thing to me in a top coat is how quickly it dries; followed by shine factor.</li>
            <li>I know all nail polish has a strong smell</li>
            <li>Really strong chemicals in this.</li>
            <li>It is almost painfully strong smelling, but it does it&#x27;s job.  </li>
            <li>It does have a strong odor</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell to it, but it wears off.</li>
            <li>This is a great high shine, quick drying too coat.</li>
            <li>But again, one afternoon of removing stubborn polish, instant dry-time, and a full week or more of a perfect manicure is SO worth it IMO.</li>
            <li>I also love that if your polish smudges at all this top coat fixes that problem right away.</li>
            <li>If you like to change your polish a lot, as I do, this is perfect, because it looks flawless for a few days and then, when it starts to chip, you&#x27;re naturally ready to change to a new color anyway.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite&#x27;s Dry Fast Top Coat is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This gives such an awesome shine to my nails and they dry so fast with an awesome finish.</li>
            <li>Most awesome fast dry top coat ever.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite dry fast top coat is one of the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li>The reviews all said positive things &amp; it seemed just to good to be true.</li>
            <li>I very love this product because it helps me keeping my polished nail much longer.</li>
            <li>This stuff really is amazing and dries my nails so fast!</li>
            <li>It was amazing for the first six months.</li>
            <li>I will still use it because it&#x27;s the best top coat I have found, but if I found something better that wasn&#x27;t so thick and gooey at the end</li>
            <li>The price here was ridiculously good; it&#x27;s normally $10 at Target/Ulta.</li>
            <li>would NOT recommend this product unless you&#x27;re only looking for a beautiful, glossy look for an hour---and even then, there are no guarantees.</li>
            <li>There is a beautiful sheen and your regular nail polish looks like a gel mani!</li>
            <li>It turns any regular nail polish into a beautiful manicure.</li>
            <li>Especially good for dark colors, any brand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, seriously the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super quick drying and amazingly shiny.</li>
            <li>This is the best quick dry nail polish I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best, hands down.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best.</li>
            <li>I use this in combination with a quick dry spray for the best and fastest results.</li>
            <li>It is the best quick dry I have ever used and cheaper on amazon then stores.</li>
            <li>I had searched Amazon for hours looking through all of the different fast drying top coats, but most of the reviews weren&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li>I only buy this top coat because it dries quickly, and protects beautifully.</li>
            <li>But even better than that it has the most amazing glossy shine!&lt;br /&gt;Despite the thick layer it still does a great job of keeping bubbles from forming in your color coats.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a sturdy and effective everday top coat nail laquer.</li>
            <li>The thinner makes it good as new.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good as new.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good as new.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the best fast drying top coat that I have ever tried!  </li>
            <li>It is very good, dry fast and more glossy with the color under it!</li>
            <li>I notice though if you apply too many of these top coats it hardens the polish so much that it can break off!</li>
            <li>It brushed on so smoothly, leveling everything off beautifully.</li>
            <li>And by the way, if you do end up buying this product despite my warnings, then fine.</li>
            <li>95% of my nail polish is just fine.</li>
            <li>I have concerns however about the \\&quot;fine print\\&quot; on the label that reads \\&quot;This product</li>
            <li>The top coat comes out beautifully shiny and doesn&#x27;t drag through the color underneath.  </li>
            <li>I used to try out all those cool nail art designs on youtube, taking my time, perfecting every nail, and then finishing it off with a cheap top coat.</li>
            <li>It dries in less than 10 minutes which is great!</li>
            <li>It works great at first, dries fast &amp; is shiny, but, it shrinks on your nails, pulling the polish away from the edges of your nail.</li>
            <li>It glides on so smoothly and adds a beautiful shine, I would recommend this to anybody who paints their nails regularly.</li>
            <li>It comes on really easily and smooth.</li>
            <li>:) Normally when I paint my nails and do my own thing at night my nails smudge and get all ruined even after I painted my nails like 2 hours before.</li>
            <li>I love how this dries super quick!  </li>
            <li>Seche Vite worked fine, but it was a thicker formula.</li>
            <li>I fell in love the first time i used Seche Vite as my top coat</li>
            <li>Does what it promises - quick dries the polish without bubbling!</li>
            <li>Does its job, dries up quick!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t imagine how quick it showed up!</li>
            <li>yes, quick drying too!</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and keeps your nails from chipping for more than a week.</li>
            <li>This one is tremendous!</li>
            <li>I used to be a LOYAL out the door top coat user, swore I would never switched until someone on a beauty blog mentioned this stuff and gave it rave reviews, so I bought a bottle.</li>
            <li>Got here quickly, too!</li>
            <li>I also love how quickly it dries your nails.</li>
            <li>This top coat dries quickly and lives up to the shine that bloggers write about.</li>
            <li>Dries so quickly!</li>
            <li>Oh and it&#x27;s super shiny!</li>
            <li>I really love the shine and the super speedy drying time.</li>
            <li>It makes my nails super glossy, but my polish comes off faster than it would without a top coat.</li>
            <li>Today my nails are super shiny :)</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it dries in record time, and that the finish is super glossy.</li>
            <li>As a quick drying top coat, it did the job.</li>
            <li>I quickly put another coat of this on top of it before I ran out the door, and within a couple moments it had cured all the flaws of my self-manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This topcoat dries really, really quickly!</li>
            <li>It makes your nails super shiny and gives them salon strength!  </li>
            <li>And it stays super shiny for weeks!</li>
            <li>It also dries quickly which I love.</li>
            <li>Comes out shiny and dries quickly!</li>
            <li>I do another quick coat over top.</li>
            <li>It peels off so quickly!</li>
            <li>It dries SO much more quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and safely.  </li>
            <li>Shiny and quick drying two thumbs up!</li>
            <li>I use it for quick manis and to reseal the top coat every couple of days.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so super glad</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and in tact!  </li>
            <li>Makes them feel so smooth and strong too.</li>
            <li>Came Quickly!</li>
            <li>and it dries so quickly!</li>
            <li>It provides a super shiny coat and lasts for days and is inexpensive, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>This leaves a super shiny coat on top.</li>
            <li>And, it is super shiny too!  </li>
            <li>It dries really quickly and leaves a lovely shine.</li>
            <li>I love that it dries so quickly.</li>
            <li>This dries so quickly and doesn&#x27;t chip!  </li>
            <li>Dries so quickly and lasts!</li>

            <li>this is a super top coat.  </li>
            <li>I love this nail polish for its quick drying time.  </li>
            <li>I had so many high hopes for this top coat because it had so many reviews and rah rah comments</li>
            <li>&quot; time (you know... can&#x27;t touch anything or you ding those perfect smooth nails) from hours down to minutes.</li>
            <li>It makes my nails look professional and amazing, and the best part is that it lasts a long time before chipping.</li>
            <li>So I at first was very excited and pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>you really cannot ask for more!</li>
            <li>I normally pay the $6 extra after EVERY manicure, but now I can just add this on myself for sooo many applicant&#x27;s, great!</li>
            <li>:) I searched for so long for a good top coat</li>
            <li>Also, the brush in the bottle might mess up the shininess of your nail because the brush can&#x27;t perfectly polish your nail because it makes your nail bumpy.</li>
            <li>This dry fasy top coat is hands down the best top coat I have ever used!!</li>
            <li>I use super cheap nail polish and just top my nails with this.  </li>

            <li>good stuff drys super fast.</li>

            <li>It dries so fast so which is perfect for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t have time to wait for nail polish to dry. :)</li>
            <li>Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat is the best product I have found yet for finishing my manicures at home.</li>
            <li>It dries super fast and adds amazing shine to polishes :)</li>
            <li>This gives me the best sparkle by far and dries super fast.</li>

            <li>the best dry fast top coat i</li>
            <li>It dries super fast and it&#x27;s just an amazing top coat.</li>
            <li>but it certainly looks nice.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the bottle, a very strong paint smell hit me.</li>
            <li>This top coat works well against most dings and it certainly works as directed.</li>
            <li>was definitely impressed with the outcome of this fast dry top coat and is worth it for this price!</li>
            <li>I use Opi, Essie, and China Glaze exclusively because as a healthcare worker the cheap polishes chip after 3 hand-washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great price for this product also, it is double in stores.</li>
            <li>Dries instantly and it leaves my nails looking great.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wondering why this is so cheap</li>
            <li>The bottle was misprinted and looked cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Before I talk about the product itself, I feel that it is important to mention the over-exaggerated topic of toluene.</li>
            <li>I only bought this because of the great reviews.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this stuff is.</li>
            <li>Keeps polish on securely for days.</li>
            <li>Fast drying, nice shiny finish.  </li>
            <li>but it was cheap and looked like it would get the job done.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth I like it</li>
            <li>Plus, my nails were shiny and smooth as glass.</li>
            <li>Think automotive clearcoat - glassy and smooth and awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only problem I had was that it sometimes peeled off with some nail polishes, but stayed on great with my lacquers.</li>
            <li>You could type or do light work.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that Seche Restore is fantastic for thinning out all brands of nail polish as well, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.      </li>
            <li>I apply a lot in order to have a smooth look and</li>
            <li>Seche Vite fixes my crappiest nail painting jobs, makes the tops smooth as glass.</li>
            <li>I work in a nursing home, so I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands and changing gloves, and this is by far the BEST top coat I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used a TON.</li>
            <li>I use the goopier one to do my free edge.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>Cheap for the money but its also cheap quiality.</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t make it worth the $8-$15 that I would routinely pay, hoping for a better result than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do enjoy peeling off my nail polish</li>
            <li>Smooth, glossy, smudge free nails every time.</li>
            <li>The shiny smooth coat it leaves makes people ask me where I got my nails done,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent top dollar on top coats, an gels, and this by far was the best topcoat I have ever received.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t, I recommend [[ASIN:B004F82HB8 Beauty Secrets Nail Polish Thinner]] for the great price and big lasts forever</li>
            <li>Smooth like GLASS.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read a lot of blog posts touting the amazingness of Seche Vite, but I wasn&#x27;t sure it would be worth the price.  </li>

            <li>It FILLED IN EVERYWHERE</li>
            <li>My nails were filled in,</li>
            <li>I will admit that it does tend to &amp;#34;scratch&amp;#34; after a few days, so it stops being perfectly shiny.</li>
            <li>seems that they should supply for free if their product is going to act that way.</li>
            <li>I even looked up the sheche restore from this seller which was really cheap too</li>
            <li>Perfectly smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I had heard such great things about this too....</li>
            <li>Thanx Jen fabulous for the suggestion</li>
            <li>One bottle has a lot of product, too, and the brush is really nice at spreading (though sometimes too much polish gets on there).</li>
            <li>Purchased on Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find it in a regular drug store, so I don&#x27;t know if it would be cheaper in a store, but this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and doesnt bubble.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait until their color polishes are available.  </li>
            <li>A shiny topcoat is not THAT important to me.  </li>

            <li>My nails now stay chip free for about a week.</li>

            <li>It dries quickly in a smooth gloss.  </li>
            <li>This is the best..best...best for making your nail polish shiny and smooth.  </li>

            <li>LOL I&#x27;ve now discarded all my other bottles of top coat--</li>
            <li>Only top coat to use!!  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li>I have used this stuff religiously, and LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>This will be the last top coat you ever try!!</li>
            <li>It peels off in one whole sheet, ugh!!!</li>
            <li>I am a very busy girl and a very creative one at that.</li>
            <li>Received quickly and in good, new condition.  </li>
            <li>This is seriously the BEST top coat I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It dries super quickly which I absolutely love.</li>
            <li>I liked this fast drying top coat, because it does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ended up with too many full bottles of top coats I no longer use and they can be very expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I thought it was too good to be true, but after five or ten minutes I was able to rummage through my purse, pick eye goops out of my dog&#x27;s eyes, and then wash my hands (because eww, eye goops).</li>
            <li>On the positive side:  it dries quickly and leaves nails with a nice shine.  </li>
            <li>best top coat ever- can use on wet nails and it dries super fast.</li>
            <li>I think this is largely because of the glossy and clear finish I get from Seche Vite--though I will take credit for the years of experience, but a manicure or pedicure won&#x27;t look professional no matter how good you are if you don&#x27;t have a good top</li>
            <li>It is a very good top coat that does dry pretty quickly and stays shiny.</li>
            <li>No seriously this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, dries quickly, and is ultra-protective.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite top coat I&#x27;ve ever owned because it dries SUPER fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also read a lot of complaints about it chipping super easy.</li>
            <li>It is strong smelling and says not to be used if you&#x27;re pregnant.  </li>
            <li>Also important, I did not wake up the next day with sheet and pillowcase imprints in my nails-- nice!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the super strong smell</li>
            <li>My favorite top coat for normal polish AND KONAD STAMPING.</li>

            <li>Not only does it dry in no time,it also keeps my mani in great shape for two weeks or more!!</li>
            <li>It leaves a surface that is smooth and super shiny, and it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>The very BEST aspect, though, is that it really DOES dry in a minute or so.  </li>
            <li>It smoothed out bumpy polish, dries fast, and leaves a nice salon worthy shine.</li>
            <li>This is the best fast dry polish I have ever used.</li>
            <li>would say this is more ideal for people who need their top coat to dry quickly, but don&#x27;t mind changing their polish frequently.</li>
            <li>I must say it drys extremely fast, my nails are almost instantly dry, which is Great!!!</li>
            <li>I have been using this fast dry nail topcoat for 20 years and it is the best!</li>
            <li>The BEST feature is its fast dry formula.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite Dry Fast Topcoat is the best topcoat on the market.</li>
            <li>This fast dry nail coat is the best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>I really like this nail polish, I use it as a top coat and dries faster that most top coats ( aprox 2 mn to dry) love it!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull the polish back as it dries and that is amazing!</li>
            <li>Shortens significantly life of nail polish.</li>
            <li>I could never get nail polish to last more than a day until I discovered this top coat!</li>
            <li>I originally tried this product based solely on its description on another website.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this after the first use.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>and I was really excited to receive it.</li>
            <li>A small price to pay for an excellent topper though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the best way to describe it...</li>
            <li>My nail polish rarely chips now!</li>
            <li>My first trial run with this top coat was over three coats of OPI.</li>
            <li>pretty neat top coat -</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the way i felt when i first discovered Magic Erasers.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I ordered several more bottles for Christmas gifts and all my friends love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Totally worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>but luckily the product itself was fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a must, it will make the formula return to it&#x27;s original texture.</li>
            <li>I bought my first Seche top coat from my nail salon.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I bought this top coat after seeing it reviewed elsewhere.</li>
            <li>originally wrote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten more and more into doing my nails at home, and have tried a dozen different top coats.</li>
            <li>is that if you apply another coat over the original it peels sometimes.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is supposed to do, and much more.</li>
            <li>Was skeptical of the claims of others but this is the best top coat ever!</li>
            <li>So i was so excited for this product when i received it.  </li>
            <li>Even cheap, low quality polish can look amazing with this top coat.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Love it thanks!</li>
            <li>NO shiny nail polish in the world is worth that risk!</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>It adds a great shine and helps keep the polish on much longer than most other top coats that I have used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure if they ever stop making it I&#x27;ll die and then never do my nails again.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li>, my first time using SV top coat, I waited about 10 minutes before applying it.</li>
            <li>oh my goodness, it dries super quick!</li>
            <li>Worth taking time to research and find this online!</li>
            <li>/&gt;IT is great and also covers up any minor flaws that might have happened in the process.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the cost scare you away, it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I am so excited that I can use my polishes I have been collecting.</li>
            <li>Well I purchased Seche Vite top coat, and it really lived up to the hype!</li>
            <li>I am so excited.</li>
            <li>and I promise it will be worth it!</li>
            <li>and i got all excited.</li>
            <li>I heard of this top coat from many beauty bloggers and thought I would give it a try when I ran out of my last top coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be coming back for more, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li>A friend told me about this stuff, and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li>This puts such a nice shinny coat on my nails!</li>
            <li>I always believe in spending more money for higher quality beauty products.</li>
            <li>Scrubbing and cleaning my bathrooms, hanging a light fixture, painting, and working a full work week.</li>
            <li>This top coat dries super quick and its super shiny.</li>
            <li>I use another quick dry product afterwards but the quality and consistency of the Seche V is really perfect compared to my old top coat.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing Essie right now, and it looks perfect after a day and a half.  </li>
            <li>It was very easy to apply, not to thick, and it did not smudge my beautiful nail art.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to weight minutes for my nail polish to dry, this top coat dries fast and leaves a beautiful shine.</li>
            <li>Honestly I have not really seen a difference in my nail polish not chipping when I use this top coat vs other top coats, but I am committed to it because it&#x27;s so shiny!!!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different top coats and this one is hands down the BEST out there.</li>
            <li>Leaves my new nails nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>It also gives it a smooth shiny finish and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>a toothpick or something to clean any run off asap</li>
            <li>Like it takes it off so cleanly that I don&#x27;t need nail polish remover before repainting my nails.</li>
            <li>It dries fast, gives you a glossy finish that lasts for days, and really keeps my nails looking good.</li>
            <li>My favorite top coat by far.</li>
            <li>Put it on my nails and they are practically perfect, WEEKS later!&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic clear coat that does not yellow.</li>
            <li>It is really a great product and worth the price when applied correctly and properly maintained.  </li>
            <li>Makes your nail polish--even multiple layers--dry super quickly and gives a great shine.</li>
            <li>If you are willing to smell that for a short amount of time, you will reap the rewards of having a rock-hard, beautifully covered, and glistening manicure.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite dries fast enough to counteract my clumsiness, and it dries to a really incredible shine.  </li>
            <li>It dries to the touch in just a couple of minutes, and leaves my nails with a super smooth, glossy shine.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and dries quickly, as promised.</li>
            <li>but on the inside is different, and I have a feeling that this one might be some kind of ripoff, though I have no way to be sure.</li>
            <li>With this top coat i have noticed less smearing of the colors in my nail art, and it provides a nice smooth top of my nail as it seems to help level out any bumps from said nail art.</li>
            <li>Because the Goddess of Love wants you to have fabulous nails and a manicure that lasts for a week.</li>
            <li>And if you put two hours into the effort of doing your nails, you kind of want your end results to last more than Monday to Wednesday, if you&#x27;re lucky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and leaves a silky smooth finish over the nail.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my nail super shiny and smooth</li>
            <li>The only thing that kept me from giving this top coat a 5 star rating is the fact that no matter how much i try after 3 or so days the top coat seems to have shrunk on my nail, leaving the edges of my nail polish exposed without top coat while the rest of the nail still has top coat.</li>
            <li>It dries so quickly and leaves nails looking shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>course, most of these things occur only with acute exposure, so &#x27;they&#x27; say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I garden, go camping, shooting, cook clean and do dishes.</li>
            <li>I have more luck with using just a clear glitter polish as a top coat.</li>
            <li>Even after getting a professional manicure done I put this on top of it when I get home to make it look even better.</li>
            <li>It dries so, so quickly and leaves a smooth, even finish.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and dries so quickly  </li>
            <li>I do my own nails with regular nail polish and this top coat and my manicure lasts for up to two weeks before signs of chipping begin to show.</li>
            <li>I spent a lot of time researching good top coats &amp; came across Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>With Seche Vite, you still need to be careful with your nails for an hour or so, but with Poshé you&#x27;re good to go in like 10 minutes, 15 at the most.</li>
            <li>I wash dishes, clean house, do yard work,</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite top coat.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong solvent odor, but it&#x27;s worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The only downside to this is that it doesn&#x27;t smell so pleasant.</li>
            <li>My original order got lost in the mail, contacted the company and they sent another right away!</li>
            <li>this top coat is hands down AMAZING!</li>
            <li>There were so many positive comments about this product, I felt I just had to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>when college tuition is far more a priority!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this product so far!</li>
            <li>Within the first couple of weeks after I puchased it, I already had a few of my friends place their own orders because they couldn&#x27;t believe how great my nails looked.  </li>
            <li>Super fast delivery I have ever had!!!</li>
            <li>Super shiny, dries super quick,  and lasts!</li>
            <li>This stuff drys my polish so quickly and leaves such a nice shiny coat!  </li>
            <li>This top coat really DID dry super fast, I was impressed!</li>
            <li>The color I chose was a beautiful green color that resembled something you&#x27;d see on a tropical island, it was so shiny and strong.</li>
            <li>It dries the polish so quickly and with a beautiful shine minus the bubbles.</li>
            <li>So far, this is my favorite, fast drying top coat for most nail polishes.</li>
            <li>I really like this top coat - it does what it says it&#x27;ll do - it dries fast and leaves a shiny and smooth top coat.</li>
            <li>Love this product- fast dry and great shine.</li>
            <li>Great top coat dry really fast</li>
            <li>Dries out to fast, but other than that its a great buy!</li>
            <li>Great top coat, just gets super gloopy after a few months and you have to replace.</li>
            <li>It dries incredibly fast which is great for me because I&#x27;m not always the most patient person when it comes for waiting for nails to dry...</li>
            <li>&quot; top coat dry almost instantly after application, leave my nails with a glossy sheen, and best of all...</li>
            <li>just make sure not to inhale the fumes before the top coat is dry and do not ingest (that means no nail biting, or teeth picking, or anything of that nature with this top coat on)</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a great top coat that also helps dry your nails fast.</li>
            <li>This top coat dries super fast, and leaves my nails smooth and shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good quick dry top coat that is shiny and gives you the glassy look that Seche Vite does, I recommend Poshe Super Fast Drying Top Coat.</li>
            <li>the more the polish will come off in a large chunk.</li>
            <li>&quot; large name brand top coats.</li>
            <li>Its just right!</li>
            <li>She was right!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right!  </li>
            <li>She was right!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even gotten into bed right after and no sheet marks!  </li>
            <li>And they were absolutely right!</li>
            <li>My daughter-in-law told me about this product and she was right!  </li>
            <li>and I heard right!</li>
            <li>The gloss isn&#x27;t overbearing, and it isnt underwhelming, for me it is just right!</li>
            <li>, right!</li>
            <li>Some of the nail polish didn&#x27;t dry very nicely, looking matte instead of shiny.  </li>
            <li>This is a great quick dry.  </li>
            <li>but I wanted something to increase their shine after a few days and this product is doing a very good job.</li>
            <li>Though it smells very strongly it works with any polish and is now the only top coat I recommend.</li>
            <li>It makes my nails hard, shiny and close to flawless for the bulk of a week.</li>
            <li>I was super excited when I got it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this top coat if you enjoy nail art because it doesn&#x27;t smudge your designs.</li>
            <li>I really love the way my nail polish is dry immediately after the top coat with out using a gel polish!</li>
            <li>Makes a beautiful hard, shiny shell on top of your nail color, but can be brittle  and chips if you accidentally slam your fingernail on a surface.</li>
            <li>I do  a lot of typing at work and nail polish chips off easily, but it&#x27;ll usually last days longer with this top coat!</li>
            <li>Not only is it a terrific drier, it&#x27;s also a very good top coat.</li>
            <li>I tried a lot of dry fast top coat brands, and SECHE VITE is THE BEST by far!</li>
            <li>Arrived in great shape, when expected.</li>
            <li>so it works great for a quick dry and a glossy finish!</li>
            <li>Dries my nails pretty fast and leaves it with a nice shiny finish.</li>
            <li>First of all the price was really good which surprised me.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t check whether or not this polish was three free (no toluene, dibutyl phthalate, and formaldehyde) or not when i purchased it; i was simply going by the reviews of my peers, who said that this was their very favorite topcoat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But if you can get past that, it&#x27;s a really great top coat.</li>
            <li>Was a great price and came as expected.</li>
            <li>It looks nice at first, but then peels way too fast.</li>
            <li>I change my polish often so I can appreciate a fast drying top coat.</li>
            <li>Good stuff but can buy locally.</li>
            <li>i really like this top coat except that it smells horrible(but</li>
            <li>Love this fast nail coat.</li>
            <li>I really like this top coat</li>
            <li>Compared to Salley Hansen, Out The Door, and Essie, Seche Vite comes out on top if you really don&#x27;t want to wait.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really delighted and just bought a second bottle.</li>
            <li>Much stronger than any top coat I have used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This top coat dries really fast, in about 5-10 minutes</li>
            <li>it is really glossy and makes your nails look fabulous!</li>
            <li>Bottle is all the way full.</li>
            <li>I really would like to give this a better review.</li>
            <li>I work in healthcare full time</li>
            <li>and me I spend a lot of money on good products to ensure that I only have to do my nails either once</li>
            <li>I had never bought a fast drying top coat before.</li>
            <li>I almost get a full week, depending on the polish.</li>
            <li>I never had a top coat polish work as fast as this one .</li>
            <li>which is still a twice as fast (and 10 times as cheap!)</li>
            <li>I have absolutely zero complaints about this top coat.</li>
            <li>Although the shine wasn&#x27;t there, but I was satisfied with the fast drying attribute.</li>
            <li>but I really think it&#x27;s the top coat that&#x27;s keeping my polish</li>
            <li>I received this as a sample and was so amazed by the product that I immediately bought the full size.</li>
            <li>and now I do them all the time, thanks to this top coat.</li>
            <li>With this as the top coat it lasted for almost a whole week.  </li>
            <li>Love how it drys so fast.</li>
            <li>I love it so much, it is defenitly a must</li>
            <li>so you know for sure that it&#x27;s a real thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about it is that it dries sooo fast.  </li>
            <li>They look and feel better than the fast drying drops.</li>
            <li>My fave fast drying top coat... works immediately</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li>I do my nails, and I&#x27;m good to go 10 minutes later.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping :-)</li>
            <li>Overall the polish is good</li>
            <li>but I think Essie&#x27;s top coat is comparable and doesnt ssmell so much.</li>
            <li>Another really loved effect of this polish is that it creates a solid, almost gel-like topcoat.</li>
            <li>I heard of this top coat from a lot of nail art gurus and figured for the price it sounded reasonable.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love it, but too often it has peeled or chipped off my nails in just an hour.</li>
            <li>I love how fast it dries and leaves an acrylic nail finish and</li>
            <li>It keeps  your polish in place and looking quite good for a lasting amount of time.</li>
            <li>It dries polish almost instantly and adds a gorgeous shine.</li>
            <li>I was able to get a price match at a target store so thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also true that it does well about not chipping.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even been able to get my polish to stay on a whole day.</li>
            <li>It dries incredibly fast and most people assume my nails are gel names.</li>
            <li>fast drying top coat for nails.  </li>
            <li>Finally a top coat that looks like a gel mani and dries FAST.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Dries MUCH faster and with a thicker, more non chipping coat.</li>
            <li>Fast Top Nail Coat to apply rhinestones.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Revlon&#x27;s top coat, which is ok, but nothing compares to this, and at such a cheap price, why not buy this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes your nails so shiny :)  Drys SO fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so much about this top coat and decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Definitely a very glossy top coat.</li>
            <li>I work full time</li>
            <li>It is a nail art fanatic&#x27;s best friend!</li>
            <li>It comes off the brush looking thick, but it glides onto the nail perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I guess that happens because the top coat bonds so much to the polish?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through many polish bottles and fast drying products.</li>
            <li>try NYC fast drying top coat from Walmart.</li>
            <li>I really like this top coat.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s fast drying ability is outstanding, I can&#x27;t get over  the shrinkage effect.</li>
            <li>I really like the top coat.</li>
            <li>I use Essie brand nail polish exclusively and it works really well with the Seche top coat.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>A wise woman once said, &amp;#34;A woman is only helpless while she waits for her nail polish to dry.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, between you and me, I don&#x27;t like to be helpless...</li>
            <li>As far as top coats go on a regular manicure this is great.  </li>
            <li>Like my title suggests, I love how fast it dries my nail polish.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.</li>
            <li>and it dries really fast love</li>
            <li>It is fair enough.</li>
            <li>Dries fast, smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li>Good for someone like me who always tends to do my nails last minute</li>
            <li>I use this one in a pinch, and Dior fast drying topcoat when I have more time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in the name and it&#x27;s definitely true.</li>
            <li>Great for a manicure that needs to dry super quick,  however your nails chip within 3-4 days.</li>
            <li>I really really wanted to love this</li>
            <li>Now with this fast drying top nail coat, I never have to do that again.</li>
            <li>Unbeleivable price for such good quality.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite topcoat.</li>
            <li>This top coat is shiny and dries fast, BUT...</li>
            <li>I like this top coat because it dries fast.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this top coat is how fast it dries and therefore dries my whole manicure.  </li>
            <li>It dries so fast and makes any polish look better.</li>
            <li>An overall good purchase.</li>
            <li>I really like this top coat.</li>
            <li>The morning after applying this admittedly fast drying top coat, I watched bits of my nail polish start chipping off while just sitting in a meeting.  </li>
            <li>I really like this top coat.</li>
            <li>I used to always use China Glaze&#x27;s Fast Forward top coat.  </li>
            <li>I love how fast and shiny, but  </li>
            <li>It is a fast drying top coat.</li>
            <li>I cannot the smell but overall good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all true.  </li>
            <li>I really like this top coat.  </li>
            <li>The reason being that it is such a good coating that no oxygen gets through AT ALL (either that or</li>
            <li>with washing dishes by hand &amp; giving kids baths, my opi &amp; this top coat lasted 1.5 weeks before I had to really repaint.</li>
            <li>Love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This was not at all true for me.  </li>
            <li>It is truely a miracle in a bottle.  </li>
            <li>Roll Call, A True Prison Story of Corruption and Redemption</li>
            <li>Sure, it dries fast, but it makes my manicure chip within one or two days.</li>
            <li>I can get a good full 7 days with no chips, only tip wear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t repurchase, but not a bad product.</li>
            <li>True that it doesn&#x27;t smudge the design, but what good is it if the polish comes off the next day and the design is ruined.</li>
            <li>the smell that some describe was not bad at all</li>
            <li>Really does dry very fast - great product!</li>
            <li>Love how quickly my nails dry with this top coat!</li>
            <li>Loving it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks &#x3D;) easy to use and strong fast dry!</li>
            <li>As someone who takes the time to sit down and do beautiful nails (stamps, art, jewels, tape)</li>
            <li>In my opinion it works best with a glitter colors, since glitters, for me, are super hard to remove anyway.</li>
            <li>, it dries very fast, hardens over the nail polish leaving it feeling strong and un-chipable.</li>
            <li>The most amazing fast dry top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This is the best top coat in the game right now</li>
            <li>I would recommend this top coat to anyone who loves doing their own nails and hates waiting around for them to dry.</li>
            <li>The top coat dries FAST and gives your nails a super glossy shine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many topcoats and this one is worthy of its high ratings!</li>
            <li>As much as I can appreciate a topcoat that dries as quickly and glossy as Seche, I would rather wait a bit longer or even use two coats of a formula that works better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As much as I can appreciate a topcoat that dries as quickly and glossy as Seche, I would rather wait a bit longer or even use two coats of a formula that works better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super fast drying top coat.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve gone through about a dozen top coats, all promising amazing shine, quick dry, no chip, blah blah, and never have any of them lasted me more than a couple days.</li>
            <li>As others have said - this top coat dries SUPER fast (within a minute or 2)</li>
            <li>They looked as fabulous as they did right after I painted them.</li>
            <li>Great top coat, makes nails look professionally done, even if you&#x27;ve messed up the color a little, this nail polish will smooth out the look!</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE how quickly this dries, but other than that</li>
            <li>If you want something that goes on easily, dries quickly and finishes off your manicure with a nice shine, look no further!</li>
            <li>and it is true, it sets and dries quickly</li>
            <li>My polish dries super, super fast, if I use this top coat over it.  </li>
            <li>Has made my manicures so much better - thanks mainly to the fact this top coat dries before I have a chance to wreck what I have painted.  </li>
            <li>It does dry quickly, as promised, and leaves the polish smooth and gorgeous for days.</li>
            <li>but it does have a pretty strong smell..</li>
            <li>This by far is the best quick dry I have ever tried</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried every kind of quick dry top coat in the market and nothing seems to work quite like sech</li>
            <li>Helps speed up dry time and leaves a nice shine!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong</li>
            <li>It dries my nails super fast and is super smooth!</li>
            <li>It really dries so fast it is like magic!  </li>
            <li>This top coat dries super fast and is super shiny.</li>
            <li>I feel very comfortable doing whatever after only 2 or 3 minutes with this top coat.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think the high end stuff was good enough to spend $15 more a bottle.</li>
            <li>It never seemed to prevent my polish from chipping; actually, whatever top coat the Vietnamese ladies use at my cheap neighborhood nail salon is far superior in terms of chipping.</li>
            <li>Love love love and will absolutely order again when I&#x27;m getting low.</li>
            <li>The product is good, but the price is a little more than I what I wanted to pay for it.</li>
            <li>I love how fast it dries and it is really shiny!!</li>
            <li>The overwhelming amount of positive reviews led me to Seche Vite&#x27;s Dry Fast Top Nail Coat, and I&#x27;m pleased to say this product lived up to its many praises.</li>
            <li>I had very high hopes for this though, even being exceptionally cautious and thorough, but it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat dries super fast to a beautiful shine in a minute.  </li>
            <li>I went from perfect, shiny, colorful nails to dull, chipped nails.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this polish, has amazing shine and dries super fast!</li>
            <li>Really shiny and nice, dries super fast</li>

            <li>Adds a lot of shine to your manicure and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Its also super shiny and brings whatever mani-pedi</li>
            <li>glossy, dries quick, inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>But I will keep using it since it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I even tried using another top coat on top of this one, and had same results.</li>
            <li>It dries so quickly.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly, and my nails have yet to chip (longest I&#x27;ve went</li>
            <li>dries nail polish super quick, I&#x27;m never without it.</li>
            <li>Since I touch up between fills, this dries it quickly</li>
            <li>This top coat was recommended to me by friends who had tried multiple top coats.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to go through multiple top coats to find this.</li>
            <li>Super product.  </li>
            <li>but luckily I didn&#x27;t throw it out.  </li>

            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t bother me because it fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>It dries amazingly quick.</li>
            <li>Great thick top coat.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it will not prevent your nails from chipping, so after you apply this top coat, i would recommend using a chip-proof top coat over it.</li>
            <li>quick</li>
            <li>I have bought many top coats from various manufacturers over the years.</li>
            <li>quick drying</li>
            <li>I was super dissapointed with this product.  </li>
            <li>It makes the nails look super shiny while protecting them.</li>
            <li>Dries super</li>
            <li>I was amazed by how quickly it chipped.</li>
            <li>You could spend 10 minutes on your perfect mani and ruin it the second you stick your hands in the washer to get out your laundry or the second you pick up your kiddo.</li>
            <li>Protects well and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Gives your polish that hi-gloss &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look because of how quickly it sets  </li>
            <li>I think it dries way too quickly for any bubbles to pop.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying it loyally for 10 years now.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t chip, which is great, but when it wants to come off, it comes off all at once in a giant sheet.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quick,</li>
            <li>The biggest thing I like about this topcoat is that it dries extremely fast, safely sealing in your fresh polish.</li>

            <li>so convenient, dries nail polish quick.</li>
            <li>It dries extremely quick allowing me to get on with the functions of my day.  </li>
            <li>I like how it gives your nail a super shine</li>
            <li>I am always skeptical but this product is the best top coat I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this top coat &amp; would never use a different one.</li>
            <li>It also helps tremendously w keeping nail polish on.</li>
            <li>quick drying.  </li>
            <li>I received this product and was super pumped.</li>
            <li>toxic and pregnant women should keep away from it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve try lots of top coats, from the basic of BEAUTY SECRETS to SALLY HANSEN, and many others.</li>
            <li>Dries polish quickly and helps color stay on.</li>
            <li>Hardens quickly and glossy.</li>
            <li>It dries pretty quickly!</li>
            <li>It got here in 3 days it dries quick amd makes my nails look</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been buying this top coat for several years now and I am in love.</li>
            <li>Dries exceptionally quick.  </li>
            <li>Drys nails quickly and adds unparalleled shine.</li>
            <li>is it does not leave nails super shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for better no chip top coat from my current Sally Hansen Mega Shine.</li>
            <li>If you are in hurry and need a quick nail spruce up, Seche Vite is the way to go.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this product many times and it is the only top coat I have used in years.</li>
            <li>im good for a few more days too</li>
            <li>I finally added this to my cart to get free shipping, and it is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Quick drying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many different top coats</li>
            <li>I would get about 2-4 days of wear, if I was lucky.</li>
            <li>It seems thick going on but dries flawlessly smooth and brilliantly shiny.</li>
            <li>While it dries quickly, it leaves some &amp;#34;bubbly&amp;#34; patches on my nails, which are rather unsightly.</li>
            <li>and it dries fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>but it dries quickly</li>
            <li>Makes nails super glossy and dries the polish faster.  </li>
            <li>this is my favorite top coat that I will definitely repurchase time and time again.</li>
            <li>Then, on top of that this morning, I stamped a design on top of the Seche Vite with White On by Sally Hansen then put on another coat of the Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different top coats.</li>
            <li>plus it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a \\&quot;quick dry\\</li>
            <li>Seche Vite dries extremely quickly, and SO shiny</li>
            <li>Not as quick as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li>Quick fix maybe...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use my Jordana Quick</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that this dries out rather quickly</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, as advertised, and after 4 days wear, it&#x27;s still just as shiny as when I applied it.</li>
            <li>Dries out too quick.</li>
            <li>Simply put, I love this top coat.</li>
            <li>AND it&#x27;s super shiny</li>
            <li>Super shiny and prevents chipping, would buy again and again.</li>
            <li>And it also leaves a super glossy touch to it.</li>
            <li>Nothing has been as good as the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Nail Coat.</li>
            <li>Drys quickly and seems to last better than many others.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly</li>
            <li>Dries quick, but &#x27;causes a lot of shrinkage and cracking of the polish, and didn&#x27;t wear any longer on my nails.</li>
            <li>This stuff dries so quickly</li>
            <li>And watching my fresh, bright red nail polish fall off in bits all over the table.</li>
            <li>Dries super quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries so quickly.</li>
            <li>It smooths out any unevenness and dries super glossy and almost makes it look like you&#x27;ve used a gel.</li>
            <li>I have used many different top coats.  </li>
            <li>It looks beautiful, lasts long, it&#x27;s super glossy and dries fast.</li>
            <li>Super shiny and elongates the life of any nail polish regardless the brand.</li>
            <li>Gotta use this quickly.</li>
            <li>it evaporates quickly.</li>
            <li>However, I do make sure to seal the tips of my nails to make the manicure last longer. :)</li>
            <li>You can basically glob it on and it still dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t cause any discolorations.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Dries quick with a almost gel like finish.</li>
            <li>dries quick.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different top coats and this one ROCKS.</li>
            <li>For me it doesn&#x27;t increase the length of my manicure but it dries quickly</li>
            <li>It dries so quickly, and dries the layers underneath.</li>
            <li>It dries super quick although the smell is pungent, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and well packed.  </li>
            <li>Super glossy.</li>
            <li>It is super shiny doesn&#x27;t smudge designs or stamping nail art.</li>
            <li>Best top coat ever, dries very hard and fast.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as a top coat for your nails.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended :)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend trying this top coat polish.</li>
            <li>I would DEFINITELY recommend doing business w/ Pro Concepts because my item was shipped fast, arrived quickly, and packaged very nicely so that the contents remained in tact and w/out damage.  </li>
            <li>For best results, apply Seche Vite in normal brush strokes and then seal it in by horizontally running the brush along the edge and slightly underneath the nail.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great - it does what it says it does, which is dry your nails FAST!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Super hard, so far the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used</li>

            <li>No other top coat I&#x27;ve tried dries as quickly!</li>
            <li>Super shiny and super fast dying!!...</li>
            <li>If you enjoy painting your nails you really need this in your arsenal!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that after 5 minutes of applying the product you should be able to resume normal activity.  </li>
            <li>Love this topcoat and will never use any other kind or seller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of other sprays, drops, and polishes that claim to be quick-drying, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It isn&#x27;t instantaneous, but faster than normal top coat.</li>
            <li>Overall very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love using this because it helps to dry my polish VERY quickly!</li>
            <li>I use it on top of my color polish, and my polish lasts longer then it normally would.</li>
            <li>-dries very fast, it is &amp;#34;seche vite&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>Just like the title, it dries VERY fast!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product overall.  </li>
            <li>I decided to buy this product for my own, and give my nails a refresher coat  of top coat at day 4 or 5, and now my manicure can last a whole two weeks.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Dries very fast!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty</li>
            <li>It is very very shiny but sometimes chips!</li>
            <li>That speaks for itself, if this product has been around that long, it must be good.</li>
            <li>it also adds a beautiful shine.s, and your nails become messy.</li>
            <li>I tried over a dozen different top coats to seal and smoothly coat my favorite large glitter nail polish ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Thanks to this, my nail polish lasts longer:) it&#x27;s just pure perfection!</li>
            <li>It dries super fast and that is awesome for me because I have very little patience.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and convenient until halfway down.</li>
            <li>Hands down best quick dry top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It is so nice and shiny and helps polish dry very quickly.</li>
            <li>It looks nice, goes on easily, and my nails are dry in minutes instead of hours.</li>
            <li>Drys super quick and gives you that fresh mani look</li>
            <li>However, it tends to peel off easily since it dries so quickly and hardens so fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually going to buy more while the price is right :)</li>
            <li>This top coat does its job as an accelerator, but not nearly as well as Sally Hansen&#x27;s quick drying top coat.</li>
            <li>For the most part it keeps my nails super shiny and it drys pretty fast for a polish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;TL;DR: very good polish, not very good for you.</li>
            <li>I ALWAYS got air bubbles in my nail polish after putting on the top coat so a fast drying polish was needed very much.</li>
            <li>Price is good and it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>This is my new HG top coat.</li>
            <li>My new favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite</li>
            <li>and I got their new Oxygen top coat</li>
            <li>So with a swipe of this after giving my fingers a new look they are safe from bumps and smudges after about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Love it and will buy new one when done</li>
            <li>My new FAV top coat.</li>

            <li>Dries very quick and ready to go in 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Much better than essie quick dry top coat.</li>
            <li>Also, the way the brush is made makes it&#x27;s easy to get too much product on</li>
            <li>This product allows me to do my nails more often, because it makes the whole process FAST!</li>
            <li>The best part about this top coat is that it dries in a way that makes it hard and doesn&#x27;t deny as easily as other top coats.</li>
            <li>Makes painting my nails fast and easy.</li>
            <li>Not only does it dry quickly but it smooths over any polish imperfections and leaves nails looking salon glossy and perfect!</li>

            <li>It applies easily, though since I&#x27;ve just gotten it today, I can&#x27;t really say how it holds up over time.</li>
            <li>Paints on easy, dries fast, but shrinks as it dries.</li>
            <li>My favorite quick dry top coat on the market.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tip: Try not to keep the top off the bottle for too long or even just place a finger over the bottle opening while the top is off.</li>
            <li>I have to put a glop of this on my nail pretty much to make sure it&#x27;ll spread without streaks.</li>
            <li>Overall, pretty good, just not life-changing.</li>
            <li>It dries fast, minimizes bubbles, and creates a strong, shiny finish.</li>
            <li>Make sure to buy the &amp;#34;restore&amp;#34; as well because it gets goopy pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I love how I can layer on colors and have them dry quickly with this top coat.</li>
            <li>Fast drying and easy to apply, two coats and one every day for three days</li>
            <li>but they never last more than a day or so without becoming chipped or something.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making it so easy to get.</li>
            <li>I used to have to reserve a good chunk of time out of my weekend just to paint my nails - not because the painting takes time, but because I have to sit idiotically still for hours waiting for the polish to dry, layer by layer.  </li>
            <li>Love this quick dry top coat.</li>
            <li>and it really is the fastest drying top coat, resulting in a fabulous high gloss shine.</li>
            <li>LOVE Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat!</li>
            <li>But this dry fast top coat dries my nail paint quickly and gives it a nice shine.</li>
            <li>amazing, Dry&#x27;s very fast and smells like the nail salon.!!</li>
            <li>The process took me so long, and it ended up getting messed up more often than not, so it just didn&#x27;t seem worth it most of the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it dries the polish under it and helps my manicure last longer and looks better!</li>
            <li>As if nail polish didn&#x27;t start to peel and chip soon enough, this top coat makes it peel even sooner!  </li>
            <li>this wil be the only top coat i use!</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t chip for days and it keeps my nails VERY shiny!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more when this one runs out!</li>
            <li>you get this polish if you are an avid nail painter!</li>
            <li>My nails usually last for about 2 weeks by using this top coat!</li>
            <li>This topcoat really works!!  </li>
            <li>They are absolutely glass-like!!</li>
            <li>When I received it, packaging read, Will NOT Thin polish! !</li>
            <li>This stuff is the absolute BOMB!!</li>
            <li>My nails last over a week with no chipping when I use this top coat!</li>
            <li>Definitely replacing my opi top coat!</li>
            <li>of my favorite buys so far!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I did not realize how much I needed it!!</li>
            <li>Just got my first bottle today and was so excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to return it, as I have a little one around, and would love to have more!</li>
            <li>Really works !!</li>
            <li>Worth the price to save a new manicure from the disaster that is sheets touching your at night nails and ruining your manicure.</li>
            <li>This top coat is just as fabulous as countless other blogs and reviews have stated, maybe even more!!  </li>
            <li>It leaves a smooth, super shiny salon finish and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li>I bought some OPI Top Coat and Drip Dry to go with it, but I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Dries super fast and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>And it is almost half the price on Amazon as it is in the store, so i am more than thrilled.  </li>
            <li>Evens out every one of your nail art boo boos and dries super fast to a smooth shiny finish.</li>
            <li>Dries nails quickly and leaves a professional looking glossy top coat</li>
            <li>Dont waste your money on the super pricey ones when this is so great</li>
            <li>Seche Vite dries super fast, with a smooth glassy finish.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a strong odor because it does contain toluene, so make sure you aren’t using these in a tiny, enclosed space.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to push your cuticles back before applying it, because it can peel easily if it dries against cuticles or skin.</li>
            <li>It took about 15 minutes for the top coat to dry and harden (I still tried to keep my hands free for another 15-30 minutes just in case, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like I NEED to!).</li>
            <li>Dries quickly, nails still look great after a few days.  </li>
            <li>I got the Seche Vite top coat so quickly after I ordered it that I was surprised I even had a package.  </li>
            <li>It dries fast and is super shiney!</li>
            <li>Dries fast and with a nice professional shine!  </li>
            <li>Incredibly fast drying and super shiny -- nails always look like I&#x27;ve had a salon manicure when I use this topcoat!</li>
            <li>This top coat works great in the sense that it is dry within minutes (literally just like 5 minutes) where you can go back to work, handle things with your hands and not have to worry about your polish getting ruined.</li>
            <li>I would say a good way to look at this is fast drying but NOT long wear.</li>
            <li>They love it as much as I. It dries super fast and the smell does go away.</li>
            <li>Good top coat, but you have to use it fast, or the whole bottle will dry out soon.</li>
            <li>found it to be okay , it doesn&#x27;t shine like I would like but it does dry my nails fast and that is most important to me</li>
            <li>Nope, all this great little product.  </li>
            <li>maybe a good quality top coat, but not long lasting effect.</li>
            <li>Most of the top coats I&#x27;ve tried take forever to dry and then chip in 2-3 days, but not this one!</li>
            <li>/&gt;EDIT: Ok I gave this another shot some time later and it seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li>excellent extra dry and protect!</li>
            <li>It is super shiny and it dries super fast!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a top coat nail polish that is super high gloss and super fast drying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of quick dry top coats and this is the best hands down!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seche Vite leaves a beautiful, mirror-like gloss on top of your nails, which is absolutely fabulous, and it DOES dry your nails within 5 minutes or less.</li>
            <li>It leaves a high gloss shine finish on your manicure and dries super quick !</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of strong though, and there are warning labels due to chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>Sure, it dries quickly, but so did my other top coat.  </li>
            <li>It also has a nice high gloss that does not dull.</li>
            <li>It does what it says, dries fast, makes nails shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>Looks amazing on acrylics, and though I haven&#x27;t used it on regular polish yet</li>
            <li>Fast drying cheap</li>
            <li>I know a few people arent happy with the fact that it shrinks your polish at the tips</li>
            <li>Dries fast and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I have repurchased multiple times and its amazing, i dont use anything else anymore for my nails</li>
            <li>It dries really fast and stays chip free for days.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really shiny, smooth gloss</li>
            <li>This dries literally in seconds, and is great when you&#x27;re in a hurry or just impatient.</li>
            <li>The shipping came a week earlier than it said it would which was amazing.</li>
            <li>It makes your nails shiny and smooth and it dries relatively fast.</li>
            <li>Dries fast and gives your nails a smooth glossy finish.</li>
            <li>Not only that, but the shine is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so amazing, it takes the current nail color I have on, and makes it so shiny and well protected.</li>
            <li>Dries fast &amp; so smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>This is a good top coat if you are looking for a good protective shine, but it smells really bad.....</li>
            <li>but if you are smooth it will really do wonders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, the shine is gorgeous and the drying time is fantastic especially when you are painting your nails while your 15 month old takes a nap.</li>
            <li>This will give you a really solid, glossy look with amazing speed.</li>
            <li>It gives me and amazing gloss, but doesnt last on nails</li>
            <li>Dried fast, went on smoothly and looked great.</li>
            <li>I recently discovered this product and it is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>Works great, but it fed sticky after few weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks already and it works really great.</li>
            <li>This is for real a fast drying topcoat.</li>
            <li>Having a huge gap at the tips of my nails was a very unattractive look.</li>
            <li>but I hadn&#x27;t run out of my old top coat (Essie)</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t think this top coat really does much for maintaining my manicure.</li>
            <li>I end up having to redo my nails more frequently than before.</li>
            <li>I bought it after I read about it on a nail blog, and it is so worth every penny</li>
            <li>it is actually fairly useful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard a lot of great things about this clear coat from lots of different people</li>
            <li>This topcoat is the only reason I can do my own manicures.</li>
            <li>As a top coat it performs as well as any top coat I&#x27;ve ever used: keeps my nail color perfect for at least a few days before any chipping or wearing.</li>
            <li>I love this clear nail polish.</li>
            <li>People are always asking me if I&#x27;ve had a fresh manicure and complimenting my nails.</li>
            <li>In drug stores this runs about $9.99 and it would be worth every penny, but...  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying.  </li>
            <li>has become FUN</li>
            <li>People always tell me my nails look professionally done when I use this top coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m typing this with freshly painted nails...</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>This nail polish top coat works even better than expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not visible from afar, and you&#x27;d really have to be looking very close to be able to see the shrinkage.</li>
            <li>When it looks wet three weeks from application, then you got a wicked product that earns every good will.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like to do my own french manicures, and would be lost without this.  </li>
            <li>This makes the polish last much longer and keeps the shiny finish much better than most top-coats I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Almost worth it.</li>
            <li>I can actually do my nails on my own now without messing it up after 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>For the price this is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I will never waste my time with another top coat.</li>
            <li>and use only this when I want nice shiny glasslike nails.</li>
            <li>Will take advice on keeping a fresh bottle on hand.</li>
            <li>Professional grade top coat.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to follow directions, it is meant to be put on top of wet polish.</li>
            <li>Expected much more from this, but it was ok...</li>
            <li>I would also recommend Seche Restore - great for bringing old polishes back to life.</li>
            <li>and I know it&#x27;s because of this top coat and makes my nails looked like they were professionally done at the salon.  </li>
            <li>A much better clear coat is Duri&#x27;s Rejuvinate Coat</li>
            <li>I would just put any clear coat on top of my manicure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not for nothing that this top coat is always marked as &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; everywhere you look.</li>
            <li>No beauty product is worth risking a life.</li>
            <li>I recently began doing my own nails since going to the salon is no longer in my budget.  </li>
            <li>If you do your own nails, this is the only way to go.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the results.</li>
            <li>Clear polish outstanding?  </li>
            <li>Worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the product and was glad that it wasn&#x27;t false advertising.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried seche vite, I think it&#x27;s a pretty good product overall.</li>
            <li>If you have never tried a fast drying top coat, be ready to be amazed.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the 5 bucks.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare I get a chip ort</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was on time and packaged good, nail polish just wasn&#x27;t what I expected though.</li>
            <li>a couple hours after painting them and its not like I am re-grouting my bathroom to get chips like that on a fresh manicure</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>worth it.</li>
            <li>Within seconds, your nails are okay to touch lightly and within an hour they&#x27;re solid.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Good topcoat and definitely lives up to its claim of fast drying.</li>
            <li>I spend a lot of time doing a nice french manicure on myself.  </li>
            <li>I even use it to re-top coat a professional pedi just to be sure it lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely worth it..  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>- very shiny - cruelty-free - good price  CONS: - peeled off same day.</li>
            <li>As the day wore on, two more nails had the polish completely peel off and one peeled off halfway.  </li>
            <li>the kind that goes around with blanket smudges on every last nail.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t observed any polish shrinkage so far with the top coat.</li>
            <li>and it restores all your old polishes and your seche vite top coat</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll take any advice on this, but it isn&#x27;t worth knocking any stars.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find that it was available on Amazon (for about the same as what I&#x27;d pay in the store).</li>
            <li>Nice, solid top-coat.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is old school drying top coat.</li>
            <li>This is by far my HG top coat.</li>
            <li>&gt; Not only does this topcoat make my polish last days longer, it also makes my nails incredibly shiny, and it is helping them to grow stronger and</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a reason every nail salon worth</li>
            <li>So maybe save your polish and go with a different top coat when you&#x27;re wearing a cheap nail polish underneath it.</li>
            <li>After about five minutes, I can do anything with my fresh manicure.  </li>
            <li>This top coat really really worked and is FAST.  </li>
            <li>So far after a few months of useage, this is by far the best top coat I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>then the product is worth.</li>
            <li>You should place a coating when you get your fresh mani and pedi</li>
            <li>That con is worth it to me.</li>
            <li>It makes my home painted nails look better than a professional manacure.  </li>
            <li>Splurge because it&#x27;s truly worth it.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s just for myself or my 3 &amp; 5 year old, it&#x27;s a bit pricey for a top coat.</li>
            <li>i love the shine it gives my nails -- just like a professional manicure.</li>
            <li>this top coat goes on smoothly, dries almost instantly, and prevents chips.  </li>
            <li>Together, using both, my manicures at home last 5 days and look really nice.</li>
            <li>It works, so just decide how sensitive you are to chemical smells :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit \\&quot;pricy\\&quot; and a 100% WORTH</li>
            <li>The restorer is well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does have a powerful odor</li>
            <li>Even replacing this more frequently bc of it</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s really glossy and dries incredibly fast.  </li>
            <li>It makes your nails look shiny and freshly polished.</li>
            <li>Maybe the product itself was a fake, I really don&#x27;t know, why so many people think it is so great!</li>
            <li>Seriously, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just worth it</li>
            <li>, I have  used this product for awhile on others and on rare occasion myself.</li>
            <li>far as the one rev... Read more</li>
            <li>To me its worth the risk of whatever harmful ingredient is in it.</li>
            <li>; however, it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li>The smell of this is very strong and quite gross, but it does disappear quickly.</li>
            <li>I will never again use another quick dry top coat again!</li>
            <li>When I first got this, I was very happy and surprised how fast it would dry no matter</li>
            <li>It dries very fast and I super shiny.</li>
            <li>Not only is it quick drying, but it leaves such a beautiful finish on your nails.</li>
            <li>Although, if you want a top coat, with fast drying step, plus a super shiny coat (especially when you wear jewel tones or bright reds), for a color pop, try PRO FX QUICK DRY HIGH GLOSS TOP COAT.</li>
            <li>IT DRIES so fast and its so very shiny!!!</li>
            <li>Say goodbye to sheet creases, which is amazing if you are like me and find that the only time you ever have to paint your nails is right before you go to bed.</li>
            <li>I love that this really helps my nails dry super fast and leaves a really nice glossy finish.</li>
            <li>First of all, it&#x27;s great that you can get it on Amazon for half the price in stores.   </li>
            <li>every polish takes way to long to dry but this polish works wonderful!</li>
            <li>that it &#x27;gloops&#x27; up pretty quickly (but you can always buy Seche Restore to fix that, which is worth it in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that if I use and older bottle of Seche Top coat that I&#x27;ll be more prone to cracking of the top coat, but that&#x27;s only if I happen to pick up a bottle that is over a year old.</li>
            <li>So if your husband/boyfriend/significant other is into fly fishing, hide it or your wont get it back!!! :-)</li>
            <li>It does take a lot more time to chip than other top coats.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how it got to be so popular, other than the fact that it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Seche Vite for almost a year now, it is the only top coat that will keep my nails looking fresh and glossy without chipping for days, and with all the abuse I put them through that says a lot!</li>
            <li>I have looked up and tried many top coats based on other reviews</li>
            <li>The fact that it has lasted better than all of the other top coats that I have invested in already has prompted me to give it five stars.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong but it leaves such a great shine and a nice thick protective coat!</li>
            <li>A couple chips I had touched up with a complementary color, creating an ombre effect, and adding this top coat let the color edges soften into each other even better.  </li>
            <li>I like it, but think many other brands work as well and protect my polish against chipping better.</li>

            <li>Drys my nails super fast!</li>
            <li>Was shipped super fast; arrived a couple days before the estimated arrival date!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve noticed that even salon brands chip pretty quickly on me.</li>
            <li>Not to mention it dries super fast!</li>
            <li>And I am generally pretty quick when painting my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dries super fast!</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s a lot of dishes and laundry!), but it chipped pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>, it chips off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The polish dries super fast!</li>
            <li>but oh boy does it peel off super fast as well!</li>
            <li>Dries super fast and keeps your polish shiny and glossy for DAYS!</li>
            <li>but when I recieved this top coat I started loving doing my nails because it last a long time and chip free for 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used pretty much every drug store top coat, and many nicer ones, and I always come back to Seche.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, drys quickly and keeps your polish looking new for twice or triple the time.</li>
            <li>For the frequent flyer I am this is the miracle that makes my mani/pedi look great in 5mn flat!</li>
            <li>The quick dry is a nice feature.&lt;br</li>

            <li>They seem to get dry and peel more easily when I use this regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone wanting a quick, strong, shiny (wouldn&#x27;t work for a matte finish manicure), affordable and professional looking at home mani/pedi.</li>
            <li>Only con - is the strong smell, but what nail polish doesn&#x27;t smell strong??</li>
            <li>While this is unnoticable on dark colours, it can really detract from a light or bright colour.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the most part it&#x27;s a good product but the tips don&#x27;t last as long</li>
            <li>, friendly tip: try not to get any on your skin or breathe too much of the stench.</li>
            <li>Now I always have neatly polished nails (which is a requirement for me or I&#x27;ll bite them right off).</li>
            <li>I noticed immediately that the box didn&#x27;t look as right.</li>
            <li>The pros are right.</li>
            <li>Stop right here and buy this.</li>
            <li>So instead of the nail polish chipping, it just peels right off...</li>
            <li>But u get my point right?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done my nails right before bed and never had any problems with sheet nails.</li>
            <li>I can finish my nails, then leave right away for work.</li>
            <li>Whatever those chemists did, they did it right.  </li>
            <li>tried this on right when I got it.</li>
            <li>Tried it right away</li>
            <li>It does tend to get gloopy, and the Seche Restore will fix it right up.  </li>
            <li>I used a Sinful Colors under Seche Vite once and it chipped right away.</li>
            <li>I would go washing dishes right away</li>
            <li>It makes the polish peel right off.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t used to have the patience to do my nails because I smooshed them right away...</li>
            <li>Shipping was speedy and the price was just right.</li>
            <li>As of right now, 42 out of 61 reviews give this product 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>I recieved my item right on time</li>
            <li>Revolutionary, right?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on day 5 right now</li>
            <li>Polish still peels right off, i guess my nails are damaged.</li>
            <li>Perks your nail polish right off.</li>
            <li>How much can I trust review here is becoming really a question to me.    </li>
            <li>If you want an amazing top coat, search no more.</li>
            <li>I know that may not be long for most people, but it is huge for me.  </li>
            <li>This is the first bottle I&#x27;ve used, but so far it is my HG of top coats.</li>
            <li>This is the first bottle I&#x27;ve used, but so far it is my HG of top coats.</li>
            <li>I get more than a day from my Sally Hansen top coat, it just doesn&#x27;t dry as fast.</li>
            <li>After my first use I immediately threw out my out the door top coat, this stuff makes even the cheapest nail polishes look professional grade</li>
            <li>This stuff is my favorite fast dry nail top coat - it works so well.  </li>
            <li>I love Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Nail Coat.</li>
            <li>I love this fast dry top coat.</li>
            <li>BUT before receiving it, I noticed my favorite salon that gives me bionic manis that last 1 full week are using THIS topcoat.</li>
            <li>The only reason this product gets two stars instead of one is because it left a beautiful shine to my nail with no nicks/scratches underneath the polish.</li>
            <li>Personally, I think that when I purchase a product that I should be able to get full use of it without the requirement of purchasing an additional product.  </li>
            <li>Performed much better for me than my much pricier OPI rapid dry top coat.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work for a simple color mani, but it works beautifully for all types of nail art.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that I can ever do with out this Vite Dry Top Nail Coat, I love it and it dries your nail polish really fast</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not one of those products where before you can get a full layer of top coat on, it&#x27;s clumpy and you have to redo your entire nail)</li>
            <li>Makes your nails soo shiny and they dry so much more quickly!</li>
            <li>I love how quickly it dries, but when you have to redo a nail every day, it kind of loses the value.</li>
            <li>It truly is fast drying and it lasts a good long while and takes a beating.</li>
            <li>The only downside I could see is that it has a very strong chemical odor.</li>
            <li>ONly thing is the containers break VERY easily.</li>
            <li>this top coat is like no other.</li>
            <li>No other top coats will do now that I have had seche vite.</li>
            <li>No other top coat gives you the shiny finish as Seche Vite.  </li>
            <li>I like it, but not sure if I would re-purchase again, since there are so many other great top-coats out there!</li>
            <li>There is no other top coat to buy.  </li>
            <li>I applied the this top coat and it dried very quickly!</li>
            <li>Just be sure to keep a fresh bottle on hand and close it tightly, and this should help extend the life of your top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product came way earlier than expected &amp; this is definitely the best top coat i&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on top of the cheapest to the most expensive nail polish brands and the effect is the same - simply brilliant.</li>
            <li>It makes your nails really hard, gives a beautiful shine, and speeds up drying time-</li>
            <li>Not only does it dry quickly, the end result is a beautiful shiny finish.</li>
            <li>There is no doubt that this product is fast drying, in fact it has encouraged me to paint my nails more often now that I don&#x27;t have to wait 20-30mins for my top coat to dry before I can do anything but lay there with my arms in the air!</li>
            <li>(my nails are probably dry before that, but I like to play it safe!)</li>
            <li>it gets dry slower, but this is magical stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than ready for a new color anyway.</li>
            <li>It dries super fast, leaving a nice and professional high gloss finish.</li>
            <li>I always use an ORLY Color Blast glitter polish on the top half of my nails before applying Seche Vite top coat.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed chipping any more than with a typical top coat.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it does slightly change the color of the polish - but most top coats do that</li>
            <li>I read a tip online somewhere that it is best to apply this when the nail polish is wet; don&#x27;t wait until the polish is dry.</li>
            <li>My nails are dry in just 2 minutes tops after applying this fabulous top coat....</li>
            <li>Used a good polish -- which was also fast dry</li>
            <li>This top coat gives the most clean, smooth finish and the shines lasts several days to two weeks depending on how rough you are on your hands/toes.</li>
            <li>this is the most essential to the shine and quick dryof</li>
            <li>Every time I pet him with this top coat on, his skin got red and he got super itchy.</li>
            <li>The seller was fast and got the product to me very quickly; I just really didn&#x27;t like the product.</li>
            <li>It dries my manicure so quickly that I am able to get back to work immediately -- yes, immediately.</li>
            <li>This top coat needs to be put on right after your last coat of polish, the polish needs to be good and wet still.  </li>
            <li>and it takes me some time, and with the usual top coats, even quick drying, I really can&#x27;t do much with my hands for the rest of the night if I want to keep them nice.  </li>
            <li>, i&#x27;m not exaggerating i don&#x27;t usually say a product is great</li>
            <li>The shine is amazing and it lasts as long as I need it to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Edited two years later: Well, the honeymoon period is over, and I&#x27;ve moved on to other top coats, most notably HK Girl Glisten&amp;Glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>which would be cool if I was ready for it to come off ....</li>
            <li>I bought the Poshe brand top coat at the same time as Seche Vite and Seche is by far my favorite out off of the two.</li>
            <li>Also it occasionally, though rarely for me, causes your polish &amp;#34;peel off&amp;#34; - I only experienced this once, ever since I started using it a year or so ago.</li>
            <li>so I don’t have to worry about messing it up with light activity, and after 20-30 minutes, I continue with my normal activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>instead of staying soft for an hour (or more) like my last top coat.</li>
            <li>I generally reapply top coat every day and still get wear</li>
            <li>product dries and hardens manicures quickly, which is why I gave it two stars, but I will keep looking for a quick dry top coat that protects instead of contributes to the ruin of my manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the only fast drying top coat I will ever buy!</li>
            <li>Make sure you combine with a good base coat and good nail polish</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of Top Coats over the past year, and this is hands down the best.  </li>
            <li>Super shiny, lasts a long time, and most importantly,dries super fast!  </li>
            <li>Love this clear quick dry top coat.</li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t chip any more than the other top coats I&#x27;ve tried, so I have no complaints there.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite is SO shiny and gorgeous, cuts drying time down to 2 mins TOPS, and puts the kabosh on chipping for days.</li>
            <li>Seche is a cult classic in the nail world, so I was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>The reason I originally purchased this top coat was because I have no patience when it comes to waiting for nail polish to dry.</li>
            <li>Only downside is the strong smell, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>Seche Vite is a great top coat to put on nails that you need to dry quickly, but I do not recommend putting it on your bare nails as it smells like spraypaint when you&#x27;re actually putting it on</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s super shiny and kind of gives your nails</li>
            <li>goes on smooth, dries quickly, and protects against chips better than any other brand!</li>
            <li>The one on the right is the one I first ordered.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, i don&#x27;t have to wait very long anymore.</li>
            <li>I swear, I sat perfectly still after applying this top coat for at least 10 minutes, and then moved very carefully for another 20.  </li>
            <li>I no longer have to wait hours for my nails to dry which is amazing.</li>
            <li>I heard so many things about how bad it smelled but that it worked perfectly</li>
            <li>It dries super fast &amp; leaves a shiny gloss</li>
            <li>Dries fast and super shiny.  </li>
            <li>Very shiny and dries QUICKLY.  </li>
            <li>Amazon offers a good price, as I saw these later at Ulta for $9 or $10.</li>
            <li>It lives up to its promise of drying fast and makes my color last forever and look amazing.</li>
            <li>So this top coat is working very well with the routines I have so far.</li>
            <li>Dries super fast.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and leaves a high gloss!</li>
            <li>I do my own acrylics at home, but when they dry their matte.</li>
            <li>It locks it in and dries super fast.</li>
            <li>This stuff really dries quickly and keep the polish shiny.  </li>
            <li>i always loved seche vite, but when i got it from my cvs, i must&#x27;ve got my an old gross one.</li>
            <li>but luckily it dries fast</li>
            <li>but i got over that quickly after I saw how fast it dries.  </li>
            <li>product is so excellent, it makes me wish we could just broadcast a quick announcement to the nail polish users of the world and let them know we&#x27;ve all been doing it wrong, and Seche Vite is the last brand of top coat we&#x27;ll ever buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dries my nails super fast and gives them a finish like glass.</li>
            <li>Drys super fast.</li>
            <li>Super fast drying polish.  </li>
            <li>Super fast drying nil polish.</li>
            <li>This stuff dries my polish SERIOUSLY fast, and it so far hasn&#x27;t seemed to matter how many coats of polish are under it.</li>
            <li>and it dries super fast.</li>
            <li>Dries super fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through many fast drying clear coats and nothing seems to rival Seche Vite (&amp;#34;Say Veet&amp;#34;???).</li>
            <li>Dries quickly, dries very shiny,&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li>Plus dries quickly and gives a high gloss shine!</li>
            <li>Five or so minutes should do it, then gently and quickly apply your Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>it dries super fast and my nail polish lasts longer.</li>
            <li>It is very glossy, dries quickly, and lasts and lasts and lasts.</li>

            <li>its super fast drying and shiny.</li>
            <li>Super fast drying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back to my stand-by top coat that leaves my nails looking salon fresh for 6 days.</li>
            <li>The bottles came super fast.</li>
            <li>It adds a nice shine to your nails, helps them dry super fast, and helps prevent polish from chipping off.  </li>
            <li>it will never dry, this top coat works</li>
            <li>Dries super fast and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this product will really give you a nice, professional-looking manicure at home.  </li>
            <li>It dries fast and let&#x27;s you go on with your day quickly.</li>
            <li>It leaves my manicures super shiny and it dries so fast that by the time I am finished applying the coat to all my fingers I can touch my nails without messing up the manicure.  </li>
            <li>Now, I only spend about an hour once a week (give or take a few days) and they always look great!</li>
            <li>Dries super fast.</li>
            <li>I say forgo the Seche Vite and invest in some good old Sally Hansen quick dry topcoat or the Diamond</li>
            <li>dries super fast.</li>
            <li>I do my own nails, along with friends, and this polish makes my manicures last much longer than I was used to.</li>

            <li>It dries really quickly and makes my nails really glossy.</li>
            <li>Arrived super fast.  </li>
            <li>Seals in your nail designs &amp; dries super fast.</li>
            <li>dries quickly and it has worked very well at keeping my nail polish on</li>
            <li>Dries super fast leaving a glossy finish.</li>
            <li>You still want to avoid doing anything with your hands for a good half hour because the nail polish underneath will still smudge and wrinkle.  </li>
            <li>It dries my nails SUPER fast and helps me to avoid smudges.</li>
            <li>My nails dry fast and the top coat is strong and glossy.</li>
            <li>It got here super fast</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t give it five stars because I&#x27;ve noticed that my polish chips, and sometimes peels off entirely, much faster than with my old top coat.  </li>
            <li>It dries super fast.</li>
            <li>Helps your nails dry faster and has a nice glossy finish.</li>
            <li>It is super shiny and dries really fast.</li>
            <li>Just stay clear of this when women apply it as it smells strong</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years and while it may be a tad bit pricey for a top coat, you definitely get your monies worth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super shiny and dries ridiculously fast.</li>
            <li>It dries so fast and keeps your polish from chipping so quickly.</li>
            <li>Dries fast and super shiny.</li>
            <li>dry within minutes and leave a nice gloss.</li>
            <li>Drys super fast as well.</li>
            <li>When I use this top coat, it feels nice and thick on my nails like gel.</li>
            <li>You can get stuff just as good for 80% less at the drug store.</li>
            <li>Its looks like gel polish and will keep your color or natural nail super clean and shiny for two weeks.</li>
            <li>Love how fast it dries and the glossy professional finish it provides.</li>
            <li>Super fast.</li>
            <li>Dries fast and super shiny</li>
            <li>: Dries SUPER fast.</li>
            <li>I have tried several others, only when the store ran out of Seche Vite and no other comes close to the beautiful gloss look you get with Seche Vita!</li>
            <li>Not only did this top coat dry my nails in under 5 minutes, but it also is the shiniest top coat I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>It goes on so easy, dries amazingly fast, and provides a glossy, high shine finish.  </li>
            <li>But, from the products I&#x27;ve used before (which are limited), I find this to be amazing.  </li>
            <li>only downside to this top coat is that it does suffer some shrinkage, which becomes more apparent the longer you wear it.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy frequent color changes, this might not be a problem at all!</li>
            <li>Hansen Xtreme Wear seems smaller, but the best for long wear so far.</li>
            <li>I have used this top coat many times over the past four months and can&#x27;t believe the fact that when I have completed all 10 nails the first one I did is very dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, be careful-- as much as it looks and feels great</li>
            <li>For long lasting nail color dont spend this kind of money on a unhelpful top coat.</li>
            <li>I recommend purchasing Seche Restore with it, I even use Restore on normal nail polishes and it makes them better than new.</li>
            <li>Love the high shine clear coat!</li>
            <li>(let it dry just a bit first) and it keeps it looking nice and intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I love this topcoat, it leave my nails super shine and it dry them super fast even when I have a lot of coat&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s AMAZING for little rhinestones you definitely don&#x27;t need glue with this top coat!</li>
            <li>the down side, however, it seems like it makes the polish chip more easily.</li>
            <li>Make sure you smooth and buff rough edges of your nails, this topcoat wont save you if you are jagged!  </li>
            <li>Fantastic shine that I have yet to find in any other top coat.</li>
            <li>The shine that comes from applying to freshly painted nails cannot honestly be matched by other products.</li>
            <li>Dries fast, covers mistakes, stays shiny, keeps manicure looking good for longer than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>But little did I know how good this stuff is.</li>
            <li>This really dries my nail polish fast!!</li>
            <li>I read another reviewer saying it&#x27;s best to apply while your actual nail polish color is still wet, and I&#x27;d have to completely agree with that!</li>
            <li>This top coat is great, it dries your nails very quickly and makes the polish last for a few extra days.  </li>
            <li>I love this quick dry polish.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, just make sure the color coat is mostly dry</li>
            <li>Without a quick dry top coat, I would not be painting my nails.</li>
            <li>I tried the Sally Hansen quick dry top coat before and tried to do things 15 minutes afterwards and my nail polish would smudge, and the nail polish would chip within a day or two.</li>
            <li>This truly is a quick dry, no smudge, top coat.</li>
            <li>I wanted a quick dry top coat that wouldn&#x27;t smudge my nail art.  </li>
            <li>I have so many quick dry nail polishes</li>
            <li>I have tried quick dry products (put on after manicure, top coat etc) from OPI, Revlon, Sally Hanson,</li>
            <li>Try Deborah Lippmann&#x27;s quick dry top coat.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, dries fast, and holds up to some pretty decent wear and tear.</li>
            <li>hand with Seche Vite had a blindingly bright shine, dried very fast and lasted for 3 days before chipping/peeling off my nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This high gloss top coat turns at home nail color into &#x27;wow&#x27;.</li>
            <li>The Sally Hansen quick dry top coat in the red bottle is much better than this one.</li>
            <li>This is a good strong top coat, don&#x27;t even try to use as a base, will cause it to chip easily since its meant to stick to polish not your nail beds.  </li>
            <li>it really does dry super fast and gives a nice shine to your polish.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to receive the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat in the mail and esp since I paid less than $11 for two.</li>
            <li>I am sure many of us out there have used a quick dry product only to end up having to redo our nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am sure many of us out there have used a quick dry product only to end up having to redo our nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really does dry in minutes, which I love!  </li>
            <li>This fast dry top coat cane on three days !</li>
            <li>This really dries the nail polish fast, I saw this product being advertised on YouTube, and she was right!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even get through 24 hours without my nails chipping (i.e. huge chunks) or this completely peeling off.  </li>
            <li>As a busy mom, this is huge.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only top coat I use.</li>
            <li>but this top coat helps my polish last approx 10 days without chipping !!!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s something to be aware of.</li>
            <li>I was able to open mail within like 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>It is my first bottle and it will not be my last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this I was blown away.</li>
            <li>At first I passed it off thinking maybe I had just been unlucky</li>
            <li>and my nails ran up against to many things.&lt;br /&gt;After trying out multiple polish brand colors and varying amounts of coats I have concluded its the Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>After multiple times of trying to make this work, I&#x27;m never buying this top coat again.</li>
            <li>I work in beauty retail and let me tell you, this is the only top coat I use and will probably ever use.</li>
            <li>Not only does it protect it for up to a week but the this top coat dries in a matter of minutes.  </li>
            <li>Pretty sturdy, too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SO at first, I didn&#x27;t want to buy it because of the review about the Toluene that was in it.</li>
            <li>and she said most definitely</li>
            <li>I must say that overall I truly love it.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying the product for this exact reason.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this Top Coat nail polish several times and will continue to order it.  </li>
            <li>Waaay shinier than normal topcoats, which is cool.</li>
            <li>Ultra glossy and dries so fast I was doing laundry within 20 minutes and no smudging!</li>
            <li>Finally I ran out of the Revlon Colorstay top coat and decided to try this.</li>
            <li>especially after I top coat</li>
            <li>On one of my first uses of it</li>
            <li>I tried using my regular top coat on them</li>
            <li>The only top coat I will ever use, and the one my manicurist uses.</li>
            <li>Very shine!</li>
            <li>It keeps the shine in days and preserves the nail color pretty well.</li>
            <li>I finally realized it&#x27;s the Seche Vite top coat.</li>
            <li>My manicures do not last more then 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li>I constantly was touching something that destroyed my nails.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t ever get a different top coat from now one, this is just like the one you get at the nail salon.</li>
            <li>It is now the only top coat I use.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I hoped for.  </li>
            <li>I will NEVER use any other top coat ever again!</li>
            <li>I have absolutely no problems keeping the manicure chip free and looking good for 7-10 days especially if I apply another layer of top coat 2-3 days after the initial manicure.</li>
            <li>After several attempts to determine what it was, I realized it was this top coat.</li>
            <li>This is my third bottle of this top coat</li>
            <li>My manicure last about two weeks with this top coat.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>This is the only top coat I use when I get a pedicure or manicure...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real steal for this price too!</li>
            <li>Even better, shipping only takes 4 days.</li>
            <li>My nail color usually last 4-5 days using OPI nail prep and top coat.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, it did!  </li>
            <li>This dries so fast!  </li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>and it dries really fast!</li>
            <li>When I first used Seche Vite</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will ever use a different top coat again.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all true -- arrived fast, dries fast, gel-look shine.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>This is the only top coat I will use.</li>
            <li>but unfortunately it is not the miracle product I was looking for that</li>
            <li>I just did my nails last night after receiving the top coat.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty-</li>
            <li>Not only that, but the finish is fabulous!</li>
            <li>does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>it will not fail you.</li>
            <li>I had my last nail polish on with this top coat</li>
            <li>... shouldn&#x27;t a top coat make it last longer?!</li>
            <li>I only use OPI polishes because even with the Seche Vite top coat, if you&#x27;re using an inferior polish, it&#x27;ll still smudge.  </li>
            <li>This product did exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li>It last longer when I don&#x27;t use the top coat.</li>
            <li>This is literally the only top coat I use anymore.</li>
            <li>I personally believe it is better</li>
            <li>It dries so fast!  </li>
            <li>It never occurred to me before using it that a top coat was actually helpful in any way, just that sometimes it was suggested.  </li>
            <li>Only top coat I&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li>because they get messed up - this is going to fix that fast!  </li>
            <li>This is the only top coat you&#x27;ll ever want.</li>
            <li>I also am constantly cooking, washing dishes, cleaning and stress picking at my nails, so I feel like up til now, no home-done manicure lasts more than three days.</li>
            <li>and I love that it makes any color application I have on lasts for several days.</li>
            <li>My manicures would last a day at most.</li>
            <li>this is the only top coat I ever get.</li>
            <li>There are a number of times I have used this top coat, with various brands of nail polish.</li>
            <li>I bought this top coat a couple weeks ago from my local Sally&#x27;s on sale.</li>
            <li>and you are ready to go!</li>
            <li>is fast too!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my nails look pretty</li>
            <li>This really does work!  </li>
            <li>The top coat also makes my manicures last at LEASTT a week.</li>
            <li>Yes, like others I have noticed that it isn&#x27;t necessarily the strongest top coat.</li>
            <li>But it dries so fast that you could repaint the nail before you would even have a chance to complain!</li>
            <li>This is an absolute game-changer though!</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is much cheaper than drugstores, too!</li>
            <li>A lot of people complain about it &#x27;thickening&#x27; after awhile, and I have definitely noticed this, but if you change your nails a lot, you&#x27;ll be ok.</li>
            <li>It was my 3rd time purchased this top</li>
            <li>This is the only top coat I use now.  </li>
            <li>Dries fast and my toes are shiny!</li>
            <li>Keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li>Seche vite does exactly what it says--</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Would totally suggest this top coat.</li>
            <li>Very shiny with no bubbles at all!</li>
            <li>First time I applied one coat - it chipped after just two hours.</li>
            <li>Dries and hardens any polish so fast!</li>
            <li>Also much cheaper on amazon then in store!</li>
            <li>Make my nail polish looks better and last longer.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will use it every time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the only top coats that truly gives a salon-finish look.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>because I&#x27;ve only been able to get one day wear from it before it chips and flakes off in sheets.  </li>
            <li>I will only use this top coat.  </li>
            <li>With this top coat, your manicure can easily last a week.  </li>
            <li>It has a gel like look once it dries, which it dries fast!</li>
            <li>Really fast shipping!</li>
            <li>And I always use OPI or Essie nail polish with this top coat, my nail polish last longer without this!</li>
            <li>I am bummed because I really wanted this to work for me!</li>
            <li>Not my favorite, and it has that gross glitter polish smell too.</li>
            <li>I paint my nails weekly and this top coat seals my nailpolish instantly!</li>
            <li>It is the only top coat I will use now.</li>
            <li>and it was pretty</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>No chipping, great, long lasting shine.  </li>
            <li>this stuff really works!</li>
            <li>It works just like it says it does which is exactly what every girl needs.</li>
            <li>If I could give this more stars I definitely would!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that this top coat has noticeably extended the life of my manicure beyond the initial application</li>
            <li>Dries SO fast!</li>
            <li>But I still love it regardless, I&#x27;m already on my 2nd bottle since.</li>
            <li>It serves as a top coat AND dries your nails instantly.  </li>
            <li>And sometimes I just use it on my natural nails because it makes them smooth and protected.</li>
            <li>first a confession...</li>
            <li>I actually paint my nails more.</li>
            <li>but it is really shiny!</li>
            <li>On the first day, I did my nails in the morning and by nighttime, after my nightly hot shower, my polish had already begun to peel.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>up buying a couple different top coats brands to experiment</li>
            <li>(Sally Hansen Dries Instantly 30 Second Top Coat).</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll just stick to my regular O.P.I or ORLY top coat.</li>
            <li>FAST drying!</li>
            <li>and I get the same results, but I have purchased the refill size to top it off and maintain the consistency for easier application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says .</li>
            <li>Thick, clear, and incredibly fast-drying, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>This product may work for some, but I am starting to see so many unsatisfied people.</li>
            <li>Besides, a whole bottle lasts me for 9-12 months, and I change my polishes a LOT!</li>
            <li>, Seche vite prevents this and dries extremely fast!</li>
            <li>I researched this top coat extensively before I decided to go ahead and purchase it.</li>
            <li>Okay, so, to be technical, they weren&#x27;t lying.</li>
            <li>This is THE only top coat in my opinion.</li>
            <li>My polished nails last about 5-7 days with this top coat.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not as glossy as I want a top coat to be, after finishing this bottle I might go back to Essie good-to-go</li>
            <li>A lot of salons use this &amp; I would really recommend this!</li>
            <li>this stuff dries insanely fast, and makes your nails so shiny!</li>
            <li>My nails are also starting to chip more often too</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely buy again! :)</li>
            <li>Still this will always be my first choice.</li>
            <li>It is best to take a small bead and spread it over the entire nail.</li>
            <li>It dries really fast!  </li>
            <li>Works really well if you are doing nail art!  </li>
            <li>One of the first ingredients is TOLUENE, a known carcinogen.</li>
            <li>I most likely will not be making another purchase though.</li>
            <li>was it cuz i took a hot shower</li>
            <li>The biggest pro is that it dries SOOOOOO fast!</li>
            <li>No chips, no bubbles, fast drying!</li>
            <li>Drys so fast!</li>
            <li>The nail coat dries fast but PEELS OFF even faster!</li>
            <li>The Gold Standard of top coats.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ll continue to use this over my regular manicures, since I change polish so often, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use this over any of my more intricate manicures or any that I&#x27;d like to last more than 3-4 days.</li>
            <li>This top coat dries within a minute - and not only that</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is suppose to, dries you nails fast!  </li>
            <li>I literally was rubbing my nails after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>That fast!</li>
            <li>I use nail stamps, and after stamping my nails Seche Vite is the only top coat that won&#x27;t blur and smudge the pattern.</li>
            <li>I have tried top coat which a similar in quality</li>
            <li>Drys really fast!</li>
            <li>This top coat truly dries within a minute or so (if i blow on them especially).</li>
            <li>it looked EXACTLY</li>
            <li>Dries fast,!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!;)</li>
            <li>Overall, though, I love it.</li>
            <li>It had a gloss to it for about 2 weeks straight!</li>
            <li>This is my go to top coat for regular polish.</li>
            <li>Keeps my nails looking great for at least a week</li>
            <li>ONLY GRIPE is that I sometimes get bubbles in the top coat when I apply it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty glossy, although not as glossy as some others I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I apply it over my nails after I have them done and it helps the polish job last for one week or more.  </li>
            <li>First got introduced to this product by my neighborhood nail salon.</li>
            <li>Amazingly fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Love this product and just bought my second bottle.</li>
            <li>Got that one in fast!</li>
            <li>Seche Vite is my only Top Coat Polish I will put on my nails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not getting the same results as most users.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Seche Vite does exactly what it states.</li>
            <li>Dries so fast!</li>
            <li>top coat definitely dries fast!  </li>
            <li>I am an avid do-er of nail art and lover of polish and follow many nail blogs, and have listened to others rave about this product, so I finally had to try it.</li>
            <li>When I first used this, my manicure lasted over a week without chips.</li>
            <li>It definitely lives up to the hype of being top coat of the year.</li>
            <li>And I love that I could purchase it as such a bargain price!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>I recommended it to my whole family and thats all we use now!</li>
            <li>The only thing is I don&#x27;t know how sturdy the top coat is because I&#x27;ve found my nails chipping with in the first week.</li>
            <li>Definitely will be buying again when I run out:)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just as shiny and pretty.</li>
            <li>not expensive</li>
            <li>The performance has been consistent over that period of time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper than OPI top coat, but I prefer the former.</li>
            <li>but with this top coat, they last about a week.</li>
            <li>I see is that the top coat no longer shines like the first day application around my fourth day of wearing it.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I read so many reviews about how it stays on forever and no chipping .</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>If anyone knows of a top coat that actually seals in your polish and extends it&#x27;s wear, let me know!</li>
            <li>Maybe need buy some more later.</li>
            <li>I also find peeling the nail polish off  in one giant piece oddly satisfying..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear and goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve sort of found a solution to this by applying it not only on the nail but under it and making sure it&#x27;s on the edge on the nail too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with it because it&#x27;s definitely made my nails a million times stronger without nail polish because of this nail</li>
            <li>Helps to color nails fast!</li>
            <li>I can apply this top coat over two coats of polish and 5 minutes later be in bed for the night and wake up without any imprints or sheet marks.  </li>
            <li>When my nails are shorter this top coat seems to last longer.</li>
            <li>This arrived SO fast!</li>
            <li>You can polish your nails, put this on top and run your fingers thru your hair 5 to 10 minutes later.</li>
            <li>Dries fast!</li>
            <li>also make the manicure last longer than if i hadn&#x27;t used the seche vite top coat</li>
            <li>This top coat  definitely makes your manicure look like you had it done in a salon, gives it that shine.</li>
            <li>I can use this top coat, go to bed shortly after finishing my manicure</li>
            <li>I am an OPI addict, it is the only polish I use, with the exception of Seche Vite top coat.  </li>
            <li>The part I like most is you apply it after the final coat of polish and</li>
            <li>Get this top coat if you want for your nails to look shiny and your polish to last for days without chipping.</li>
            <li>My solution is to just finish using my first bottle and when it gone, trade the caps.</li>
            <li>Its the only top coat I will use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never going back to another top coat.</li>
            <li>I use it in rotation with my extra-life Revlon top coat, only when I don&#x27;t have time to wait around.</li>
            <li>Even the cheapest and noname topcoats I ever bought in a local drug store worked better...</li>
            <li>and my manicure will last when I use the Seche Vite top coat.</li>
            <li>This is a phenomenal product and literally dries all layers instantly.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It leaves a glassy shine and can even smooth out imperfections in your polish application, making a homemade manicure look professional.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT, will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>, the shine is so pretty...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely have to practice more and update review</li>
            <li>First time I am trying this product and others just don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this another try because I actually lost my bottle of Sally Hansen Top Coat.</li>
            <li>Try to keep it off your cuticle and skin because it shrinks as it dries and will peel back from your skin and makes the nail more prone to peeling prematurely.</li>
            <li>it came really fast too!</li>
            <li>My nails looked great--the first day.  </li>
            <li>I am going to try it with a couple of different nail polishes to see if I get better results.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>This product does seem to seal in the manicure pretty well.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Makes your nails look very shiny!</li>
            <li>I was pretty devastated.</li>
            <li>Some polishes (often cheaper ones) often will flake or peel off the next day while others I have used have stayed virtually chipless for more than a week.</li>
            <li>but with this top coat, it dries instantly</li>
            <li>Dries really fast!</li>
            <li>Let me tell you something, if you weare this top coat, your polish is going to last for AGES!!!  </li>
            <li>Basic top coat.  </li>
            <li>Dries on so fast, I will often paint my nails just before bed with no smudges in the morning!</li>
            <li>I did my Christmas manicure in red and silver paisley and used Seche Vite as top coat.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what it sounds like.  </li>
            <li>It makes painting your nails that much easier!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m switching back to Sally Hansen&#x27;s Strengthening Top Coat.</li>
            <li>they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like this, but it was only OK.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping..great product!</li>
            <li>Highly highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Seche dries my nails so fast!</li>
            <li>Tried it for the first time and it dries faster than any they use in the nail salons.  </li>
            <li>It has a gorgeous glass-like finish, and dries to the touch in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Even other \\&quot;quick dry\\&quot; top coats would sometimes seal in the still-wet polish underneath and never allow it to fully dry (ending up squishy, kind of like a waterbed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally listen to reviews on products of any kind to make a decision but based on the fact that there are a million and one different quick dry top coats I thought it wise to do a little research before shelling out however much money</li>
            <li>One was how to clean up the polish using a brush, and the other was Seche Vite for a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seriously dries fast and is fairly chip-free!</li>
            <li>Strong odor from the bottle but who cares with an amazing, glossy, hard finished nail from home</li>
            <li>Best top coat I&#x27;ve ever bought and nails are dry in only a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Quick dry-with a High sheen.</li>
            <li>This is amazing, Seche Vite means dry fast, and this is exactly what it does.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s excellent for someone that always bumps their nails or is too busy to wait that long for nails to dry.</li>
            <li>Wow this is very smelly!!!  </li>
            <li>I also like color clubs speed dry, but this is an old standard and anyone knows what a great performer this top coat is when its a new bottle.</li>
            <li>i have since found a local supply store where i purchase this for super cheap, and it is 7.50 at ulta too.</li>
            <li>And for those who like to keep their nails fresh by adding a top coat every two days or so, not working over dry polish is a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>It dries in less than a minute and gives nails a great glossy shine, as well as making them look professionally done.</li>
            <li>I really liked the Seche Vite fast dry polish....</li>
            <li>it really dries fast and leaves a super shiny coat.</li>
            <li>Only downside is that it has a strong smell but, worth it.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First the positive: It is very fast drying.</li>
            <li>Whole sections of my polish just either fall off or peel right off.</li>
            <li>I might give away the bottle I have right now because it irritates me so much.</li>
            <li>I must be using too much or something, because this peels right off within a day or so after use every time.</li>
            <li>Goes good over plain colored polish and even glitter polish.</li>
            <li>Works great when the bottle is new, but gets super thick and gunky after a while and isn&#x27;t useable anymore.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in a pinch and need your manicure to dry super fast then this is the top coat for you.</li>
            <li>Love this product it really makes you nail dry quickly.</li>
            <li>This top coat dries super fast, your manicure will be completely dry within 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Okay, not that quickly, but it does dry fast.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly with one application, within 15 minutes, I could being doing normal things and not have to be worried about smudging.</li>
            <li>I use it as a top coat over my nail polish and my nails dry super fast.</li>
            <li>Right when I painted my nails, I swear that this top coat really did dry my nails right away.</li>
            <li>Now I can get a full week out of my manicure, so long as I make sure to re-wrap the free edge every third day or so.</li>
            <li>I will say this stuff works ridiculously well, almost too good to be true, so I am giving 5 stars for performance and removing 2 for the health concerns.</li>
            <li>Be aware of the tons of positive feedback and don&#x27;t get caught up in the hype.</li>
            <li>obsessed with this top coat!!!  </li>
            <li>can say for certain this is the only top coat I will ever use.  </li>
            <li>I bought this and it does dry very fast and very smooth and glossy.</li>
            <li>I use it to prolong a manicure or pedicure by adding my own topcoat every other day or so.  </li>
            <li>I am not joking I polished my nails before work this morning and was able to get in the shower and flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li>absolutely recommend this top coat to anyone who is interested in an actual quality mani/pedi.</li>
            <li>Reasonably chip resistant, but I usually put on a gel top coat an hour or two after the Seche Vite for more durability.</li>
            <li>This is the first fast dry top nail coat that I have purchased without paying a fortune that is so worth it.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I was pretty amazed at how fast it really did dry and create a protective barrier with a nice, shiny sheen.  </li>
            <li>They used to get smudged and chip quickly with other top coats...</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and lasts longer than any other top coat I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>with some polishes the whole coat of polish will come off in one large piece!</li>
            <li>The bottle was full, and if it wasn&#x27;t a brand new bottle, it certainly gave the impression to be.  </li>
            <li>This top coat is worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be confidently making lasagna for my family in half an hour, knowing all those layers are rock solid under this amazing goo.</li>
            <li>Using it for the purpose of a nail polish top coat is completely safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend using this if you are pregnant.</li>
            <li>I recently started doing my own white tip manicure and use it to set the tip quickly.</li>
            <li>My natural nails never dry and my husband swears it&#x27;s my cheap buy cheap nail polishes</li>
            <li>Within ten to fifteen minutes at the most I&#x27;m able to go about my day without worrying about ruining my nails because they are dry.</li>
            <li>I was previously using Sally Hansen, and I am not even sure if it was a top coat or a clear nail polish.  </li>
            <li>The scent is pretty strong but not a big deal, highly recommend the product!!</li>
            <li>This was great as people always say for allowing a manicure to last, but it didn&#x27;t dry as fast as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>This one goes on so smooth and leaves a nice thick coat on the nail.</li>
            <li>I use China Glaze base coat, 2 coats of polish and this top coat for perfect nails every time.    </li>
            <li>I hurriedly did my nails and smeared on a whole gob of top coat for each nail, and perhaps 20 minutes later, my nails were done.</li>
            <li>I do a lot of cleaning and wash my hands frequently, it really helped my polish last for more than a day.</li>
            <li>Not only was the delivery ridiculously fast, but the product is more than I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>- it is only good if you need it for a mani that day or the next day.</li>
            <li>I have a big problem with painting my nails, applying topcoat, and very soon after, for lack of a better word, smushing them.</li>
            <li>Painted it on my wet nails and it dried them perfectly without nicks or smudges.</li>
            <li>However, make your nail really shinny and overall rating is okay.</li>
            <li>I love how fast it dries (literally rock solid in 2 minutes</li>
            <li>Time and time again, for the last two months, this bottle has been a life saver since I couldn&#x27;t really afford to go to the salon anymore - and no one will ever be the wiser :)</li>
            <li>It dries so fast and keeps my nails looking great for at least a week.  </li>
            <li>it does what i bought it for, very shiny and does not yellow when i smoke, a lot of top coats do.</li>
            <li>Definitely just head to Sally to make sure you&#x27;re getting the real deal.</li>
            <li>this is some of the best top and base coat polish.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong smell, which I took a star off for, but that&#x27;s to be expected with nail stuff,</li>
            <li>It dries the polish very quickly and often makes the polish last twice as long as with a normal top coat, and with almost no chipping!</li>
            <li>Apply it while polish is still wet and your poilish will dry pretty fast and it makes a nice protective top coat.</li>
            <li>This nail coat really dries very fast, 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Love this Nail Polish, and finally paint it the color drifted, some minor defect is gone, so much the better, rather like.</li>
            <li>Great for Halloween, otherwise a true fake cheap clear coat</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and offers a high-shine finish and extends the life of my manicure!  </li>
            <li>As someone who always mess up a perfectly good polish job by bumping into something or touching it before it completely dries (no matter how long I waited), the Seche Vite Fast Dry Top Coat is a miracle in a bottle!</li>
            <li>I would put in a lot of time and effort and have beautiful designs only for it to chip in less than a day.</li>
            <li>I bought this clear coat nail polish because I am learning how to do acrylic nails, it came in pretty quick, within a week.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Positive:</li>
            <li>I bought this solely based on all the positive feedback.</li>
            <li>Works as positive reviewers claim.</li>
            <li>a positive note</li>
            <li>After reading all of the positive reviews regarding this product, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>It peels off each nail in one clean little sheet of polish and top coat.</li>
            <li>This product really does what it says - it dries FAST!</li>
            <li>for Seche Vite not working with three-free polishes, I pretty much exclusively use Zoya nail polish, and I do not have a problem with using Seche Vite as the topcoat.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to wrap the polish onto the underside of the nail to set a manicure for a long stay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been so passionate about a top coat in my life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also dries pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Got here pretty fast too.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty intensely for about a day after applying, but it goes away.</li>
            <li>As in, I could have done pretty much anything without messing them up.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says....dries fast.</li>
            <li>thing that is clear is that one&#x27;s nail structure and products used with Seche can play a big role in how well it will work for you - it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!e&#x27;s proprietary thinner to be able to get anywhere close to finishing a bottle</li>
            <li>So, when I stopped using this top coat, my manicure lasted twice as long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a long time user of this top coat.  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly as it says it will, it dries fast.  </li>
            <li>I will say that it smells more than other polish, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>It dries really fast and leaves my nails very glossy!</li>
            <li>For a busy student and full time worker, this is important!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It arrived the other day and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I usually get good 24 hours</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the only top coats worth using.</li>
            <li>The old bottle is still 2/3 full</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason I only gave 4 stars is because I bought this top coat just a few months ago and already the brush is funky like it&#x27;s not spreading as nicely.</li>
            <li>I think this works just as good (if not better)</li>
            <li>So far this is probably my favorite of all the brands I&#x27;ve tried but there are a few pros and cons as with most things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and seller.&lt;br /&gt;Price was right and got it quickly.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>My nails dry SO FAST with this, goes on beautifully, and makes my polish last much longer than with any other top coat product I have tried.  </li>
            <li>This top coat is really amazing except, it is just a little too thick for me as a top coat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, shiny and quick dry.</li>
            <li>It dries super quickly and contrary to what the number one critical reviewer claims</li>
            <li>Makes your nail polish last much longer and makes it very shiny and pretty!!!  </li>
            <li>I was impressed how it helps to dry the other layers of polish underneath it, really - no other topcoat like it!</li>
            <li>Because of how fast it dries, you really have to get it right - do-overs or fix-ups are very difficult.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because of how fast it dries, you really have to get it right - do-overs or fix-ups are very difficult.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I picked up Seche Vite Dry Fast Top coat while I was in a hurry at Beauty First.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a long lasting, strong Top coat, then this is the one for you.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat</li>
            <li>Only positive a can give is that it dries very quick and leaves a shiny finish.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a top coat that dried fast and left a nice shine  </li>
            <li>The author highly recommended it, so I searched the Net and learned that many nail artists recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Dry super fast!!!</li>
            <li>I also wait 12 hours or so after applying the polish before putting on a final Seche Vite top coat, because I found that this somehow makes the polish last significantly longer before chipping/bubbling...    </li>
            <li>it smooths out the gritty surface tons better than any other top coat b/c</li>
            <li>I feel like this is a much more solid coat than other top coats I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It really protects my manicures/pedicures and makes them look freshly painted way longer than any other top coat.</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes, I can cook, do laundry, do just about anything that would normally ruin my nails right after painting them.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and easily, even though it is thick.</li>
            <li>It also gives a great glossy coat to the nails....not dull at all!</li>
            <li>I Love this stuff,it stays on my nails for very long time and looks like gel manicure,gonna buy more,thank you</li>
            <li>It adds great shine and does in fact dry very fast, despite being extremely thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will admit that the Jet Dry leaves your nails with a better shine than Seche Vite but</li>
            <li>If you are having problems with bubbles in your polish or just can&#x27;t sit around and wait an hour for your nails to dry, this is the top coat for you.</li>
            <li>Big brush and goes on easy with no globs of polish.</li>
            <li>The first time I topped off my carefully executed manicure with this delectable treat, I knew I would never use another top coat ever again.</li>
            <li>Very shiny, very durable, dries FAST, too!  </li>
            <li>It is basically clear goo that hardens quickly.</li>
            <li>Dries so quickly and makes manicures look professional.  </li>
            <li>I had tried OPI&#x27;s top coat which takes forever to dry</li>
            <li>5 minutes before touching it and to my surprise it was completely dry.</li>
            <li>To make sure they&#x27;re totally dry</li>
            <li>I used this topcoat for a long time years ago and completely forgot about how much I liked it.  </li>
            <li>top dry (nail dryer) coat.</li>
            <li>The top is dry but the stuff underneath is not.</li>
            <li>That is the faster dry top coat I even use.</li>
            <li>It dries quick and makes your nails look professionally done.</li>
            <li>It makes your manicure look professional and super shiny.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and crystal clear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 3 days since I painted my nails using this top coat and so far, it has barely chipped.</li>
            <li>With this on top, it was dry in like..</li>
            <li>but it seems to easily flake away a day later, even when I apply a PH balance to my nails.</li>
            <li>i followed with it the top dry coat.</li>
            <li>Not only does it dry your nails quickly but is also hardens them, I buy a jar a month because I do my own nails 3 times a week.</li>
            <li>I let my 2 coats of Butter London polish dry for about 2 minutes and then put on this top coat.</li>
            <li>alot of times you think your nails are dry on top</li>
            <li>I was using Sephora&#x27;s Top coat which took like 20 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the chemicals in it will probably effect me in the long run since I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years, but I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>I like the top coat nail dry &amp; use it when I get a mani or pedi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to bleed color off the polish under it, and stays clear in the bottle unlike a lot of topcoats I have tried, quick drying and otherwise.</li>
            <li>it was the super clear coat.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s better than waiting for nail polish to dry.</li>
            <li>but this top coat made my polish dry</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to a normal top coat.</li>
            <li>It is really clear, shiny, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>With this nail polish it happens no more which is the most important to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With this I put the top coat on &amp; my nails are completely dry in 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no waiting for an hour for color to dry just so you can apply a top coat.  </li>
            <li>this one took more time to dry even with me waiting 20 min.</li>
            <li>I also let the tips dry just to make sure.</li>
            <li>Sometimes this means they take longer to dry, or stay &amp;#34;malleable&amp;#34; after I have put on the top coat.</li>
            <li>But looks nice for the first few hours..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: 8/27/15 My manicure is going strong, 3 days later.</li>
            <li>This top coat is super shiny and actually does dry super fast.</li>
            <li>I love this top coat it works super well on my nails and lasts a long time for a heavy nail and hand user.</li>
            <li>It gives the nails a good shine, but does not stop paint from chipping or long lasting wear!</li>
            <li>The smell is the only thing that bothers me, is a bit too strong.</li>
            <li>At first, I was reluctant to purchase Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat because I really didn&#x27;t want to spend $5 for one bottle.  </li>
            <li>Only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the strong smell.</li>
            <li>However, this has such a strong smell.</li>
            <li>My nails actually bend now, they are usually strong.</li>
            <li>I ordered Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat based on all of the positive reviews</li>
            <li>With the top coat lasting much longer than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>After 5 minutes, I was able to press down on my freshly painted nail and it did not get messed up AT ALL.</li>
            <li>The top coat produces a very high shine that lasts a long time and really seemed to protect the surface of my nail color.</li>
            <li>If I were to only plan on wearing a manicure for one day, such as for a special occasion, this polish&#x27;s drawbacks would be more of a non-issue.  </li>
            <li>If I were to only plan on wearing a manicure for one day, such as for a special occasion, this polish&#x27;s drawbacks would be more of a non-issue.  </li>
            <li>I will say I never get dent marks on my toenails from certain shoes or socks anymore</li>
            <li>With certain polishes and glitters it causes shrinkage.</li>
            <li>It certainly leaves a gel coat look.</li>
            <li>Just be smart and ventilate.</li>
            <li>Wow, this stuff really dries quickly and it seems to dry the underlying coats of nail polish when used as a top coat.  </li>
            <li>Nails dry super fast and left a nice shiny coat.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times my ADD leads me astray, I always come back to Seche Vite, and so far I haven&#x27;t found anything else that consistently delivers mani after mani.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mix and match different brands, because I&#x27;ve found that within a single brand will always have some polishes that chip easily and some that look good and last.</li>
            <li>After waking up with sheet marks numerous times, even when I would do my nails at 4:30 in the afternoon, I decided it was time to start looking for a new top coat.</li>
            <li>Most polishes I&#x27;ve tried loose their shine after a day or so.  </li>
            <li>It truly is amazing how fast my nails are mess-proof, it probably takes less than a minute</li>
            <li>Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Cost puts an end to all that.</li>
            <li>This dry fast top coat does wonders.  </li>
            <li>Thumbs up to this dry fast top coat.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try an air dry gel top coat before purchasing a UV lamp.</li>
            <li>That has always been a problem for me in the summer heat and humidity and was the reason I started using fast dry top coats.</li>
            <li>For someone like me, with 3 kids, a legitimate fast dry top coat, is a necessity.  </li>
            <li>It glistens and shines and you end up staring at your hands far more than is socially</li>
            <li>Not with the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Someone who reviewed the Quimica product also recommended Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Nail Coat, 0.5 Ounce, so I got it.</li>
            <li>FAST DRY Amor LOVE this</li>
            <li>Was amazed that my dry was ACTUALLY fast &#x3D;)</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ll be a Seche Vite Dry Fast top coat user</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s a characteristic that most fast dry top coats have, so I&#x27;m not complaining too much.</li>
            <li>This top coat works really well to make your nails dry faster.</li>
            <li>I put this top coat on when I did my nails yesterday and it did dry fast.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t dry as fast if I put more than 2 coats and it smudges.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>No matter how many layers of nailpolish you put on, this stuff will dry it REALLY fast.</li>
            <li>With the Seche Vite dry fast top nail coat (which you can get on sale at Sally&#x27;s sometimes), my nails always look like I had a salon-manicure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a top coat that stayed so shiny and dried so quickly.</li>
            <li>to SECHE VITE DRY FAST TOP COAT: when I am not doing a gel manicure (which is always)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s because it dry fast, I won&#x27;t be able to finish the bottle.</li>
            <li>I thought i used this product before with better results—maybe it wasn&#x27;t the fast dry.</li>
            <li>I love the way it is designed to dry fast it dries in about a minute or sooner.</li>
            <li>Dry Fast Top Nail Coat?</li>
            <li>I have finally found a fast drying top coat that will do what it says and DRY quickly!</li>

            <li>seche vite top dry coat always!</li>
            <li>I bought this nail top coat for the first time after seeing the rave views about it on amazon and other sites.</li>
            <li>If I know I&#x27;m going to change my polish again in the next two days, I&#x27;d be fine using the Seche Vite again.</li>
            <li>Not only does it keep my nails from chipping, but it&#x27;s dries them quickly as well!      </li>
            <li>This Seche Vite fast dry top coat is absolutely *</li>

            <li>The dry fast top coat truly dries fast on your nails.</li>
            <li>It certainly dries fast.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with my other quick dry top coats that I was using before I tired Seche Vite.  </li>
            <li>1 or 2 layers of polish will hold up really well, but if you layer on 4-5 coats of polish and then put this top coat on (which is very often done because it will even harden those really thick gummy manis very quickly)</li>
            <li>I then applied the 2nd coating of color on my right hand and quickly followed with SV.</li>
            <li>this IS a Gr8 product, my shipment was eather old or maybe got too hot during shipping?!?</li>
            <li>I love this top coat, it dries quickly, and actually keeps nails chip free for days, regardless of if you&#x27;re using expensive nail polish or dollar store polish.</li>
            <li>This top coat really does dry your nails in almost a minute!</li>
            <li>This glides on smooth, it doesn&#x27;t pick up the color of the nail polish underneath and dried quickly!</li>
            <li>I should have bought this as my main top coat a long time ago.</li>
            <li>Other than this small con, i think this top coat is great for anyone looking to extend their manicure life and make their nails look professionally done, even when it wasnt.</li>
            <li>Thick and makes your nails super shiny, I highly recommend everyone buy this top coat!</li>
            <li>I always heard great reviews of this topcoat, and I was sorely disappointed when after just a day my polish would peel off very easily.</li>
            <li>it may not dry as fast but its pretty dang quick.</li>
            <li>The top coat leaves a high gloss look and keeps my nail polish from chipping for a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dry to the touch after about 15 minutes, as with most other fast drying top coat products.</li>
            <li>I painted my nails last night and by noon today they had huge chips in them.</li>
            <li>and I just want to say it makes my cheap nail polish last sooo much longer[week to two week range bro] and makes it shiner as well.</li>
            <li>Definitely a huge time saver and makes nail polish extra shiny.</li>
            <li>Only used a few times, but this works great.  </li>
            <li>Great for when your last coat hasn&#x27;t dried yet and you need your hands back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>goes on smooth and makes my polish last so much</li>
            <li>It dries really fast and its such a smooth finish.</li>

            <li>Drys so fast, no issues with crappy nail polish getting smudged or ruined 15-20 minutes after you are finished painting your nails.</li>
            <li>Make sure you put it on while the rest of your nail polish is still wet, otherwise it will all peel off within a day or two.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li>Additionally, shipping was extremely fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really extends the polish much.</li>
            <li>That said, it dries MUCH faster than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried, and continue to use</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s very annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>

            <li>Very durable wear.</li>
            <li>Dries fast to a patent leather, liquid shine.</li>
            <li>Dries polish fast</li>
            <li>This still chips on me, even using top quality color, but I am a waitress and that is to be expected.  </li>
            <li>IT DRIES FAST</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure if this top coat is better than the cheaper ones, as this is my first time actually using one.</li>
            <li>It dries really fast...</li>
            <li>You really do have to try it to believe it.</li>
            <li>It seems thicker even and is very stringy as I apply.</li>

            <li>, I give this a 5/5 for how fast it dries.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite does (must apply to wet polish, starts to thicken as you use up the bottle), but I do believe it is much, much better.</li>

            <li>Thanks Pro Concepts.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much on the brush, just one coat should do for optimal results.</li>

            <li>Very wearable and prevents chipping.</li>
            <li>Dries fast without scuff marks.</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s held up really well.  </li>
            <li>It does the job of a shiny finish while drying fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t polish my fingernails very often, but I do like to keep my toenails polished.</li>

            <li>It dries on fast like a gel.  </li>
            <li>It dries so fast and does not clump.</li>
            <li>Really fast drying time.</li>
            <li>When i say really fast</li>

            <li>So much cheaper than in the stores too.</li>
            <li>and I am ready to go, doesn&#x27;t peel.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Breakneck fast drying.</li>
            <li>really fast but scared when i read the label ...</li>
            <li>It stays shiny the whole time.  </li>
            <li>Really brings out the colors in the polish I use.</li>
            <li>Nothing really seems to work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone up to 3 whole days with no chips</li>
            <li>description describes the polish in a nut shell very well.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s fast drying and protects the nail color for days.</li>
            <li>It dries your nails fast.</li>

            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>Drys fast</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer stated, literally 10-15 minutes after using, I was doing my hair with not so much as a smudge.  </li>
            <li>After applying, the next day or two, the polish will completely peel off and shed the whole nail top like a snake sheds it&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>Fantastic and only cost $6 on Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li>Dries fast, like in 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Dries fast and stays put.  </li>
            <li>I do my nails and make sure to apply the Seche Vite when they are still wet.  </li>
            <li>It really dries fast.</li>
            <li>Dries really fast.</li>
            <li>It relly works and it dries really fast</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend it..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really mind the smell.</li>
            <li>I like it because it dries fast</li>
            <li>BUT RUNS OUT FAST.</li>
            <li>exposing the white of the tips of my nails (in spite of capping the free edge generously), but my polish also started to chip after one day.  </li>
            <li>Nail coat works for me very well.</li>
            <li>Actually, within 2 minutes you are dent free, and don&#x27;t have to worry about bumping your manicure and denting your polish.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really help the polish stay on too much longer</li>
            <li>Dries fast.</li>
            <li>I will continue using this top coat seeing as I spent the money on it, but I don&#x27;t think I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>Very prompt.</li>
            <li>Fast Drying, high glossy shine!  </li>
            <li>My nail polish really lasts when I wear this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have an intense love/hate relationship with this product.</li>
            <li>It dries so fast.</li>
            <li>It also dries fast too.  </li>
            <li>I apply the top-coat while my color coat is still wet and make sure to apply and additional swath of product over my tips.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>I put it on over 5 layers of polish and gel finish, and it was almost as if the top coat sinks into all the layers of nail polish and hardens it to perfection.  </li>
            <li>Its very shiny &amp; dries fast.</li>
            <li>Very shiny and no scratches or dents from the sheets.</li>
            <li>But really, this may have put me over my beauty carcinogenic limit for the month.</li>
            <li>so I have to continue to buy more before empty.</li>
            <li>price fast</li>
            <li>If a nail does chip, the whole fingernail of color will often come off, since the topcoat holds it together so well.</li>
            <li>Really does shorten drying time, and is very glossy.</li>
            <li>This dries incredibly fast, and protects the color underneath.</li>
            <li>Dries fast (but chips by day 2).</li>
            <li>Like really fast.</li>
            <li>It dries up fast and looks amazing/shiny on my nails.</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast this stuff dries my nails.</li>
            <li>The shine never dies and it prevents the color from chipping very well.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this bottle to anyone.</li>
            <li>It dries so fast that my manicures aren&#x27;t ruined minutes after I finish them.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>There is no way this is the real product.</li>
            <li>To my fellow polish connoisseurs, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>it also makes them very shiny.</li>
            <li>I like seche vite for the thickness &amp; it really helps strengthen my nails.  </li>
            <li>i bought this figuring i&#x27;d try and see how fast it dries and maybe save some money on manicures.</li>
            <li>highly recommend seche vite!</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of protecting from chips and peels.</li>
            <li>My nail polish lasts so much longer now.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like the whole I have to wrap the end of my nails or</li>
            <li>Dries fast and has a gel-like finish and shine.  </li>
            <li>, I have not had a chipping issue or a whole nail peeling off.  </li>
            <li>it works really well too</li>
            <li>/&gt;PROS -&lt;br /&gt;-Extremely fast drying, fastest I&#x27;ve ever seen</li>
            <li>It is very shiny also.</li>
            <li>Drys just as fast as it says it will.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Works fast just like it says.  </li>
            <li>Very glossy.</li>
            <li>Even through daily washing of dishes and light yard work.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It dries fast without altering the shine or finish of the polish.</li>
            <li>Really hardens the polish.</li>

            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so glossy and dries fast.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>but it is much cheaper on amazon.com</li>
            <li>it got my whole family using it now</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need to put much on.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s very safe.</li>
            <li>but my nails look really shiny and glossy.</li>
            <li>Dries extremely fast and lasts for days.</li>
            <li>Dries fast with a shiny finish.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive for the quality.</li>
            <li>The way it peeled up, I just tugged and watched my polish come off in one whole piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it dries fast ;</li>
            <li>which allows me to do my nails at night and go straight to bed.  </li>
            <li>(cos I don&#x27;t like when the color&#x27;s still wet and taints the top coat in the bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she said her polish chipped fast also.</li>
            <li>Fast drying and shiny, what else can you expect?</li>
            <li>Pink Armor is much better.</li>
            <li>This really locks in your nail polish -</li>
            <li>Who knows if its real or not - but read some articles and decide for yourself.</li>
            <li>Have to use up the polish fast</li>
            <li>I get a lot of compliments on my nails thanks to this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>it not bothering in.returning.it.ahipping was fast ...</li>
            <li>Now my whole family is hooked on this stuff.</li>
            <li>I like how it really seals the nail color/design that you have on your nail.</li>

            <li>This works so amazingly fast</li>
            <li>fast</li>

            <li>so really doesnt</li>
            <li>Dries fast, looks shiny...</li>
            <li>As for shine,there really isn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li>and it dries fast too.</li>
            <li>and thats even without you washing your hands too much.</li>
            <li>It really does make a difference on the shine.  </li>
            <li>I will forever buy this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Once you get about 1/ way through with the bottle it gets really goopy and stringy</li>
            <li>also very shiny coat.</li>
            <li>Halfway through the bottle I am starting to notice that is gotten a lot thicker and does not go on evenly and as smooth as it used to.</li>
            <li>I have had the entire nail-full of polish pop off as if it were one of those cheap glue on nails.  </li>
            <li>And sometimes, if my color could use some shine, Seche Vite doesn&#x27;t really help too much.</li>
            <li>This came on time and works very well.</li>
            <li>It is definetly fast dying.</li>
            <li>AND ITS SO MUCH CHEAPER HERE</li>
            <li>Dries exceptionally fast.</li>
            <li>Really lives up to reputation in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely a MUST have for every nail polish</li>

            <li>And it&#x27;s SO much cheaper on Amazon than it is in stores, even w/ a beauty license discount.</li>
            <li>And it really protects the polish from chipping.  </li>
            <li>Thanks guys...  Cathi</li>

            <li>Fast drying, leaves shiny coat, and really protects color.</li>
            <li>but I really like this product.</li>
            <li>though it says and seems it&#x27;s fast drying.</li>
            <li>Maybe I am a bit more rough on my nails</li>
            <li>Fast drying.</li>
            <li>Will absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li>too (this stuff dries lightening fast</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I prefer revlon colorstay topcoat though both did not help fasten the drying time that much</li>
            <li>Seriously fast.</li>
            <li>Dries fast though.</li>
            <li>It dries in around 10 minutes and around an hour to really harden.</li>
            <li>It dries incredibly fast, (and I have yet to see it clump on me</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;It dries my nail polish so fast...</li>
            <li>You can polish your nails, put on the Seche Vite, and in 1 minute you are ready to go.  </li>
            <li>If you reapply a top coat everyday your polish will last up to a week or more.  </li>
            <li>It was only $4.40 with free shipping</li>
            <li>It dries fast.</li>
            <li>If you apply too much to the nail, no worries.</li>
            <li>This product literally is fast drying.</li>
            <li>Heard so much about this brand, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay almost $10 for a bottle in the stores.</li>
            <li>but this one was much stronger.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast drying and anti-chipping.</li>
            <li>It really does protect your color.  </li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>Drys insanely fast</li>
            <li>Dries fast too.</li>
            <li>Really seals it it to help the manicure&#x27;s staying power.</li>
            <li>Dries SO fast</li>
            <li>Keeps nail polish on for over a week and fast drying.</li>
            <li>The smell is absolutely toxic, but I guess it&#x27;s forgivable if it does what it says it does.</li>
            <li>I really like how fast Seche Vite dries.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>and it dries so fast.</li>
            <li>and I just don&#x27;t like them as much as seche vite.</li>
            <li>Now in the summer I change my nail color every two days, and it helps to have a fast dryer.</li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s really takes care of my nails.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>After carefully placing my designs on each nail, I would unavoidably find it smudged with the top coats I was using.  </li>
            <li>This chips/peels off too fast for me.</li>
            <li>the product, it works very well, as promised.</li>
            <li>dries fast, very shiny and protects well.  </li>
            <li>I can not beleive how fast my polish dries using this.  </li>
            <li>/sets polish very quickly&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly shiny</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Contains toluene&lt;br /&gt;Smells really bad&lt;</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t notice much difference.</li>
            <li>And remember to wipe your nails with acetone-based (or straight aceton, as I opt to do) nail polish remover so that the nail polish &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; and your at-home manicure lasts.</li>
            <li>But it chips just as fast.  </li>
            <li>one is because it dries fast and is shiny.</li>
            <li>Dries insanely fast.</li>
            <li>It is very glossy.</li>
            <li>absolute must have for doing your nails at home.</li>
            <li>And to make matters worse, most of these so called &amp;#34;top rated top coats&amp;#34; peeled within three days of me applying my nail polish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To make a long story short, I was very pleased with my results.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t yellow like many clear polishes.  </li>
            <li>My nails are nice and firm, very shiny and my manicure now lasts about a week.</li>
            <li>But I definitely got longer wear from my old top coat.</li>
            <li>This polish does dry super quick.  </li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s like any regular old top coat.</li>
            <li>Not to mention it helped dry everything super quick</li>
            <li>I am even able to intricately and properly do my 12yr old&#x27;s nails</li>
            <li>There is some small smearing, but not NEARLY as bad as big brand top coats, as in the kind in the makeup isle at your local grocery store.</li>
            <li>I like thick topcoats a lot because I find that they are longer-lasting and provide superior shine.</li>
            <li>Good to note that it is is a thick polish and needs to be spread evenly (you can see drastic differences or if you missed a spot).</li>
            <li>So, this is my hope for Seche Vite, I can paint my nails and have it last a good 5 days before I have to look down and think \\&quot;Hot mess!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>The brush pulled the colored polish right off my nail, unbeknownst to me, and tainted the entire bottle when I dipped the brush back in for more.</li>
            <li>it beats other top coats ive tried and loved, like out the door and hard as nails..</li>
            <li>Wow!!!  </li>
            <li>Normally when I put on a top coat it takes forever to dry</li>
            <li>The only real benefit it has is the quick dry time, but I feel as though that quickness could be achieved with another fast drying top coat.</li>
            <li>This top coat has a strong bad smell, doesn&#x27;t go on smooth, and chips off quickly.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new, so this was the first one.</li>
            <li>I am pretty hard on my nails , but I&#x27;ve had cheap clear polish hold better than that.</li>
            <li>Dries much quicker than any other top coat I have ever used.</li>
            <li>My other fast drying top coats have now been demoted to doing pedicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes the polish shiny and stay much longer than other top coats.</li>
            <li>It is really shiny and does not interfere with the polish underneath as you apply it (some other top coats streak the nail color that they&#x27;re being applied to).</li>
            <li>i was used to painting my nails every other day, mostly because they start chipping, but this preserves it for much longer.</li>
            <li>Apparently you should not use if you are pregnant or want to have kids.</li>
            <li>Unlike other fast drying top coats though it does not chip.</li>
            <li>It really does dries your nails quicker than any other top coat polish out there.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite, however, has provided a much clearer and glossier finish than any other top coat I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>makes your polish last super super super long.</li>
            <li>it chipped the same day, it literally lasted as long as the cheap $1 clear top coat.</li>
            <li>Whether you are looking for quick dry (it sure does dry fast!)</li>
            <li>The only fast dry top coat I use!</li>
            <li>After all the&amp;#34;hype&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve heard about this particular Seche product,I expected more.</li>
            <li>Gives a fabulous gel like shine and dries hard SUPER FAST!!</li>
            <li>Seche Vite, while completely unpronounceable, forms this amazing hard shell over your nails and dries super fast.</li>
            <li>The formula and brush make it very easy to apply and it definitely helps make my polish last longer.</li>
            <li>its durable and shiny but dries faster than any other top coat without leaving the polish layers mushy underneath.</li>
            <li>other top coats try to imitate it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure which polish is improving the longevity more, but everything put together is working!</li>
            <li>The clerk at Sally Beauty Supply gave me a tip; always use a top coat or your polish will peel off in one sheet (as other reviewers have mentioned.)  </li>
            <li>The first thing you will notice when you open the bottle is the odor - it is overwhelming and gives me a headache after only moments.</li>
            <li>usually do two coats of my polish and wait about a minute or more to apply the top coat, after about 2 minutes its not longer tacky to the touch, but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest you start playing with rocks just yet, however, you can go about your day with some caution for the following 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t afford manis/pedis more than about once per year, but I&#x27;m extremely picky when it comes to DIY nail polish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;mmoving on to other top coats.  </li>
            <li>I originally gave this only 1 star.  </li>
            <li>and that gets it back to its original form.</li>
            <li>I change mine about every other day and this top coat holds up well for 2 days and then begins to chip away.</li>
            <li>reason I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because it definitely does not stop chipping, which is the reason I originally purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other night I finished painting my nails and had about 10-15 minutes to go until I needed to go to bed, and with this product that was able to happen.</li>
            <li>After awhile of letting the layers of polish set, I won&#x27;t even get dents in my nails if I touch something (which always happens with other top coats).</li>
            <li>and I tried a couple other top coats but each time I used it my nails would end up with a smudge or</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found any other top coat out there yet that self-levels the way Seche Vite does.  </li>
            <li>Also it will not smear nail art like other top coats...</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t get any other top coat after using this one.</li>
            <li>I do not put any other top coat on my nails anymore.</li>
            <li>A problem I&#x27;ve had with other top coats is that when my nails are bent, the nail polish will loosen and chip.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it gets goopy, but any nail polish thinner (I use Beauty Secrets) should restore it to its original consistency.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other top coats and this one works wonders, staying on for days and fighting to protect your nails from the world.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had only a couple of instances where use of this topcoat has not resulted in significant peeling.  </li>
            <li>I would never consider any other top coat after using this.  </li>
            <li>It kicks all other top coats to the curb.</li>
            <li>the price is way better than any other online site.</li>
            <li>I keep trying other topcoats but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>and and I have already disposed of all other top coats in my house.  </li>
            <li>Dries quicker than any other top coat I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>A lot of the other top coats I have tried would smudge my nail art/designs</li>
            <li>I used to have other top coats</li>
            <li>I normally take this off before it begins to wear!</li>
            <li>They also stay shinier longer than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>and after i applied it my nails were noticeably dryer than they had been with other top coats.</li>
            <li>My nailpolish no longer chips as much as other top coats.</li>
            <li>My polish usually lasts about 5 days without any chipping...and that is a pretty long time to me as I have used other top coats and experienced chipping within a day.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t wake up with waffle nails which was my struggle with all my other top coats!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It just seems to work better than all the other ones, and a lot of salons use it.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d recommend using Seche Restore which provides the ingredients that have evaporated from the bottle over time to get it back to its original consistency.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, the next time I purchased a bottle it was received in an original box that stated \\&quot;BIRTH DEFECTS AND REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES\\</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a lot better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>/&gt;Incidentally, the other top coat I use when taking a Seche Vite vacation is Revlon.  </li>
            <li>I applied a second coat for more protection and shine several days after the first with no problems.  </li>
            <li>It provides a high gloss finish with extremely fast drying and really seals in your polish with just one coat.</li>
            <li>Love this clear polish, it really does dry incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>Dries very quick and lasts long!</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t even know it was possible for top coats to dry so fast!), and leaves your nails really shiny (which is nice because it helps to camouflage little imperfections).</li>
            <li>the edges lift and literally the entire coat of polish will peel clean off.  </li>
            <li>Worth more than the small price.</li>
            <li>Only drawback is that it&#x27;s not big 3 free, so I won&#x27;t be using it while pregnant.</li>
            <li>I wondered why it looked so much better and lasted so long when I got a professional pedicure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how long my  manicures last!</li>
            <li>I love this clear polish it makes it dry fast</li>
            <li>it really does dry your nails quickly!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a top coat that can make my nails last more than a couple days without chipping... and after trying several complete failures, I&#x27;ve finally found it.</li>
            <li>It does dry very quickly.</li>
            <li>This top coat saves you fifteen minutes worth of dry time and only takes 30 seconds to a minute.</li>
            <li>Dries really fast, always goes on smooth and shiny, doesn&#x27;t chip for a long time.</li>
            <li>They dried super quick!</li>
            <li>It does have a strong odor during application that I don&#x27;t notice when dry.</li>
            <li>Love how it drys super fast and don&#x27;t have to wait for my nails that long to dry.</li>
            <li>This is a nice lasting top coat and it does dry faster than the other brands I&#x27;d</li>
            <li>It provides a great shiny top coat which brings alive any nail polish color and helps it to dry super quick...even with dark tones of nail polish which usually take longer.</li>
            <li>It gives polish a high gloss finish and it&#x27;s very durable.</li>
            <li>It is thick and has a strong odor, but I am sure that odor comes from the chemical that allows it to dry so quickly.</li>
            <li>Makes my nails look like I got a professional manicure and dries very fast.</li>
            <li>While it will take several days more before I can comment on Chip resistance, let me just say that this is much shinier than any other fast drying top coat I have tried, and the equal of some high gloss coats.</li>
            <li>(if you bump a nail, you make mess it up, but if it&#x27;s a light bump, it evens itself out pretty well!</li>
            <li>It really does dry super fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the fault of the OPI polish and not this top coat, seeing as the other brands/colors last a long time.    </li>
            <li>This really does dry SUPER FAST!  </li>
            <li>Goes on thick but smooth and clean crisp finish.</li>
            <li>It dries nail color quickly, however, it does dry pretty fast when exposed to air.</li>
            <li>Dries super quickly, but when I use it just directly on my nails, it turns a strange color brown at the ends after a day or two.</li>
            <li>Amazing, dried my newly painted nails in about 3-5min.  </li>
            <li>However, 5 days later it literally peels right off the nail, along with the nail polish underneath it!  </li>
            <li>My only very minor complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t dry with that awesome glassy look that some top coats have</li>
            <li>It dries super fast and solid!</li>
            <li>The only thing I will say is that if you are sensitive to the strong scent of nail polish, do NOT order this product.</li>
            <li>Within 2-3 minutes, my nail polish is completely dry and I am able to do something as touch sensitive as moving clothes from the washer to the dryer.</li>
            <li>Drys super fast and makes my polishes last longer.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I&#x27;ve always had a peeling problem with my polish, never having had a manicure last less than a day.</li>
            <li>It definitely dries super fast</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the super thick consistancy it has</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can be a bit challenging to find in stores, so I was excited to find it on Amazon, and at about half the price we pay in the local stores.</li>
            <li>and I have my nails looking fabulous all week long.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and adds shine and protection but not for to long.</li>
            <li>as long as you get the free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I have another quick dry top coat called Jet Dry by Kiss</li>
            <li>I use various base coats, but Seche Vite is the best top coat out there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(The nail color in this photo is Hello Pretty in Sally Hansen&#x27;s Complete Salon Manicure line.)</li>
            <li>My nails have never dried so fast!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to smell</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own nails for the past year</li>
            <li>The average wear I get out of my polish with Seche Vite top coat is between 5 and 8 days before I get a chip.</li>
            <li>Nails dry super fest!</li>
            <li>It makes your nails dry so quick and leaves them looking like glass and feel like gel!</li>
            <li>This tends to make my nail polish chip/peel much faster than normal.</li>
            <li>If that doesn&#x27;t scream hazardous, not sure what else would.</li>
            <li>i did my nails just 15 min before leaving the house to go on a date and by the time i got to my destination, they were completely dry and super shiny!</li>
            <li>will note that this is a really thick top coat, so you have to make sure you cover the entire nail or else</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: While everything I wrote above remains true, I&#x27;ve encountered a problem.  </li>
            <li>However, I am just not willing to spend more than a couple dollars for a bottle of nail polish, especially when you buy so many different colors.  </li>
            <li>I have a base coat made by the same people and I have always loved it--works great.</li>
            <li>This top coat does dry very quickly even when I apply multiple coats in a short time span.  </li>
            <li>There is a trick to reducing that problem but most of us just want to polish and not worry about bowing down to a product.</li>
            <li>this stuff will dry everything up pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>You have to coat your nails pretty quickly so that the product doesn&#x27;t dry itself out.</li>
            <li>But it hardens quickly in the bottle half way full.</li>
            <li>Makes polish dry super fast!</li>
            <li>Everyone is amazed that this quick dry really works!</li>
            <li>Makes polish dry super fast!</li>
            <li>I cant wait to use it more often with other clients !</li>
            <li>I have been able to do my nails a lot more than usual because I don&#x27;t have wait forever for them dry.</li>
            <li>there is a little shrinkage, so make sure you coat the whole nail.</li>
            <li>This is my new go to top coat, I won&#x27;t be using anything other than this.</li>
            <li>this is my new topcoat!</li>
            <li>I read the other reviews and thought I had found a new top coat.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I got this the other day because I needed a new top coat.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it now that I&#x27;ve tried it!</li>
            <li>My third time purchasing this top coat, long lasting and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is very thick which works great to make your nails shine and your designs looks professional.</li>
            <li>Usually, the first place my nail polish will wear is on my thumbs, and this is the first top coat I&#x27;ve had that has stopped that completely.</li>
            <li>, it dries so fast, leaves your nails so shiny and hard, and its amazing.</li>
            <li>, it dries faster than any OPI top coat I&#x27;ve used or any other brand top coat for that matter, and over the years I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.</li>
            <li>My nails dry so fast, are super shiny, and I never get that bubbling effect that I&#x27;ve seen with other polishes and top coats.</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii and it came thru fast.</li>
            <li>This has become my go-to top coat because it dries quickly and does not create any air bubbles, which is a big trouble with other top coats.  </li>
            <li>Seche Vite top coat does go on smooth and dries very fast, but it does chip after a few days, but overall it is a better top coat than a few others that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>There are reviews on here that ask how this top coat has gotten good reviews, but I don&#x27;t understand how it got any bad reviews.  </li>
            <li>and then I am free from the bondage of waiting for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li>Super fast dry, very shiny.</li>
            <li>The first day is fine, but by the third day the polish has seem to shrunk back from the tip.  </li>
            <li>In the end I picked 4 because this stuff is magical in the sense that it dries in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>I kept hearing about this top coat as a &amp;#34;HG&amp;#34; (holy grail) product, but never bothered to pick it up because I felt obligated to finish up the previous bottle</li>
            <li>I applied the Seche Vite while my nail polish was still wet and found it absolutely EASY to apply.</li>
            <li>By a couple of days in, I&#x27;ve had half of a nail peeling off, usually more than one.  </li>
            <li>My nails started chipping at the tops slightly after a couple of days, but I like this top coat regardless.</li>
            <li>I think the OPI top coat is slightly easier to work with.</li>
            <li>I used the top coat and in less than 24 hours it began to flake off all of my nails.</li>
            <li>Did not last any longer than other top coats I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>If you go in their shops and ask to buy a top coat, this is the only one they will sell you, and the only one they will use.</li>
            <li>I have tried multiple top coats and this is always the one I go back to!  </li>
            <li>Well, it dries the outside of the polish quickly.</li>
            <li>Now you do have to be realistic with yourself.  </li>
            <li>read about this product in one of the In Style product reviews years ago and have been a steady convert since then.  </li>
            <li>I like to do my nails at home because I&#x27;m lucky enough to have a steady hand</li>
            <li>Before this I had a top coat that literally cracked and chipped my manicures like 2 days after doing them, and then finally I had enough.</li>
            <li>so they are sure to use mine not any random top coat</li>
            <li>This concerns me not so much personally for the birth defects as I am in my mid 40&#x27;s with teenagers and don&#x27;t plan on having more children.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried a top coat that dried this fast.</li>
            <li>Recently I&#x27;ve been struggling with top coats that several hours after I applied them were still developing bubbles or I would wake up the morning after doing my nails the afternoon before and discover sheets marks on my nails.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice when you have an impatient 3 and 5 year old always wanting or needing help with something.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and provides lasting shine.  </li>
            <li>I will say that while it dries fast, it will take a few minutes to &#x27;cure&#x27; the nail polish if you have many layers on.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly, provides a glossy finish, AND helps polish last longer.</li>
            <li>I have been able to stretch manicures for almost a week whereas before they would only last for a day or two.</li>
            <li>This top coat even worked better than all the fake nail dryer systems I purchased.</li>
            <li>Dries quick and makes me polish last!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different top coats.</li>
            <li>I also bought the Seche thinner which has breathed life into my older gloppy polishes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t count how many times where I have painted my nails last minute before going out and it dries instantly!</li>
            <li>and it always seemed like they were putting polish on so quick after the final coat.  </li>
            <li>I can put on three coats of polish and this top coat and ten minutes later be washing dishes or getting dressed with no worries!</li>
            <li>Oh yes.  Great as a base, or top coat or alone.  </li>
            <li>Most of the times I&#x27;ve used this have resulted in chipped manicures on the 2nd or 3rd day.</li>
            <li>but this....this is my main squeeze.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and provides just enough shine.</li>
            <li>Putting this on my OPI nail polishes definitely helps prevent my nails from chipping for about 4 extra days. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a top coat that dried this fast and the polish looks so shiny.  </li>
            <li>I am never going back to a regular top coat.</li>
            <li>The only reason this doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t stay super shiny for longer than a day or 2.  </li>
            <li>only that part chips off quickly.  </li>
            <li>While I love the way that it makes my nails look, it&#x27;s useless when the top coat peels off (along with the nail polish underneath) over the course of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and provides a lasting glossy shine.</li>
            <li>This is the only top coat I have used for the last two years.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase this again in the future. :)</li>
            <li>This top coat has some big pros, and some big cons for me.</li>
            <li>Now I haven&#x27;t tried any OPI top coats, heard they do well, but they are even more expensive, so I didn&#x27;t try it yet.</li>
            <li>Dries really quick and keeps the shine for several days.</li>
            <li>so quick i do not mind doing the regular manicure!!!</li>
            <li>Ill be buying more for sure.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While the product does dry my nails super fast and make them shiny, I would have to touch them up repeatedly starting on the second or third day to keep them looking good.  </li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as this top coat, my manicure will last much longer.  </li>
            <li>Makes my home manicures last longer than any other top coat I have ever used before!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too expensive when purchased online, so overall I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I use this top coat with the gelous base coat and its great.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and leaves a lasting shine that looks like you stepped out of a nail salon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This will definitely be the only top coat I ever use again</li>
            <li>i think this chips a decent amount.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying I wasn&#x27;t doing anything wrong, but I sure as hell wasn&#x27;t able to figure out what it was, try as I might.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only use this top coat for the last 4 years!</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, however, starts chipping either the very same day when applied or the day after.</li>
            <li>I am guessing because it dries so quick that when it is open</li>
            <li>The next time I tried it, with a different nail polish, I alternated between applying color and this top coat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the longest time I&#x27;ve been trying to find a top coat that worked well and dried fast.</li>
            <li>stuff dries fairly quickly, but isn&#x27;t INSTANT.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Strong smell, STRONG smell&lt;br /&gt;Takes longer on wet polish</li>
            <li>This has the expected strong polish scent so no surprises there.</li>
            <li>It has a strong chemical smell, which is to be expected considering the ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong (and no I am not pregnant or overly sensitive to smells).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Butyl Acetate (main ingredient)  can also be narcotic in high concentrations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very glossy clear coat/top coat!</li>
            <li>I was recommended this top coat instead of the more expensive one I normally buy.  </li>
            <li>I have a very busy life and can&#x27;t sit around waiting for polish to dry--this has been a lifesaver!</li>
            <li>I use has the exact same smell, so this really didn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li>the whole coat peeled right off, the same evening.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pretty strong and my manicure did chip after a few days.  </li>
            <li>So, be sure to tightly cap it after every use, and be prepared for it to thicken up.</li>
            <li>I make sure to screw the cap on tightly as a result, this seems to help.</li>
            <li>It makes your polish dry to the touch quickly and is better than any other one that I have tried.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>High shine, even over matte polish&lt;br /&gt;Dries</li>
            <li>So...I won&#x27;t be getting any additional bottles of Sache Vite and will continue to look for a product which leaves nail with a high shine.</li>
            <li>Also leaves a high shine and smoothes any nicks, bubbles, or blemishes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>

            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>also it seems to yellow very fast with light colors like white and light pink, and also alters the color of my nude polish after a day or so.</li>
            <li>Nails still chip after 2 or 3 days, and the high gloss finish isnt as glossy as the company would like you to believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I experienced.&lt;br /&gt;- Has a high glass shine.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>After using Miracle Shine for a year, this polish has a faster drying period, high gloss, and longevity.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>The nail technicians speak highly of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>But you are not getting the highly glossy look probably at that expense.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>On balance, it&#x27;s still worth it because my nails still look nice and air bubble free for at least a few days.  </li>
            <li>It is better than &amp;#34;out the door&amp;#34; and just about any other clear coat, however.  </li>
            <li>thing that is clear is that one&#x27;s nail structure and products used with Seche can play a big role in how well it will work for you - it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>I was able to smooth onto nails while still wet, less than 1 minute after application.  </li>
            <li>As my others run out, this will replace all my other clear top coats.</li>
            <li>It does dry really fast, but it doesn&#x27;t last for many days ..</li>
            <li>I would love to see this have a flat brush instead of the standard.</li>
            <li>With this dry fast top coat i can get to my daily routine without smudged nails.</li>
            <li>I have NEVER had a fast dry top coat that actually worked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you don&#x27;t need your manicure to last more than 4 days and want your nails to dry fast, this works.</li>
            <li>used to love this for the fast dry time, but ultimately I don&#x27;t think it outweighs the cons.</li>
            <li>Now, for those of you girly gals that don&#x27;t dig chemicals I believe Seche Vite (regular fast dry top coat) has Formaldehyde in it and for those ladies who don&#x27;t care (like myself)</li>
            <li>Makes polish dry really quickly and very high gloss shine.  </li>
            <li>But lucky for me I found this little gem, and now I only have to wait a few minutes regardless of how many coats are beneath this top coat.</li>
            <li>but then I put Seche Vite over it and it fixed the smudges!!</li>
            <li>for a little while I thought I found my Holy Grail top coat...</li>
            <li>Wet n Wild&#x27;s 99cent topcoat actually does a better job preserving a manicure!</li>
            <li>The top coat may get a little scratched on the surface</li>
            <li>When I first used this, I decided to use it on only one hand, and use my inexpensive drug store top coat on the other.  </li>
            <li>It makes toenail polish last for several weeks, and makes it look so much more professional!</li>
            <li>It costs a little more at stores like riteaid or cvs...</li>
            <li>I also love that it fills in any little bumps or ridges that might have formed with the color polish.</li>
            <li>Despite the fact the OPI top coats created little bubbles on my nails.</li>
            <li>I did remove a star because I noticed a little &amp;#34;shrinkage&amp;#34;, i.e. the nail color pulling away from my edges and cuticles as the top coat dries.</li>
            <li>Lasts two weeks, makes your nails look like they were professionally done!!</li>
            <li>heard about this stuff on Pinterest and WOW!!</li>
            <li>Also when painting your nails with this top coat make sure to not be a messy, ie getting polish all over, that&#x27;ll mess up your manicure as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you want your nails to dry super fast with no smudges</li>
            <li>Super fast dry.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does dry super fast, BUT</li>
            <li>Even when my color is not dry yet I can use this top coat and my nails are dry in seconds.</li>
            <li>So I would recommend this if you need to make your nails dry very quickly, AND you like re-polishing your nails quite frequently.</li>
            <li>Nails are dry super fast.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t hurt that it does dry super fast.</li>
            <li>Dry super fast.</li>
            <li>My nails dry super fast and they look like glass.</li>
            <li>Nails shine, and dried super quick.</li>
            <li>drying time is unreal, super fast, and super slick.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s kind of hard to get off with polish remover.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have reported, it does have a strong chemical-ly smell, but</li>
            <li>Dries my nails with a nice hard coat and a shine.</li>
            <li>I am have a hard time not smudging when I do my own nails</li>
            <li>am not a professional manicurist so, maybe there are special ways of using this product?&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, will not buy again..</li>
            <li>I normally have to reapply the top coat in the middle of the weak to keep my polish looking fresh, but I only have to use this top once</li>
            <li>Not the best or worst of top coats - it does dry quickly but it doesn&#x27;t prevent chipping either - regardless of the quality of the nail color.</li>
            <li>This really does dry very fast!  </li>
            <li>For those who are encountering problems with shrinkage due to their polish being three-free, it might be a good idea to let the polish dry completely.  </li>
            <li>apply to very wet polish or it&#x27;ll peel off easily</li>
            <li>So at this point not so sure if better than other coat top polish that takes more time to dry :(</li>
            <li>so i got a little worried, but it dried quickly and created a beautiful, smooth, hard, protective layer over the color of my nail polish.</li>
            <li>I was a tad intimidated by the bad reviews here on Amazon, but I&#x27;m happy I went ahead and purchased SV anyway!</li>
            <li>The idea that it penetrates all layers of polish to make one, solid covering sounded intriguing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of glitters,shimmers,and chunky polishes in general,love the look,hate the rough finishes</li>
            <li>but hey, I can deal with that if I&#x27;m not forced to sit around and wait an hour for my touch up to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>It dries fast and the clear coat is not sticky.</li>
            <li>Dries fast and makes your nails look shiny and professional.</li>
            <li>and it is not thick</li>
            <li>Fast drying, clear.</li>
            <li>Pros: very shiny, professional looking finish.</li>
            <li>Works very well, but if you are sensitive to smells at all, skip it.  </li>
            <li>Has a weird smell but works great</li>
            <li>It dries to a gel-like clear, polished, protective finish very rapidly.</li>
            <li>Great price on amazon though, can&#x27;t go wrong there.</li>
            <li>It really dries completely within 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic for a quick dry, it lets my nails dry with in 20 minutes</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many coats below (three at MOST, and only with a thin polish)</li>
            <li>I will say that it seemed to preserve my polish a few days more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard about this top coat from an Ulta employee but just thought it would be a waste of money.  </li>
            <li>Shiny nails and super fast dry!</li>
            <li>I first heard of it from every nailpolish blogger ever (thanks, pinterest - who knew such things existed??)...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably the most impatient person to ever give nail art a try.</li>
            <li>It does have a kind of strange smell, but for the end result, I absolutely do not mind.</li>
            <li>Most polishes have the scent for a few hours, but this scent disappears in minutes.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, this polish is inexpensive enough to always have a fresh bottle for a truly miraculous home-polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t post stuff like this</li>
            <li>It led not just to the chipping of polish, but to my fingernails breaking, unevenly, along the top.</li>
            <li>My nails grow pretty fast but after using this product, my nails tke 10 years (not literally) to grow back!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t listen to the low ratings it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using the Seche Vite, I thought it was just going to be what I used years ago, I only wear top coats on dark nail polish.</li>
            <li>I paint my nails with the color of my choice and let it sit for a few minutes then place the top coat on and wait 20 minutes</li>
            <li>Peels off after normal wear in one day.</li>
            <li>so idk if that is normal.</li>
            <li>I normally can&#x27;t go for even a day without my manicure chipping.  </li>
            <li>I find that this top coat dries in a matter of a few minutes.</li>
            <li>which is actually a few dollars more than this.</li>
            <li>So I asked a few friends for suggestions and a friend recommended that I used Seche Vite as my top coat.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a few more bottles just to have on hand.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway I decided to do a fresh mani with Brucci Gianna&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Blue.</li>
            <li>I had this top coat a long time ago but only used it a couple of times before my sister took it.</li>
            <li>I find that my non-smelling top coats last as long if not longer than this one.</li>
            <li>, you can apply it on top of wet nails and it will suck the moisture of the layers of nail polish below it so all of your nails dries within that time :O</li>
            <li>Also, after a day or so of normal wear</li>
            <li>and I use to make my manicures last longer---sometimes as long as 2 weeks---way better than even using nail gels.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;However, the rumors about it completely peeling off an entire nail are true.</li>
            <li>I have never had a top coat that dried within the 5 minutes that I applied it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; a few of them to friends who love it after trying it from me.</li>
            <li>The extra coats I use revive the manicure so it looks fresh again.</li>
            <li>I cycled through so many brands of polish and top coats, always ending up with the same frustrating dents and marks.</li>
            <li>Long lasting top coat in centuries.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product for anyone that wants pretty nails</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t leave reviews but for this I had to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally use this with China Glaze polish</li>
            <li>A few days after I get my nails done, I paint this top coat over my nails and it helps prevent my nails from chipping.</li>
            <li>Essie Good to Go does everything this claims to do (if not better) and actually lasts and can be re applied.</li>
            <li>Although it goes on as a nice thick protective coat and is shinny, salon quality, it started peeling alot sooner</li>
            <li>It also gives it a nice, thick gloss</li>
            <li>The stuff does dry very fast and its cheap, which makes up for the vile smell that comes from that tiny bottle.</li>
            <li>I am hard on my nails and not patient enough to wait for them to dry completely before going on with my day, so this product is perfect for</li>
            <li>I am a new fan and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>2 diaper changes and a couple tantrums later (literally 5 minutes after I painted my nails), my nails were still smooth and fresh and as dry as a 3 day old manicure.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this stuff is magic, I&#x27;ll never use another topcoat polish ever again!</li>
            <li>and I was very excited to find it online for much cheaper than the usual $10</li>
            <li>It really does dry really fast and leaves my nail looking very shiny!</li>
            <li>I bought Seche Restore to deal w/this problem, but IMO the formula is never the same as when the bottle is new &amp; fresh.)  </li>
            <li>When I smelled the polish itself, it had a too strong odor that most fake polishes have.</li>
            <li>Nail polish and top coat dry within 5 minutes of application, and nail colors last longer without chipping!</li>
            <li>It also tends to dry only the top layer, often crumpling the under-layers of polish.</li>
            <li>Now with this I only wait 30 mins to make sure its really dry</li>
            <li>This top coat is a miracle your nails get dry within minutes even if you have several coats of polish!</li>
            <li>now, I&#x27;m still looking for a toluene free, less stinky alternative that dries my nails fast</li>
            <li>Dried very quickly, used over nail polish and put a real shine on my nails.  </li>
            <li>If you use it over dry polish, it&#x27;s much more likely to peel up.</li>
            <li>I love how I can layer this over a not yet dry second coat of nail polish!</li>
            <li>This top coat, named \\&quot;Dry fast\\&quot; in French, does what it says it will.  </li>
            <li>Goes on thick and smooth and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>and I usually have pretty strong nails...</li>
            <li>and i really dont see myself going back to any other top coat ive used.</li>
            <li>As for protecting the nail polish and keeping the color on, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be more durable than other top coats, at least for my nails.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t worn it long enough to know if it chips/lasts, but I&#x27;m pleased just with the quick dry time.</li>
            <li>if it doesn&#x27;t peel off right away by the next day it will.</li>
            <li>use my mask right now, and I will probably stop using this product because my mind is not totally at peace with it yet..</li>
            <li>I did this to test it and managed to severely smudge the tips of two of my fingers (right pointer and left thumb).  </li>
            <li>I put it on right after I put several coats of everything before</li>
            <li>This stuff caused every manicure I used it on to peel right off in one big piece within a day or two, almost like plasti dip for cars.</li>
            <li>Yes, it smells but the high gloss and quick dry make up for it.</li>
            <li>What I love the most is that the product is dry and hard within 15 minutes!   </li>
            <li>This is the only top coat that at least somehow prevents my nail polish from chipping the first day, and the only one that goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>time just isn&#x27;t as long as needed for a quick polish.</li>
            <li>I use to have to reapply every other day after cleaning and washing dishes but with this top coat I am going on 2 weeks and my nail polish has barely chipped, keep in mind</li>
            <li>It peels the whole polish in a matter of days, if not less.</li>
            <li>This is probably the Cadillac of top coats, but I probably would not have bought it if I knew that it &amp;#34;contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause birth defects and other reproductive harm.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m not looking to have a baby, but I will look for a less toxic formula for my next top coat purchase.</li>
            <li>It does take longer to dry than you&#x27;d expect from a fast dry top coat though.</li>
            <li>I put this over a new coat of polish last night right before bedtime</li>
            <li>but unfortunately it did nothing special for me and has a VERY strong smell.</li>
            <li>This top coat dried very fast and helped my manicure last longer.</li>
            <li>I am nail polish obsessed and have at least 5 different top coats, this one is without a doubt the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Dries extremely fast, and if you nail polish is still a little sticky the top coat will still dry fast!</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not quite as long as a typical gel manicure, the price and quick drying time easily makes up for it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my manicure last any longer or make my nails shine any brighter, so it&#x27;s really just an average top coat</li>
            <li>I have been using Seche Vite for several years, and within those years I have tried other top coats, you know, to see if I can find a top coat a little cheaper, and like they say, you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li>importantly, there is a warning label on the bottle saying that &amp;#34;this product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.</li>
            <li>All of these can be tough on a manicure, but I&#x27;d still expect more than a days worth of wear.</li>
            <li>I am new to this nail care stuff.</li>
            <li>How did I live 23 years without this?</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll live.</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Works like new after adding some nail polish thinner.</li>
            <li>Keeps my mani&#x27;s shiny for 3-4 days, then I apply a new coat</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s brand new again.</li>
            <li>But for the price, I don&#x27;t mind purchasing a new bottle.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>I am new to the world of nail art stamping, and anyone that makes rounds on youtube will tell you that this topcoat is all the rage.</li>
            <li>I sometimes reapply after a week to get that shiny, newly manicured look.</li>
            <li>I found that these do not chip (if you&#x27;re using a brand new bottle) but will eventually after a longer period of time.</li>
            <li>So, I needed a new one.</li>
            <li>It is fixable with the polish refresher (another $10), but I don&#x27;t feel like I should have to do that with a brand new bottle.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I had no way to get it where I live.  </li>
            <li>This top coat dries fast and hard and won&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be aware that it will dry out after a few months and become thicker and harder to use, though it will still dry perfectly even when it&#x27;s started to thicken up.</li>
            <li>Can be found for a reasonable price if you know where to look - online and small shops tend to be much more realistic than major retailers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the only thing that is kind of annoying is that the topcoat get a little gloopy after a while so make sure you have a good nail thinner to go with it</li>
            <li>This stuff is super shiney, and stays on for a long time!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never created such a great manicure with any other topcoat, in such a short time.</li>
            <li>This helps regular nail polish dry much faster and helps smooth out the tops.</li>
            <li>Dries SO fast and chip free for a few days.</li>
            <li>But the thinner they sell as this does dry out quickly.  </li>
            <li>When I saw the massive number of 5 star reviews for Seche, I ordered a bottle expecting it to be at least as good as the Sally Hansen topcoat.</li>
            <li>For starters, it goes on extremely thick, so you have to make sure that don&#x27;t pick up too much on the brush.</li>
            <li>It drys quickly, so there&#x27;s no accidental oopsies while waiting for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li>Because of the toluene Seche Vite simply does not work with Big 3 Free polishes.</li>
            <li>It dries (enough to touch without smudging) within a minute, and with a smooth, glossy finish that I didn&#x27;t even know was physically possible for nail polish to have.</li>
            <li>It also makes your nails dry quick.</li>
            <li>I love that it only takes like 5 to 10 mins to dry completely</li>
            <li>It is really thick and while putting it on I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be smooth when dry.  </li>
            <li>Makes nail polish dry quickly.</li>
            <li>Ive been looking for a quick way to dry my nails for about a year.  </li>
            <li>its simply amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;Paint a coat on and it not only looks like you have had your nails gel painted, but it dries super fast even when you put on a couple coats of a polish under it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does dry incredibly quickly.</li>
            <li>I always apply this in a super ventilated area such as outside my home haha.</li>
            <li>But since it dried super fast, I really don&#x27;t mind redoing the nail over.</li>
            <li>It dry&#x27;s fairly quickly</li>
            <li>Makes your nails dry quickly which it was</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and glossy, tacking within a minute of application and drying in the next few minutes afterwards.</li>
            <li>Always does the job when you need your polish to dry quick.</li>
            <li>when I did it, I have Seche Vite to make it dry quickly.</li>
            <li>love that i can do my nails and not spend a day being extra careful not to smear it.</li>
            <li>This is a quick way to get your nails dry if you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li>This top coat would definitely work well for busy moms who don&#x27;t have the luxury of waiting for their nails to dry.</li>
            <li>It definitely keeps my polish looking better for longer with minimal chipping.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to using this because I need quick dry</li>
            <li>It has a smooth and glossy finish, and I can actually use my nails to unbutton my jeans to pee within ten minutes of applying it</li>
            <li>Nails are super shiny, and dry in 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>I used to use the Essie Quick Dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry quickly at all.</li>
            <li>I generally use higher end polishes like Butter London, OPI, China Glaze, Zoya, and others, but have a busy schedule that makes doing my nails a trial without quickdry topcoat.  </li>
            <li>I used drying drops on these, so I cannot say how quickly it would dry without that.</li>
            <li>Even if my color application is messy this top coat makes it shine and look professional.  </li>
            <li>No matter what type of polish I use under this top coat (whether it&#x27;s cheap or expensive)</li>
            <li>They then get completely dry quickly, which otherwise takes hours, for those of us who have woken up with blanket weave marks in our nail polish.</li>
            <li>It makes your nails super shiny and within minutes they are dry.</li>
            <li>It came earlier than expected and it is a phenomenal product.</li>
            <li>quick dry, and</li>
            <li>I have found that quick dry topcoats, quick dry sprays and drops, etc.</li>
            <li>Except for the quick dry thing.</li>
            <li>Except for the quick dry thing.</li>
            <li>This top coat was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li>It does help dry nails quickly.</li>
            <li>Definitely put on the top coat when your polish is wet</li>
            <li>Dry&#x27;s quickly &amp; durable.</li>
            <li>and it helps dry your nails quickly meaning NO SMUDGES.</li>
            <li>A thin coat dries quickly (about 3 minutes) and has such a nice, shiny finish.</li>
            <li>I love that it dries fast and thick.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The brand&#x27;s base coat is not as good as the top coat though.</li>
            <li>The Seche Vite Dry Fast really works and keeps my nails looking great for at least a week!!</li>
            <li>Goes on really thick and smells very strongly of chemicals.</li>
            <li>No other topcoat has really worked for me like this one has.</li>
            <li>It dries insanely fast and gives a shiny, glossy finish like no other.  </li>
            <li>The pros: it is pretty glossy (although not really any glossier than any other top coat I have used).</li>
            <li>It dries in about 10 mins flat, meaning that I can paint my nails right before bed and not worry about ruining my nails.</li>
            <li>It makes any polish look professional and high gloss.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting this product directly FROM AMAZON.</li>
            <li>I am very busy at home and had nail polish chip on me day 2.</li>
            <li>This dries very fast but my nail polish bubbled and peeled or chipped the next day.</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was interested in the Sache Vite (or some product) for shine and not necessarily for a quick dry.  </li>
            <li>This makes multiple coats of polish dry super fast!</li>
            <li>In fact I think just plain old Sally Hansen is better.      </li>
            <li>This product is amazing plain and simple.</li>
            <li>Works better than expected !!!!</li>
            <li>I will never go back to any other brand, this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>FAST DRY for real!</li>
            <li>I tried it on myself today and it does dry pretty fast.</li>
            <li>how long I let the polish dry before applying the top coat.</li>
            <li>My nails dried super fast in 5 minutes and shiny too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Third, it dried pretty darn quick.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve previously used Essie Good to Go quick dry topcoat and SV is definitely a step up when it comes to dry time and high shine finish.</li>
            <li>BUY ANY OTHER DRY FAST TOP COAT.</li>
            <li>I have used other brands of fast dry top coats for years</li>
            <li>There are endless raves on the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat, and this is just another in the pile.</li>
            <li>This would be really upsetting especially if you are trying really hard to make it look nice.</li>
            <li>It really does dry faster than any other top coat I&#x27;ve ever tried, has longer hold, goes on smoother, and shines like no</li>
            <li>It dries superbly fast and will even dry your old nail polish! ;)</li>
            <li>what i like about this dry fast top is it doesnt decrease the number of days the polish stays on like some other ones i noticed do.</li>
            <li>It definitely dries faster than most other top coats I&#x27;ve tried, but I&#x27;m still having tons of smudging, even after I let my nails dry for a LONG time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it was my initial coverage not being as thick with the polish colors, the top coat, or perhaps these nails were more dry when I used the top coat.</li>
            <li>My nails usually chip the first day I paint them, and with this topcoat they last a good 3 days before a single chip.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical but this stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why most don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
            <li>I usually buy this top coat at my nearby Sally&#x27;s whenever they have a BOGO sale on Seche.</li>
            <li>but I usually use Sally Hansen Diamond Strength Diamond Flash top coat</li>
            <li>I asked the clerk at my local Beauty First what she recommended</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it was such a dud the first time I tried it out of the box</li>
            <li>It took a longer that I expectec to receive my package... other than the slow shipping the product its great</li>
            <li>professionally done!  </li>
            <li>It dries any polish in minutes, and smooths most small nicks.</li>
            <li>- As soon as you&#x27;re done with your last coat of polish on your first hand, apply this top coat before you move on to applying the second coat to your other hand.  </li>
            <li>I used it over a Wet &#x27;n Wild polish that I absolutely love but that only lasts for about two days.  </li>
            <li>Makes even sub-par nail polish look professional!</li>
            <li>other day I made the mistake of using my Esse 3-way gloss top coat, and by the next morning I had bubbles and sheet marks.  </li>
            <li>and WOW DID IT!</li>
            <li>Now my manicures can even last over a week, dries my manicures fast, intensifies the color, smooths the surface, protects from chipping and shines so radiantly!</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd purchase of this bottle &amp; i havent even finished my first bottle yet.</li>
            <li>This far exceeds my expectations!  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll recommend this product to anyone whos interested especially people that do nails.</li>
            <li>I like to layer my nails to get a shading look from dark to light</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>Another quick-dry top coat to add to my usual lineup.</li>
            <li>It makes my nails slick and shiny :)</li>
            <li>I applied it over wet nail polish (thickly to avoid touching the polish beneath), and capped the free edge.  </li>
            <li>makes polish QUICK DRY!</li>
            <li>It gets thicker and gloopier over time, and it generally only lasts two or three days without pealing away, but it is SO worth it because of the shine and, really, because it dries practically instantly.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that I&#x27;ve noticed that my polish cracks sooner than if I had used regular top coat, like after 3 days as opposed to 5 days with regular.</li>
            <li>I also always keep Seche Vite around for occasional use when I&#x27;m in the mood for super-killer shine &amp; am willing to tolerate the shrinkage.</li>
            <li>I usually go to bed and wake up with creases on my nails after an hour of drying with Sally Hansen, OPI, etc., but not this Seche Vite Top Coat.</li>
            <li>I notice a difference when I don&#x27;t use this - even when I get my nails professionally done!</li>
            <li>After using this product for the first time, I&#x27;m hooked and currently searching nail polish colors online!</li>
            <li>Yeah, well those marks become a thing of the past when you use this top coat.</li>
            <li>This product goes above and beyond any other top coat I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>It DOES dry fast; very quickly your nails are dry to the touch.  </li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re surprised that I DIY it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get over how quickly these dry my nails!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I’ve tried the top coat without the base coat and though it still looks great, I’m convinced the base+top coat combo is the key.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t use top coats that often</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if this is a phenomenon of all top coats, or if it&#x27;s reacting with the nail polish that I use.</li>
            <li>HECK YES!&lt;br /&gt;Shipped a day early too!</li>
            <li>I found that Seche has a higher tendency to lift polish than others I have tried, even with proper application.  </li>
            <li>I found that Seche has a higher tendency to lift polish than others I have tried, even with proper application.  </li>
            <li>I am in healthcare and wash my hands non-stop and with this polish and a great base coat, my nails can last for more than 1 week.</li>
            <li>My nails also last 2-3 times longer than they do with any other top coat.</li>
            <li>There are other top coats out there that can do the same things but may be safer.</li>
            <li>I painted my nails with two coats of polish, waited about a minute, no more than that for sure and then applied Seche Vite.  </li>
            <li>Overall,it&#x27;s a fine topcoat that i got for like half price.</li>
            <li>Just recently I got my first &amp;#</li>
            <li>The only thing i dont like is the smell but other than that i like it because it give my Esse colors a gely look and feel :)</li>
            <li>At the price of $5 and free shipping, this completely beats any other seller I have found, including target and walmart.</li>
            <li>My fave by far!</li>
            <li>This top coat is unbelievable.</li>
            <li>I will simply not use any other top coat.</li>
            <li>can usually get a week or more out of a manicure with this polish-</li>
            <li>It makes the polish pretty shiny and seems to help it last longer.</li>
            <li>A manicure isn&#x27;t a professional looking one without this stuff!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle of Seche Vite at Target and painted my nails only once with it.</li>
            <li>I have finally found a product that I can use that drys fast and wont chip!</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, if you are reading reviews of top coats / fast drying products, don&#x27;t waste another second.</li>
            <li>well only one word very good top base and protect and dry fast  </li>
            <li>Clear and will not dull color.</li>
            <li>It does smell a little strong</li>
            <li>The smell is a little bit strong though so beware of that, however once it dries it doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like nail polish though, the scent is a little strong.</li>
            <li>Has a little strong smell, so try not to inhale that.</li>
            <li>My nails were dry by 1 minute and even when I did 2 coats on one nail and did a thicker coat on another, it still was dry by 1 minute * 1 minute 12 seconds at the most</li>
            <li>Super shiny and makes ur life less of a hassle really</li>
            <li>It allows the polish to dry quickly and chipping is nearly non existent.  </li>
            <li>This quick dry is a life saver for a busy girl and mom.</li>
            <li>Out the Door may feel dry on top, yet not be totally dry underneath.</li>
            <li>So my old standby is the Sally Hansen quick dry topcoat in the reddish orangish bottle.  </li>
            <li>is long lasting and is super affordable!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it will not dry quickly and will soften the polish enough to make it &amp;#34;move&amp;#34; and smudge if you touch or rub up against something.</li>
            <li>It dries SUPER SUPER FAST, very hard</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t just dry the top coat of you polish like most other products, it seeps into the bottom and dries all the polish in just a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does dry to the touch pretty fast, but is still soft for 30 min or so.</li>
            <li>it dries my polish fast and it leaves my nails super shiny and helps my polish last a long time.</li>
            <li>Works well and fast, but has a strong lasting odor and if you get your fingers near your mouth they taste very, very bitter.</li>
            <li>Ok so I&#x27;m a very impatient person.</li>
            <li>For $5 a bottle, it lasted longer the high end stuff, the shine was gorgeous and the application wasn&#x27;t as difficult as some said it would be.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s back to conventional top coats.</li>
            <li>With the Seche Vite, I&#x27;ve been able to change a diaper or put my toddler in his carseat 5 - 10 minutes after applying it without ruining my polish job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, and this is something I&#x27;ve never experienced with other top coats I&#x27;ve tried...</li>
            <li>In under a minute, the top coat was completely dry--and with very little smell, either.</li>
            <li>product will thicken up quite quickly if you leave the cap off or loose, so don&#x27;t do that!</li>
            <li>It dries super fast and holds tight, securing your manicure in a matter of a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard and I think I&#x27;ve finally found my new top coat!</li>
            <li>While a cheap top coat leaves your nails shiny, it doesn&#x27;t last very long, and your nails usually start chipping within two days.</li>
            <li>This top coat makes my nails last well throughout the week, and only when i cook and clean extensively do the nails chip slightly.</li>
            <li>Aside from that advice enjoy the LONG lasting shine and colour</li>
            <li>Dried polish very quickly.</li>
            <li>Does not dry fast.  </li>
            <li>not only does it dry super fast</li>
            <li>Dries very quickly but tends to peel off after a few days.</li>
            <li>Especially if you are in a rush to get ready &amp; need your nails to dry quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Seche Vite Top Coat for about 3 months (the same bottle), and I change my nail polish on average about every 4 days.</li>
            <li>This actually does make your nail polish dry quickly, through all the layers!  </li>
            <li>It is a thick quick dry top coat you can apply as soon as you are done painting your nails.</li>
            <li>Not only does it dry quickly, its leaves you with shiny, polished nails that look like shellac!</li>
            <li>I either was waiting too long to apply the top coat (it should applied while polish is wet)</li>
            <li>Wow does this polish dry amazingly fast and shiny!!</li>
            <li>It dries so fast it&#x27;ll make your head spin, then to make matters inconceivably better, the finish is super hard, shiny and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>In fact it was not until the 12th or 13th day that I noticed the color was coming off from the bottom up, noticed the top down.</li>
            <li>quick dry!!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s positive reviews, however I have mixed feelings about</li>
            <li>One issue I&#x27;ve noticed is if I apply too much color polish and then try to topcoat with this I sometimes get little &amp;#34;waves&amp;#34; in my work if I accidentally touch something because the top of the layer of paint will dry quick, but the bottom will still be wet.  </li>
            <li>It made a huge mess and was embarrassing.</li>
            <li>My nails usually have a light shine to them after putting a top coat, but that shine goes away after a few hours.</li>
            <li>Pretty much as soon as you finish painting the last nail, open your Seche Vite and start applying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t read the directions and I didn&#x27;t use enough, but my nails still dried in record time, but they chipped after a day or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the directions (always important) and letting the drop form at the end of the brush before brushing it on, my nails have lasted days, even though the nail color I used is one that is notoriously flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, it dries pretty fast, but it starts peeling by the second maybe third day.</li>
            <li>If I wasn&#x27;t constantly doing dishes and cleaning, I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t chip as much, but I can usually make it through 5 or 6 days without any chips.</li>
            <li>As long as you are deliberately trying you will NOT mess up your fresh nails.  </li>
            <li>Good the first few uses then, too thick</li>
            <li>It really does live up to its claims of drying instantly.</li>
            <li>It really helped my color dry faster and did not chip as fast.  </li>
            <li>Some people say that you have to apply to wet nails, but I have always applied it to dry polish (mostly because I stamp my nails</li>
            <li>It does dry fast, but it also chips fast.</li>
            <li>My nails dry so fast and polish stays on so much longer</li>
            <li>Yep, this dry fast nail coat really works.</li>
            <li>It does look very shiny and helps dry nails fast.</li>
            <li>It does dry really fast but does NOT go on really well.  </li>
            <li>It really does dry fast and it stays looking shiny for days.  </li>
            <li>The brush brings me to my next gripe, when I opened my particular bottle, the bristles of the brush are stuck together and it sucked trying to get them apart to where they&#x27;d apply the product decently.</li>
            <li>yes my nails dried fast &amp; were super shiny.</li>
            <li>If you put on shoes to quickly your entire pedi turns into a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nail polish last for 2 weeks!!!</li>
            <li>As soon as it arrived I opened it and put a coat on my polish and it dried fast and was super shiny.</li>
            <li>I did use it once, it dried quickly but didn&#x27;t make my nails very</li>
            <li>it dries relatively quickly, gives a deep glossy finish, and protects even the cheapest nail polish, making it last 2+ weeks on my toes.  </li>
            <li>only downside that I can see is that it smells strong when wet.</li>
            <li>I am a starting out nail enthusiast, my collection is slowly growing, I am trying out new things and finding better brands for certain jobs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the kind of girl who paints her nails at least three times a week, so I rarely wear a manicure long enough for this to become an issue.</li>
            <li>it does dry right away</li>
            <li>I find that there are some minor flaws with the product, but it works better than any other brand I&#x27;ve used thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of quickly dry top coats but what makes this one different is that the brush reaches all the way to the bottom of the bottle</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s going straight into the trash, because the Seche Vite actually does the job in the promised time, and leaves my nails feeling like they were professionally done!</li>
            <li>By the time I&#x27;m done applying over my freshly painted nails... they are completely dry!</li>
            <li>Pretty much the cure to sheet marks and other evidence of improper drying.  </li>
            <li>Unlike other quick dry top coats I&#x27;ve tried, you use this while polish is still wet</li>
            <li>It drys fast, which I happen to find phenomenal because I am so impatient when it comes to waiting for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li>Let it sit for a minute, and all the polish wipes away in one simple swipe (I always use pure acetone.</li>
            <li>I would definitely continue to use and certainly recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li>But it only effects certain polishes.</li>
            <li>I need to buy the large refill bottle next time.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite applies easily and smoothly a thick durable layer that dries faster than the other fast dry top coats.</li>
            <li>All in all despite the bad smell, This is the only top coat I will ever use (except when I am using a matte top coat!).</li>
            <li>Very disappointed -- so my search for a good fast drying top coat continues.</li>
            <li>I love how thick the formula is (without being goopy) and it really does dry so much faster than other \\&quot;quick dry\\</li>
            <li>So when there was a little gift set of this top coat and a China Glaze color at my local Sally Beauty Supply...</li>
            <li>It dries your nails in like 5 minutes they are hard as rock, it doesnt matter how many layers of polish you have on.</li>
            <li>Just remember to get it on there while your nails are still super wet!</li>
            <li>Keeps the top hard and protects from scratches and smudges.</li>
            <li>It also dries for the most part in like a minute, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about ruining your hard worked nail design.</li>
            <li>It also dries the other layers of nail polish quickly</li>
            <li>I love changing colors and it will be hard to justify taking the polish off if its not chipped.  </li>
            <li>The main problem with this polish though is that is does no better than any cheap-y, generic top coat polish.</li>
            <li>And, if the color starts to look dull, I apply another top coat to shine it</li>
            <li>Other than that, still worth it, as I went on Amazon and bought another brand new bottle because I couldn&#x27;t resist.</li>
            <li>I have heard that this is a side effect of using fast drying top coat over very thickly applied polish</li>
            <li>where the other top coats I had to wait up to 30 minutes just to dry .</li>
            <li>Dries very quickly - its definitely faster than other topcoats on the market.  </li>
            <li>There are top coats from other brands that dry just as well/quickly without peeling off immediately.</li>
            <li>I was thinking that it would be $10.00 per bottle or more, but it costs about the same as my other fast dry topcoats.</li>
            <li>This topcoat dries quickly and it lasts me up to 5 days with very minimal chipping.</li>
            <li>I have also used it alone as a clear polish</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to do that because I can get it done in 20-30 minutes total with base coat, color coat, and this top coat without taking such a huge chunk of time.    </li>
            <li>It dries so fast and it CLEAR that I don’t mind taking the extra 30 seconds to throw on coat.</li>
            <li>The issue is the one I received was clearly used.</li>
            <li>the clear coat seems to pull up the polish.</li>
            <li>After all I thought it was just clear nail polish</li>
            <li>I was in need of a clear polish to apply to my nails, and this polish chips and peels after a day or two.</li>
            <li>Clear coat, not bubbles.</li>
            <li>I bought it to go over Konad nail polish while stamping, because it is a thicker clear coat and wouldn&#x27;t smudge the design.</li>
            <li>I like the outsides around my nailbeds to be clear of polish anyways</li>
            <li>so there is no color stain on Natural nails</li>
            <li>Mani last so much longer using this product.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised to find that my nail polish chips</li>
            <li>So after having done some research from reliable, credible sources, I stumbled across a few facts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keeps nail polish from chipping longer and provides professional shine that you get at the nail salon.  </li>
            <li>Manicures last much longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a busy woman.</li>
            <li>but it takes the polish completely off with it.</li>
            <li>in love with this I have to buy at least one for each of my aunts and my mom and sister ....</li>
            <li>al I can say is wow</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>wow ...</li>
            <li>I can guarantee this is NOT the case for this product, it is definitely the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Fast forward to when I finally got around to purchasing it.</li>
            <li>My polish lasts atleast 5 days at least with this top coat.</li>
            <li>and I completely agree.</li>
            <li>A few important tips.</li>
            <li>My ONLY gripe about it, is that about halfway through the bottle, it thickens almost too much to use.</li>
            <li>The only reason this gets two stars is because of how fast it dries.</li>
            <li>- completely colorless</li>
            <li>Within a few minutes I could use my hands freely without smudging my nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fidgety - meaning, of course, that my manicures are infallibly ruined within ten minutes of me finishing them.</li>
            <li>and was completely giggity over how well</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>but so far I haven&#x27;t needed to use them.  </li>
            <li>My only COMPLAINTS are that it gets goopy really fast.</li>
            <li>are never damage my designs always last thanks to this product</li>
            <li>It works incredibly fast and gives my nails an extra layer of strength.  </li>
            <li>far as durability</li>
            <li>It looks like I went to a professional manicurist when I did it by myself at home.</li>
            <li>Was already goopy and old by the time I got it.</li>
            <li>It will keep an at-home paint job for a week and dries completely in about 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>so I just completely gave up and stopped painting my nails until I found this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely sold and</li>
            <li>The polish last much longer as well.</li>
            <li>And most nail polishes stink so I don&#x27;t understand why that is even a complaint.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s all I have besides Sally Hansen top coat and at least it doesn&#x27;t shink your polish)</li>
            <li>I have saved a ton of time thanks to this stuff, and it makes painting my nails a possibility again even when I am short on time.</li>
            <li>Like an industrial chemical, believe it or not, worse than actual nail polish.</li>
            <li>Drys so fast and last for about a week for me without chipping.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the shine it leaves.</li>
            <li>Also dries completely with in 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>This has completely changed the way I do my nails and nail art.</li>
            <li>This top coat maintains my nail polish for at least a week.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works well on real nails only, but didn&#x27;t work on my gel nails.</li>
            <li>and she could instantly tell it wasn&#x27;t the real stuff.  </li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re sensitive use a well ventilated area to do your manicure.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I tear through bottles TOO fast :]</li>
            <li>It is completely indispensible to the process.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even to use nail polish remover, I can just peel it off completely without any effort.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>Plus there&#x27;s the whole controversy about the ingredients possibly causing birth defects...</li>
            <li>For those that are always on the go and don&#x27;t have time to waste, this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>the more you use it, and about halfway through the bottle it loses its quality.</li>
            <li>I have 9 month old and sometimes nap</li>
            <li>Extra shiny and fast drying.  </li>
            <li>However, for me, it still saves money going to get my nails professionally done</li>
            <li>Has completely transformed doing my nails at home.</li>
            <li>(Don&#x27;t use nail polish REMOVER, it ruins nail polish, just pick up a small bottle of thinner at your local beauty store, inexpensive and works great).</li>
            <li>As far shrinking I have noticed any.</li>
            <li>I have no idea how this polish got such a high star review!</li>
            <li>Seche dries my polish completely within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>This finish makes even an amatuer nail polisher, such as myself, look like an absolute pro.  </li>
            <li>My problem WAS polish never dried on my nails.</li>
            <li>It is professional quality and it works wonders.</li>
            <li>I had never tried this before, and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Extends the life of my manicures by a week and my pedicures by nearly a month.</li>
            <li>but it is professional polish.</li>
            <li>Makes my polish last so much longer.  </li>
            <li>My nails look professionally done (combined with OPI nail polish).  </li>
            <li>remember seeing this in the salons and thinking, wow, I should pick this up.</li>
            <li>They stay soft underneath.</li>
            <li>Wow, who invented this stuff?  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to awake with ZERO sheet lines on my nails.  </li>
            <li>It also dries fast, which is a big bonus!</li>
            <li>Mega shine is glossy but chips easily on my busy hands.  </li>
            <li>It makes the polish near the nail bed look cracked when it shrinks &amp; the tips end up looking worn.  </li>
            <li>but underneath they are still soft and u get a dent or a sheet imprint.</li>
            <li>It completely dries my nails in 10 minuntes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read so much about Seche Vite on various nail blogs</li>
            <li>Then my friends wanted to go out for late night munchies and I was able to function without screwing up my nails.</li>
            <li>This never happened with my old topcoat.</li>
            <li>Fast totally rocks.  </li>
            <li>so I can get on with my busy life.  </li>
            <li>After the color has set, but not dried completely, I apply Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>But wow.</li>
            <li>and I can be completely functional and go about my business in about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>look professionally done</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s far cheaper here.</li>
            <li>Wow..</li>
            <li>But with this product, it doesn&#x27;t even last 5 whole days before it peels off.  </li>
            <li>smoothes the surface of your nail (minor bumps go away), and it dries fast!  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind the smell as much if it smelled like regular nail polish...</li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised that the Seche Vite nails peeled like they did.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised with Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>it will completely peel off.</li>
            <li>so beware if you are sensitive.  </li>
            <li>but this one beats them all by far.</li>
            <li>I was told I may have an old polish.</li>
            <li>Wild</li>
            <li>Does get tacky if not used fast enough.</li>
            <li>It also provides professional shine that you get at the nail salon.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like it and will continue to use it, but just fyi about the shrinking polish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>People always make comments about no4 gelieving that my nails are not done professionally.</li>
            <li>It has saved all my old polishes that I was going to have to throw away</li>
            <li>With my China Glaze, they lasted for nearly two weeks without chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dries so fast and my manicure seems to last longer with it than without it.</li>
            <li>It gives my mani a professional look.  </li>
            <li>This product makes my nails look professionally done and prevent my polish from chipping for a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>Plus the shine is professional quality.</li>
            <li>but it was getting old.  </li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I received all 3 bottles of Vite very soon after order...I will buy from you in the future as well.  </li>
            <li>so far no chips</li>
            <li>You may use any polish under it and it makes even the cheapest clearance bottle of color look like a professional manicure.</li>
            <li>However, chips are pretty minor</li>
            <li>It looks glossy and professional when it dries.</li>
            <li>dries fast and  makes my nail polish last way longer !</li>
            <li>I am very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>only con is it is very smelly.  </li>
            <li>It makes my manicure last much longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a busy mom</li>
            <li>Wow, this stuff is great!&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I thought it was, but only because it dries so fast.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It was a busy day at work.</li>
            <li>OLD REVIEW:</li>
            <li>It makes your nails looks as though they were done by a professional.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that different nail polish brands used underneath it can really affect the chipping and peeling of it.</li>
            <li>and they think they look professionally done.</li>
            <li>and I never have marked up nails in the morning.  </li>
            <li>and i am usually really sensitive to smells because of my migraines, but had no problems.</li>
            <li>and I leave nearly an hour for drying--even though it isn&#x27;t needed considering this stuff dries in like 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>So far it has not chipped like before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she is far from patient-</li>
            <li>I completely regret buying this.</li>
            <li>My color was completely ruined with chips in about 16 hours.</li>
            <li>This is a bit more expensive but worth it I think.</li>
            <li>my polish never last more than a few hours on my fingers and toes</li>
            <li>people say is true, it does tend to not last long, so</li>
            <li>Then use this top coat and be all set to go a few minutes later.</li>
            <li>I bought this product a few years ago when it was recommended to me and it is the only top coat that I have bought since then.</li>
            <li>Apply it as the final top coat, wait a few minutes</li>
            <li>/&gt;Absolutely worth the five bucks I spent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Absolutely worth the five bucks I spent.  </li>
            <li>so I did not apply the Seche Vite to fresh, wet nails.</li>
            <li>hand with DL ATS topcoat had a nice subtle shine, dried just as quickly</li>
            <li>also want to add I have used this top coat while working with children and doing jobs where I&#x27;ve had to pry open drawers, and cash registers, and use harsh chemicals,</li>
            <li>In fact when you try to use your nails too quickly after applying the quick dry topcoat, you will find smudges/ridges, and your nails become messy.</li>
            <li>I had bought the OPI top coat but it turned really thick</li>
            <li>Which I love, but about halfway through the bottle, it gets thick and stringy.  </li>
            <li>it sounds scary, but it&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this polish works best without a base.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really impressed, but it&#x27;s good for the price.</li>
            <li>to thin it out again which is kind of a pain.</li>
            <li>to apply a thick layer on top of my nail polish and  it dries so</li>
            <li>The top coat is thick.</li>
            <li>This with the Gelous Nail Base makes for an incredible home manicure!</li>
            <li>Now this top coat is not as shinny and thick as it used to be, and it bubbles up.  </li>
            <li>If you want a top coat that never gets thick use Revlon.</li>
            <li>So...I thought one more try because I really wanted to like it and applied it in thin coats.</li>
            <li>I bring along my own Base &amp; Top coat because this way regardless of the quality of the polish&lt;</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure the bottle gets thick over time</li>
            <li>Not only does it dry very fast, it dries the polish layers underneath, making my nails ready to go in minutes.  </li>
            <li>Oddly, my favorite is a discontinued base and top coat by Max Factor (yes, really) -- it was long lasting and effective, didn&#x27;t change my polish colors, and just imparted a slight shine, with a bonus of being dual purpose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seemed to dry fast and leaves a glassy, high shine layer.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations due to outstanding reviews and a great reputation, only to be severely disappointed.</li>
            <li>I paint my nails a LOT (mainly because I get bored with what is on my nails and have to change it to keep things interesting!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually pretty bad about applying a top coat, but this brand definitely makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does dry very fast.  </li>
            <li>And it does dry very fast</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;It dry very fast as its name.</li>
            <li>It does dry very fast however.</li>
            <li>When i&#x27;m in a rush but need to paint my nails, this helps them to dry very fast to where I can grab things without my nails smudging.</li>
            <li>Dry&#x27;s very fast</li>
            <li>The real product tends to be somewhat thick but spreads easily and covers minor flaws and evens the bumps from nail art and leaves a very shiny surface.</li>
            <li>I typically use Essie or OPI underneath and the polish lasts at least 5-7 days without chips or scratches, which is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>By the time I got done applying the topcoat to my second hand, my first hand was absolutely and completely dry.</li>
            <li>It does dry really fast, faster than any top coat I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, plain and simple!</li>
            <li>Put it on right after you finish your last coat of polish and then immediately put the second coat on after you finish the first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fourth try was with 3 coats, it just peeled right off next day.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and its long lasting.</li>
            <li>like it because it does dry fast, but within the limitations of normal work.</li>
            <li>The smell kind of smells like spray paint almost, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming and won&#x27;t stink up your house and dissipates once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>I will admit that it dries very quickly and leaves a nice shine, but the shrinkage it causes drives me crazy!</li>
            <li>The chemicals it had, good and bad reviews, compared it with other top coats, etc.</li>
            <li>The reason I tried it, was that all the nail art vloggers  (The ones I like, I mean, on you tube), use Seche Vite, and mention it that it is their favorite topcoat.  </li>
            <li>Makes my manicure last several days longer than other top coats.</li>
            <li>my nails dry fast and can stay chip free far longer than the previous two tops coats I have used.</li>
            <li>However, with Seche Vite Dry Fast, I didn&#x27;t have to worry after a half hour (more like 15 minutes actually).</li>
            <li>If you do nail art, be sure the colors are dry before applying the seche vite, or apply with a light hand as it can smear colors (i had trouble with a design using a black Essie).</li>
            <li>I spent time getting just right</li>
            <li>You just have to be careful not to pick at your nails in the shower or right after.</li>
            <li>I paint right over wet polish with no problems.</li>
            <li>When it first arrived, I was so excited I put a coat over the pinky nail of a day&#x27;s old manicure (Wet n wild quick dry black, topped with Sally Hansen HD Byte, LCD, DVD, and some generic clear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a success above the rest of the new age dry fasts.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even need to let your color polish dry first and after a minute</li>
            <li>I always paint my nails after work in the evening and even after they seem dry it never fails that when I go to bed</li>
            <li>Adds fantastic shine and truly does dry quickly, never used a polish that really dries the way this does.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple brands of top coats to try and achieve that glossy, long lasting finish you get with a professional manicure and this is the only one that is comparable.</li>
            <li>By the time I am doing both hands the nails on my first are already dry to the touch.</li>
            <li>I have never seen anything dry so fast!</li>
            <li>For me, it is much thicker than some typical drug store top coats I typically buy.  </li>
            <li>It is really dry fast!</li>
            <li>so the first time around, I was applying it to mostly dry polish.</li>
            <li>The only downside that I&#x27;ve found is that although it dries extremely quickly, if you have multiple layers of polish underneath, those layers do not dry.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, but last for only a couple to a few days.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff - dries very fast - no more smudges for me!!!</li>
            <li>so it doesnt last as long as i thought it would, maybe with a second coat it would make your nail polish last longer, but i love it regardless.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s because of this that I decided to look into a top coat that could dry my nails in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>This top coat makes your nail polish dry in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pronounced &#x27;sesh veet&#x27; French for quick dry)</li>
            <li>The only upside is that it does dry extremely quick.</li>
            <li>Not only does it dry extremely quickly (and it dries all the layers of polish underneath, too), but it produces a mirror-like shine.  </li>
            <li>While the product did dry quickly, it peeled off my nails next day!</li>
            <li>I have been using the quick dry Sally H product and thought it was sufficient but after using this I will NEVER go back.  </li>
            <li>Nails dry quickly, have a shiny finish, and last longer.</li>
            <li>it makes your nails dry faster last longer and look super shiny</li>
            <li>Only slight downfall is it has a strong odor until it dries.</li>
            <li>Sets polish quickly so it cuts down on smuggling.</li>
            <li>With my fast dry drops, it truly is dry in 5 minutes though, and gives a shinier appearance than any other top coat  have used.</li>
            <li>there is a little bit of an art to putting on enough so that you can cover the nail before it sets without globbing on so much that it won&#x27;t dry, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>great top coat or if using a DARK color as a base if need be</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands that people have had success with, but nothing, in my opinion, works as well as Seche Vite for me.</li>
            <li>No mess, it dries, i seconds.</li>
            <li>It works everytime, in every season, lasts for months and worth the money spent!</li>
            <li>Read a few reviews on the product, was really excited about ordering the product esp for the price</li>
            <li>It dries your nails fast and gives them a wet look (high gloss shine).</li>
            <li>But please wait at least one minute for your nail polish to dry before you put on this top coat!</li>
            <li>I definitely consider this a new staple in my nail polish collection!</li>
            <li>Dries fast, has a long shelf life and its crystal clear.</li>
            <li>However, I know many view it as a serious product fault</li>
            <li>Seriously you won&#x27;t be able to stop looking at your nails!&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>the first is already dry!</li>
            <li>Yes, it does chip fairly easily after a couple of days but imo, if you are changing your polish regularly its really not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li>WARNING: using this ridiculously fast-drying top coat may cause you to DRAMATICALLY increase your nail polish inventory</li>
            <li>and this top coat is serious business.  </li>
            <li>dries in seriously, seriously, 5 minutes top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super shiny, actually does dry fast, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>so disappointed, I&#x27;ve been better off just using polish without a top coat than using Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>It is super shiny and dries in less than five minutes.</li>
            <li>No matter how hot and humid it is outside after one application of Seche Vite I only need to sit for one drying cycle at the salon</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super shiny and seriously dries so fast!</li>
            <li>It does &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; super fast, in about a minute, but it remains soft for at least an hour.</li>
            <li>For me, usually two coats of polish without a top coat last about a day.</li>
            <li>The next day however did have some peeling just replaced top coat and no more problems.</li>
            <li>It makes my manicures last for a significant amount of time longer than other tops coats.</li>
            <li>I also found that this stuff runs out pretty quickly--make sure to apply a thin coat!</li>
            <li>My nail polish ends up chipping rather quickly and it shrinks up on the polish, making it look odd.</li>
            <li>This was my second try with it and these are the same results as the first time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it sometimes reacts weird with certain polishes resulting in what is known as &amp;#34;shrinkage.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve never had much problem with shrinkage but many people have.</li>
            <li>high gloss, a thick but not too thick clear layer, smooth smooth smooth, and it even evened out some knubbly areas where my polish had clumped as it dried.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong, but just open the window</li>
            <li>This is a major polish extender that every busy mom should try.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when it arrived and promptly used it, and put it to the test putting it over a polish that takes FOREVER to dry, and I kid you not, within one minutes of putting Seche Vite on, my nails were COMPLETELY dry, and my jaw hit the floor.</li>
            <li>It is very shiny and super hard.  </li>
            <li>Its super shiny, dries fast and hard.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for your final step of polished nails......</li>
            <li>Love this product, everyone asks me if my nails are gel and they are always shocked when I tell them it&#x27;s regular old nail polish and this top coat.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t recommend this high enough.</li>
            <li>and your whole nail is dry in less then 10 minutes ( depends on how dry your coats where before you applied the top coat)</li>
            <li>More importantly, this top coat contains Toluene which rates a 10 (the worst possible score) on the Environmental Working Groups rating of harmful cosmetic ingredients.</li>
            <li>It settles on the nail and smooths out, so for people who have shaky hands or something, it will smooth out and give a slick and even top coat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you have nails that tend to be unhealthy like I do (thin, cracks easily, etc.), you may want to look at a different top coat, either that, or alternate this top coat with a different one (which is what I do).  </li>
            <li>so i got a new one when i had about 1/4 left in my old bottle.</li>
            <li>If you use it right, your polish will last as long as shellac.</li>
            <li>If there is a smudge on the nail polish or the color is slightly uneven, this covers it right up!</li>
            <li>This is worth it and last a very long time.</li>
            <li>The other major problem I have with it is that it tends to pull the underlying polish away from the nail edges, which significantly cheapens the overall look of the manicure.</li>
            <li>I was actually going to give this to my mom and use it on my little tiny sister, so I am glad I found out before.</li>
            <li>It only starts chipping a week or more in, and then only a little bit.</li>
            <li>and then it&#x27;s not as fabulous the 2nd half of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Before I bought this product, I looked for reviews of fast dry clear coats.  </li>
            <li>I was in need of something fast drying because I just don&#x27;t have the patience to let my nails dry completely.</li>
            <li>It dried my 4 layers of polish quickly and completely.  </li>
            <li>Even after it dried and I washed my hands the next day, it still smelled like a strong acrylic chemical smell.  </li>
            <li>good for AT LEAST 2 and a half weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course, I&#x27;d still let it dry as long as possible just to ensure that your  nails are done, but this top coat definitely prevents the accidental smudging.</li>
            <li>I have used many dry fast items in the past, but this is the only product that has worked 100% for my nails.</li>
            <li>I was tired of smudges with every single color change or touch up, but then I read good stuff about this product.  </li>
            <li>so this isn&#x27;t a huge deal for me, but if you don&#x27;t get close enough to the sides and top of your nail it could look funky, so take this into consideration when painting and don&#x27;t be afraid to get a bit closer than usual.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Almost dries too fast for really long nails</li>
            <li>It stays very shiny for a long time.  </li>
            <li>it dries fast and lasts long</li>
            <li>However, it is not a good top coat.</li>
            <li>I have naturally long nails, which makes my life so much easier.  </li>
            <li>I am not a professional and don&#x27;t have much to compare this to</li>
            <li>I swear by Seche Vite, any other top coat is not worth the money.</li>
            <li>I am able to do my nails and within a few minutes can get back to my daily life.</li>
            <li>Normally polish only lasts a day or two, even before I worked in a nursing home.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not worth the type, not worth your money.</li>
            <li>I keep my nails to just a bit longer than my fingertips, and I&#x27;m pretty rough on them</li>
            <li>It goes back to its normal hardness after about 20 minutes of being out of the shower.</li>
            <li>the first use of the product i found i was applying the polish incorrectly, the polish is to be applied while the color polish is wet.</li>
            <li>My first couple of tries with Seche Vite...</li>
            <li>It works and doesn&#x27;t get the color onto the brush (i used with OPI hot pink and nude).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>U normally can only get a shine like that from a UV gel polish.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my nails covered and lasting longer than it would normally.</li>
            <li>Second, if you&#x27;re planning on painting on art of some kind (polka dots, stripes, whatever your fancy), I do my base color, then Seche Vite, my art, then more Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>If you use it, be certain the nail polish is dry before applying it.  </li>
            <li>I can put it on right after finishing my second coat of color and within 3 minutes, my nails are dry.</li>
            <li>It dry&#x27;s quickly and lasts long</li>
            <li>It keeps the polish looking fresh and shiny, and keeps the tips from wearing down or chipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus when it starts to come off, it comes off in huge pieces instead of little chips, which I like, makes it easier to remove with polish later.</li>
            <li>Not only is it quick drying it is also long lasting.  </li>
            <li>My polish dried quickly and didn&#x27;t give me enough time to do anything to ruin my manicure the way I normally do.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easy and dries my nails quickly to a hard shine.  </li>
            <li>I like my normal polish manicure (with a little bit of nail art on ring fingers to make me feel pretty)</li>
            <li>Just to make sure they were fully dry, I wait at least an hour before I resume &#x27;normal&#x27; activity.</li>
            <li>My manicure at home now only takes no more than 15 minutes and it actually looks much better than professional ones I used to pay for.</li>
            <li>It also dries and hardens in much less than time than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing this quick wearing process is due to it drying into one solid coat with the nail polish beneath (according to the description in the packaging).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hard to take off but it lasts longer than a regular top coat.</li>
            <li>Fast Top Nail Coat has gone down over the last few years.</li>
            <li>If I reapply every other day, my manicures can last a week or more with minimal tip wear.</li>
            <li>I usually were OPI fast dry top coat but found that it gets thick very fast, and I have to purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something I can live with for the overall quality.</li>
            <li>I put two coats of this stuff on my new tiffany blue nail polish, after two hours, I already had chips!</li>
            <li>Not only does this topcoat dry fast and leaves nail polish looking very glossy, it prevents my polish from chipping much longer than other quick-dry topcoats.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to rate it accurately - I think 3 is too low but 4 is too high.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brand before and loved it, but purchasing it from this seller, I don&#x27;t think this is the real product, or I just got a really bad batch.</li>
            <li>While it does help the polish dry much quicker, it creates this peeling effect.</li>
            <li>All that sitting around waiting for drying was really cramping my style, it was like I was sitting there watching my life pass before my eyes waiting for nail polish to dry.  </li>
            <li>When it says dry fast, it isn&#x27;t kidding.</li>
            <li>and it does dry really fast</li>
            <li>Used to use OPI but didn&#x27;t dry fast so gave this polish a try</li>
            <li>Shiny and dry fast.</li>
            <li>This really speeds up the amount of time it takes for my nails to dry.  </li>
            <li>It does dry fast and leaves it shiny</li>
            <li>It does dry fast.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really want to sit around for 30 minutes waiting for my polish to dry...</li>
            <li>It says FAST DRY</li>
            <li>It does dry incredibly fast, and I&#x27;m not exaggerating</li>
            <li>the words means dry fast..</li>
            <li>To dry (fast nail dryer)</li>
            <li>I typically do my nails about 20 mins or so before going to bed and the top coat is dry enough that it causes no problems and</li>
            <li>It makes nail polish dry much faster than without it</li>
            <li>It works wonders and the insanely fast dry time is no lie.</li>
            <li>It also doesnt dry that fast.</li>
            <li>and they dry so fast.</li>
            <li>It does dry your nails fast.</li>
            <li>It makes my polish dry fast</li>
            <li>I painted my nails before I went to bed just to see how fast it would dry my</li>
            <li>This product does dry fast like others have said.</li>
            <li>it really helps the dry polish to dry fast.</li>
            <li>I gave two stars because my nails did dry fast.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does dry fast.</li>
            <li>It dries my nail fast and now I don&#x27;t have to wait hours for my nail to dry.  </li>
            <li>It does dry fast however.</li>
            <li>Dry Fast.  </li>
            <li>Makes my nails so shiny and there are no smudges because they dry so fast</li>
            <li>and this helps the polish to dry fast.</li>
            <li>dry very fast&lt;</li>
            <li>Literally, 2 minutes and my nails are dry an ready.</li>
            <li>My nails dry so fast</li>
            <li>It helps the polish dry fast, shiny, and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like the products that say fast and take forever to dry.</li>
            <li>it really dry fast</li>
            <li>Dry really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>As  others have stated, it does dry fast and in under  5  minutes.</li>
            <li>It does as it promises, it does dry fast...</li>
            <li>, it drys in less than a minute and becomes rock solid afterwords, its super shiny and adds a professional look to any nail polish/art.</li>
            <li>The quantity of the ingredient is so low, the only way you&#x27;d really do damage is if you sat there and huffed the bottle.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY quick dry product that actually dries my nails within a minute.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it solid and fast drying, it never yellows.</li>
            <li>on to the negative: I have to constantly redo my nail with the top coat polish.</li>
            <li>This stinks like hell and makes my husband want to puke, but dries fast and gives nice shine and protection.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as the Sally Hansen top coat that I was using before, however it&#x27;s still pretty durable.</li>
            <li>makes any polish you use last for at least a week, won&#x27;t used anything but this now as top coat</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry super fast, it takes about 15 minutes to dry enough so my nails don&#x27;t stick when I press them together, but after 30 minutes to an hour, it dries to a very solid layer over my nails.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a somewhat thick texture that makes your nails dry fast and last more than 7 days.&lt;br /&gt;The high-end nail salons around my area also use it.</li>
            <li>If I get a nice thin layer it seems to last longer.</li>
            <li>This goes on so thick, and dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I think the most I&#x27;ve tried was with 5 coats as I did glitter on top of a color base.</li>
            <li>Man o man it dried quickly</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is the top coat or the top coat and base coat combined</li>
            <li>It goes on pretty thick and dries extremely fast!</li>
            <li>I noticed this doesn&#x27;t do much in terms of top coat strength unfortunately.</li>
            <li>My nails are shiny, thick and strong.</li>
            <li>But it smells really strong and it gets goopy and thick after a while,so you have to buy the &amp;#34;restore“</li>
            <li>leaves your nails feeling strong and thick.</li>
            <li>If you ding your nailtip, a single layer will chip off much easier than layer over layer over layer.</li>
            <li>Not sure the shine is worth the pain!</li>
            <li>There is no other.  </li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t had ANY major chips or nicks</li>
            <li>Major dissapointment.  </li>
            <li>Using this top coat makes removing the nail polish slightly more difficult, but it&#x27;s not a significant enough difference to ding all the positives here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still...I&#x27;m looking for alternatives to this as I am now aware of the risks in using this product, but I do plan to continue using it every other manicure until it&#x27;s all gone.</li>
            <li>I am an avid rock climber and this is the only polish that has kept my nails from chipping after a long day at the crag!</li>
            <li>If any major brands make a topcoat, I have it.</li>
            <li>major issue is with the packaging.</li>
            <li>and I always get major shrinkage.</li>
            <li>MAJOR shrinkage.  </li>
            <li>I use no other.</li>
            <li>Use China Glaze Strong Adhesion Base Coat as your first coat on clean nails.</li>
            <li>I dont think the brush is quite long enough and it gets kind of thick and gooey at the end of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Right now my nails are about 6 days old, and I have a few noticeable chips at the tips of 3 or 4 fingers.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I&#x27;ve never been able to finish a bottle of SV - a quarter of the way into the bottle, the polish begins turning gummy, and by the half bottle mark, it&#x27;s more like spreading gluey paste onto my nails than painting with polish.</li>
            <li>Top coat dried super fast and my nail polish lasted through the crazy New Years holiday weekend.  </li>
            <li>My nails are fully dry in as little as 4-5 minutes...not just the top, but the entire nail.</li>
            <li>By the time I finish painting the second hand, the first hand is dry.</li>
            <li>Nothing feels worse than topping a flawless application and having it look cracked and sloppy because of the topcoat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use my hands for work other than constant typing, so my polishes tend to last longer than the average persons anyway, but this top coat definitely extends the life of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very hard to smash after using the top  </li>
            <li>I was really just looking for something simple, but tthis is a miracle in a bottle and completely worth a few extra bucks.</li>
            <li>My nails are very thin and this top coat keeps my nails from breaking and it&#x27;s very shiny.</li>
            <li>It was so frustrating to spend an hour making my nails look perfect and then having the base, polish, and top coat pop off in one solid chunk.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your nail polish looking extra shiny and it helps it dry super quick no matter how thick your nail polish is.</li>
            <li>Not only a quick dry, but super shine and thick without bubbling so</li>
            <li>This one is seriously terrific as far as fast dry and hardening go.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t love the thickness and chemically smell, but its worth having my nails dry in mere seconds.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I have &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; nails or what the problem is, but I did clean nails well before applying polish.  </li>
            <li>It completely smoothed out the rough glitter polished, gave my nails a manicure finish and dried very quickly.</li>
            <li>thick and dries quick!</li>
            <li>Leaves them thick and super shiny, I have received lots of compliments when using this!</li>
            <li>only thing I found that is the top coat seems to wear off quicker than I&#x27;d like which makes my nails look dull, but other than that, I highly reccommend this!</li>
            <li>It makes the polish last a while and nail polish tends to peel off my nails pretty quickly because they are so soft and thin.</li>
            <li>However as far as chipping, it&#x27;s no better than any other top coats.</li>
            <li>It dried so fast!!</li>
            <li>This product gives you super fast speed drying and a crystal hard and shiny finish!</li>
            <li>Usually I end up messing up my paint job before my nails are dry, but this top coat dries super fast and very hard.</li>
            <li>I literally felt my nail lightly after less than a minute and my nail was dry.</li>
            <li>Ridiculous yet at the same time I can&#x27;t help but be amazed that it does that yet gets soo many people raving about it.</li>
            <li>Both dry quickly, although the Seche feels &#x27;harder&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Also this top coat is very thick.</li>
            <li>As most people have said, the consistency of Seche Vite is very thick and goopy, and takes a handful of applications to get used to the texture.</li>
            <li>But I can live with it because it&#x27;s still a 5 star product and we all know perfection is impossible and seche vite came pretty darn close. :)</li>
            <li>It makes a hard smooth finish that lasts.  </li>
            <li>It dries super quickly (I&#x27;m not sure exactly how quickly because I didn&#x27;t want to mess up my nails, but it was definitely less than 5 minutes, probably 3-ish?)</li>
            <li>While I hate that Seche Vite wears on the tips so easily, and it also gets goopy once you&#x27;re halfway through the bottle, I&#x27;ve been spoiled already by the super fast drying time!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so quick drying that, if you&#x27;re not careful, it can start drying right in the bottle and become thick and harder to work with.</li>
            <li>While I have noticed some shrinkage on certain polishes (mainly glitters) when I wear Seche Vite, I love the fact that this makes my nails completely dry and rock hard within just a few minutes.</li>
            <li>After 3 or 4 minutes my nails are dry enough to do pretty normal things around the house, and after 5 or 6 minutes they&#x27;re completely dry.</li>
            <li>lasting, won&#x27;t chip especially if you use in combination with high quality nail polishes</li>
            <li>this product dried in under two minutes just what I was searching for goes on well and is inexpensive also shipped very fast  so far after cleaning my house</li>
            <li>So while you don&#x27;t have to be immobile as with wet nail polish, it&#x27;s still easy to mess them up if you&#x27;re not careful.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny spent!!!</li>
            <li>I am hard on my nails so they do chip occasionally, and with this top coat, it does peel off in bigger pieces...</li>
            <li>I do mean DRIES, all the way through - so quickly!</li>
            <li>My only other caveat is that it can chip pretty easily if you put it on too thick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this Seche Vite fast dry topcoat with polishes from a variety of manufacturers, some higher end and some less so (including, but not limited to Sheswai, Zoya, OPI, Seche Vite, and Revlon).  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical but it&#x27;s amazing and sets polish in seconds</li>
            <li>generally I topcoat the day after I polish or after a pedi</li>
            <li>and it keeps my nails glossy and chip free for at least a week.</li>
            <li>My nail polish lasts at least twice as long with this top coat.</li>
            <li>Shines wonderfully, is fast drying, smoothes out imperfections and helps my manicures last twice as long.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not easy on my polish either - I have kids and an OCD clean house, so I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands and cleaning, playing around with the kids, etc.</li>
            <li>(I know I&#x27;m probably the only person who has natural nails)</li>
            <li>I have a desk job, so I&#x27;m constantly typing, and I&#x27;m also a busy mom and wife.</li>
            <li>wow totally with the money</li>
            <li>/&gt;Dries very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Can be applied over wet polish.&lt;br /&gt;Protects your manicure to give it some staying</li>
            <li>:O</li>
            <li>That is just too much time to sit around with wet nails.  </li>
            <li>The thing you need to keep in mind with this that I had to learn is that you really need to apply it to nails that are still wet.</li>
            <li>I even put it over my professionally done manicure to make it last longer!</li>
            <li>It also allows me to complete nail art following a shorter drying time.</li>
            <li>My nail polish barely lasts a day.</li>
            <li>It helps my polish last far longer</li>
            <li>It bonds so well to my polish that when I finally start to nervous-pick at me nails the polish comes off completely in-tact.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going on two weeks now and my nail Polish is barely chipping.</li>
            <li>Apparently not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the only downside is that once you get near the end it gets gloopy and un-useable so i suggest buying seche restore with it.</li>
            <li>However, it pulls back &amp; shrinks after it dries completely.  </li>
            <li>but I have to share my experience with this product because it differs, apparently, with a thousand of others.  </li>
            <li>Came fast, works just as expected.</li>
            <li>This will be my last time purchasing this just because of how sensitive I am to the smell.  </li>
            <li>Apparently you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Thanks to another reviewer, I found out that this must be applied to wet nails.  </li>
            <li>Fast-drying, very glossy, and doesn&#x27;t drag nail art.</li>
            <li>My nails have barely chipped in over a week</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t really hold up like I expected.</li>
            <li>I have tried it three times so far and always the same story.</li>
            <li>Use in a well-vented area and the smell is barely discernible.</li>
            <li>Dries so fast and doesn&#x27;t smudge wet nail art.</li>
            <li>I am not a rough person.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m pretty rough on my hands throughout the day (especially because I&#x27;m a musician), and my nails endure a lot of wear.</li>
            <li>however my nail polish doesn&#x27;t last longer than normal, instead of chipping off it started to peel off entirely.</li>
            <li>The shine is crazy good..</li>
            <li>Again be realistic, thin coats will dry better.  </li>
            <li>Kind of scary</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also mega shiny and since it&#x27;s so thick, it can smooth out flakie and glitter polishes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I kind of like it A) because I am weird like that and B)</li>
            <li>Kind of scary.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff, i will never go back to not using a base and top coat.</li>
            <li>I manicure my nails at home and use the Seche Vite top coat and Seche Clear base coat with a variety of nail polish brands like Essie, OPI, Orly and even Sally Hansen - all with fabulous, long-lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The glass of  top nail coat  was  totally broken when I receive the product.</li>
            <li>Throw your ideas about thin coats out the window with this one, and you&#x27;re okay.  </li>
            <li>Throw your ideas about thin coats out the window with this one, and you&#x27;re okay.  </li>
            <li>The reason it makes your polish chip is that something weird in the formula makes every layer of polish on your nail kind of &#x27;melt&#x27; together into just one layer.</li>
            <li>then the Deborah Lippmann Addicted to Speed top coat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not 100% effective, unfortunately.</li>
            <li>If anyone out there wants a really good product of this type, you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Though the &amp;#34;no chip&amp;#34; claim that all top coats boast, once again proved false.</li>
            <li>But if you do it right, and don&#x27;t drag it across the nail polish too much with too little, it&#x27;ll work like a charm.</li>
            <li>The ONLY drawback that I have found is that because of the fast drying nature, air exposure from use causes it to get a little thick pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe I just finished my last nail and my first one was dry!!</li>
            <li>I mean, the others (Essie, OPI, i.e.) provided brilliant shine and all, but the complete game changer for me was how fast the Seche Vite dried.  </li>
            <li>your nails are dry in minutes, with a high gloss finish.  </li>
            <li>the very expensive topcoat lasted slightly less but didn&#x27;t chip nearly as much, but both were great products.</li>
            <li>The fact that I can do a quick manicure and get on with the things I need to do without worrying about my nails getting messed up makes it worth the minor inconvenience of having to keep another product around to thin it out.  </li>
            <li>Second, it does dry fast.  </li>
            <li>but they just dont dry fast enough.</li>
            <li>When it finally does dry, which takes a whole lot longer than advertised, it dries to the consistency of rubber plastic.  </li>
            <li>This nail polish does dry fast, but it doesn&#x27;t make my nail polish last any longer.</li>
            <li>Helps nail polish dry much faster and last longer.</li>
            <li>I give them a minute or two, to where they&#x27;re still tacky but not super wet, then put it on, and seal the free edge.</li>
            <li>After waiting a few minutes it was perfectly smooth and totally dry.  </li>
            <li>The French name (dry fast) says it all.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite (French for Fast Dry) dries oh too well.</li>
            <li>I used to wait a whole hour for my nails to dry, but now I only wait 20 minutes</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thickening - By the time your bottle is half empty, the polish will have thickened to the point where it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>or it didn&#x27;t dry fast enough so that I&#x27;d wake up with imprints of my bedsheet on them.  </li>
            <li>It lets my polish set and dry so fast and make it last longer.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the topcoat did dry fast.</li>
            <li>my nails are dry so fast and my manicures last over a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Obviously it will dry fast.  </li>
            <li>so you are less likely to damage your freshly painted nails.</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is definitely worth the price here, which is half of what it costs to buy in stores.</li>
            <li>I found it to get thick very quickly, though, so I never got to use the entire bottle.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite is good for finishing complicated nail designs when you don&#x27;t have time to sit around for hours waiting for it to dry.  </li>
            <li>The only complaint is the chemical smell which is strong.</li>
            <li>with this top coat, several layers are hard to the touch in 10 minutes flat!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost due for a new bottle!!</li>
            <li>Ok, I know there are some bad reviews of this product because of the smell and the Toulene, but I have used other top coats and nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li>I have a huge problem with my nail polish chipping off (usually within a day of putting it on!)</li>
            <li>I mean prolly the fastest delivery from anything I bought off here esp for it being a free delivery.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sheet marks&lt;br /&gt;Being impatient and screwing over your manicure right after doing it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Without this, your nails might be &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;, but not really - when you run your fingers over the nail, it&#x27;s dry at a light touch, but then clearly it isn&#x27;t dry underneath.</li>
            <li>Normally I get a dent or 2 even if I&#x27;ve let my nails dry for about an hour.</li>
            <li>The polish stays on longer as a result and chips less in the first day or two.</li>
            <li>I let it dry longer than normal thou.</li>
            <li>After about 6 months and with half a bottle left, my last bottle started drying so quickly that I couldn&#x27;t even get it on the nail.  </li>
            <li>People who do nail art should definitely invest in this item so your art can last longer and look professional without the cost!d my nails without it!  </li>
            <li>People who do nail art should definitely invest in this item so your art can last longer and look professional without the cost!</li>
            <li>Since I took a trip out of town for the weekend and did none of my usual chores around the house, I figure I was lucky to get 3 days out of them.  </li>
            <li>You can see a little flaking on the side of my middle and index fingers, and the color (Essie Mojito Madness) is a little dull, but still looks good!</li>
            <li>It does dry fast but at the end of the bottle, it gets really thick and stringy and does not dry as quickly and is susceptible to bumps and scratches, screwing up your (and my) manicure.  </li>
            <li>Only the top edges had worn down a little but the polish design had no damage to it.</li>
            <li>This is the only fast dry I use!</li>
            <li>Previously I had used Sally Hansen&#x27;s hard as nails line, which when dry, is very nice and helps with growing longer nails, but takes longer to dry than I am patient.  </li>
            <li>Believe the other reviews - this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Take it from someone who is a really hesitant buyer, is extremely cautious with her money, and does a lot of research before buying.</li>
            <li>Yes, it dries fast, but I agree with the other reviews...</li>
            <li>dries so much faster than any other i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It lasts so much longer than any other that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Works extremely well at fast drying as well as protecting the polish.  </li>
            <li>It finishes like a gel manicure and it lasts much longer than other topcoats I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>being said, I have two nail polish racks full to the brim with 100 different shades of the same few pinks, grays, whites, and blacks.</li>
            <li>so at the end of your wear, it creates a thick enough layer that you can pretty much peel your polish off.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and forms very few (if any) bubbles.  </li>
            <li>Dries fast and hard, stays really glossy.</li>
            <li>This was watered down and doesn&#x27;t have near the same consistency as a REAL seche vite.</li>
            <li>Scrubbing countertops with chemical cleaners, stocking the cooler, counting change in the registers, and not a single chip or dent in my nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only fast drying, but it&#x27;s very long lasting.</li>
            <li>Seriously, I was off to cook dinner within moments of having finished my nails, and they were still as sleek and smooth as all get out when I set dinner on the table.</li>
            <li>The crazy fast drying speed of this magic potion is a deal maker.  </li>
            <li>Only takes a few minute to dry and it goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li>It dries incredibly fast allowing me to paint my nails even with an active toddler running around, without fear that my nails will get messed up.</li>
            <li>Dry times at least 60% faster than regular top coat polish.</li>
            <li>Way different from the standard clear polishes out there</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be the solution to my constantly smudged nails, but, it didn&#x27;t dry fast enough for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this through amazon and only wasted half the amount that I would&#x27;ve if I had gotten it at a beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li>A lot of companies advertise this type of result, but so far this is the only brand I&#x27;ve found that actually delivers.</li>
            <li>The ONLY flaw is that I got chipping the next day, and the day after that two nails completely chipped off.</li>
            <li>I was about to give up on natural nails because nail polish would only last a day or two, but then I found this product.</li>
            <li>shortly after I painted my nails the last time, I realized how screwed I was since my boys woke up too early from their naps.</li>
            <li>It dried really fast, and it looks like a professional manicure.</li>
            <li>I think some companies sit around and get a kick out of making polishes that never dry</li>
            <li>I used it on wet polish and it dried shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Did not dry fast--was tacky and made my polish bubble.</li>
            <li>Before I bought this, my polish would chip within the first hour or so no matter what I did or the quality of the base color, so I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>It dried pretty quickly and my manicures lasted a bit longer than usual.</li>
            <li>This top coat goes on a bit thick so be careful</li>
            <li>this on dry nails&lt;br /&gt;Apply two coats for a very professional look&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Not only did I have major &amp;#34;shrink back&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I did struggle with it a little at first however.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I had a little freak out because I thought I ruined my mani</li>
            <li>Nearly all of the nail polish I purchased was less than $1.50 a bottle, so it was by no means high quality.  </li>
            <li>I will then fix the chip, add a second top coat of it, and by 48 hours, the majority of my nails have chipped pretty bad, and I have to completely redo them.</li>
            <li>Seriously it dries super fast and leaves a long lasting shine too!</li>
            <li>Just what I expected this is a high shine polish.</li>
            <li>And yes, my nails dried very fast.</li>
            <li>And dries my nails quick, meaning to the point I can do light things, if I were to rub my finger nail hard on my jeans, yes it will mess them up, they dry them enough to where you can do things and not worry about if something touches your nails, and definitely keeps the polish from chipping or fading.</li>
            <li>I got this b/c I started using Julep polish and for me that polish was taking to long to dry but having that sticky factor after words.the seche vite really douse dry fast and has long wear before chipping.</li>
            <li>first bottle didn&#x27;t goop up on me, but the second slightly did-</li>
            <li>One odd thing is that I have noticed by then end of one week, the nailpolish looks a tiny bit darker than when I first painted them so there might be an issue with discoloration.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of top coats in the past, and decided to purchase this one based on previous reviews.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really pretty before the shine dulls (3-4 days), and it DOES dry my nails super-fast, but I&#x27;d prefer my nail polish not chip between manis (every week).</li>
            <li>But the real reason for the low rating: it also stinks like no other top coat I have used recently.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Dries up quickly if you keep the cap off for too long, hence becoming thick, and leaving a thick coat (again not a problem if you use Seche Restore)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Naturally, the quick wear and frequent mini manicures mean the bottle doesn&#x27;t last very long.   </li>
            <li>I thought this was a great product reading the reviews :(</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m disappointed because the reviews said it was so great.</li>
            <li>Awesome top coat, no bleeding when doing designs like galaxy or thin art work, but the smell is awful, like paint thinner!!</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and was nicely secured so it wasn&#x27;t broken or damaged the least bit.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is the smell but still totally worth it!</li>
            <li>B000J63372 Essie First Base Coat Nail Treatment]]) to other nail salons because I prefer these products and several have all remarked on what a great topcoat this is.  </li>
            <li>I have long, natural nails and never painted them because my polish was chipped or smudged within an hour of a manicure.  </li>
            <li>I wash my hands frequently and type all day long, so my polish takes a beating.</li>
            <li>I am going on day 5 with one tiny chip that is barely noticeable , no shrinkage or tip wear.</li>
            <li>Also, I applied a second layer and my entire french manicure completely lifted and basically just fell off.</li>
            <li>The shine lasts long too and it leaves my nails looking as if I had the professional gels done.</li>
            <li>I usually do my nails at home and bough Seche Vite to make my manicure last longer and all I can say is that it&#x27;s the same quality as any other top coat you can buy at any drugstore.</li>
            <li>As long as your nail polish isn&#x27;t so old</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t even imagine what chemicals could be in it &amp;#62;.&amp;#62; It also warns about possible birth defects on the bottle :o</li>
            <li>I  don&#x27;t know if it has been sitting too long and is old.</li>
            <li>My nails dried so fast!</li>
            <li>- smooth, glossy feel... can apply a thick, smooth coat or a thin one.</li>
            <li>No more hair marks or dings on your freshly painted nails.</li>
            <li>It dried SO FAST!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t drag the polish, doesn&#x27;t shrink, doesn&#x27;t crack or chip under normal use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and glossy and dries quicker than any other top coat I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good for at least a week and a half!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong and if that gives you trouble, then you may have a hard time using Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>Now there&#x27;s no excuse for you to go home and slop it on over day-old dry polish, or straight on a dry nail bed.</li>
            <li>Easy dry and nail polish stays on for at least a week.</li>
            <li>And it really cuts down on the chipping.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately it chipped very easily and by the next day it was chipping/peeling on on my nails.</li>
            <li>Well if there was one out there that makes any polish dry fast and last a long time, I had been yet to find it.  </li>
            <li>was skeptical at first, but after my first pedicure and manicure, I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li>It dries quickly &amp; makes your nails shiny &amp; hard, smoothing out any mistakes along the way.</li>
            <li>And, because it is so shiny, it is super noticeable - because the polish coat underneath is dull by comparison.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This top coat stinks to high heaven (gives my boyfriend a headache), but it does its job.</li>
            <li>I started painting my nails so much frequently after getting this product because it cuts down on the amount of time you have to wait for your nails to dry by so much.</li>
            <li>I also think it helps to dry the polish under the topcoat; the Revlon polish I used recently was kind of thick and took a long time to dry between coats.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I honestly really found nothing wrong with this top coat.</li>
            <li>used to dedicate about 3 hours every 3 days to maintain my OPI base and top coat manicure, and more time with other brands.</li>
            <li>I even got a small snag in a nail and was able to file it down and the polish did not chip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding!</li>
            <li>That isn&#x27;t usual for an older bottle of Seche Vite, but I have never had that happen with a new bottle.</li>
            <li>I was SHOCKED the first time I used this top coat.  </li>
            <li>Just from scratching your head over night in your sleep, you may very well see slightly worn tips in the morning depending.</li>
            <li>I have 3 kids, so I am not exactly super gentle on my nails and this keeps my nails from chipping and continues to make them look shiny and just painted...</li>
            <li>It would start to bubble and take ages to dry, the finished result would look like a 5 year old</li>
            <li>and I have to wait a while for it to dry completely because if I do it too soon it will smear.</li>
            <li>Even after allowing my nails to dry for a considerable amount of time they still get dents and sheet marks.  </li>
            <li>Dries to the touch in under 5 minutes, complete dry between 1-2 hours depending on the amount of polish I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It also becomes very goopy half way through the bottle.</li>
            <li>It makes it look like I had my nails done professionally, and helps my polish last a long time.</li>
            <li>I still noticed it discolored my white tips- turning them pinkish, but it also gave unnatural brassy color to my bare nails above the white!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before I knew something like this existed, I put off repainting my natural nails for as long as possible because it was quite literally an all-afternoon job for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few manicures last a whole week with this!</li>
            <li>It dries quickly; however, you still have to be delicate with your nails.  </li>
            <li>I had been using OPI and Sally Hansen top coat for the past few years now, and ordered a bottle of this just to see what the hype was about.</li>
            <li>However, on the back of the bottle there&#x27;s a warning that it contains a chemical known to cause birth defects, so I&#x27;m still not sure if it&#x27;s worth it...</li>
            <li>*) I keep my nail shorts because they tend to chip &amp; break easily if I do not.</li>
            <li>Makes my nails hard and dries very fast!</li>
            <li>When I ordered from this seller, it arrived quickly, but turned thick, gooey, and unusable within 3 months.</li>
            <li>This top coat sucks!!</li>
            <li>Very Clear, Glossy Wet Look when dry.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>The only down side is it also makes my nail polishes peel sooooo much fast.</li>
            <li>It made my polish peel off in large chunks, not just little nicks.</li>
            <li>The down side: it doesn&#x27;t chip any less than any other top coat I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but if you do it right - as instructed then you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>Starting chipping and peeling right away :/</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other high quality brands when I could not find this</li>
            <li>Using it myself now, I completely agree that it only takes a couple minutes to completely dry.</li>
            <li>But it still takes between an hour and two hours for the entire polish job to dry completely.</li>
            <li>It dries my nails completely in under a minute, so I can go back to my life and not have to sit around waiting for polish to dry.</li>
            <li>i can never do regular manicure and always go for the color gel because i do not have the patience for it to dry completely.</li>
            <li>Also when approaching the half bottle mark it begins to get VERY clumpy.</li>
            <li>I was so tired of top coats that chip after a day, and nails that seemed to take forever to dry.</li>
            <li>Enough so that it beads at the tip of the brush, and then you GENTLY pull it down the middle of your nail.</li>
            <li>It dries both your base and top coat INSANELY quick, but there is a price to pay.</li>
            <li>I am using a vitamin filled base coat to help my nails grow strong (Orly)</li>
            <li>It looks a little thick on the brush, but it goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>The dry time makes it easier for them to not mess them up.</li>
            <li>If your polish has dried even a little, then it works fine.  </li>
            <li>Makes my weak, thin nails look great.  </li>
            <li>I can not only save money by doing my nails at home, but I can have them dry in 60 seconds flat, look like a professional did them, and go on about my business!  </li>
            <li>I get a mani and pedi every other week and was unhappy with their brand of quick dry, top coat.  </li>
            <li>I used the same brand of polish a few months before with a different top coat, and it didn&#x27;t even survive past the second day.  </li>
            <li>This top coat does dry fast but it chips like crazy.</li>
            <li>Does dry fast but gets very gooey and thick in bottle after a couple months.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter how cheap, thin, or thick, your nail polish is, it will go on smoothly and dry within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Its really nothing that a little polish thinner can&#x27;t fix though.</li>
            <li>It takes a little longer to dry completely, so if you smash them too hard your polish will move, but since the top coat is completely dry you can generally push the polish back/reshape a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would not suggest using it in a closed space ( like your bathroom ) because of the possible fumes, but the smell goes away once dry, and this does dry very fast.</li>
            <li>and I try to give this top coat at least a little time as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand of Base and Top coat for sometime now and finding it for $5 online was an absolute steal!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through several top coats and realized how stupid I was for never knowing about Seche Vite in the first place!</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have said it does dry up really fast.</li>
            <li>I have used other brands that didn&#x27;t dry as fast as i needed it to and smudged.  </li>
            <li>I also have a tendency to mess my nails up within the first 5 minutes but with this stuff my nails are dry in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>unless it really is, i LOVE it it just cuts down the drying time to less then half, literally you just need to apply it and wait like a minute</li>
            <li>Since I  wasn&#x27;t too keen on changing my polish every two days like clockwork, I decided to try quick dries by a few other companies.</li>
            <li>this can be a good thing and a bad thing.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s something bad I can say about it, it&#x27;s the smelll (What good nail polish product doesn&#x27;t smell?)</li>
            <li>Really the only bad thing I have to say is that if you miss a spot with this top coat (i.e. you don&#x27;t cover your ENTIRE nail)</li>
            <li>It makes it dry to the touch in minutes and then fully dry so much faster than the polish would ever dry without it.</li>
            <li>colors that drag then get deposited back into the bottle of clear Seche and end up in your next manicure</li>

            <li> The best topcoat I have used in awhile.</li>
            <li> My theory is that it works best with higher-quality nail polishes (like OPI and Essie)</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly three years ago, when I received it, which means I could put my jeans on and off after 15 mins after I applied it.  </li>

            <li> I have experienced severe shrinking and even chips!</li>
            <li> I do feel like it makes the paint chip faster, but it makes for a beautiful manicure before that happens!</li>
            <li> But try it, it is the best!!!</li>

            <li> BEST TOP COAT AVAILABLE!!</li>
            <li> I had read excellent things about this top coat online, and am so glad I decided to purchase it!</li>
            <li> I was impressed at how quick this nail coat works!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff supper happy with it</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing and at a great price.</li>
            <li> I just got this, and decided to do a bright neon mani for the summer.</li>
            <li> it also leaves nail color looking bright and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I honestly think this is the best top coat ever.</li>
            <li> It enhances every colour I use, and I&#x27;m delighted to accept the accolades from friends and colleagues</li>
            <li> friend loved it.</li>
            <li> The best way is to get a bead of Seche Vite on the end of your brush, and gently smooth it over your nail.</li>
            <li> That is good.  </li>
            <li> This product is so good it doesn&#x27;t make sense.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Seche Vite for the good work in Chemistry you&#x27;ve done here.</li>
            <li> Goes on good with lots of shine</li>
            <li> It keeps the nails looking so good</li>
            <li> so I figured it must be good.  </li>
            <li> but there isn&#x27;t a good thing I can say about it.</li>
            <li> After reading the good reviews on here I decided to try it</li>
            <li> i would have loved to give this 5 stars because it works, its a miracle topcoat.</li>
            <li> one thing to take caution of is NOT to use too much of a good thing because it will cause the polish to shrink, peel, or chip faster.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is a good buy</li>
            <li> For a damn good reason.</li>
            <li> I would say after 2-3 minutes of using the Seche Vite and I&#x27;m good to go on with my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good product to prolong your manicure no matter who does your nails.</li>
            <li> I use a good quality color</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s good-</li>
            <li> Good polish.</li>
            <li> This is the most incredible product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking into a good gel nail kit myself.</li>
            <li> Now I guess business is so good they sell it everywhere.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time pkg was good</li>
            <li> So, I decided to try this because a friend said she loved it</li>
            <li> and then I read good reviews on it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good with reg. polish for a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to my Essie Good To Go.</li>
            <li> The price is a good price.</li>
            <li> I always loved it and always will.</li>

            <li> good packaging..</li>
            <li> I hoped it would be as good as I read and protect my nails from chipping.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell too good, but what nail polish does?</li>
            <li> I was expecting this nail polish to be really good</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved this product.</li>
            <li> brilliant top coat.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> recommend, shipping was good as well.</li>
            <li> A cult fave for good reason.</li>
            <li> good--</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t prepared for what a gorgeous finish it puts on your nails:  </li>
            <li> I loved it</li>
            <li> I read reviews and thought this would be a superior product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good quality and it prevents my nail polish from chipping.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy it and see if its as good as it says.  </li>
            <li> and I am good to go...</li>
            <li> A truly superior product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen magazines give it good reviews.</li>
            <li> The good thing is, the smell doesn’t linger.</li>
            <li> It has some good qualities</li>
            <li> Smooth, perfect nails every time.</li>
            <li> Mix this with a good polish and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> It also has a really good shine.</li>
            <li> Either way, it did not look good.  </li>
            <li> Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> Shiny, smooth, beautiful!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> Good for the price.</li>
            <li> And it works really good too.</li>
            <li> Get a good look.</li>
            <li> This was not it, however good it was.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so good</li>
            <li> A great product otherwise and deserving of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> But for the price, it&#x27;s really a good buy.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it lasts a good couple of months (for people like me who do their nails almost every week)</li>
            <li> Not so good protecting the nail polish</li>
            <li> It takes about 60 seconds and you are good to go.  </li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> So I guess it must be good.</li>
            <li> not that good as ads...</li>
            <li> Put it on and within 10 minutes, you are good to go.  </li>
            <li> When I have purchased this product before in a store, I LOVED it:</li>
            <li> But the rest of my nails turned out good.</li>
            <li> All in all though it&#x27;s a good option for the price.</li>
            <li> Makes my nails looks so good and shiny.</li>
            <li> Good but shrinks.</li>
            <li> Good.........</li>
            <li> My nails were good all week with NO nicks, chips, or peeling.</li>

            <li> Makes my nails look really nice and has lasted two years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard alot of good things about this top coat</li>
            <li> and it gives a nice, long-lasting finish to a manicure.  </li>
            <li> How does this top coat have so many great reviews?</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best thing ever!!!</li>
            <li> I have acrylics over my own nails</li>
            <li> Came fast, works great!</li>
            <li> I liked the look that it gave to my nails.</li>
            <li> This topcoat is perfect for all manicures and pedicures it leaves your nails looking very shiny</li>
            <li> AND it makes them look nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> Has a nice gloss level as well.</li>
            <li> The absolute best product....</li>
            <li> It adds a nice shine to any color you use.</li>
            <li> So I went and researched and many people had good things to say about this topcoat.</li>
            <li> i have started to do my own nails</li>
            <li> I have been using Out The Door top coat for a couple of years now and swore by it, but this is just as good...</li>
            <li> Gives a nice gloss finish.</li>
            <li> There is evidence that exposure to toluene at work is associated with spontaneous abortion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li> I have purchased over 20 of these and amazon has the best price with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking around for a good top coat because my nails always seem to chip within a day or two after painting them.</li>
            <li> &#x60;Nice is Nice&#x27;</li>
            <li> It gives it a nice shine, and looks like i came put of a salon.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely--</li>
            <li> all the polish kind of way..</li>
            <li> I also like the nice glossy finish.</li>
            <li> It does have an obnoxious smell, kind of like liquid rubber.</li>
            <li> good stuff :)</li>
            <li> I purchased Seche Vite because I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about it</li>
            <li> Makes my polish stay on longer &amp; looks nice and shiney, I will be purchasing another bottle, as soon as this one, run out.</li>
            <li> It dries fast and works great!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a top coat that prevents your polish from chipping or peeling off than this isn&#x27;t for you because I find that my nail polish does still chip and peel, but hey, the price is good.</li>
            <li> my own nails had a mani once and took it off and redid.</li>
            <li> I still gave this top coat 5 stars since I don&#x27;t believe it promises drying the bottom layers, just the top, and it does a great job of that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with my nail polish peeling &amp; chipping within one day of application, but when I add this top coat, the paint lasts a good 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> I was kind of on the fence about it, but figured I&#x27;d give it a try since everyone raves about it.  </li>
            <li> It looked nice with just that on my nails.</li>
            <li> I got this product after reading a lot about how wonderful &amp; fast drying it is.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been waiting for a good top coat and Seche Vite does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Good top coat, lasted about one week.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great product!</li>
            <li> Nothing has ever made my nails look as nice as Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> You know the kind.</li>
            <li> Drys so fast with a almost glass finish its awesome and makes any polish look brighter!</li>
            <li> I heard so many good this about this</li>
            <li> Has a nice shine to it though.</li>
            <li> Aside from that, this polish speeds up your drying time and makes your polish look spectacular.</li>
            <li> I tried so many topcoats over the years and never found one I loved until this product.  </li>
            <li> WHO are these people who write loving reviews of crappy products ?</li>
            <li> And best fast drying to coat</li>
            <li> However, if you are able to handle that type of smell and are use to thicker top coats then this product would be great for you.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Also gives a nice shine.</li>
            <li> My friends parents own a nail salon, and this is all they use.</li>
            <li> Dries sooo fast and perfectly.</li>
            <li> It was so good, I immediately bought four more.</li>
            <li> I sometimes get pedicures or do my own pedicures.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good top coat for a while.</li>
            <li> I like to do my own nails</li>
            <li> Purchased Seche Vite after having done some online research for a really good top coat.</li>
            <li> My nails and toe nails come out nice with this</li>
            <li> but sometime I wonder if this causes the shrinkage in the nail polish on day two but the quality is nice ...</li>
            <li> A must-have for those who paint their own nails.</li>
            <li> Will keep looking for a good top coat.</li>
            <li> Nice coverage</li>
            <li> Dries really fast &amp; makes your nails look great, salon style!</li>
            <li> I bought this because there were soo many good reviews on it.</li>
            <li> This time around I was able to apply a good coat except for one nail that had an excess amount of Seche Vite pool in one corner and</li>
            <li> But honestly, after it dries, and I wash my hands the smell starts to fade.</li>
            <li> But everyone is entitled to their own opinions of this product, but just a heads up...</li>
            <li> This is a good quality top coat.</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Arrived in perfect condition, the product will please my girldfriend and really recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> Great top coat compared to most out there.  </li>
            <li> I do my own nail art</li>
            <li> Nice and glossy, holds your charms, crystals etc.</li>
            <li> It keeps the polish looking nice longer.</li>
            <li> About as good a top coat as I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This top coat is so good.</li>
            <li> But when they were out of that, I grabbed a bottle of Seche Vite instead, since I&#x27;d heard so many good things about</li>
            <li> I thought it&#x27;d be nice to save some money and skip manicures/pedicures one in awhile and just do them it at home between appointments.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product because I have heard so many great reviews .</li>

            <li> This fast drying top coat provides wonderful shone and extends the length of my manicure.</li>

            <li> It is very easy to use this in 3 sweeps over the nail.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This item has a very strong smell.  </li>
            <li> very easy to fade or peel off</li>

            <li> Has a VERY strong odor</li>
            <li> It chips very easy.</li>
            <li> Its a very strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff has a VERY strong odor</li>
            <li> It also has a very strong scent, so avoid inhaling it.</li>
            <li> when your nail starts to grow out the nail polish on your skin will move with the nail polish on your nail and cause it to peel very easily.</li>
            <li> However, the smell is very strong - almost like a polyurethane smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong.</li>

            <li> But I&#x27;m glad I tried it out, to see how well it would work.</li>
            <li> I use OPI polish and this top coat now exclusively.</li>

            <li> This is my 4th bottle of Seche Vite and I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this top coat because it&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li> Sure, many brands have removed the ingredient, but if it were truly unsafe to use for the purpose for which it was intended, it wouldn&#x27;t be allowed in any brand.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is my go to top coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s my favorite top coat for protecting nail art, as I find it doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear my designs.</li>
            <li> OK, can I give this a MILLION stars?  </li>
            <li> Curiosity got the better of me.  </li>
            <li> It just feels so smooth and nice.  </li>

            <li> I was able to do my nails then run out the door with no smearing or smudging.</li>
            <li> I love to paint my nails a striking shade of crimson</li>

            <li> I love this top coat</li>
            <li> depending on how many coats you apply.</li>

            <li> Its simply the best!</li>
            <li> I love this top coat.  </li>

            <li> Love this top coat.  </li>
            <li> As I continued to use this product over the course of dozens of manicures and pedicures, I grew to love it more and more.</li>
            <li> Seche has been able to pin-point the cause of this thickening</li>
            <li> It happens to ALL nail polishes and top coats.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> AND I LOVE THE SHINE.  </li>
            <li> polishes are more susceptible to peeling when SV has been applied.  </li>
            <li> It seems to happen most in conjunction with OPI polishes.&lt;br /&gt;You may need to replace it sooner than you think.  </li>
            <li> Love love love this product.</li>
            <li> really love the nail polish, but the Toluene bothered me.  </li>
            <li> though I have a problem with the product, I won&#x27;t take away more than one star.</li>
            <li> Ok I kid..</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I got this top coat after reading all the rave reviews on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This top coat works WONDERS.  </li>
            <li> I will buy more.</li>
            <li> This stuff is one of my favorite beauty products.  </li>
            <li> The top coat I put on my toes has lasted over a week.  </li>
            <li> I paid $10 for this and expect a much better product.  </li>
            <li> I never review products but this one really deserves a great one.</li>
            <li> This is THE top coat you need.  </li>
            <li> simply the best.</li>
            <li> , I do my nails more often with this product as the manicure and pedicure lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the ratings for this top</li>
            <li> so I probably wouldn&#x27;t have needed a top coat, except everyone recommended it.</li>
            <li> I use China Glaze polish, this top coat</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how a top coat can get any better.  </li>
            <li> After reading many reviews I decided I had to try this top coat for myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it ever since and just love its protective aspect</li>
            <li> So many products SAY they do this</li>
            <li> This top coat keeps the color from chipping for up to 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smear nail art like most will.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> &quot; that most polish companies have removed from their lacquers and treatments.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Plan to purchase this Top Coat again.</li>
            <li> I make sure to paint all the way to the tip of the nail and over, and never have any issues.</li>
            <li> To the reviewer that says it&#x27;s garbage that a top coat can be applied incorrectly:</li>
            <li> My friend did her nails at my house and told me she didn&#x27;t like the top coat.</li>
            <li> My favorite top coat.</li>
            <li> three more words</li>
            <li> Shine top coat</li>
            <li> After being thoroughly impressed with what I was reading about this product I finally purchased some.  </li>
            <li> So I looked into gel top coats and UV lights.</li>
            <li> and I gotta say I am in LOVE with it.</li>
            <li> I find that if I topcoat my polish every 4 days with this, my manicure stays better and longer.</li>
            <li> Very happy with it, this is the third time I have bought it.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Seche Vite after so many of my favorite nail blogs mentioned it in passing.</li>
            <li> Love this product and ALWAYS have it on hand.</li>
            <li> My daughters love it too.</li>
            <li> great fast service.</li>
            <li> I apply the top coat</li>
            <li> Some things was ok and others was not.</li>
            <li> great top coat, very shiny and</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is a top coat that I have used for years at the recommendation of my nail salon gal.  </li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> My nails chip after 3 days when I use this as a top coat.</li>
            <li> This top coat was the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite nail products.  </li>
            <li> My home manicure is now lasting a week+ because of this awesome stuff.</li>
            <li> i love it so.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get better than this.  </li>
            <li> All the women in my family love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> Even better than Sally Hansen.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite may work for you as it has for many</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found Out the Door to work much better.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Will return to buy &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Therefore, having a way to purchase top quality products so that I can perform my own home manicures is highly important.  </li>
            <li> This is THE go-to top coat for nail professionals.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat</li>
            <li> and I am so pleased that I can find it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> How do you apply a top coat incorrectly??</li>
            <li> But I think that&#x27;s mostly because I use quality polish.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Everyone I let borrow this top coat they always go out and buy it themselves.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Seche Vite top coat from amazon about two - three months ago.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to use it for awhile to give the best review possible.    </li>
            <li> I also recommend making sure you get the sides of your nails.  </li>
            <li> Ican&#x27;t believe people don&#x27;t know about this top coat</li>
            <li> This top coat was ok, but I don&#x27;t understand the hype surrounding it.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for quite a while now and was glad I could find it on Amazon at a better price</li>

            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure to not get it on my skin</li>
            <li> I bring it with me whenever having a mani/pedi because it works better than the salons products.</li>
            <li> what can i say, i LOVE this top coat</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just simply THE BEST !!</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best top coat I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Nothing compares to Seche!! :))</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews about this top coat I had to try it.  </li>
            <li> It almost seems like it melts the top layer of polish and helps it to level itself out.  </li>
            <li> have read that it co-operates with some polishes better than others.  </li>
            <li> I had seen it at Walmart many times but knew nothing about it</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Also it has a much better price than at sally&#x27;s .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the shiniest top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that will work OK and not cause your polish to peel using this top coat.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this top coat.</li>
            <li> Winning combination.</li>
            <li> and i thought nothing could top it.</li>
            <li> And within about 15 minutes i was able to clack my nails together without any tack.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> I had seen a lot of reviews on this top coat, so I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> and I would have to wait about an hour or more</li>
            <li> I love this top coat.</li>
            <li> I have been able to paint on the top coat, brush my teeth, then go to bed, without waking up with sheet marks on my nails.  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use anything else and the price this time was fabulous!</li>
            <li> I love Seche Vite and at the price I got these</li>
            <li> I applied the top coat and waited approx.</li>
            <li> This top coat is my go to ever since i discovered it.</li>
            <li> and i bet you will fall in love with it to when you get to use it.</li>
            <li> but a tip is to make sure to &#x27;wrap&#x27; your nails, or make sure that you coat the tip or edges of your nail and not just the top of the nail.</li>
            <li> Love it and it is all I use now.</li>
            <li> I type all day and can&#x27;t keep nail polish unchipped for more than an eight hour work day but this top coat extended it to two or three days-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of concerned that a cheap replacement was poured in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I really love this top coat.  </li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat</li>
            <li> I love it .</li>
            <li> I have been searching everywhere for a top coat that prevents nail polish from chipping.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I sent to my sisters and they also love.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love Seche Vite.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff for toes and finger nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way better to buy here</li>
            <li> top coat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Haven&#x27;t found a better top coat yet.</li>
            <li> I just bought it at Target (for $9.99, so buy it here on Amazon, FOR SURE</li>
            <li> , when I need more, I will buy here no question), and came home to try it out.  </li>
            <li> stay longer.! :)</li>
            <li> It went on thicker than any top coat I had ever used.</li>
            <li> That is why they have a nail polish thinner that they sale, or you can do as many of us do and add acetone until it thins out to your liking...</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE...</li>
            <li> Also the smell is overwhelming.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what most people want.</li>
            <li> so please do your best to use it outside or in well-ventilated areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bring this top coat with me to the nail salon every time.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this topcoat so many times</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> and I am really glad I did.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite top coat ever.</li>
            <li> It works, just saying so more people know :)</li>
            <li> there are too many negatives to make it any good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can spend all this time painting designs etc, follow through with the seche vite top coat</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE this fast-drying, long-lasting topcoat.  </li>
            <li> but I am so glad I tried it because I LOVE IT!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lovely nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cheapskate, so wish it were cheaper, but this is the most recommended brand by the consumer websites I checked.  </li>
            <li> I love this nail product.</li>
            <li> but I like changing color more often.</li>
            <li> Even if you make sure to paint from edge to edge, after a day, you&#x27;ll see a gap between the edge of the top coat and the skin of your finger.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is my favorite top coat in the world.</li>
            <li> All you need is one healthy coat to seal in you</li>
            <li> I will probably never, ever use another top coat.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite for years.</li>
            <li> I found my go to top coat, looks like gel and protects against chipping</li>
            <li> Then  on top of that, after one day of having the top coat on, my nails started to chip.</li>
            <li> I have been using this top coat for a while now</li>
            <li> and I must tell you I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like magic.</li>
            <li> Also, this top coat does not streak or smudge the polish underneath in any way.  </li>
            <li> I love how this top coat finishes the look on my nails.</li>
            <li> love love love love it.</li>
            <li> I love this topcoat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nevertheless, this top coat changed my nail-polishing life.</li>
            <li> ...let&#x27;s just say that I started out with maybe 20 polishes, but after I found that I&#x27;d actually be able to paint my nails way more often, at any time of day or night, even an hour before going to bed, I now have WELL</li>
            <li> I love my nail salon</li>
            <li> Magic in a bottle.  </li>
            <li> Magic.</li>
            <li> I put on 3 coats of polish and a top coat</li>
            <li> It dries faster than any top coat I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Fastest drying top coat</li>
            <li> have used oil fast drying drops, I wasn&#x27;t truly happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This top coat performs much better than my OPI one.  </li>
            <li> how many layers of polish you&#x27;ve put on to a glassy finish.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to assist any with preventing nail polish chipping, so i might still need to get a non-chip top coat.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try more elaborate designs now.</li>
            <li> like this product OKAY.</li>
            <li> Have been through so many top coats and decided to finally google what was the best.</li>
            <li> My wife loves being able to add a topcoat and speed up the drying process.</li>
            <li> I thought the reviews for this were more BS, and people trying to hype up a product.</li>
            <li> and I have been sent MANY top coats to review.  </li>
            <li> This is above and beyond the best one there is.</li>
            <li> i love love love this nail polish.</li>
            <li> dries fast and leaves nails looking great.</li>
            <li> and it instantly dries them and has a great shine!</li>
            <li> even when I try I always end up touching something accidentally and messing it up.  </li>
            <li> I love this, it def.</li>
            <li> I have ordered 4 more and given them as gift (kept 2)  </li>
            <li> I love this.</li>

            <li> I just love to paint my nails</li>
            <li> I was about to drop $100+ on a gel nail kit when I came across this top coat.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat.  </li>
            <li> Better than the driers in salons or spray</li>
            <li> I will try to find something better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this top coat for about 6 months and have been in love with it ever since.</li>
            <li> This top coat also helps with strengthening your nails.</li>
            <li> And make sure you get the thinner, as this starts to thicken as it gets to the end of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> top coat&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> many times I have to redo my polish</li>
            <li> But this top coat is heavenly.</li>
            <li> My nails looks sooo much better with this top coat.</li>
            <li> Why waist the time to paint your nails if you are not using a top coat?  </li>
            <li> Love this product when there&#x27;s about a quarter remaining it hardens.</li>
            <li> Anywho I love how the finish is and no matter the nail polish from $1 to 30</li>
            <li> This is the holy grail of top coats.</li>
            <li> Chips more than I thought too</li>
            <li> This is the top coat you&#x27;ve been looking for, the magical make-it-stay-and-dry-it-fast dream polish people talk about.</li>
            <li> I love painting my nails.</li>
            <li> I love you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-JR-</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll never buy another top coat again.</li>
            <li> There is a reason it&#x27;s a cult favorite.</li>
            <li> After a week or every 3 days apply another top coat</li>
            <li> &amp; then I used the top coat again &amp;</li>
            <li> I have used out the door top coat for years.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Keeps polish on nails looking fresh and glowing for a good two weeks or more.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really fantastic addition to any lacquerista&#x27;s collection!</li>
            <li> It chips more and more.</li>
            <li> It brings out the colors and designs and it doesn&#x27;t just make my nails shine, it makes them gleam like the top of the Chrysler building, and seals everything.  </li>
            <li> It adds such gloss and shine, it looks great!</li>
            <li> are better than they have ever been</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure that will help.</li>

            <li> I have gotten many compliments on my nails.  </li>
            <li> This continues to be one of my favorite nail products.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this top coat.</li>
            <li> Call me conceded, but I love being able to correct people and tell them I got them done myself.</li>
            <li> But this dries faster and glossier than ANY top coat I have ever tried in my life.</li>
            <li> Additionally, they are so cheap on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Possibly the best I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries almost immediately and unlike most top coats, it won&#x27;t smear the color of ur nail</li>
            <li> With using this top coat I&#x27;ve had many compliments on my nails.</li>

            <li> I love having my nails painted.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love walking around like Edward scissor hands for hours out of fear of messing them up.</li>

            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I am giving this product 5 stars because I have fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li> Ever since i started using it, I ALWAYS finish with the Seche Vite top coat.</li>
            <li> and I put this top coat to finish it, and I swear that she still had the designs after about two months.</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> top coat again.</li>
            <li> Sure it smells like varnish....</li>
            <li> I love the shiny gloss</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> This is the must-have top coat for your manicure.</li>
            <li> but I like variety even with top coats.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a timeless product to add to your top coat collection.</li>

            <li> This top coat is magical.</li>
            <li> I have had better luck with lower priced Sally Hansen top coats.</li>
            <li> Before I used this top coat</li>
            <li> Bought this on a recommendation from a friend and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> A top coat is supposed to protect the polish, but whenever I use this it chips soon after.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it is my go to top coat.</li>
            <li> This top does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> but I still love how it gives a lot of glow.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to buy more of these products.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this has so many five-star reviews.</li>
            <li> how many color coats I did.</li>
            <li> I know that salons love this top coat, so I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> need to buy more.</li>
            <li> It makes polishing my nails frustration free!</li>
            <li> I love the product and I won&#x27;t ever buy another type of top coat again</li>
            <li> i love that.</li>
            <li> I bought this top coat upon recommendation from a friend who works in a nail salon.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite top coat dries nail polish in minutes and gives it a stunning glossy look.</li>
            <li> Here is one product among many cosmetics that just cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> I have more colors than I have nails.</li>
            <li> LOVE  </li>
            <li> but with this top coat it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> This top coat is amaze.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> My longtime favorite fastdry topcoat is Jessica Brilliance, which I still use &amp; keep backups of at home at all times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it 3.5 - stunning finish but too many performance problems.</li>
            <li> I remember this product being better.</li>
            <li> I prefer the SALMA HAYEK NUANCE top coat that you find at CVS.  </li>
            <li> but this top coat still doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite top coat.</li>
            <li> The top coat drys to touch in about a minute</li>
            <li> This has been my &#x27;go-to&#x27; top coat varnish for years.</li>
            <li> Shrinkage issues (has been mentioned in many of these reviews).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the hunt for something better.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> It seems to penetrate the polish more and keeps everything in place.  </li>
            <li> This is my fav top coat just for</li>
            <li> Every polish starts to chip within one or two days, but the fact that this one starts lifting off the nail in one layer (peeling) makes it more susceptible to chipping.</li>
            <li> It makes my nails nice and smooth and keeps the nails looking shiny.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I used to like this Top Coat that I purchased 3 bottles.</li>
            <li> After 5+ attempts with this top coat, I have had no luck.</li>
            <li> This works great for fast drying nail polish.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for many years.  </li>
            <li> Definitely my favorite nail product.  </li>
            <li> My favorite topcoat.</li>
            <li> Will never use anything but this top coat.</li>
            <li> This top coat is a dream.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever buy another type of Top Coat.</li>
            <li> the most it lasts is maybe up to 2 days, then the chipping and peeling begins.  </li>
            <li> and then I finished it off with my Seche Vite top coat :)  </li>
            <li> I absolutly love it.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this stuff, and unlike most men, it will never let me down.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li> and this product is the most chip-resistant polish I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy anything else as a top coat</li>
            <li> I am a master of impatience, but this top coat beats me to my boredom by drying my nail polish</li>
            <li> I would rather paint more often and skip drying time....</li>
            <li> I had tried a Sally Hansen top coat before this one--</li>
            <li> but this one is even better.  </li>
            <li> but a lot of people use this top coat</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this top coat with OPI, China Glaze, Sally Hansen, Julep, Revlon, and Ulta brand nail polishes and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> With this top coat, I can leave my manicure for 3-5 days without reapplying any more polish.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> , I love how it feels on top.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li> I had heard SO many rave reviews about it on YouTube.</li>
            <li> The top coat peeled off the top layer of polish.</li>
            <li> The polish I have on now has been on for 4 days, with just a China Glaze glitter polish on top, and there isn&#x27;t any chipping yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is the top dog of topcoats.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just nothing better.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> As a top coat, I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish and will never use another top coat.</li>
            <li> I love collecting polishes, change colors often and love doing home manicures.  </li>
            <li> I am  not expecting to have any chipping with this manicure with a top coat of this quality.  </li>
            <li> my sis told me about this product and it is the fastest drying top coat ever.</li>
            <li> And Most tend to disappoint.</li>
            <li> if it lasts about a week i sometimes do another coat on top to make it shinier again.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s basically the go-to top coat for any nail enthusiast.</li>
            <li> So, I ran out and bought a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is ok.</li>
            <li> It dries polish almost immediately and has a lovely high-shine finish.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this top coat, would buy again in a heart beat. :)</li>
            <li> I am in love.  </li>
            <li> I love painting my nails almost to the point of obsession.</li>
            <li> I guess by the time I put the top coat on</li>
            <li> yet so I can&#x27;t say anything about the longevity of this top coat</li>
            <li> Not going to lie, I don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li> This is my favorite top coat.</li>
            <li> I have gotten compliments on my nails with this top coat.  </li>
            <li> Using this top coat has made my color stay on for over a week with no chips or peels.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different top coats - and this is the best!</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great top that dries fast.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fall in love.</li>
            <li> The top coat firms up almost immediately</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is in a class by itself, as most polish fans already know.</li>
            <li> my chosen TC would be and Seche Vite always seemed to be the top runner in top coats.</li>
            <li> After I found this top coat, I will never buy another top coat again.</li>
            <li> This is the fastest drying top coat</li>
            <li> i paint my nails often.. have tried many top coats and none compare to this one.</li>
            <li> Better than gel.</li>
            <li> Nothing dries faster than this top coat.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I watch way too many YouTube videos</li>
            <li> and I see a lot of beauty guru&#x27;s raving about this top coat</li>
            <li> Just be sure to apply polish around tips to seal in color.  </li>
            <li> I think this chips easier than my opi top coat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a top coat that dries faster than that.</li>
            <li> Also if you&#x27;re a &amp;#34;picker&amp;#34; like me and enjoying peeling it off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought so many bottles of this stuff I&#x27;ve lost track.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Really smooths out my polish and leaves a great shine.</li>
            <li> Also, after a day or so, I noticed that some of the edges of the top coat was lifting off of the nail polish.</li>
            <li> However after I did more research on it I found out that it contains Toluene :</li>
            <li> Why is this the top selling nail polish?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use to always use the OPI top coat, but this one is so much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper and protects my nails better.</li>
            <li> dries fast and leaves a great shine for days.</li>
            <li> I use this over all of my nail polishes and am always satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Great price, reasonable shipping time, packaged and delivered safely.</li>
            <li> I heard about this top coat on a YouTube channel and figured I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> I will never use another Top Coat...</li>
            <li> As a result, I&#x27;ve tried many on the market.  </li>
            <li> The fact that one must purchase Seche&#x27;s proprietary thinner to be able to get anywhere close to finishing a bottle is a bit deceptive and frustrating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was surely unnoticable to anyone but myself, but I did find that it sometimes resulted in streaking as well.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> However, I do want to see longer wear with better presentation.  </li>

            <li> i had two coats of nail polish and a design with a sparkle top coat.  </li>
            <li> the polish is OK, but I would recommend fixing the smell of the polish.</li>
            <li> I love this, but I am switching to non-toxic nail products.</li>

            <li> Therefore, you can&#x27;t immediately follow with a top coat.</li>

            <li> :)</li>
            <li> if you want only gloss is gonna be perfect</li>

            <li> Simply the best top coat</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on my nails and ever since I started using this top coat people ask me who did them and ask me what I think about gel (they&#x27;re assuming I&#x27;ve got the UV gel nail polish on).</li>
            <li> This will be my go to top coat from now on.</li>
            <li> For the price I just wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> This is really different and wonderful.</li>

            <li> people who love this product,and advertised\\&quot;Sally</li>
            <li> I was expecting the Holy Grail of all top coats.</li>
            <li> For all of its faults though, this top coat had a lot going for it.</li>
            <li> All the same, this is the best top coat I&#x27;ve found to date.</li>
            <li> It saved me from re-doing my home manicure many times.  </li>
            <li> This Top Coat does what it says:</li>
            <li> I have another that gives a jelly top which I do not like but</li>
            <li> This is my favorite top coat.</li>
            <li> ; by a beauty expert and made it onto another beauty expert&#x27;s &amp;#34;top ten best products&amp;#34; list.</li>

            <li> I went by the reviews and everyone said this thing was just phenomenal.</li>

            <li> This is my holy grail top coat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, as I stated before I will not be repurchasing this because of the smell and thickness of the top coat.  </li>
            <li> Literally the fastest drying top coat I have ever used.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;ve reordered my favorite top coat, OPI Rapidry top coat, to replace this.  </li>

            <li> I love painting my nails</li>
            <li> so I would combine it with another to  top coat</li>
            <li> &gt; Am I glad that I finally took the plunge and bought a bottle.&lt;br /&gt; I am not what they call someone who spends a lot of time on &amp;#34;cuticle care&amp;#34; (Pitch Perfect reference *high5</li>
            <li> I love nail polish colors, God knows I have plenty of them.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> My friend told me about this top coat, so I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I will never use another top coat again.</li>
            <li> its salt uses this top coat.</li>
            <li> Have tried many, and no polish can outlast that of one with this topcoat.</li>
            <li> can i say again i LOVE THIS TOP COAT</li>
            <li> It emits quite a toxic smell so make sure to use it in a well ventilated area.</li>
            <li> Just not my favorite topcoat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product and plan to purchase it again in the future.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the packaging used, I ordered two bottles and both arrived intact.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be an airhead like myself... apply as top coat only and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> If some of this top coat lifts off the nail plate and you try to peel it off, all your polish goes off with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on this top coat.</li>
            <li> And believe me, I have tried many.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found faster drying top coats than this like the color club top coat.</li>
            <li> This top coat is one of the strongest I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this top coat.</li>

            <li> favorite top coat.  </li>
            <li> I no longer spend top dollars on nail polish.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a top coat based on Amazon reviews.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best topcoat out</li>
            <li> there- way better than Essie.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li> enjoying it alot..</li>
            <li> as I&#x27;m sure all of you do)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite top coat to use for nail polish.</li>
            <li> This product makes the nails shiny and look healthy on top of the growth system coats.</li>
            <li> Avon UV top coat holds up well as well as OPI top coat, not this seche vite</li>
            <li> i recommend this top coat.</li>
            <li> have not had any problems with any of the above-listed brands in combination with this top coat.  </li>
            <li> The OPI top coat also lasts longer for me.</li>
            <li> I went to the nail salon and fell in love with this nail polish.</li>
            <li> A bottle of top coat from the 99 cent store does a better job.</li>
            <li> So overall this is a great topcoat!</li>
            <li> makes nail polish/nail art stay much more longer</li>
            <li> I love this top coat.</li>
            <li> Seems to resist scratches better than the Sally Henson top coats.</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> Top Coat.</li>
            <li> but shipping would have cost more</li>
            <li> This will even make ok polishes pop.</li>
            <li> i love it and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> I thought my friend was lying when she said that a top coat that dries nail polish in</li>
            <li> I also love how it leaves a glossy glass look.</li>
            <li> It is best to reapply after 4 days to provide the same type of protection.</li>
            <li> I love the stuff .</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this top coat since it&#x27;s a cult favorite but didn&#x27;t want to pay salon price in case</li>
            <li> really love Seche Top Coat</li>
            <li> This is definitely the BEST topcoat I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> and I still love it.</li>
            <li> This top coat does not prolong nail color.</li>
            <li> I apply it as a top coat</li>
            <li> have tried a couple of top coats, from revlon to essie to sally hansen to OPI.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic.</li>
            <li> but most topcoats seem to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes I like to do nail art and paint cute designs.</li>
            <li> When I put this top coat on it flattened out my work-</li>
            <li> in all I love the finish it gives but wish it would stay on longer.</li>
            <li> Love this top coat.  </li>
            <li> I had to try Seche Vite myself before I could believe the hype... and for the most part, it has lived up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Saves EVEN MORE time when you&#x27;re doing your nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but after the 1 day, the nail polish started chipping even faster than without the top coat.  </li>
            <li> I will not buy thing again and will be looking for another top coat.</li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d invest in a better top coat....</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s from Amazon you&#x27;re safe.</li>
            <li> no matter how many layers of nail polish you have on.</li>
            <li> I did not experience any &amp;#34;polish shrinkage&amp;#34; or thickening of the top coat as others have stated.</li>
            <li> just okay.</li>
            <li> However this top coat is literally a godsend and will make your nails look like you went to a salon.</li>
            <li> No need to look for another top coat.</li>
            <li> It stays shiny for a week or more.</li>
            <li> I like this top coat.  </li>
            <li> I will never use another top coat.</li>
            <li> I will just stick with my Loreal top coat..</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how this top coat goes on.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat and every friend I lend it to raves about it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love it.</li>
            <li> , I would recommend it every time for sure</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I used to use China Glaze&#x27;s top coat, but Seche Vite surpasses CG in a way I never could have imagined.</li>
            <li> All in all, I love the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love having polish on my nails, it&#x27;s like an accessory to me.</li>
            <li> and there is something about the brush that is better than most</li>
            <li> Regarding the smell, I feel like every top coat polish</li>
            <li> My favorite nail top coat.</li>
            <li> have seen this at Target, but Amazon&#x27;s prices are always better.</li>
            <li> I cannot explain why this top coat does not work for me when for</li>
            <li> top coat.</li>
            <li> I love painting my nails</li>
            <li> Also, I did not find the smell of the product to be overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> and I have painted my nails using this as the top coat and went to sleep under the covers without any marks in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many times, but it seems to always chip either in the shower, or at school/ work, when I&#x27;m just typing etc.</li>
            <li> but then you get use to it. :-)</li>
            <li> I love how it helps with the chiping though.</li>
            <li> this top coat is awsome</li>
            <li> can polish your nails and put this top coat on and in 5 minutes do anything you want.</li>
            <li> A friend referred this product to me as the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;fastest drying&amp;#34; top coat.</li>
            <li> It works very well for me great product</li>
            <li> used to use OPI top coat</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> &quot; were plausible.</li>
            <li> Glad I gave this top coat another try.</li>
            <li> The top coat was peeling off within a couplehours.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an alternative, buy Sally Hansen&#x27;s Dries Instantly top coat.</li>
            <li> but until there is another top coat that is in any way comparable to this one, I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I started looking for this product after seeing it many times in YouTube videos containing nail art.</li>
            <li> But for setting polish, I haven&#x27;t found a better product yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> AND it&#x27;s way cheaper and more practical than getting your nails done each week.</li>
            <li> It;s the Fastest Drying Top Coat</li>
            <li> Glad I read reviews on this brand</li>
            <li> and I go thru So many bottles as I change my nail art every day .</li>
            <li> Definitely the best topcoat I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Seche Vite Top Coat on Amazon because it was a bit more pricey at every store in my area.</li>
            <li> After trying it out for a while, I bought more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my #1 top coat now.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat.  </li>
            <li> My favorite top coat.</li>
            <li> Where has this top coat been all my life?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Sally Hansen products, Out the Door Top Coat, all of these, and none of them compare.</li>
            <li> You still have to wait a bit before touching your nails to anything but the wait time for me has been drastically reduced.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The edges will shrink in with this top coat.  </li>
            <li> I love you, Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re functioning and digging in your purse within an hour at most.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many top coats and</li>
            <li> Just love it.</li>
            <li> It gives a yellowish top coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars as a neutral review because it does work but to me health wise at the stake of vanity isn&#x27;t really worth the risk.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat.</li>
            <li> Love this top coat.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have used Seche Vite many times before.</li>
            <li> It works ok</li>
            <li> but I like another brand  that I used better.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat.</li>
            <li> It leaves a wonderful shine and last for many uses.  </li>
            <li> then I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d be pulled from the shelves</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and will definately continue to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> Somehow, when the top coat dries, it shrinks in, pulling the polish with it.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this top coat.</li>
            <li> Saw this top coat recommended in a magazine and bought it.</li>
            <li> What could be better?</li>
            <li> Love this top coat.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Top Coat.</li>
            <li> I am in love.</li>
            <li> Just apply the top coat when nails are dull.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> But infinitely better than the hours I used to (unsuccessfully) attempt to wait out!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this at a top coat along with Orly Bonder (orange-y with a purple cap).  </li>
            <li> And to top it all off</li>
            <li> Even over MANY</li>
            <li> So like I said, it&#x27;s made of magic.</li>
            <li> and I am able to do ANYTHING without getting smudges/marks in my nails</li>
            <li> cannot say enough about how great this product is!!</li>
            <li> I have heard about this topcoat from all the favorite nail bloggers, so I just HAD to try it</li>
            <li> and I am in love</li>
            <li> I did my nails yesterday using this as a top coat.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> ; are my two favorite top coats.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I survived before discovering these two top coats.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing at how fast it dries the polish!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this top coat with all my O.P.I polishes, and I have tried many, It prevents any chipping!!</li>
            <li> I paint my nails in a rush before leaving the house, or nights when I have the bright idea of painting my nails right before bed.</li>
            <li> Its fast drying and it paints on very nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d have even better results if I used a high quality nail polish underneath, but it still did a great job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hands down the best top coat ever!</li>
            <li> Hands down, the BEST top coat I have EVER tried!</li>
            <li> Hands down the best top coat!</li>
            <li> but the price is so much higher!!!</li>
            <li> so I ordered this and was very excited about this.</li>
            <li> I was very excited</li>
            <li> Like everyone else I was VERY excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li> Perfect shine, long lasting topcoat, and the best part is it dries nails ROCK</li>
            <li> flat, just perfect!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good top coat - probably one of the better ones I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Excellent, super fast, super shiny topcoat!</li>
            <li> Great top coat, but my dog was highly allergic to it.</li>
            <li> Love how quickly this top coat dries!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously this top coat dries so fast is just amazing and truly makes everything stand out!</li>
            <li> The service was fast and the quality was amazing for its price thank you! :)</li>
            <li> It holds up pretty well for a good week possibly more.  </li>
            <li> a great product that&#x27;s a decent price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time buying this product it has so many good reviews that I decided to give it a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first got this bottle of top coat, I loved it.</li>
            <li> seems like a pretty good top coat.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m in a hurry and my nails look nice and clean</li>
            <li> Totally awesome, I love this top coat and use it for every single time I paint my nails.</li>
            <li> Be warned it does have a very potent odor, but for chip free nails it is more than worth it!</li>
            <li> High gloss, great addition to that home and salon mani/pedi.</li>
            <li> Great product- highly recommend</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick drying, crystal clear, and it gives you a wonderful glossy finish.</li>
            <li> I even like to put on up to 3 coats of my colored polish, and still this top coat creates a really nice seal that hardens quickly and is not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> this top coat is amazing over chunky glitter and makes it super sparkly and your nails will have a smooth/slick surface.</li>
            <li> I like that this top coat dries very quickly, but I wish it was stronger to keep polish from chipping better.</li>
            <li> This top coat is amazing and dries so quickly.</li>
            <li> ..only think it can peel off easily sometimes..must polish on corners or sometimes more than one after a day for better results</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat because my nails are completely dry in minutes instead of hours.</li>
            <li> the best top and dry coat...have been using it for years</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s normally about $10 in stores, so this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Its also great to reapply another coat (especially at the top) if you are noticing any chipping or rubbing off of the color!</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li> but, man its awesome, my nails are not professionally manicured</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty good stuff.  </li>
            <li> love love love amazon for having this miracle polish available.</li>
            <li> She called me the day after she first used it to complain that it wasn&#x27;t any good because her nail polish peeled off in sheets by morning.</li>
            <li> I can get about a week which is pretty good for finger nails.</li>
            <li> Best buy in a long time.  </li>
            <li> The result is beautiful nails that look like they were professionally done.    </li>
            <li> and I absolutely loved it at first</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at it.</li>
            <li> so so much longer thanks to this top coat: your nail&#x27;s best friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a fast drying top coat, but when I started getting more into nail art, I wanted to buy a good one.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve used because it dries my nails so fast and makes my life SO much easier.</li>
            <li> Pretty good sealing coat for nails.</li>
            <li> They looked great, super stoked, right?</li>
            <li> Even after the first chip, my nails stayed looking decent for over a week.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> However, it is not so great if you&#x27;re looking for a protective top coat, the color chipped pretty quickly with this.</li>
            <li> A good top coat, but peels off pretty easily still.</li>
            <li> I am excited to give it a try for myself!</li>
            <li> and I was so excited!</li>
            <li> Its well worth the money though!!</li>
            <li> But SO worth it!!</li>
            <li> Awesome dry time.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I used the nail polish again, and it was dry within seconds, shiny, perfect, no smudge, and just perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and is nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> Love how shiny and strong this glaze is.</li>
            <li> dries quickly and with a nice shine.</li>
            <li> But best thing is it is totally dry in under 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly and leaves a nice shine.  </li>
            <li> Dries nails quickly and leaves an amazing shine.&lt;br /&gt;Peals and chips sometimes.</li>
            <li> It dries very quickly, and is a durable top coat.</li>
            <li> I do like it because it dries quickly, but i dont see anything particularly amazing about the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky if my nail polish lasts 24 hours without chipping to be completely honest.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong, and I&#x27;m sure the chemicals are not the healthiest, but this stuff WORKS.</li>
            <li> ; top coat works just as well, and has a very mild scent.</li>
            <li> Picking/peeling at the nail polish off your nails, this top coat peels off easily...</li>
            <li> do not get any peeling or shrinkage with this topcoat and it dries quickly and with a nice shine.  </li>
            <li> , in the end, I find that this dries quickly, looks nice, and works with a variety of polishes (both those that are &amp;#34;3 free&amp;#34; and those that are not).  </li>
            <li> This is the best nail dry product ever.  </li>
            <li> does have a strong odor, as most polishes.  </li>
            <li> It goes on nice and glosses, dries quickly but peels off within 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be best if applied when the top color coat is still wet.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s kind of fun to peel off the top coat and still have nail polish on</li>
            <li> But overall good product, not so good receiving it.</li>
            <li> The Seche Vite top coat had the effect of softening any mistakes in the polish and letting the colored polish underneath flow into a more perfectly smooth layer.  </li>
            <li> The glazed look you get on the top of your nails will make almost any manicure look fabulous and feel smooth!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really mind the smell, so its all good things for me :)</li>
            <li> I use this top coat faithfully and love it so much!!!</li>
            <li> Great so far!</li>
            <li> The formula penetrates all the layers of ur polish and dries it super fast that way not to mention the shine it leaves is beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time!!</li>
            <li> (+) Dries nails VERY fast, leaves a beautiful sheen, makes nail color very vibrant!  </li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, the price was great, and the product is by far the best fast drying topcoat I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and I&#x27;ve tried just about everyone on the market</li>
            <li> Seche Vite Fast Drying Top Coat is by far the best top coat I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a decent amount of time, and is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> It does get more viscous about halfway through the bottle, but I just add some Orly Thinner and it works fine.</li>
            <li> Im sure the product is fine, but I bought basically nothing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with other top coats, this one is the best.</li>
            <li> This top coat is perfect for covering, protecting, and drying any other polish you are using.</li>
            <li> Great top coat and super fast drying time</li>
            <li> I have used other top coats for my pedicures but this one is the best.</li>
            <li> is the only top coat that dries flawlessly and quickly</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish - dries all layers so quick!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product since it&#x27;s the most top-rated top coat on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Puts a top coat on like getting a shellac manicure and dries so quickly!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other top coat since the time I bought this, it&#x27;s my best friend now!</li>
            <li> My manicures typically last about 5-6 days with this top coat (of course a good quality polish helps!)  </li>
            <li> It is magnificent, fine as on the Picture, corresponds to the Description, fast Delivery, high Quality of a product, I am completely satisfied with Purchase</li>
            <li> It applies smoothly, dries SUPER quick, and will make your nails look amazingly shiny for days and days!</li>
            <li> It makes your nails look shiny and bright, and it&#x27;s a high quality top coat.</li>
            <li> It is a nice top coat and it dries very fast.</li>
            <li> Amazing top coat drys very fast .</li>
            <li> Wow, just used and dries very fast with beautiful shiny coat!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased so many brands of top coats that came highly recommended to me, but this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> Remember to look at factual sources of evidence, and not automatically assume that someone&#x27;s anecdotal \\&quot;knowledge\\&quot; is somehow more accurate.</li>
            <li> I know many enjoy the \\&quot;glossy\\</li>
            <li> product itself, as most others have mentioned, is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Well, I generally have to do my nails every 3 days, but I have had this manicure for about 5 days, and it is still beautiful.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they manage it, but Seche Vite managed to make a top coat that doesn&#x27;t bond to nail polish (and no, I don&#x27;t use cheap Wal-Mart nail polish</li>
            <li> Some of the top coats I looked at where cheaper than this, and stated here was no use for a UV light.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, dries faster than the speed of light, and NEVER smudges!</li>
            <li> Okay, Seche Vite is cheap.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re attentive to detail, you&#x27;ll notice this top coat shrinks around the edges of the nails.</li>
            <li> so far, the best top coat i&#x27;ve ever used, and the fact that it dries really fast boosts the product.</li>
            <li> I have lots of bottles of cheap top coats that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have to re-do the polish or put on another layer of top coat if I&#x27;m trying to smooth out a spot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Well no, it&#x27;s not reasonable because the product is so wonderful that I would pay 3x the amount I paid.</li>
            <li> Please be advised that this is a top coat, so if you still wear cheap nail polish underneath, it may still chip.  </li>
            <li> This top coat is fabulous.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for painting impatient kids nails:) I find myself saying yes to nail painting more often</li>
            <li> if you nick it, the top coat re-seals itself and becomes smooth again.</li>
            <li> This is a really fantastic top coat.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel it helped keep my nail polish on any longer than a cheap brand top coat.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic top coat.</li>
            <li> love nail art in particular and this is the best top coat I &#x27;ve ever tried: it dries super fast.</li>

            <li> The top coat is solid and leaves a beautiful finish to my nails.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s what is most important to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and dries really fast.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if they are good for nails or not.</li>
            <li> I loved this stuff so much I gave a bottle to my mom before I realized it contained the harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> Dies really fast and a good shine.</li>
            <li> The Good: Dries extremely fast.</li>
            <li> The good side of the polish is that it dries fast.</li>
            <li> Price is really good and ships fast.</li>
            <li> I loved it and was ready to rate it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s kind of worth it.</li>
            <li> It dries very easy and quick.</li>

            <li> I was a loyal Out The Door top coat user but after trying Seche Vite top coat I don&#x27;t think I will have to continue my search.</li>
            <li> /&gt;All-in-all I would say that it is the best top coat I have ever used (OPI was my previous go-to)</li>
            <li> I like this top coat because it dries super fast,probably one of the fastest drying top coats .</li>

            <li> Does thicken in the bottle but can be easily restored with &amp;#34;Restore&amp;#34;.Best price @ Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing manicure product I have ever met in my whole life.</li>
            <li> This is my go to top coat, dries fast, leaves nails looking amazing.</li>
            <li> My issue with this is that it can chip easily.</li>
            <li> It comes off easy with polish remover, not like the glitter polish.  </li>
            <li> I will say that Seche Vite dries very quickly, with no bubbles in the polish</li>
            <li> The shipping was very quick, which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> the one downside is it no longer applies easily.</li>
            <li> This stuff dries really fast and leaves a nice smooth finish!</li>
            <li> They bend and break really easily, and growing them out is a b***h-and-a-half.</li>
            <li> Dries very quickly and truly no marks or smudges on your manicure after.  </li>
            <li> Comes off easily with non-acetone and acetone removers.</li>

            <li> and I got the package very quickly.</li>
            <li> Dries fast and when used with OPI nail polish, my nails stay chip free for a good week or so.</li>
            <li> Actually dries my nails at an incredible speed and keeps them smooth.</li>
            <li> I am a mommy to a very hyperactive toddler and this top coat is amazing for me.</li>
            <li> It is such a great top coat.</li>
            <li> chips and peels easily.</li>
            <li> This makes home manicures so easy.</li>
            <li> So its easy to put ripples in your nails from the polish sliding if you run it over something.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries very quickly and even works well with 2 or 3  damp color layers beneath it.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think that a top coat would make a world of a difference on my nails, but it really does.</li>
            <li> and it dries very quickly</li>
            <li> This is a great top coat that makes your polish last days longer and gives any nail color an even look.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I honestly am amazed at how fast this top coat dries.</li>
            <li> As indicated, dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> It gives a great shiny finish, though this doesn&#x27;t last for more than a day, maybe two.</li>
            <li> It seems to come off quite easily and will peel the rest of itself off.</li>
            <li> Your nails chip easily with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Very quick at drying.</li>
            <li> I really need an amazing top coat that seals everything in and keeps chips off.</li>
            <li> but honestly if you want a extremely FAST drying top coat</li>
            <li> It dries fast, and is by far the best on I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> this has easily become a must have for my nails.  </li>
            <li> I am loving this top coat; it really does wonders to the hardest drying nail polish.</li>
            <li> The highlight is that it dries VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> It smooths out the color polish and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> It dries your nail enamel very quick; within seconds.</li>
            <li> It makes the nails look like you put in a lot of work, when it maybe takes five good minutes, just to make sure it&#x27;s completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> Buy with a bottle of Seche Restore because it gets gloppy in the bottle very quickly.</li>
            <li> It makes colors pop and shine and it also allows for glitter polishes to be taken off easily.</li>
            <li> I goes on smooth and really keeps a good finish to prevent chipping.  </li>
            <li> Still an amazing top coat and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> nice polish dries super fast, and nice glow</li>
            <li> I can easily wear my polish for a week before they chip, and that&#x27;s WITHOUT babying them and still doing dishes/etc.</li>
            <li> Easily to peel off.</li>
            <li> I liked that this was a fast drying top coat.</li>
            <li> My nail polish chips easily</li>
            <li> It also dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s not obnoxiously shiny, just an overall great top coat.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t chip easily.  </li>
            <li> This is the best top coat that I have used, and I have used quite a few others.</li>
            <li> It also has the virtue of being very quick drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gel polish is not an option for me because my nails grow very quickly.</li>
            <li> But, it is easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does have a somewhat strong smell.</li>
            <li> It has a strong odor, but that does not affect the quality.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t get over the strong smell.  </li>
            <li> It is durable and strong.</li>
            <li> Also, the odor on this stuff is SOOO strong.</li>
            <li> I was about 10 feet away from it and the chemical smell was so strong</li>
            <li> She said she loved it because it made a so-so DIY manicure look put together and gave a nice lasting gel effect to nails.</li>
            <li> It makes your nails strong while its on.</li>
            <li> It keeps my manicure strong longer.</li>
            <li> She said she loved it because it made a so-so DIY manicure look put together and gave a nice lasting gel effect to nails.</li>
            <li> The top coat is super fast drying and leaves your manicure looking glossy and gorgeous and protected.</li>
            <li> Feels strong.</li>
            <li> Strong chemical smell</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews about Seche Vite before I ordered and used it, so I was well-prepared for shrinkage, peeling, and strong odor.</li>
            <li> but yes, the odor is strong and does linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want</li>
            <li> Smells strong</li>
            <li> This is by far a superior top coat...</li>
            <li> However the smell is really strong.</li>
            <li> (-) Smells strong, doesn&#x27;t prevent chipping, thickens up and requires additional nail polish thinner  </li>
            <li> It does have a strong odor, however.</li>
            <li> and I loved the fact that it gives such a nice shiny finish</li>
            <li> Although (I can tolerate this), there is a really strong smell once I used it.</li>
            <li> The most important thing to me in a top coat is how quickly it dries; followed by shine factor.</li>
            <li> I know all nail polish has a strong smell</li>
            <li> Really strong chemicals in this.</li>
            <li> It is almost painfully strong smelling, but it does it&#x27;s job.  </li>
            <li> It does have a strong odor</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell to it, but it wears off.</li>
            <li> This is a great high shine, quick drying too coat.</li>
            <li> But again, one afternoon of removing stubborn polish, instant dry-time, and a full week or more of a perfect manicure is SO worth it IMO.</li>
            <li> I also love that if your polish smudges at all this top coat fixes that problem right away.</li>
            <li> If you like to change your polish a lot, as I do, this is perfect, because it looks flawless for a few days and then, when it starts to chip, you&#x27;re naturally ready to change to a new color anyway.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite&#x27;s Dry Fast Top Coat is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This gives such an awesome shine to my nails and they dry so fast with an awesome finish.</li>
            <li> Most awesome fast dry top coat ever.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite dry fast top coat is one of the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li> The reviews all said positive things &amp; it seemed just to good to be true.</li>
            <li> I very love this product because it helps me keeping my polished nail much longer.</li>
            <li> This stuff really is amazing and dries my nails so fast!</li>
            <li> It was amazing for the first six months.</li>
            <li> I will still use it because it&#x27;s the best top coat I have found, but if I found something better that wasn&#x27;t so thick and gooey at the end</li>
            <li> The price here was ridiculously good; it&#x27;s normally $10 at Target/Ulta.</li>
            <li> would NOT recommend this product unless you&#x27;re only looking for a beautiful, glossy look for an hour---and even then, there are no guarantees.</li>
            <li> There is a beautiful sheen and your regular nail polish looks like a gel mani!</li>
            <li> It turns any regular nail polish into a beautiful manicure.</li>
            <li> Especially good for dark colors, any brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, seriously the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super quick drying and amazingly shiny.</li>
            <li> This is the best quick dry nail polish I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best, hands down.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with a quick dry spray for the best and fastest results.</li>
            <li> It is the best quick dry I have ever used and cheaper on amazon then stores.</li>
            <li> I had searched Amazon for hours looking through all of the different fast drying top coats, but most of the reviews weren&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li> I only buy this top coat because it dries quickly, and protects beautifully.</li>
            <li> But even better than that it has the most amazing glossy shine!&lt;br /&gt;Despite the thick layer it still does a great job of keeping bubbles from forming in your color coats.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a sturdy and effective everday top coat nail laquer.</li>
            <li> The thinner makes it good as new.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good as new.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good as new.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down the best fast drying top coat that I have ever tried!  </li>
            <li> It is very good, dry fast and more glossy with the color under it!</li>
            <li> I notice though if you apply too many of these top coats it hardens the polish so much that it can break off!</li>
            <li> It brushed on so smoothly, leveling everything off beautifully.</li>
            <li> And by the way, if you do end up buying this product despite my warnings, then fine.</li>
            <li> 95% of my nail polish is just fine.</li>
            <li> I have concerns however about the \\&quot;fine print\\&quot; on the label that reads \\&quot;This product</li>
            <li> The top coat comes out beautifully shiny and doesn&#x27;t drag through the color underneath.  </li>
            <li> I used to try out all those cool nail art designs on youtube, taking my time, perfecting every nail, and then finishing it off with a cheap top coat.</li>
            <li> It dries in less than 10 minutes which is great!</li>
            <li> It works great at first, dries fast &amp; is shiny, but, it shrinks on your nails, pulling the polish away from the edges of your nail.</li>
            <li> It glides on so smoothly and adds a beautiful shine, I would recommend this to anybody who paints their nails regularly.</li>
            <li> It comes on really easily and smooth.</li>
            <li> :) Normally when I paint my nails and do my own thing at night my nails smudge and get all ruined even after I painted my nails like 2 hours before.</li>
            <li> I love how this dries super quick!  </li>
            <li> Seche Vite worked fine, but it was a thicker formula.</li>
            <li> I fell in love the first time i used Seche Vite as my top coat</li>
            <li> Does what it promises - quick dries the polish without bubbling!</li>
            <li> Does its job, dries up quick!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine how quick it showed up!</li>
            <li> yes, quick drying too!</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and keeps your nails from chipping for more than a week.</li>
            <li> This one is tremendous!</li>
            <li> I used to be a LOYAL out the door top coat user, swore I would never switched until someone on a beauty blog mentioned this stuff and gave it rave reviews, so I bought a bottle.</li>
            <li> Got here quickly, too!</li>
            <li> I also love how quickly it dries your nails.</li>
            <li> This top coat dries quickly and lives up to the shine that bloggers write about.</li>
            <li> Dries so quickly!</li>
            <li> Oh and it&#x27;s super shiny!</li>
            <li> I really love the shine and the super speedy drying time.</li>
            <li> It makes my nails super glossy, but my polish comes off faster than it would without a top coat.</li>
            <li> Today my nails are super shiny :)</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it dries in record time, and that the finish is super glossy.</li>
            <li> As a quick drying top coat, it did the job.</li>
            <li> I quickly put another coat of this on top of it before I ran out the door, and within a couple moments it had cured all the flaws of my self-manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This topcoat dries really, really quickly!</li>
            <li> It makes your nails super shiny and gives them salon strength!  </li>
            <li> And it stays super shiny for weeks!</li>
            <li> It also dries quickly which I love.</li>
            <li> Comes out shiny and dries quickly!</li>
            <li> I do another quick coat over top.</li>
            <li> It peels off so quickly!</li>
            <li> It dries SO much more quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and safely.  </li>
            <li> Shiny and quick drying two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I use it for quick manis and to reseal the top coat every couple of days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so super glad</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and in tact!  </li>
            <li> Makes them feel so smooth and strong too.</li>
            <li> Came Quickly!</li>
            <li> and it dries so quickly!</li>
            <li> It provides a super shiny coat and lasts for days and is inexpensive, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> This leaves a super shiny coat on top.</li>
            <li> And, it is super shiny too!  </li>
            <li> It dries really quickly and leaves a lovely shine.</li>
            <li> I love that it dries so quickly.</li>
            <li> This dries so quickly and doesn&#x27;t chip!  </li>

            <li> this is a super top coat.  </li>
            <li> I love this nail polish for its quick drying time.  </li>
            <li> I had so many high hopes for this top coat because it had so many reviews and rah rah comments</li>
            <li> &quot; time (you know... can&#x27;t touch anything or you ding those perfect smooth nails) from hours down to minutes.</li>
            <li> It makes my nails look professional and amazing, and the best part is that it lasts a long time before chipping.</li>
            <li> So I at first was very excited and pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> you really cannot ask for more!</li>
            <li> I normally pay the $6 extra after EVERY manicure, but now I can just add this on myself for sooo many applicant&#x27;s, great!</li>
            <li> :) I searched for so long for a good top coat</li>
            <li> Also, the brush in the bottle might mess up the shininess of your nail because the brush can&#x27;t perfectly polish your nail because it makes your nail bumpy.</li>
            <li> This dry fasy top coat is hands down the best top coat I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> I use super cheap nail polish and just top my nails with this.  </li>
            <li> With the super fast delivery and really good prices...</li>
            <li> good stuff drys super fast.</li>
            <li> great top coat, long lasting and great shine.</li>
            <li> After I ordered the first bottle and tried it, I went back online and ordered three MORE bottles!!!</li>
            <li> It dries so fast so which is perfect for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t have time to wait for nail polish to dry. :)</li>
            <li> Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat is the best product I have found yet for finishing my manicures at home.</li>
            <li> It dries super fast and adds amazing shine to polishes :)</li>
            <li> This gives me the best sparkle by far and dries super fast.</li>
            <li> For my money it&#x27;s the best fast dry top coat out there.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this dry fast top coat is superb.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST fast dry top coat that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> THis is the best fast dry top coat I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the best fast dry top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> the best dry fast top coat i</li>
            <li> It dries super fast and it&#x27;s just an amazing top coat.</li>
            <li> but it certainly looks nice.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the bottle, a very strong paint smell hit me.</li>
            <li> This top coat works well against most dings and it certainly works as directed.</li>
            <li> was definitely impressed with the outcome of this fast dry top coat and is worth it for this price!</li>
            <li> I use Opi, Essie, and China Glaze exclusively because as a healthcare worker the cheap polishes chip after 3 hand-washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great price for this product also, it is double in stores.</li>
            <li> Dries instantly and it leaves my nails looking great.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wondering why this is so cheap</li>
            <li> The bottle was misprinted and looked cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Before I talk about the product itself, I feel that it is important to mention the over-exaggerated topic of toluene.</li>
            <li> I only bought this because of the great reviews.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this stuff is.</li>
            <li> Keeps polish on securely for days.</li>
            <li> Fast drying, nice shiny finish.  </li>
            <li> but it was cheap and looked like it would get the job done.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth I like it</li>
            <li> Plus, my nails were shiny and smooth as glass.</li>
            <li> Think automotive clearcoat - glassy and smooth and awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was that it sometimes peeled off with some nail polishes, but stayed on great with my lacquers.</li>
            <li> You could type or do light work.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that Seche Restore is fantastic for thinning out all brands of nail polish as well, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.      </li>
            <li> I apply a lot in order to have a smooth look and</li>
            <li> Seche Vite fixes my crappiest nail painting jobs, makes the tops smooth as glass.</li>
            <li> I work in a nursing home, so I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands and changing gloves, and this is by far the BEST top coat I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used a TON.</li>
            <li> I use the goopier one to do my free edge.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> Cheap for the money but its also cheap quiality.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t make it worth the $8-$15 that I would routinely pay, hoping for a better result than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do enjoy peeling off my nail polish</li>
            <li> Smooth, glossy, smudge free nails every time.</li>
            <li> The shiny smooth coat it leaves makes people ask me where I got my nails done,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent top dollar on top coats, an gels, and this by far was the best topcoat I have ever received.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, I recommend [[ASIN:B004F82HB8 Beauty Secrets Nail Polish Thinner]] for the great price and big lasts forever</li>
            <li> Smooth like GLASS.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of blog posts touting the amazingness of Seche Vite, but I wasn&#x27;t sure it would be worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Unless a non-chip polish is as rare and mythical as a golden-horned unicorn... :)</li>
            <li> fantastic shine, dries fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Therefore, if you use gloves and are not a crazy hand washer like me, then this product will probably work better for you.</li>
            <li> This product is just fantastic.</li>
            <li> on smoothly without bubbles</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on Seche top coat and how it can help with keeping your polish fresh.  </li>

            <li> This stuff works FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great to go over last minute paint touch-ups on the way out of the door.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use cheap nail polishes either, so i know its not my nail polishes, i use china glaze, orley, essie and OPI</li>
            <li> I love watching all the fun nail tutorials on youtube</li>

            <li> top coat dries almost immediately so no dings to fresh polish.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an absolute must when I do my own and often bring it with me to a salon when they don&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d try this one because it had great reviews and was only $4.</li>
            <li> Dries fast is nice and shinny, recieved it within days.</li>
            <li> Looks great initially, but starts to crack within a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> i was currently using sally hansen which, in my opinion works great</li>
            <li> And it also made my polish so smooth</li>
            <li> It looks fantastic -- like a salon effect.  </li>
            <li> Maybe worth more.  </li>
            <li> Maybe worth more.  </li>
            <li> shine it adds is worth it if you make sure to get your housework done in advance.</li>
            <li> the free quite shipping was a plus.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy salon manis.  </li>
            <li> This topcoat is so smooth and shiney.</li>
            <li> It self-levels into a glassy, shiny, perfectly smooth layer every time.</li>
            <li> It can smooth out textured glitter, nail art and rhinestones.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It finishes your nails off with a shiny &amp; smooth coat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and its wonderful.</li>
            <li> plus it was free because of swag bucks</li>
            <li> Smooth finish also.</li>
            <li> The only problem that I experienced with this product was when I opened the bottle.</li>
            <li> Wish they made this toulene and pthalate free.</li>
            <li> Keeps my polish looking shiny and chip free.</li>
            <li> I was on the hunt for a great topcoat that would help my polish stay on my nails as my polish tends to chip off the same day I apply it.</li>
            <li> This product dries amazing fast.</li>
            <li> Edited 3/4/15 to add the following: The price for three bottles is a great deal.</li>
            <li> It gives a great shine that makes the polish last for days longer.</li>
            <li> Always goes on smooth and even.</li>
            <li> Always goes on smooth and evenly.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S JUST A FANTASTIC MUST HAVE...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford to get my nails filled as often as I should.</li>
            <li> It FILLED IN EVERYWHERE</li>
            <li> My nails were filled in,</li>
            <li> I will admit that it does tend to &amp;#34;scratch&amp;#34; after a few days, so it stops being perfectly shiny.</li>
            <li> seems that they should supply for free if their product is going to act that way.</li>
            <li> I even looked up the sheche restore from this seller which was really cheap too</li>
            <li> Perfectly smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I had heard such great things about this too....</li>
            <li> Thanx Jen fabulous for the suggestion</li>
            <li> One bottle has a lot of product, too, and the brush is really nice at spreading (though sometimes too much polish gets on there).</li>
            <li> Purchased on Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find it in a regular drug store, so I don&#x27;t know if it would be cheaper in a store, but this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and doesnt bubble.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait until their color polishes are available.  </li>
            <li> A shiny topcoat is not THAT important to me.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.</li>

            <li> It dries quickly in a smooth gloss.  </li>
            <li> This is the best..best...best for making your nail polish shiny and smooth.  </li>

            <li> Smooth and shiny finish.  </li>
            <li> Best part is that it is so thick and silky smooth, that when I put it over my bubbling color polish, it smooths all the bubbles out and saves me from having to re-do them all!</li>

            <li> .It dries fast without bubbling up and doesn&#x27;t peel as easily as most top coats.</li>
            <li> That would make it my favorite top coat if not for one thing: it chips my nails super fast!</li>
            <li> No other top coat better than it!</li>
            <li> easy application overall just an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Excellent dry fast plus it adds a varnish to a Matt Colour!  </li>
            <li> I have tried SO may different top coats because I love to have shiny, clean looking nails, and have finally found the best one!</li>
            <li> The polish gives a wonderful finish and very shiny so at first I was so happy with this product only to find out this top coat does not last,</li>
            <li> My polish and this top coat peel right off soon after application.</li>
            <li> Well, the reviews are right, and this top coat lives up to the hype.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t plan on becoming pregnant for awhile</li>
            <li> I bought this top nail coat due to the great reviews, and I must say that it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, I can use the brush full and not worry that it&#x27;ll run off.</li>
            <li> LOL I&#x27;ve now discarded all my other bottles of top coat--</li>
            <li> Only top coat to use!!  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff religiously, and LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> This will be the last top coat you ever try!!</li>
            <li> It peels off in one whole sheet, ugh!!!</li>
            <li> I am a very busy girl and a very creative one at that.</li>
            <li> Received quickly and in good, new condition.  </li>
            <li> This is seriously the BEST top coat I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It dries super quickly which I absolutely love.</li>
            <li> I liked this fast drying top coat, because it does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ended up with too many full bottles of top coats I no longer use and they can be very expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I thought it was too good to be true, but after five or ten minutes I was able to rummage through my purse, pick eye goops out of my dog&#x27;s eyes, and then wash my hands (because eww, eye goops).</li>
            <li> On the positive side:  it dries quickly and leaves nails with a nice shine.  </li>
            <li> best top coat ever- can use on wet nails and it dries super fast.</li>
            <li> I think this is largely because of the glossy and clear finish I get from Seche Vite--though I will take credit for the years of experience, but a manicure or pedicure won&#x27;t look professional no matter how good you are if you don&#x27;t have a good top</li>
            <li> It is a very good top coat that does dry pretty quickly and stays shiny.</li>
            <li> No seriously this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, dries quickly, and is ultra-protective.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite top coat I&#x27;ve ever owned because it dries SUPER fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also read a lot of complaints about it chipping super easy.</li>
            <li> It is strong smelling and says not to be used if you&#x27;re pregnant.  </li>
            <li> Also important, I did not wake up the next day with sheet and pillowcase imprints in my nails-- nice!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the super strong smell</li>
            <li> My favorite top coat for normal polish AND KONAD STAMPING.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is my absolute favorite fast drying nail top coat EVER!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite topcoat!  </li>
            <li> This is my new go to top coat!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.g makes your manicure look amazing, and makes doing it easier,  I&#x27;m sold.  </li>
            <li> Very fast drying top coat</li>
            <li> Dries very fast and lasts longer than most topcoats.</li>
            <li> This top coat dries very fast</li>
            <li> Not only does it dry in no time,it also keeps my mani in great shape for two weeks or more!!</li>
            <li> It leaves a surface that is smooth and super shiny, and it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> The very BEST aspect, though, is that it really DOES dry in a minute or so.  </li>
            <li> It smoothed out bumpy polish, dries fast, and leaves a nice salon worthy shine.</li>
            <li> This is the best fast dry polish I have ever used.</li>
            <li> would say this is more ideal for people who need their top coat to dry quickly, but don&#x27;t mind changing their polish frequently.</li>
            <li> I must say it drys extremely fast, my nails are almost instantly dry, which is Great!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this fast dry nail topcoat for 20 years and it is the best!</li>
            <li> The BEST feature is its fast dry formula.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite Dry Fast Topcoat is the best topcoat on the market.</li>
            <li> This fast dry nail coat is the best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I really like this nail polish, I use it as a top coat and dries faster that most top coats ( aprox 2 mn to dry) love it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull the polish back as it dries and that is amazing!</li>
            <li> Shortens significantly life of nail polish.</li>
            <li> I could never get nail polish to last more than a day until I discovered this top coat!</li>
            <li> I originally tried this product based solely on its description on another website.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this after the first use.</li>
            <li> Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> and I was really excited to receive it.</li>
            <li> A small price to pay for an excellent topper though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the best way to describe it...</li>
            <li> My nail polish rarely chips now!</li>
            <li> My first trial run with this top coat was over three coats of OPI.</li>
            <li> pretty neat top coat -</li>
            <li> It reminds me of the way i felt when i first discovered Magic Erasers.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I ordered several more bottles for Christmas gifts and all my friends love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Totally worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> but luckily the product itself was fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must, it will make the formula return to it&#x27;s original texture.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Seche top coat from my nail salon.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought this top coat after seeing it reviewed elsewhere.</li>
            <li> originally wrote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten more and more into doing my nails at home, and have tried a dozen different top coats.</li>
            <li> is that if you apply another coat over the original it peels sometimes.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is supposed to do, and much more.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical of the claims of others but this is the best top coat ever!</li>
            <li> So i was so excited for this product when i received it.  </li>
            <li> Even cheap, low quality polish can look amazing with this top coat.  </li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Love it thanks!</li>
            <li> NO shiny nail polish in the world is worth that risk!</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> It adds a great shine and helps keep the polish on much longer than most other top coats that I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure if they ever stop making it I&#x27;ll die and then never do my nails again.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> , my first time using SV top coat, I waited about 10 minutes before applying it.</li>
            <li> oh my goodness, it dries super quick!</li>
            <li> Worth taking time to research and find this online!</li>
            <li> /&gt;IT is great and also covers up any minor flaws that might have happened in the process.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the cost scare you away, it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I am so excited that I can use my polishes I have been collecting.</li>
            <li> Well I purchased Seche Vite top coat, and it really lived up to the hype!</li>
            <li> I am so excited.</li>
            <li> and I promise it will be worth it!</li>
            <li> and i got all excited.</li>
            <li> I heard of this top coat from many beauty bloggers and thought I would give it a try when I ran out of my last top coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be coming back for more, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this stuff, and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li> This puts such a nice shinny coat on my nails!</li>
            <li> I always believe in spending more money for higher quality beauty products.</li>
            <li> Scrubbing and cleaning my bathrooms, hanging a light fixture, painting, and working a full work week.</li>
            <li> This top coat dries super quick and its super shiny.</li>
            <li> I use another quick dry product afterwards but the quality and consistency of the Seche V is really perfect compared to my old top coat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing Essie right now, and it looks perfect after a day and a half.  </li>
            <li> It was very easy to apply, not to thick, and it did not smudge my beautiful nail art.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to weight minutes for my nail polish to dry, this top coat dries fast and leaves a beautiful shine.</li>
            <li> Honestly I have not really seen a difference in my nail polish not chipping when I use this top coat vs other top coats, but I am committed to it because it&#x27;s so shiny!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different top coats and this one is hands down the BEST out there.</li>
            <li> Leaves my new nails nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> It also gives it a smooth shiny finish and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> a toothpick or something to clean any run off asap</li>
            <li> Like it takes it off so cleanly that I don&#x27;t need nail polish remover before repainting my nails.</li>
            <li> It dries fast, gives you a glossy finish that lasts for days, and really keeps my nails looking good.</li>
            <li> My favorite top coat by far.</li>
            <li> Put it on my nails and they are practically perfect, WEEKS later!&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic clear coat that does not yellow.</li>
            <li> It is really a great product and worth the price when applied correctly and properly maintained.  </li>
            <li> Makes your nail polish--even multiple layers--dry super quickly and gives a great shine.</li>
            <li> If you are willing to smell that for a short amount of time, you will reap the rewards of having a rock-hard, beautifully covered, and glistening manicure.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite dries fast enough to counteract my clumsiness, and it dries to a really incredible shine.  </li>
            <li> It dries to the touch in just a couple of minutes, and leaves my nails with a super smooth, glossy shine.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and dries quickly, as promised.</li>
            <li> but on the inside is different, and I have a feeling that this one might be some kind of ripoff, though I have no way to be sure.</li>
            <li> With this top coat i have noticed less smearing of the colors in my nail art, and it provides a nice smooth top of my nail as it seems to help level out any bumps from said nail art.</li>
            <li> Because the Goddess of Love wants you to have fabulous nails and a manicure that lasts for a week.</li>
            <li> And if you put two hours into the effort of doing your nails, you kind of want your end results to last more than Monday to Wednesday, if you&#x27;re lucky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and leaves a silky smooth finish over the nail.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my nail super shiny and smooth</li>
            <li> The only thing that kept me from giving this top coat a 5 star rating is the fact that no matter how much i try after 3 or so days the top coat seems to have shrunk on my nail, leaving the edges of my nail polish exposed without top coat while the rest of the nail still has top coat.</li>
            <li> It dries so quickly and leaves nails looking shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> course, most of these things occur only with acute exposure, so &#x27;they&#x27; say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I garden, go camping, shooting, cook clean and do dishes.</li>
            <li> I have more luck with using just a clear glitter polish as a top coat.</li>
            <li> Even after getting a professional manicure done I put this on top of it when I get home to make it look even better.</li>
            <li> It dries so, so quickly and leaves a smooth, even finish.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and dries so quickly  </li>
            <li> I do my own nails with regular nail polish and this top coat and my manicure lasts for up to two weeks before signs of chipping begin to show.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time researching good top coats &amp; came across Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> With Seche Vite, you still need to be careful with your nails for an hour or so, but with Poshé you&#x27;re good to go in like 10 minutes, 15 at the most.</li>
            <li> I wash dishes, clean house, do yard work,</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite top coat.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong solvent odor, but it&#x27;s worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The only downside to this is that it doesn&#x27;t smell so pleasant.</li>
            <li> My original order got lost in the mail, contacted the company and they sent another right away!</li>
            <li> this top coat is hands down AMAZING!</li>
            <li> There were so many positive comments about this product, I felt I just had to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> when college tuition is far more a priority!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product so far!</li>
            <li> Within the first couple of weeks after I puchased it, I already had a few of my friends place their own orders because they couldn&#x27;t believe how great my nails looked.  </li>
            <li> Super fast delivery I have ever had!!!</li>
            <li> Super shiny, dries super quick,  and lasts!</li>
            <li> This stuff drys my polish so quickly and leaves such a nice shiny coat!  </li>
            <li> This top coat really DID dry super fast, I was impressed!</li>
            <li> The color I chose was a beautiful green color that resembled something you&#x27;d see on a tropical island, it was so shiny and strong.</li>
            <li> It dries the polish so quickly and with a beautiful shine minus the bubbles.</li>
            <li> So far, this is my favorite, fast drying top coat for most nail polishes.</li>
            <li> I really like this top coat - it does what it says it&#x27;ll do - it dries fast and leaves a shiny and smooth top coat.</li>
            <li> Love this product- fast dry and great shine.</li>
            <li> Great top coat dry really fast</li>
            <li> Dries out to fast, but other than that its a great buy!</li>
            <li> Great top coat, just gets super gloopy after a few months and you have to replace.</li>
            <li> It dries incredibly fast which is great for me because I&#x27;m not always the most patient person when it comes for waiting for nails to dry...</li>
            <li> &quot; top coat dry almost instantly after application, leave my nails with a glossy sheen, and best of all...</li>
            <li> just make sure not to inhale the fumes before the top coat is dry and do not ingest (that means no nail biting, or teeth picking, or anything of that nature with this top coat on)</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a great top coat that also helps dry your nails fast.</li>
            <li> This top coat dries super fast, and leaves my nails smooth and shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good quick dry top coat that is shiny and gives you the glassy look that Seche Vite does, I recommend Poshe Super Fast Drying Top Coat.</li>
            <li> the more the polish will come off in a large chunk.</li>
            <li> &quot; large name brand top coats.</li>
            <li> Its just right!</li>
            <li> She was right!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right!  </li>
            <li> She was right!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even gotten into bed right after and no sheet marks!  </li>
            <li> And they were absolutely right!</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law told me about this product and she was right!  </li>
            <li> and I heard right!</li>
            <li> The gloss isn&#x27;t overbearing, and it isnt underwhelming, for me it is just right!</li>
            <li> , right!</li>
            <li> Some of the nail polish didn&#x27;t dry very nicely, looking matte instead of shiny.  </li>
            <li> This is a great quick dry.  </li>
            <li> but I wanted something to increase their shine after a few days and this product is doing a very good job.</li>
            <li> Though it smells very strongly it works with any polish and is now the only top coat I recommend.</li>
            <li> It makes my nails hard, shiny and close to flawless for the bulk of a week.</li>
            <li> I was super excited when I got it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this top coat if you enjoy nail art because it doesn&#x27;t smudge your designs.</li>
            <li> I really love the way my nail polish is dry immediately after the top coat with out using a gel polish!</li>
            <li> Makes a beautiful hard, shiny shell on top of your nail color, but can be brittle  and chips if you accidentally slam your fingernail on a surface.</li>
            <li> I do  a lot of typing at work and nail polish chips off easily, but it&#x27;ll usually last days longer with this top coat!</li>
            <li> Not only is it a terrific drier, it&#x27;s also a very good top coat.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of dry fast top coat brands, and SECHE VITE is THE BEST by far!</li>
            <li> Arrived in great shape, when expected.</li>
            <li> so it works great for a quick dry and a glossy finish!</li>
            <li> Dries my nails pretty fast and leaves it with a nice shiny finish.</li>
            <li> First of all the price was really good which surprised me.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t check whether or not this polish was three free (no toluene, dibutyl phthalate, and formaldehyde) or not when i purchased it; i was simply going by the reviews of my peers, who said that this was their very favorite topcoat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if you can get past that, it&#x27;s a really great top coat.</li>
            <li> Was a great price and came as expected.</li>
            <li> It looks nice at first, but then peels way too fast.</li>
            <li> I change my polish often so I can appreciate a fast drying top coat.</li>
            <li> Good stuff but can buy locally.</li>
            <li> i really like this top coat except that it smells horrible(but</li>
            <li> Love this fast nail coat.</li>
            <li> I really like this top coat</li>
            <li> Compared to Salley Hansen, Out The Door, and Essie, Seche Vite comes out on top if you really don&#x27;t want to wait.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really delighted and just bought a second bottle.</li>
            <li> Much stronger than any top coat I have used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This top coat dries really fast, in about 5-10 minutes</li>
            <li> it is really glossy and makes your nails look fabulous!</li>
            <li> Bottle is all the way full.</li>
            <li> I really would like to give this a better review.</li>
            <li> I work in healthcare full time</li>
            <li> and me I spend a lot of money on good products to ensure that I only have to do my nails either once</li>
            <li> I had never bought a fast drying top coat before.</li>
            <li> I almost get a full week, depending on the polish.</li>
            <li> I never had a top coat polish work as fast as this one .</li>
            <li> which is still a twice as fast (and 10 times as cheap!)</li>
            <li> I have absolutely zero complaints about this top coat.</li>
            <li> Although the shine wasn&#x27;t there, but I was satisfied with the fast drying attribute.</li>
            <li> but I really think it&#x27;s the top coat that&#x27;s keeping my polish</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample and was so amazed by the product that I immediately bought the full size.</li>
            <li> and now I do them all the time, thanks to this top coat.</li>
            <li> With this as the top coat it lasted for almost a whole week.  </li>
            <li> Love how it drys so fast.</li>
            <li> I love it so much, it is defenitly a must</li>
            <li> so you know for sure that it&#x27;s a real thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about it is that it dries sooo fast.  </li>
            <li> They look and feel better than the fast drying drops.</li>
            <li> My fave fast drying top coat... works immediately</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li> I do my nails, and I&#x27;m good to go 10 minutes later.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping :-)</li>
            <li> Overall the polish is good</li>
            <li> but I think Essie&#x27;s top coat is comparable and doesnt ssmell so much.</li>
            <li> Another really loved effect of this polish is that it creates a solid, almost gel-like topcoat.</li>
            <li> I heard of this top coat from a lot of nail art gurus and figured for the price it sounded reasonable.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love it, but too often it has peeled or chipped off my nails in just an hour.</li>
            <li> I love how fast it dries and leaves an acrylic nail finish and</li>
            <li> It keeps  your polish in place and looking quite good for a lasting amount of time.</li>
            <li> It dries polish almost instantly and adds a gorgeous shine.</li>
            <li> I was able to get a price match at a target store so thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also true that it does well about not chipping.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even been able to get my polish to stay on a whole day.</li>
            <li> It dries incredibly fast and most people assume my nails are gel names.</li>
            <li> fast drying top coat for nails.  </li>
            <li> Finally a top coat that looks like a gel mani and dries FAST.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Dries MUCH faster and with a thicker, more non chipping coat.</li>
            <li> Fast Top Nail Coat to apply rhinestones.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Revlon&#x27;s top coat, which is ok, but nothing compares to this, and at such a cheap price, why not buy this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes your nails so shiny :)  Drys SO fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about this top coat and decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Definitely a very glossy top coat.</li>
            <li> I work full time</li>
            <li> It is a nail art fanatic&#x27;s best friend!</li>
            <li> It comes off the brush looking thick, but it glides onto the nail perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I guess that happens because the top coat bonds so much to the polish?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many polish bottles and fast drying products.</li>
            <li> try NYC fast drying top coat from Walmart.</li>
            <li> I really like this top coat.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s fast drying ability is outstanding, I can&#x27;t get over  the shrinkage effect.</li>
            <li> I really like the top coat.</li>
            <li> I use Essie brand nail polish exclusively and it works really well with the Seche top coat.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> A wise woman once said, &amp;#34;A woman is only helpless while she waits for her nail polish to dry.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, between you and me, I don&#x27;t like to be helpless...</li>
            <li> As far as top coats go on a regular manicure this is great.  </li>
            <li> Like my title suggests, I love how fast it dries my nail polish.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this.</li>
            <li> and it dries really fast love</li>
            <li> It is fair enough.</li>
            <li> Dries fast, smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> Good for someone like me who always tends to do my nails last minute</li>
            <li> I use this one in a pinch, and Dior fast drying topcoat when I have more time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in the name and it&#x27;s definitely true.</li>
            <li> Great for a manicure that needs to dry super quick,  however your nails chip within 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> I really really wanted to love this</li>
            <li> Now with this fast drying top nail coat, I never have to do that again.</li>
            <li> Unbeleivable price for such good quality.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite topcoat.</li>
            <li> This top coat is shiny and dries fast, BUT...</li>
            <li> I like this top coat because it dries fast.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this top coat is how fast it dries and therefore dries my whole manicure.  </li>
            <li> It dries so fast and makes any polish look better.</li>
            <li> An overall good purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like this top coat.</li>
            <li> The morning after applying this admittedly fast drying top coat, I watched bits of my nail polish start chipping off while just sitting in a meeting.  </li>
            <li> I really like this top coat.</li>
            <li> I used to always use China Glaze&#x27;s Fast Forward top coat.  </li>
            <li> I love how fast and shiny, but  </li>
            <li> It is a fast drying top coat.</li>
            <li> I cannot the smell but overall good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all true.  </li>
            <li> I really like this top coat.  </li>
            <li> The reason being that it is such a good coating that no oxygen gets through AT ALL (either that or</li>
            <li> with washing dishes by hand &amp; giving kids baths, my opi &amp; this top coat lasted 1.5 weeks before I had to really repaint.</li>
            <li> Love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This was not at all true for me.  </li>
            <li> It is truely a miracle in a bottle.  </li>
            <li> Roll Call, A True Prison Story of Corruption and Redemption</li>
            <li> Sure, it dries fast, but it makes my manicure chip within one or two days.</li>
            <li> I can get a good full 7 days with no chips, only tip wear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t repurchase, but not a bad product.</li>
            <li> True that it doesn&#x27;t smudge the design, but what good is it if the polish comes off the next day and the design is ruined.</li>
            <li> the smell that some describe was not bad at all</li>
            <li> Really does dry very fast - great product!</li>
            <li> Love how quickly my nails dry with this top coat!</li>
            <li> Loving it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks &#x3D;) easy to use and strong fast dry!</li>
            <li> As someone who takes the time to sit down and do beautiful nails (stamps, art, jewels, tape)</li>
            <li> In my opinion it works best with a glitter colors, since glitters, for me, are super hard to remove anyway.</li>
            <li> , it dries very fast, hardens over the nail polish leaving it feeling strong and un-chipable.</li>
            <li> The most amazing fast dry top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat in the game right now</li>
            <li> I would recommend this top coat to anyone who loves doing their own nails and hates waiting around for them to dry.</li>
            <li> The top coat dries FAST and gives your nails a super glossy shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many topcoats and this one is worthy of its high ratings!</li>
            <li> As much as I can appreciate a topcoat that dries as quickly and glossy as Seche, I would rather wait a bit longer or even use two coats of a formula that works better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As much as I can appreciate a topcoat that dries as quickly and glossy as Seche, I would rather wait a bit longer or even use two coats of a formula that works better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super fast drying top coat.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve gone through about a dozen top coats, all promising amazing shine, quick dry, no chip, blah blah, and never have any of them lasted me more than a couple days.</li>
            <li> As others have said - this top coat dries SUPER fast (within a minute or 2)</li>
            <li> They looked as fabulous as they did right after I painted them.</li>
            <li> Great top coat, makes nails look professionally done, even if you&#x27;ve messed up the color a little, this nail polish will smooth out the look!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE how quickly this dries, but other than that</li>
            <li> If you want something that goes on easily, dries quickly and finishes off your manicure with a nice shine, look no further!</li>
            <li> and it is true, it sets and dries quickly</li>
            <li> My polish dries super, super fast, if I use this top coat over it.  </li>
            <li> Has made my manicures so much better - thanks mainly to the fact this top coat dries before I have a chance to wreck what I have painted.  </li>
            <li> It does dry quickly, as promised, and leaves the polish smooth and gorgeous for days.</li>
            <li> but it does have a pretty strong smell..</li>
            <li> This by far is the best quick dry I have ever tried</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried every kind of quick dry top coat in the market and nothing seems to work quite like sech</li>
            <li> Helps speed up dry time and leaves a nice shine!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty strong</li>
            <li> It dries my nails super fast and is super smooth!</li>
            <li> It really dries so fast it is like magic!  </li>
            <li> This top coat dries super fast and is super shiny.</li>
            <li> I feel very comfortable doing whatever after only 2 or 3 minutes with this top coat.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the high end stuff was good enough to spend $15 more a bottle.</li>
            <li> It never seemed to prevent my polish from chipping; actually, whatever top coat the Vietnamese ladies use at my cheap neighborhood nail salon is far superior in terms of chipping.</li>
            <li> Love love love and will absolutely order again when I&#x27;m getting low.</li>
            <li> The product is good, but the price is a little more than I what I wanted to pay for it.</li>
            <li> I love how fast it dries and it is really shiny!!</li>
            <li> The overwhelming amount of positive reviews led me to Seche Vite&#x27;s Dry Fast Top Nail Coat, and I&#x27;m pleased to say this product lived up to its many praises.</li>
            <li> I had very high hopes for this though, even being exceptionally cautious and thorough, but it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat dries super fast to a beautiful shine in a minute.  </li>
            <li> I went from perfect, shiny, colorful nails to dull, chipped nails.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this polish, has amazing shine and dries super fast!</li>
            <li> Really shiny and nice, dries super fast</li>
            <li> Dries super quick and shiny.</li>
            <li> Dries super quick and looks so glossy</li>
            <li> Seche Vite dries so quickly</li>
            <li> Adds a lot of shine to your manicure and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Its also super shiny and brings whatever mani-pedi</li>
            <li> glossy, dries quick, inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> But I will keep using it since it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I even tried using another top coat on top of this one, and had same results.</li>
            <li> It dries so quickly.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly, and my nails have yet to chip (longest I&#x27;ve went</li>
            <li> dries nail polish super quick, I&#x27;m never without it.</li>
            <li> Since I touch up between fills, this dries it quickly</li>
            <li> This top coat was recommended to me by friends who had tried multiple top coats.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to go through multiple top coats to find this.</li>
            <li> Super product.  </li>
            <li> but luckily I didn&#x27;t throw it out.  </li>
            <li> It dries amazingly quick and is the shiniest I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It makes every normal manicure super strong and super quick drying!</li>
            <li> Super shiny</li>
            <li> Shipped really quickly.  </li>
            <li> So it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t bother me because it fades quickly.  </li>
            <li> It dries amazingly quick.</li>
            <li> Great thick top coat.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it will not prevent your nails from chipping, so after you apply this top coat, i would recommend using a chip-proof top coat over it.</li>
            <li> quick</li>
            <li> I have bought many top coats from various manufacturers over the years.</li>
            <li> quick drying</li>
            <li> I was super dissapointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> It makes the nails look super shiny while protecting them.</li>
            <li> Dries super</li>
            <li> I was amazed by how quickly it chipped.</li>
            <li> You could spend 10 minutes on your perfect mani and ruin it the second you stick your hands in the washer to get out your laundry or the second you pick up your kiddo.</li>
            <li> Protects well and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Gives your polish that hi-gloss &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look because of how quickly it sets  </li>
            <li> I think it dries way too quickly for any bubbles to pop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying it loyally for 10 years now.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t chip, which is great, but when it wants to come off, it comes off all at once in a giant sheet.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quick,</li>
            <li> The biggest thing I like about this topcoat is that it dries extremely fast, safely sealing in your fresh polish.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve try lots of top coats, from the basic of BEAUTY SECRETS to SALLY HANSEN, and many others.</li>
            <li> Dries polish quickly and helps color stay on.</li>

            <li> Drys nails quickly and adds unparalleled shine.</li>
            <li> is it does not leave nails super shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for better no chip top coat from my current Sally Hansen Mega Shine.</li>
            <li> If you are in hurry and need a quick nail spruce up, Seche Vite is the way to go.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this product many times and it is the only top coat I have used in years.</li>
            <li> im good for a few more days too</li>
            <li> I finally added this to my cart to get free shipping, and it is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Quick drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many different top coats</li>
            <li> I would get about 2-4 days of wear, if I was lucky.</li>
            <li> It seems thick going on but dries flawlessly smooth and brilliantly shiny.</li>
            <li> While it dries quickly, it leaves some &amp;#34;bubbly&amp;#34; patches on my nails, which are rather unsightly.</li>
            <li> and it dries fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> but it dries quickly</li>
            <li> Makes nails super glossy and dries the polish faster.  </li>
            <li> this is my favorite top coat that I will definitely repurchase time and time again.</li>
            <li> Then, on top of that this morning, I stamped a design on top of the Seche Vite with White On by Sally Hansen then put on another coat of the Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different top coats.</li>
            <li> plus it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a \\&quot;quick dry\\</li>
            <li> Seche Vite dries extremely quickly, and SO shiny</li>
            <li> Not as quick as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li> Quick fix maybe...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use my Jordana Quick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that this dries out rather quickly</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, as advertised, and after 4 days wear, it&#x27;s still just as shiny as when I applied it.</li>
            <li> Dries out too quick.</li>
            <li> Simply put, I love this top coat.</li>
            <li> AND it&#x27;s super shiny</li>
            <li> Super shiny and prevents chipping, would buy again and again.</li>
            <li> And it also leaves a super glossy touch to it.</li>
            <li> Nothing has been as good as the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Nail Coat.</li>
            <li> Drys quickly and seems to last better than many others.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly</li>
            <li> Dries quick, but &#x27;causes a lot of shrinkage and cracking of the polish, and didn&#x27;t wear any longer on my nails.</li>
            <li> This stuff dries so quickly</li>
            <li> And watching my fresh, bright red nail polish fall off in bits all over the table.</li>
            <li> Dries super quickly.</li>
            <li> It dries so quickly.</li>
            <li> It smooths out any unevenness and dries super glossy and almost makes it look like you&#x27;ve used a gel.</li>
            <li> I have used many different top coats.  </li>
            <li> It looks beautiful, lasts long, it&#x27;s super glossy and dries fast.</li>
            <li> Super shiny and elongates the life of any nail polish regardless the brand.</li>
            <li> Gotta use this quickly.</li>
            <li> it evaporates quickly.</li>
            <li> However, I do make sure to seal the tips of my nails to make the manicure last longer. :)</li>
            <li> You can basically glob it on and it still dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t cause any discolorations.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Dries quick with a almost gel like finish.</li>
            <li> dries quick.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different top coats and this one ROCKS.</li>
            <li> For me it doesn&#x27;t increase the length of my manicure but it dries quickly</li>
            <li> It dries so quickly, and dries the layers underneath.</li>
            <li> It dries super quick although the smell is pungent, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and well packed.  </li>
            <li> Super glossy.</li>
            <li> It is super shiny doesn&#x27;t smudge designs or stamping nail art.</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever, dries very hard and fast.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as a top coat for your nails.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended :)</li>
            <li> Highly recommend trying this top coat polish.</li>
            <li> I would DEFINITELY recommend doing business w/ Pro Concepts because my item was shipped fast, arrived quickly, and packaged very nicely so that the contents remained in tact and w/out damage.  </li>
            <li> For best results, apply Seche Vite in normal brush strokes and then seal it in by horizontally running the brush along the edge and slightly underneath the nail.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great - it does what it says it does, which is dry your nails FAST!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Super hard, so far the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> My nails dry much quicker, the shine looks great and the drying time is significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> Dries fast, no smudges, makes your manicure last, and does not blur your design, love it!!</li>
            <li> No other top coat I&#x27;ve tried dries as quickly!</li>
            <li> Super shiny and super fast dying!!...</li>
            <li> If you enjoy painting your nails you really need this in your arsenal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that after 5 minutes of applying the product you should be able to resume normal activity.  </li>
            <li> Love this topcoat and will never use any other kind or seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of other sprays, drops, and polishes that claim to be quick-drying, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It isn&#x27;t instantaneous, but faster than normal top coat.</li>
            <li> Overall very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I love using this because it helps to dry my polish VERY quickly!</li>
            <li> I use it on top of my color polish, and my polish lasts longer then it normally would.</li>
            <li> -dries very fast, it is &amp;#34;seche vite&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Just like the title, it dries VERY fast!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product overall.  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy this product for my own, and give my nails a refresher coat  of top coat at day 4 or 5, and now my manicure can last a whole two weeks.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Dries very fast!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty</li>
            <li> It is very very shiny but sometimes chips!</li>
            <li> That speaks for itself, if this product has been around that long, it must be good.</li>
            <li> it also adds a beautiful shine.s, and your nails become messy.</li>
            <li> I tried over a dozen different top coats to seal and smoothly coat my favorite large glitter nail polish ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Thanks to this, my nail polish lasts longer:) it&#x27;s just pure perfection!</li>
            <li> It dries super fast and that is awesome for me because I have very little patience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and convenient until halfway down.</li>
            <li> Hands down best quick dry top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It is so nice and shiny and helps polish dry very quickly.</li>
            <li> It looks nice, goes on easily, and my nails are dry in minutes instead of hours.</li>
            <li> Drys super quick and gives you that fresh mani look</li>
            <li> However, it tends to peel off easily since it dries so quickly and hardens so fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually going to buy more while the price is right :)</li>
            <li> This top coat does its job as an accelerator, but not nearly as well as Sally Hansen&#x27;s quick drying top coat.</li>
            <li> For the most part it keeps my nails super shiny and it drys pretty fast for a polish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;TL;DR: very good polish, not very good for you.</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS got air bubbles in my nail polish after putting on the top coat so a fast drying polish was needed very much.</li>
            <li> Price is good and it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> This is my new HG top coat.</li>
            <li> My new favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite</li>
            <li> and I got their new Oxygen top coat</li>
            <li> So with a swipe of this after giving my fingers a new look they are safe from bumps and smudges after about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Love it and will buy new one when done</li>
            <li> My new FAV top coat.</li>
            <li> My new favorite.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I love to try new products.</li>
            <li> This is my new top coat.</li>
            <li> I have used and loved this product for a very long time</li>
            <li> Yes it smells more than the average nail polish but the drying time is amazing.</li>
            <li> Seriously this is the most amazing top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Dries very quick and ready to go in 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Much better than essie quick dry top coat.</li>
            <li> Also, the way the brush is made makes it&#x27;s easy to get too much product on</li>
            <li> This product allows me to do my nails more often, because it makes the whole process FAST!</li>
            <li> The best part about this top coat is that it dries in a way that makes it hard and doesn&#x27;t deny as easily as other top coats.</li>
            <li> Makes painting my nails fast and easy.</li>
            <li> Not only does it dry quickly but it smooths over any polish imperfections and leaves nails looking salon glossy and perfect!</li>
            <li> it should be dry super fast lol</li>
            <li> This ish works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to get gel acrylics because I loved the look and feel, but this stuff makes my nails feel exactly the same!</li>
            <li> dries very quick and is very durable.</li>
            <li> It is sure quick dry top coat.</li>
            <li> Hope you guys like it as much as I do :) Get ready for mani Monday!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last me a full two days with out some kind of chip or peel.</li>
            <li> Dries fast, shiny and strong.</li>
            <li> It does dry SUPER fast and has a great shine, so I give it 2 stars.</li>
            <li> It dries fast, make the nails shiny and easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> It applies easily, though since I&#x27;ve just gotten it today, I can&#x27;t really say how it holds up over time.</li>
            <li> Paints on easy, dries fast, but shrinks as it dries.</li>
            <li> My favorite quick dry top coat on the market.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tip: Try not to keep the top off the bottle for too long or even just place a finger over the bottle opening while the top is off.</li>
            <li> I have to put a glop of this on my nail pretty much to make sure it&#x27;ll spread without streaks.</li>
            <li> Overall, pretty good, just not life-changing.</li>
            <li> It dries fast, minimizes bubbles, and creates a strong, shiny finish.</li>
            <li> Make sure to buy the &amp;#34;restore&amp;#34; as well because it gets goopy pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I love how I can layer on colors and have them dry quickly with this top coat.</li>
            <li> Fast drying and easy to apply, two coats and one every day for three days</li>
            <li> but they never last more than a day or so without becoming chipped or something.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making it so easy to get.</li>
            <li> I used to have to reserve a good chunk of time out of my weekend just to paint my nails - not because the painting takes time, but because I have to sit idiotically still for hours waiting for the polish to dry, layer by layer.  </li>
            <li> Love this quick dry top coat.</li>
            <li> and it really is the fastest drying top coat, resulting in a fabulous high gloss shine.</li>
            <li> LOVE Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat!</li>
            <li> But this dry fast top coat dries my nail paint quickly and gives it a nice shine.</li>
            <li> amazing, Dry&#x27;s very fast and smells like the nail salon.!!</li>
            <li> The process took me so long, and it ended up getting messed up more often than not, so it just didn&#x27;t seem worth it most of the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it dries the polish under it and helps my manicure last longer and looks better!</li>
            <li> As if nail polish didn&#x27;t start to peel and chip soon enough, this top coat makes it peel even sooner!  </li>
            <li> this wil be the only top coat i use!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t chip for days and it keeps my nails VERY shiny!!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more when this one runs out!</li>
            <li> you get this polish if you are an avid nail painter!</li>
            <li> My nails usually last for about 2 weeks by using this top coat!</li>
            <li> This topcoat really works!!  </li>
            <li> They are absolutely glass-like!!</li>
            <li> When I received it, packaging read, Will NOT Thin polish! !</li>
            <li> This stuff is the absolute BOMB!!</li>
            <li> My nails last over a week with no chipping when I use this top coat!</li>
            <li> Definitely replacing my opi top coat!</li>
            <li> of my favorite buys so far!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I did not realize how much I needed it!!</li>
            <li> Just got my first bottle today and was so excited to try it out.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to return it, as I have a little one around, and would love to have more!</li>
            <li> Really works !!</li>
            <li> Worth the price to save a new manicure from the disaster that is sheets touching your at night nails and ruining your manicure.</li>
            <li> This top coat is just as fabulous as countless other blogs and reviews have stated, maybe even more!!  </li>
            <li> It leaves a smooth, super shiny salon finish and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li> I bought some OPI Top Coat and Drip Dry to go with it, but I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Dries super fast and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> And it is almost half the price on Amazon as it is in the store, so i am more than thrilled.  </li>
            <li> Evens out every one of your nail art boo boos and dries super fast to a smooth shiny finish.</li>
            <li> Dries nails quickly and leaves a professional looking glossy top coat</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on the super pricey ones when this is so great</li>
            <li> Seche Vite dries super fast, with a smooth glassy finish.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a strong odor because it does contain toluene, so make sure you aren’t using these in a tiny, enclosed space.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to push your cuticles back before applying it, because it can peel easily if it dries against cuticles or skin.</li>
            <li> It took about 15 minutes for the top coat to dry and harden (I still tried to keep my hands free for another 15-30 minutes just in case, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like I NEED to!).</li>
            <li> Dries quickly, nails still look great after a few days.  </li>
            <li> I got the Seche Vite top coat so quickly after I ordered it that I was surprised I even had a package.  </li>
            <li> It dries fast and is super shiney!</li>
            <li> Dries fast and with a nice professional shine!  </li>
            <li> Incredibly fast drying and super shiny -- nails always look like I&#x27;ve had a salon manicure when I use this topcoat!</li>
            <li> This top coat works great in the sense that it is dry within minutes (literally just like 5 minutes) where you can go back to work, handle things with your hands and not have to worry about your polish getting ruined.</li>
            <li> I would say a good way to look at this is fast drying but NOT long wear.</li>
            <li> They love it as much as I. It dries super fast and the smell does go away.</li>
            <li> Good top coat, but you have to use it fast, or the whole bottle will dry out soon.</li>
            <li> found it to be okay , it doesn&#x27;t shine like I would like but it does dry my nails fast and that is most important to me</li>
            <li> Nope, all this great little product.  </li>
            <li> maybe a good quality top coat, but not long lasting effect.</li>
            <li> Most of the top coats I&#x27;ve tried take forever to dry and then chip in 2-3 days, but not this one!</li>
            <li> /&gt;EDIT: Ok I gave this another shot some time later and it seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li> excellent extra dry and protect!</li>
            <li> It is super shiny and it dries super fast!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a top coat nail polish that is super high gloss and super fast drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of quick dry top coats and this is the best hands down!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seche Vite leaves a beautiful, mirror-like gloss on top of your nails, which is absolutely fabulous, and it DOES dry your nails within 5 minutes or less.</li>
            <li> It leaves a high gloss shine finish on your manicure and dries super quick !</li>
            <li> The smell is kind of strong though, and there are warning labels due to chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> Sure, it dries quickly, but so did my other top coat.  </li>
            <li> It also has a nice high gloss that does not dull.</li>
            <li> It does what it says, dries fast, makes nails shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> Looks amazing on acrylics, and though I haven&#x27;t used it on regular polish yet</li>
            <li> Fast drying cheap</li>
            <li> I know a few people arent happy with the fact that it shrinks your polish at the tips</li>
            <li> Dries fast and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I have repurchased multiple times and its amazing, i dont use anything else anymore for my nails</li>
            <li> It dries really fast and stays chip free for days.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really shiny, smooth gloss</li>
            <li> This dries literally in seconds, and is great when you&#x27;re in a hurry or just impatient.</li>
            <li> The shipping came a week earlier than it said it would which was amazing.</li>
            <li> It makes your nails shiny and smooth and it dries relatively fast.</li>
            <li> Dries fast and gives your nails a smooth glossy finish.</li>
            <li> Not only that, but the shine is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so amazing, it takes the current nail color I have on, and makes it so shiny and well protected.</li>
            <li> Dries fast &amp; so smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> This is a good top coat if you are looking for a good protective shine, but it smells really bad.....</li>
            <li> but if you are smooth it will really do wonders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , the shine is gorgeous and the drying time is fantastic especially when you are painting your nails while your 15 month old takes a nap.</li>
            <li> This will give you a really solid, glossy look with amazing speed.</li>
            <li> It gives me and amazing gloss, but doesnt last on nails</li>
            <li> Dried fast, went on smoothly and looked great.</li>
            <li> I recently discovered this product and it is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> Works great, but it fed sticky after few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks already and it works really great.</li>
            <li> This is for real a fast drying topcoat.</li>
            <li> Having a huge gap at the tips of my nails was a very unattractive look.</li>
            <li> but I hadn&#x27;t run out of my old top coat (Essie)</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t think this top coat really does much for maintaining my manicure.</li>
            <li> I end up having to redo my nails more frequently than before.</li>
            <li> I bought it after I read about it on a nail blog, and it is so worth every penny</li>
            <li> it is actually fairly useful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of great things about this clear coat from lots of different people</li>
            <li> This topcoat is the only reason I can do my own manicures.</li>
            <li> As a top coat it performs as well as any top coat I&#x27;ve ever used: keeps my nail color perfect for at least a few days before any chipping or wearing.</li>
            <li> I love this clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> People are always asking me if I&#x27;ve had a fresh manicure and complimenting my nails.</li>
            <li> In drug stores this runs about $9.99 and it would be worth every penny, but...  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying.  </li>
            <li> has become FUN</li>
            <li> People always tell me my nails look professionally done when I use this top coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m typing this with freshly painted nails...</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> This nail polish top coat works even better than expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not visible from afar, and you&#x27;d really have to be looking very close to be able to see the shrinkage.</li>
            <li> When it looks wet three weeks from application, then you got a wicked product that earns every good will.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like to do my own french manicures, and would be lost without this.  </li>
            <li> This makes the polish last much longer and keeps the shiny finish much better than most top-coats I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Almost worth it.</li>
            <li> I can actually do my nails on my own now without messing it up after 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> For the price this is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I will never waste my time with another top coat.</li>
            <li> and use only this when I want nice shiny glasslike nails.</li>
            <li> Will take advice on keeping a fresh bottle on hand.</li>
            <li> Professional grade top coat.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to follow directions, it is meant to be put on top of wet polish.</li>
            <li> Expected much more from this, but it was ok...</li>
            <li> I would also recommend Seche Restore - great for bringing old polishes back to life.</li>
            <li> and I know it&#x27;s because of this top coat and makes my nails looked like they were professionally done at the salon.  </li>
            <li> A much better clear coat is Duri&#x27;s Rejuvinate Coat</li>
            <li> I would just put any clear coat on top of my manicure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for nothing that this top coat is always marked as &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; everywhere you look.</li>
            <li> No beauty product is worth risking a life.</li>
            <li> I recently began doing my own nails since going to the salon is no longer in my budget.  </li>
            <li> If you do your own nails, this is the only way to go.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the results.</li>
            <li> Clear polish outstanding?  </li>
            <li> Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product and was glad that it wasn&#x27;t false advertising.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried seche vite, I think it&#x27;s a pretty good product overall.</li>
            <li> If you have never tried a fast drying top coat, be ready to be amazed.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the 5 bucks.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare I get a chip ort</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was on time and packaged good, nail polish just wasn&#x27;t what I expected though.</li>
            <li> a couple hours after painting them and its not like I am re-grouting my bathroom to get chips like that on a fresh manicure</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> worth it.</li>
            <li> Within seconds, your nails are okay to touch lightly and within an hour they&#x27;re solid.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Good topcoat and definitely lives up to its claim of fast drying.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time doing a nice french manicure on myself.  </li>
            <li> I even use it to re-top coat a professional pedi just to be sure it lasts longer.  </li>
            <li> It is absolutely worth it..  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> - very shiny - cruelty-free - good price  CONS: - peeled off same day.</li>
            <li> As the day wore on, two more nails had the polish completely peel off and one peeled off halfway.  </li>
            <li> the kind that goes around with blanket smudges on every last nail.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t observed any polish shrinkage so far with the top coat.</li>
            <li> and it restores all your old polishes and your seche vite top coat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll take any advice on this, but it isn&#x27;t worth knocking any stars.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find that it was available on Amazon (for about the same as what I&#x27;d pay in the store).</li>
            <li> Nice, solid top-coat.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is old school drying top coat.</li>
            <li> This is by far my HG top coat.</li>
            <li> &gt; Not only does this topcoat make my polish last days longer, it also makes my nails incredibly shiny, and it is helping them to grow stronger and</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason every nail salon worth</li>
            <li> So maybe save your polish and go with a different top coat when you&#x27;re wearing a cheap nail polish underneath it.</li>
            <li> After about five minutes, I can do anything with my fresh manicure.  </li>
            <li> This top coat really really worked and is FAST.  </li>
            <li> So far after a few months of useage, this is by far the best top coat I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> then the product is worth.</li>
            <li> You should place a coating when you get your fresh mani and pedi</li>
            <li> That con is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> It makes my home painted nails look better than a professional manacure.  </li>
            <li> Splurge because it&#x27;s truly worth it.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s just for myself or my 3 &amp; 5 year old, it&#x27;s a bit pricey for a top coat.</li>
            <li> i love the shine it gives my nails -- just like a professional manicure.</li>
            <li> this top coat goes on smoothly, dries almost instantly, and prevents chips.  </li>
            <li> Together, using both, my manicures at home last 5 days and look really nice.</li>
            <li> It works, so just decide how sensitive you are to chemical smells :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit \\&quot;pricy\\&quot; and a 100% WORTH</li>
            <li> The restorer is well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does have a powerful odor</li>
            <li> Even replacing this more frequently bc of it</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s really glossy and dries incredibly fast.  </li>
            <li> It makes your nails look shiny and freshly polished.</li>
            <li> Maybe the product itself was a fake, I really don&#x27;t know, why so many people think it is so great!</li>
            <li> Seriously, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just worth it</li>
            <li> , I have  used this product for awhile on others and on rare occasion myself.</li>
            <li> far as the one rev... Read more</li>
            <li> To me its worth the risk of whatever harmful ingredient is in it.</li>
            <li> ; however, it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> The smell of this is very strong and quite gross, but it does disappear quickly.</li>
            <li> I will never again use another quick dry top coat again!</li>
            <li> When I first got this, I was very happy and surprised how fast it would dry no matter</li>
            <li> It dries very fast and I super shiny.</li>
            <li> Not only is it quick drying, but it leaves such a beautiful finish on your nails.</li>
            <li> Although, if you want a top coat, with fast drying step, plus a super shiny coat (especially when you wear jewel tones or bright reds), for a color pop, try PRO FX QUICK DRY HIGH GLOSS TOP COAT.</li>
            <li> IT DRIES so fast and its so very shiny!!!</li>
            <li> Say goodbye to sheet creases, which is amazing if you are like me and find that the only time you ever have to paint your nails is right before you go to bed.</li>
            <li> I love that this really helps my nails dry super fast and leaves a really nice glossy finish.</li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s great that you can get it on Amazon for half the price in stores.   </li>
            <li> every polish takes way to long to dry but this polish works wonderful!</li>
            <li> that it &#x27;gloops&#x27; up pretty quickly (but you can always buy Seche Restore to fix that, which is worth it in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that if I use and older bottle of Seche Top coat that I&#x27;ll be more prone to cracking of the top coat, but that&#x27;s only if I happen to pick up a bottle that is over a year old.</li>
            <li> So if your husband/boyfriend/significant other is into fly fishing, hide it or your wont get it back!!! :-)</li>
            <li> It does take a lot more time to chip than other top coats.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how it got to be so popular, other than the fact that it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Seche Vite for almost a year now, it is the only top coat that will keep my nails looking fresh and glossy without chipping for days, and with all the abuse I put them through that says a lot!</li>
            <li> I have looked up and tried many top coats based on other reviews</li>
            <li> The fact that it has lasted better than all of the other top coats that I have invested in already has prompted me to give it five stars.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong but it leaves such a great shine and a nice thick protective coat!</li>
            <li> A couple chips I had touched up with a complementary color, creating an ombre effect, and adding this top coat let the color edges soften into each other even better.  </li>
            <li> I like it, but think many other brands work as well and protect my polish against chipping better.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how other people are having so many problems with this top coat.</li>
            <li> it dries super fast  and keeps any polish on for days!  </li>
            <li> Super fast drying!</li>
            <li> This stuff dries super fast, which I do like alot!</li>
            <li> this polish dries super freaking fast!</li>
            <li> It does set pretty quickly too so</li>
            <li> Super fast in drying!</li>
            <li> It lives up to the hype, drying super fast!</li>
            <li> it makes my nails look like salon finish and dries super fast!  </li>
            <li> Drys my nails super fast!</li>
            <li> Was shipped super fast; arrived a couple days before the estimated arrival date!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed that even salon brands chip pretty quickly on me.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it dries super fast!</li>
            <li> And I am generally pretty quick when painting my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dries super fast!</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s a lot of dishes and laundry!), but it chipped pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> , it chips off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The polish dries super fast!</li>
            <li> but oh boy does it peel off super fast as well!</li>
            <li> Dries super fast and keeps your polish shiny and glossy for DAYS!</li>
            <li> but when I recieved this top coat I started loving doing my nails because it last a long time and chip free for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used pretty much every drug store top coat, and many nicer ones, and I always come back to Seche.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, drys quickly and keeps your polish looking new for twice or triple the time.</li>
            <li> For the frequent flyer I am this is the miracle that makes my mani/pedi look great in 5mn flat!</li>
            <li> The quick dry is a nice feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dries super shiney and super fast.</li>
            <li> They seem to get dry and peel more easily when I use this regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They seem to get dry and peel more easily when I use this regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone wanting a quick, strong, shiny (wouldn&#x27;t work for a matte finish manicure), affordable and professional looking at home mani/pedi.</li>
            <li> Only con - is the strong smell, but what nail polish doesn&#x27;t smell strong??</li>
            <li> While this is unnoticable on dark colours, it can really detract from a light or bright colour.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the most part it&#x27;s a good product but the tips don&#x27;t last as long</li>
            <li> , friendly tip: try not to get any on your skin or breathe too much of the stench.</li>
            <li> Now I always have neatly polished nails (which is a requirement for me or I&#x27;ll bite them right off).</li>
            <li> I noticed immediately that the box didn&#x27;t look as right.</li>
            <li> The pros are right.</li>
            <li> Stop right here and buy this.</li>
            <li> So instead of the nail polish chipping, it just peels right off...</li>
            <li> But u get my point right?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done my nails right before bed and never had any problems with sheet nails.</li>
            <li> I can finish my nails, then leave right away for work.</li>
            <li> Whatever those chemists did, they did it right.  </li>
            <li> tried this on right when I got it.</li>
            <li> Tried it right away</li>
            <li> It does tend to get gloopy, and the Seche Restore will fix it right up.  </li>
            <li> I used a Sinful Colors under Seche Vite once and it chipped right away.</li>
            <li> I would go washing dishes right away</li>
            <li> It makes the polish peel right off.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t used to have the patience to do my nails because I smooshed them right away...</li>
            <li> Shipping was speedy and the price was just right.</li>
            <li> As of right now, 42 out of 61 reviews give this product 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> I recieved my item right on time</li>
            <li> Revolutionary, right?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on day 5 right now</li>
            <li> Polish still peels right off, i guess my nails are damaged.</li>
            <li> Perks your nail polish right off.</li>
            <li> How much can I trust review here is becoming really a question to me.    </li>
            <li> If you want an amazing top coat, search no more.</li>
            <li> I know that may not be long for most people, but it is huge for me.  </li>
            <li> This is the first bottle I&#x27;ve used, but so far it is my HG of top coats.</li>
            <li> This is the first bottle I&#x27;ve used, but so far it is my HG of top coats.</li>
            <li> I get more than a day from my Sally Hansen top coat, it just doesn&#x27;t dry as fast.</li>
            <li> After my first use I immediately threw out my out the door top coat, this stuff makes even the cheapest nail polishes look professional grade</li>
            <li> This stuff is my favorite fast dry nail top coat - it works so well.  </li>
            <li> I love Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Nail Coat.</li>
            <li> I love this fast dry top coat.</li>
            <li> BUT before receiving it, I noticed my favorite salon that gives me bionic manis that last 1 full week are using THIS topcoat.</li>
            <li> The only reason this product gets two stars instead of one is because it left a beautiful shine to my nail with no nicks/scratches underneath the polish.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think that when I purchase a product that I should be able to get full use of it without the requirement of purchasing an additional product.  </li>
            <li> Performed much better for me than my much pricier OPI rapid dry top coat.</li>
            <li> Not only does it work for a simple color mani, but it works beautifully for all types of nail art.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that I can ever do with out this Vite Dry Top Nail Coat, I love it and it dries your nail polish really fast</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not one of those products where before you can get a full layer of top coat on, it&#x27;s clumpy and you have to redo your entire nail)</li>
            <li> Makes your nails soo shiny and they dry so much more quickly!</li>
            <li> I love how quickly it dries, but when you have to redo a nail every day, it kind of loses the value.</li>
            <li> It truly is fast drying and it lasts a good long while and takes a beating.</li>
            <li> The only downside I could see is that it has a very strong chemical odor.</li>
            <li> ONly thing is the containers break VERY easily.</li>
            <li> this top coat is like no other.</li>
            <li> No other top coats will do now that I have had seche vite.</li>
            <li> No other top coat gives you the shiny finish as Seche Vite.  </li>
            <li> I like it, but not sure if I would re-purchase again, since there are so many other great top-coats out there!</li>
            <li> There is no other top coat to buy.  </li>
            <li> I applied the this top coat and it dried very quickly!</li>
            <li> Just be sure to keep a fresh bottle on hand and close it tightly, and this should help extend the life of your top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product came way earlier than expected &amp; this is definitely the best top coat i&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on top of the cheapest to the most expensive nail polish brands and the effect is the same - simply brilliant.</li>
            <li> It makes your nails really hard, gives a beautiful shine, and speeds up drying time-</li>
            <li> Not only does it dry quickly, the end result is a beautiful shiny finish.</li>
            <li> There is no doubt that this product is fast drying, in fact it has encouraged me to paint my nails more often now that I don&#x27;t have to wait 20-30mins for my top coat to dry before I can do anything but lay there with my arms in the air!</li>
            <li> (my nails are probably dry before that, but I like to play it safe!)</li>
            <li> it gets dry slower, but this is magical stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than ready for a new color anyway.</li>
            <li> It dries super fast, leaving a nice and professional high gloss finish.</li>
            <li> I always use an ORLY Color Blast glitter polish on the top half of my nails before applying Seche Vite top coat.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed chipping any more than with a typical top coat.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it does slightly change the color of the polish - but most top coats do that</li>
            <li> I read a tip online somewhere that it is best to apply this when the nail polish is wet; don&#x27;t wait until the polish is dry.</li>
            <li> My nails are dry in just 2 minutes tops after applying this fabulous top coat....</li>
            <li> Used a good polish -- which was also fast dry</li>
            <li> This top coat gives the most clean, smooth finish and the shines lasts several days to two weeks depending on how rough you are on your hands/toes.</li>
            <li> this is the most essential to the shine and quick dryof</li>
            <li> Every time I pet him with this top coat on, his skin got red and he got super itchy.</li>
            <li> The seller was fast and got the product to me very quickly; I just really didn&#x27;t like the product.</li>
            <li> It dries my manicure so quickly that I am able to get back to work immediately -- yes, immediately.</li>
            <li> This top coat needs to be put on right after your last coat of polish, the polish needs to be good and wet still.  </li>
            <li> and it takes me some time, and with the usual top coats, even quick drying, I really can&#x27;t do much with my hands for the rest of the night if I want to keep them nice.  </li>
            <li> , i&#x27;m not exaggerating i don&#x27;t usually say a product is great</li>
            <li> The shine is amazing and it lasts as long as I need it to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Edited two years later: Well, the honeymoon period is over, and I&#x27;ve moved on to other top coats, most notably HK Girl Glisten&amp;Glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> which would be cool if I was ready for it to come off ....</li>
            <li> I bought the Poshe brand top coat at the same time as Seche Vite and Seche is by far my favorite out off of the two.</li>
            <li> Also it occasionally, though rarely for me, causes your polish &amp;#34;peel off&amp;#34; - I only experienced this once, ever since I started using it a year or so ago.</li>
            <li> so I don’t have to worry about messing it up with light activity, and after 20-30 minutes, I continue with my normal activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> instead of staying soft for an hour (or more) like my last top coat.</li>
            <li> I generally reapply top coat every day and still get wear</li>
            <li> product dries and hardens manicures quickly, which is why I gave it two stars, but I will keep looking for a quick dry top coat that protects instead of contributes to the ruin of my manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the only fast drying top coat I will ever buy!</li>
            <li> Make sure you combine with a good base coat and good nail polish</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of Top Coats over the past year, and this is hands down the best.  </li>
            <li> Super shiny, lasts a long time, and most importantly,dries super fast!  </li>
            <li> Love this clear quick dry top coat.</li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t chip any more than the other top coats I&#x27;ve tried, so I have no complaints there.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is SO shiny and gorgeous, cuts drying time down to 2 mins TOPS, and puts the kabosh on chipping for days.</li>
            <li> Seche is a cult classic in the nail world, so I was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> The reason I originally purchased this top coat was because I have no patience when it comes to waiting for nail polish to dry.</li>
            <li> Only downside is the strong smell, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is a great top coat to put on nails that you need to dry quickly, but I do not recommend putting it on your bare nails as it smells like spraypaint when you&#x27;re actually putting it on</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s super shiny and kind of gives your nails</li>
            <li> goes on smooth, dries quickly, and protects against chips better than any other brand!</li>
            <li> The one on the right is the one I first ordered.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, i don&#x27;t have to wait very long anymore.</li>
            <li> I swear, I sat perfectly still after applying this top coat for at least 10 minutes, and then moved very carefully for another 20.  </li>
            <li> I no longer have to wait hours for my nails to dry which is amazing.</li>
            <li> I heard so many things about how bad it smelled but that it worked perfectly</li>
            <li> It dries super fast &amp; leaves a shiny gloss</li>
            <li> Dries fast and super shiny.  </li>
            <li> Very shiny and dries QUICKLY.  </li>
            <li> Amazon offers a good price, as I saw these later at Ulta for $9 or $10.</li>
            <li> It lives up to its promise of drying fast and makes my color last forever and look amazing.</li>
            <li> So this top coat is working very well with the routines I have so far.</li>
            <li> Dries super fast.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and leaves a high gloss!</li>
            <li> I do my own acrylics at home, but when they dry their matte.</li>
            <li> It locks it in and dries super fast.</li>
            <li> This stuff really dries quickly and keep the polish shiny.  </li>
            <li> i always loved seche vite, but when i got it from my cvs, i must&#x27;ve got my an old gross one.</li>
            <li> but luckily it dries fast</li>
            <li> but i got over that quickly after I saw how fast it dries.  </li>
            <li> product is so excellent, it makes me wish we could just broadcast a quick announcement to the nail polish users of the world and let them know we&#x27;ve all been doing it wrong, and Seche Vite is the last brand of top coat we&#x27;ll ever buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries my nails super fast and gives them a finish like glass.</li>
            <li> Drys super fast.</li>
            <li> Super fast drying polish.  </li>
            <li> Super fast drying nil polish.</li>
            <li> This stuff dries my polish SERIOUSLY fast, and it so far hasn&#x27;t seemed to matter how many coats of polish are under it.</li>
            <li> and it dries super fast.</li>
            <li> Dries super fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through many fast drying clear coats and nothing seems to rival Seche Vite (&amp;#34;Say Veet&amp;#34;???).</li>
            <li> Dries quickly, dries very shiny,&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li> Plus dries quickly and gives a high gloss shine!</li>
            <li> Five or so minutes should do it, then gently and quickly apply your Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> it dries super fast and my nail polish lasts longer.</li>
            <li> It is very glossy, dries quickly, and lasts and lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li> It dries super fast.</li>
            <li> its super fast drying and shiny.</li>
            <li> Super fast drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back to my stand-by top coat that leaves my nails looking salon fresh for 6 days.</li>
            <li> The bottles came super fast.</li>
            <li> It adds a nice shine to your nails, helps them dry super fast, and helps prevent polish from chipping off.  </li>
            <li> it will never dry, this top coat works</li>
            <li> Dries super fast and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this product will really give you a nice, professional-looking manicure at home.  </li>
            <li> It dries fast and let&#x27;s you go on with your day quickly.</li>
            <li> It leaves my manicures super shiny and it dries so fast that by the time I am finished applying the coat to all my fingers I can touch my nails without messing up the manicure.  </li>
            <li> Now, I only spend about an hour once a week (give or take a few days) and they always look great!</li>
            <li> Dries super fast.</li>
            <li> I say forgo the Seche Vite and invest in some good old Sally Hansen quick dry topcoat or the Diamond</li>
            <li> dries super fast.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails, along with friends, and this polish makes my manicures last much longer than I was used to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super shiny and dries incredibly fast.  </li>
            <li> It dries super fast and leaves a very shiny/glossy finish (if you don&#x27;t like super shiny, don&#x27;t get this).</li>
            <li> It dries really quickly and makes my nails really glossy.</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast.  </li>
            <li> Seals in your nail designs &amp; dries super fast.</li>
            <li> dries quickly and it has worked very well at keeping my nail polish on</li>
            <li> Dries super fast leaving a glossy finish.</li>
            <li> You still want to avoid doing anything with your hands for a good half hour because the nail polish underneath will still smudge and wrinkle.  </li>
            <li> It dries my nails SUPER fast and helps me to avoid smudges.</li>
            <li> My nails dry fast and the top coat is strong and glossy.</li>
            <li> It got here super fast</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t give it five stars because I&#x27;ve noticed that my polish chips, and sometimes peels off entirely, much faster than with my old top coat.  </li>
            <li> It dries super fast.</li>
            <li> Helps your nails dry faster and has a nice glossy finish.</li>
            <li> It is super shiny and dries really fast.</li>
            <li> Just stay clear of this when women apply it as it smells strong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and while it may be a tad bit pricey for a top coat, you definitely get your monies worth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super shiny and dries ridiculously fast.</li>
            <li> It dries so fast and keeps your polish from chipping so quickly.</li>
            <li> Dries fast and super shiny.</li>
            <li> dry within minutes and leave a nice gloss.</li>
            <li> Drys super fast as well.</li>
            <li> When I use this top coat, it feels nice and thick on my nails like gel.</li>
            <li> You can get stuff just as good for 80% less at the drug store.</li>
            <li> Its looks like gel polish and will keep your color or natural nail super clean and shiny for two weeks.</li>
            <li> Love how fast it dries and the glossy professional finish it provides.</li>
            <li> Super fast.</li>
            <li> Dries fast and super shiny</li>
            <li> : Dries SUPER fast.</li>
            <li> I have tried several others, only when the store ran out of Seche Vite and no other comes close to the beautiful gloss look you get with Seche Vita!</li>
            <li> Not only did this top coat dry my nails in under 5 minutes, but it also is the shiniest top coat I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> It goes on so easy, dries amazingly fast, and provides a glossy, high shine finish.  </li>
            <li> But, from the products I&#x27;ve used before (which are limited), I find this to be amazing.  </li>
            <li> only downside to this top coat is that it does suffer some shrinkage, which becomes more apparent the longer you wear it.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy frequent color changes, this might not be a problem at all!</li>
            <li> Hansen Xtreme Wear seems smaller, but the best for long wear so far.</li>
            <li> I have used this top coat many times over the past four months and can&#x27;t believe the fact that when I have completed all 10 nails the first one I did is very dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, be careful-- as much as it looks and feels great</li>
            <li> For long lasting nail color dont spend this kind of money on a unhelpful top coat.</li>
            <li> I recommend purchasing Seche Restore with it, I even use Restore on normal nail polishes and it makes them better than new.</li>
            <li> Love the high shine clear coat!</li>
            <li> (let it dry just a bit first) and it keeps it looking nice and intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries super fast and it glossy and pretty.</li>
            <li> This is the best working fast dry top coat around, drying thickly applied wet polish in a matter of second, and leaving a beautiful glossy finish.</li>
            <li> Dries very fast but sometimes clumps on the sides.</li>
            <li> Dries very fast.</li>
            <li> Drys very fast.</li>
            <li> The price from this distributor was very reasonable too.</li>
            <li> just used this over a very light blue ( Sinful,Cinderella)</li>
            <li> Dries very fast.</li>
            <li> Dries very very fast.</li>
            <li> For me this product shipped very fast, faster than it said it would.</li>
            <li> Dries very fast.</li>
            <li> It drys nails very fast.</li>
            <li> Price was very reasonable also.</li>
            <li> It works very fast.</li>
            <li> come through the answer given by Sarah to one inquiry and find that she has studied very much</li>
            <li> as it says on the bottle, it dries very fast.</li>
            <li> Dries very fast but has a some what stronger smell.</li>
            <li> it works, but it has a very unusual smell to it.</li>
            <li> Very fast drying.</li>
            <li> Drys very fast...  </li>
            <li> I have used this product before and like it very much.  </li>
            <li> Very fast drying will order again</li>
            <li> I love this topcoat, it leave my nails super shine and it dry them super fast even when I have a lot of coat&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s AMAZING for little rhinestones you definitely don&#x27;t need glue with this top coat!</li>
            <li> the down side, however, it seems like it makes the polish chip more easily.</li>
            <li> Make sure you smooth and buff rough edges of your nails, this topcoat wont save you if you are jagged!  </li>
            <li> Fantastic shine that I have yet to find in any other top coat.</li>
            <li> The shine that comes from applying to freshly painted nails cannot honestly be matched by other products.</li>
            <li> Dries fast, covers mistakes, stays shiny, keeps manicure looking good for longer than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> But little did I know how good this stuff is.</li>
            <li> This really dries my nail polish fast!!</li>
            <li> I read another reviewer saying it&#x27;s best to apply while your actual nail polish color is still wet, and I&#x27;d have to completely agree with that!</li>
            <li> This top coat is great, it dries your nails very quickly and makes the polish last for a few extra days.  </li>
            <li> I love this quick dry polish.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, just make sure the color coat is mostly dry</li>
            <li> Without a quick dry top coat, I would not be painting my nails.</li>
            <li> I tried the Sally Hansen quick dry top coat before and tried to do things 15 minutes afterwards and my nail polish would smudge, and the nail polish would chip within a day or two.</li>
            <li> This truly is a quick dry, no smudge, top coat.</li>
            <li> I wanted a quick dry top coat that wouldn&#x27;t smudge my nail art.  </li>
            <li> I have so many quick dry nail polishes</li>
            <li> I have tried quick dry products (put on after manicure, top coat etc) from OPI, Revlon, Sally Hanson,</li>
            <li> Try Deborah Lippmann&#x27;s quick dry top coat.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, dries fast, and holds up to some pretty decent wear and tear.</li>
            <li> hand with Seche Vite had a blindingly bright shine, dried very fast and lasted for 3 days before chipping/peeling off my nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This high gloss top coat turns at home nail color into &#x27;wow&#x27;.</li>
            <li> The Sally Hansen quick dry top coat in the red bottle is much better than this one.</li>
            <li> This is a good strong top coat, don&#x27;t even try to use as a base, will cause it to chip easily since its meant to stick to polish not your nail beds.  </li>
            <li> it really does dry super fast and gives a nice shine to your polish.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to receive the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat in the mail and esp since I paid less than $11 for two.</li>
            <li> I am sure many of us out there have used a quick dry product only to end up having to redo our nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am sure many of us out there have used a quick dry product only to end up having to redo our nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really does dry in minutes, which I love!  </li>
            <li> This fast dry top coat cane on three days !</li>
            <li> This really dries the nail polish fast, I saw this product being advertised on YouTube, and she was right!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even get through 24 hours without my nails chipping (i.e. huge chunks) or this completely peeling off.  </li>
            <li> As a busy mom, this is huge.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only top coat I use.</li>
            <li> but this top coat helps my polish last approx 10 days without chipping !!!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s something to be aware of.</li>
            <li> I was able to open mail within like 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> It is my first bottle and it will not be my last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this I was blown away.</li>
            <li> At first I passed it off thinking maybe I had just been unlucky</li>
            <li> and my nails ran up against to many things.&lt;br /&gt;After trying out multiple polish brand colors and varying amounts of coats I have concluded its the Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> After multiple times of trying to make this work, I&#x27;m never buying this top coat again.</li>
            <li> I work in beauty retail and let me tell you, this is the only top coat I use and will probably ever use.</li>
            <li> Not only does it protect it for up to a week but the this top coat dries in a matter of minutes.  </li>
            <li> Pretty sturdy, too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SO at first, I didn&#x27;t want to buy it because of the review about the Toluene that was in it.</li>
            <li> and she said most definitely</li>
            <li> I must say that overall I truly love it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying the product for this exact reason.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this Top Coat nail polish several times and will continue to order it.  </li>
            <li> Waaay shinier than normal topcoats, which is cool.</li>
            <li> Ultra glossy and dries so fast I was doing laundry within 20 minutes and no smudging!</li>
            <li> Finally I ran out of the Revlon Colorstay top coat and decided to try this.</li>
            <li> especially after I top coat</li>
            <li> On one of my first uses of it</li>
            <li> I tried using my regular top coat on them</li>
            <li> The only top coat I will ever use, and the one my manicurist uses.</li>
            <li> Very shine!</li>
            <li> It keeps the shine in days and preserves the nail color pretty well.</li>
            <li> I finally realized it&#x27;s the Seche Vite top coat.</li>
            <li> My manicures do not last more then 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li> I constantly was touching something that destroyed my nails.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t ever get a different top coat from now one, this is just like the one you get at the nail salon.</li>
            <li> It is now the only top coat I use.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I hoped for.  </li>
            <li> I will NEVER use any other top coat ever again!</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no problems keeping the manicure chip free and looking good for 7-10 days especially if I apply another layer of top coat 2-3 days after the initial manicure.</li>
            <li> After several attempts to determine what it was, I realized it was this top coat.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle of this top coat</li>
            <li> My manicure last about two weeks with this top coat.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This is the only top coat I use when I get a pedicure or manicure...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real steal for this price too!</li>
            <li> Even better, shipping only takes 4 days.</li>
            <li> My nail color usually last 4-5 days using OPI nail prep and top coat.  </li>
            <li> Sure enough, it did!  </li>
            <li> This dries so fast!  </li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> and it dries really fast!</li>
            <li> When I first used Seche Vite</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever use a different top coat again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all true -- arrived fast, dries fast, gel-look shine.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is the only top coat I will use.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it is not the miracle product I was looking for that</li>
            <li> I just did my nails last night after receiving the top coat.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty-</li>
            <li> Not only that, but the finish is fabulous!</li>
            <li> does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> it will not fail you.</li>
            <li> I had my last nail polish on with this top coat</li>
            <li> ... shouldn&#x27;t a top coat make it last longer?!</li>
            <li> I only use OPI polishes because even with the Seche Vite top coat, if you&#x27;re using an inferior polish, it&#x27;ll still smudge.  </li>
            <li> This product did exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> It last longer when I don&#x27;t use the top coat.</li>
            <li> This is literally the only top coat I use anymore.</li>
            <li> I personally believe it is better</li>
            <li> It dries so fast!  </li>
            <li> It never occurred to me before using it that a top coat was actually helpful in any way, just that sometimes it was suggested.  </li>
            <li> Only top coat I&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> because they get messed up - this is going to fix that fast!  </li>
            <li> This is the only top coat you&#x27;ll ever want.</li>
            <li> I also am constantly cooking, washing dishes, cleaning and stress picking at my nails, so I feel like up til now, no home-done manicure lasts more than three days.</li>
            <li> and I love that it makes any color application I have on lasts for several days.</li>
            <li> My manicures would last a day at most.</li>
            <li> this is the only top coat I ever get.</li>
            <li> There are a number of times I have used this top coat, with various brands of nail polish.</li>
            <li> I bought this top coat a couple weeks ago from my local Sally&#x27;s on sale.</li>
            <li> and you are ready to go!</li>
            <li> is fast too!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my nails look pretty</li>
            <li> This really does work!  </li>
            <li> The top coat also makes my manicures last at LEASTT a week.</li>
            <li> Yes, like others I have noticed that it isn&#x27;t necessarily the strongest top coat.</li>
            <li> But it dries so fast that you could repaint the nail before you would even have a chance to complain!</li>
            <li> This is an absolute game-changer though!</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is much cheaper than drugstores, too!</li>
            <li> A lot of people complain about it &#x27;thickening&#x27; after awhile, and I have definitely noticed this, but if you change your nails a lot, you&#x27;ll be ok.</li>
            <li> It was my 3rd time purchased this top</li>
            <li> This is the only top coat I use now.  </li>
            <li> Dries fast and my toes are shiny!</li>
            <li> Keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li> Seche vite does exactly what it says--</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Would totally suggest this top coat.</li>
            <li> Very shiny with no bubbles at all!</li>
            <li> First time I applied one coat - it chipped after just two hours.</li>
            <li> Dries and hardens any polish so fast!</li>
            <li> Also much cheaper on amazon then in store!</li>
            <li> Make my nail polish looks better and last longer.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will use it every time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the only top coats that truly gives a salon-finish look.</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> because I&#x27;ve only been able to get one day wear from it before it chips and flakes off in sheets.  </li>
            <li> I will only use this top coat.  </li>
            <li> With this top coat, your manicure can easily last a week.  </li>
            <li> It has a gel like look once it dries, which it dries fast!</li>
            <li> Really fast shipping!</li>
            <li> And I always use OPI or Essie nail polish with this top coat, my nail polish last longer without this!</li>
            <li> I am bummed because I really wanted this to work for me!</li>
            <li> Not my favorite, and it has that gross glitter polish smell too.</li>
            <li> I paint my nails weekly and this top coat seals my nailpolish instantly!</li>
            <li> It is the only top coat I will use now.</li>
            <li> and it was pretty</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> No chipping, great, long lasting shine.  </li>
            <li> this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> It works just like it says it does which is exactly what every girl needs.</li>
            <li> If I could give this more stars I definitely would!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that this top coat has noticeably extended the life of my manicure beyond the initial application</li>
            <li> Dries SO fast!</li>
            <li> But I still love it regardless, I&#x27;m already on my 2nd bottle since.</li>
            <li> It serves as a top coat AND dries your nails instantly.  </li>
            <li> And sometimes I just use it on my natural nails because it makes them smooth and protected.</li>
            <li> first a confession...</li>
            <li> I actually paint my nails more.</li>
            <li> but it is really shiny!</li>
            <li> On the first day, I did my nails in the morning and by nighttime, after my nightly hot shower, my polish had already begun to peel.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> up buying a couple different top coats brands to experiment</li>
            <li> (Sally Hansen Dries Instantly 30 Second Top Coat).</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll just stick to my regular O.P.I or ORLY top coat.</li>
            <li> FAST drying!</li>
            <li> and I get the same results, but I have purchased the refill size to top it off and maintain the consistency for easier application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says .</li>
            <li> Thick, clear, and incredibly fast-drying, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product may work for some, but I am starting to see so many unsatisfied people.</li>
            <li> Besides, a whole bottle lasts me for 9-12 months, and I change my polishes a LOT!</li>
            <li> , Seche vite prevents this and dries extremely fast!</li>
            <li> I researched this top coat extensively before I decided to go ahead and purchase it.</li>
            <li> Okay, so, to be technical, they weren&#x27;t lying.</li>
            <li> This is THE only top coat in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My polished nails last about 5-7 days with this top coat.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not as glossy as I want a top coat to be, after finishing this bottle I might go back to Essie good-to-go</li>
            <li> A lot of salons use this &amp; I would really recommend this!</li>
            <li> this stuff dries insanely fast, and makes your nails so shiny!</li>
            <li> My nails are also starting to chip more often too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely buy again! :)</li>
            <li> Still this will always be my first choice.</li>
            <li> It is best to take a small bead and spread it over the entire nail.</li>
            <li> It dries really fast!  </li>
            <li> Works really well if you are doing nail art!  </li>
            <li> One of the first ingredients is TOLUENE, a known carcinogen.</li>
            <li> I most likely will not be making another purchase though.</li>
            <li> was it cuz i took a hot shower</li>
            <li> The biggest pro is that it dries SOOOOOO fast!</li>
            <li> No chips, no bubbles, fast drying!</li>
            <li> Drys so fast!</li>
            <li> The nail coat dries fast but PEELS OFF even faster!</li>
            <li> The Gold Standard of top coats.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ll continue to use this over my regular manicures, since I change polish so often, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use this over any of my more intricate manicures or any that I&#x27;d like to last more than 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> This top coat dries within a minute - and not only that</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is suppose to, dries you nails fast!  </li>
            <li> I literally was rubbing my nails after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> That fast!</li>
            <li> I use nail stamps, and after stamping my nails Seche Vite is the only top coat that won&#x27;t blur and smudge the pattern.</li>
            <li> I have tried top coat which a similar in quality</li>
            <li> Drys really fast!</li>
            <li> This top coat truly dries within a minute or so (if i blow on them especially).</li>
            <li> it looked EXACTLY</li>
            <li> Dries fast,!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!;)</li>
            <li> Overall, though, I love it.</li>
            <li> It had a gloss to it for about 2 weeks straight!</li>
            <li> This is my go to top coat for regular polish.</li>
            <li> Keeps my nails looking great for at least a week</li>
            <li> ONLY GRIPE is that I sometimes get bubbles in the top coat when I apply it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty glossy, although not as glossy as some others I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I apply it over my nails after I have them done and it helps the polish job last for one week or more.  </li>
            <li> First got introduced to this product by my neighborhood nail salon.</li>
            <li> Amazingly fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Love this product and just bought my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Got that one in fast!</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is my only Top Coat Polish I will put on my nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not getting the same results as most users.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Seche Vite does exactly what it states.</li>
            <li> Dries so fast!</li>
            <li> top coat definitely dries fast!  </li>
            <li> I am an avid do-er of nail art and lover of polish and follow many nail blogs, and have listened to others rave about this product, so I finally had to try it.</li>
            <li> When I first used this, my manicure lasted over a week without chips.</li>
            <li> It definitely lives up to the hype of being top coat of the year.</li>
            <li> And I love that I could purchase it as such a bargain price!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> I recommended it to my whole family and thats all we use now!</li>
            <li> The only thing is I don&#x27;t know how sturdy the top coat is because I&#x27;ve found my nails chipping with in the first week.</li>
            <li> Definitely will be buying again when I run out:)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just as shiny and pretty.</li>
            <li> not expensive</li>
            <li> The performance has been consistent over that period of time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than OPI top coat, but I prefer the former.</li>
            <li> but with this top coat, they last about a week.</li>
            <li> I see is that the top coat no longer shines like the first day application around my fourth day of wearing it.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I read so many reviews about how it stays on forever and no chipping .</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> If anyone knows of a top coat that actually seals in your polish and extends it&#x27;s wear, let me know!</li>
            <li> Maybe need buy some more later.</li>
            <li> I also find peeling the nail polish off  in one giant piece oddly satisfying..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear and goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sort of found a solution to this by applying it not only on the nail but under it and making sure it&#x27;s on the edge on the nail too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay with it because it&#x27;s definitely made my nails a million times stronger without nail polish because of this nail</li>
            <li> Helps to color nails fast!</li>
            <li> I can apply this top coat over two coats of polish and 5 minutes later be in bed for the night and wake up without any imprints or sheet marks.  </li>
            <li> When my nails are shorter this top coat seems to last longer.</li>
            <li> This arrived SO fast!</li>
            <li> You can polish your nails, put this on top and run your fingers thru your hair 5 to 10 minutes later.</li>
            <li> Dries fast!</li>
            <li> also make the manicure last longer than if i hadn&#x27;t used the seche vite top coat</li>
            <li> This top coat  definitely makes your manicure look like you had it done in a salon, gives it that shine.</li>
            <li> I can use this top coat, go to bed shortly after finishing my manicure</li>
            <li> I am an OPI addict, it is the only polish I use, with the exception of Seche Vite top coat.  </li>
            <li> The part I like most is you apply it after the final coat of polish and</li>
            <li> Get this top coat if you want for your nails to look shiny and your polish to last for days without chipping.</li>
            <li> My solution is to just finish using my first bottle and when it gone, trade the caps.</li>
            <li> Its the only top coat I will use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never going back to another top coat.</li>
            <li> I use it in rotation with my extra-life Revlon top coat, only when I don&#x27;t have time to wait around.</li>
            <li> Even the cheapest and noname topcoats I ever bought in a local drug store worked better...</li>
            <li> and my manicure will last when I use the Seche Vite top coat.</li>
            <li> This is a phenomenal product and literally dries all layers instantly.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It leaves a glassy shine and can even smooth out imperfections in your polish application, making a homemade manicure look professional.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> , the shine is so pretty...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely have to practice more and update review</li>
            <li> First time I am trying this product and others just don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this another try because I actually lost my bottle of Sally Hansen Top Coat.</li>
            <li> Try to keep it off your cuticle and skin because it shrinks as it dries and will peel back from your skin and makes the nail more prone to peeling prematurely.</li>
            <li> it came really fast too!</li>
            <li> My nails looked great--the first day.  </li>
            <li> I am going to try it with a couple of different nail polishes to see if I get better results.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This product does seem to seal in the manicure pretty well.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Makes your nails look very shiny!</li>
            <li> I was pretty devastated.</li>
            <li> Some polishes (often cheaper ones) often will flake or peel off the next day while others I have used have stayed virtually chipless for more than a week.</li>
            <li> but with this top coat, it dries instantly</li>
            <li> Dries really fast!</li>
            <li> Let me tell you something, if you weare this top coat, your polish is going to last for AGES!!!  </li>
            <li> Basic top coat.  </li>
            <li> Dries on so fast, I will often paint my nails just before bed with no smudges in the morning!</li>
            <li> I did my Christmas manicure in red and silver paisley and used Seche Vite as top coat.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what it sounds like.  </li>
            <li> It makes painting your nails that much easier!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m switching back to Sally Hansen&#x27;s Strengthening Top Coat.</li>
            <li> they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like this, but it was only OK.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping..great product!</li>
            <li> Highly highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Seche dries my nails so fast!</li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time and it dries faster than any they use in the nail salons.  </li>
            <li> It has a gorgeous glass-like finish, and dries to the touch in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Even other \\&quot;quick dry\\&quot; top coats would sometimes seal in the still-wet polish underneath and never allow it to fully dry (ending up squishy, kind of like a waterbed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally listen to reviews on products of any kind to make a decision but based on the fact that there are a million and one different quick dry top coats I thought it wise to do a little research before shelling out however much money</li>
            <li> One was how to clean up the polish using a brush, and the other was Seche Vite for a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously dries fast and is fairly chip-free!</li>
            <li> Strong odor from the bottle but who cares with an amazing, glossy, hard finished nail from home</li>
            <li> Best top coat I&#x27;ve ever bought and nails are dry in only a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Quick dry-with a High sheen.</li>
            <li> This is amazing, Seche Vite means dry fast, and this is exactly what it does.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent for someone that always bumps their nails or is too busy to wait that long for nails to dry.</li>
            <li> Wow this is very smelly!!!  </li>
            <li> I also like color clubs speed dry, but this is an old standard and anyone knows what a great performer this top coat is when its a new bottle.</li>
            <li> i have since found a local supply store where i purchase this for super cheap, and it is 7.50 at ulta too.</li>
            <li> And for those who like to keep their nails fresh by adding a top coat every two days or so, not working over dry polish is a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> It dries in less than a minute and gives nails a great glossy shine, as well as making them look professionally done.</li>
            <li> I really liked the Seche Vite fast dry polish....</li>
            <li> it really dries fast and leaves a super shiny coat.</li>
            <li> Only downside is that it has a strong smell but, worth it.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First the positive: It is very fast drying.</li>
            <li> Whole sections of my polish just either fall off or peel right off.</li>
            <li> I might give away the bottle I have right now because it irritates me so much.</li>
            <li> I must be using too much or something, because this peels right off within a day or so after use every time.</li>
            <li> Goes good over plain colored polish and even glitter polish.</li>
            <li> Works great when the bottle is new, but gets super thick and gunky after a while and isn&#x27;t useable anymore.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in a pinch and need your manicure to dry super fast then this is the top coat for you.</li>
            <li> Love this product it really makes you nail dry quickly.</li>
            <li> This top coat dries super fast, your manicure will be completely dry within 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Okay, not that quickly, but it does dry fast.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly with one application, within 15 minutes, I could being doing normal things and not have to be worried about smudging.</li>
            <li> I use it as a top coat over my nail polish and my nails dry super fast.</li>
            <li> Right when I painted my nails, I swear that this top coat really did dry my nails right away.</li>
            <li> Now I can get a full week out of my manicure, so long as I make sure to re-wrap the free edge every third day or so.</li>
            <li> I will say this stuff works ridiculously well, almost too good to be true, so I am giving 5 stars for performance and removing 2 for the health concerns.</li>
            <li> Be aware of the tons of positive feedback and don&#x27;t get caught up in the hype.</li>
            <li> obsessed with this top coat!!!  </li>
            <li> can say for certain this is the only top coat I will ever use.  </li>
            <li> I bought this and it does dry very fast and very smooth and glossy.</li>
            <li> I use it to prolong a manicure or pedicure by adding my own topcoat every other day or so.  </li>
            <li> I am not joking I polished my nails before work this morning and was able to get in the shower and flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> absolutely recommend this top coat to anyone who is interested in an actual quality mani/pedi.</li>
            <li> Reasonably chip resistant, but I usually put on a gel top coat an hour or two after the Seche Vite for more durability.</li>
            <li> This is the first fast dry top nail coat that I have purchased without paying a fortune that is so worth it.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I was pretty amazed at how fast it really did dry and create a protective barrier with a nice, shiny sheen.  </li>
            <li> They used to get smudged and chip quickly with other top coats...</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and lasts longer than any other top coat I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> with some polishes the whole coat of polish will come off in one large piece!</li>
            <li> The bottle was full, and if it wasn&#x27;t a brand new bottle, it certainly gave the impression to be.  </li>
            <li> This top coat is worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be confidently making lasagna for my family in half an hour, knowing all those layers are rock solid under this amazing goo.</li>
            <li> Using it for the purpose of a nail polish top coat is completely safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend using this if you are pregnant.</li>
            <li> I recently started doing my own white tip manicure and use it to set the tip quickly.</li>
            <li> My natural nails never dry and my husband swears it&#x27;s my cheap buy cheap nail polishes</li>
            <li> Within ten to fifteen minutes at the most I&#x27;m able to go about my day without worrying about ruining my nails because they are dry.</li>
            <li> I was previously using Sally Hansen, and I am not even sure if it was a top coat or a clear nail polish.  </li>
            <li> The scent is pretty strong but not a big deal, highly recommend the product!!</li>
            <li> This was great as people always say for allowing a manicure to last, but it didn&#x27;t dry as fast as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> This one goes on so smooth and leaves a nice thick coat on the nail.</li>
            <li> I use China Glaze base coat, 2 coats of polish and this top coat for perfect nails every time.    </li>
            <li> I hurriedly did my nails and smeared on a whole gob of top coat for each nail, and perhaps 20 minutes later, my nails were done.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of cleaning and wash my hands frequently, it really helped my polish last for more than a day.</li>
            <li> Not only was the delivery ridiculously fast, but the product is more than I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> - it is only good if you need it for a mani that day or the next day.</li>
            <li> I have a big problem with painting my nails, applying topcoat, and very soon after, for lack of a better word, smushing them.</li>
            <li> Painted it on my wet nails and it dried them perfectly without nicks or smudges.</li>
            <li> However, make your nail really shinny and overall rating is okay.</li>
            <li> I love how fast it dries (literally rock solid in 2 minutes</li>
            <li> Time and time again, for the last two months, this bottle has been a life saver since I couldn&#x27;t really afford to go to the salon anymore - and no one will ever be the wiser :)</li>
            <li> It dries so fast and keeps my nails looking great for at least a week.  </li>
            <li> it does what i bought it for, very shiny and does not yellow when i smoke, a lot of top coats do.</li>
            <li> Definitely just head to Sally to make sure you&#x27;re getting the real deal.</li>
            <li> this is some of the best top and base coat polish.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong smell, which I took a star off for, but that&#x27;s to be expected with nail stuff,</li>
            <li> It dries the polish very quickly and often makes the polish last twice as long as with a normal top coat, and with almost no chipping!</li>
            <li> Apply it while polish is still wet and your poilish will dry pretty fast and it makes a nice protective top coat.</li>
            <li> This nail coat really dries very fast, 5 minutes</li>
            <li> Love this Nail Polish, and finally paint it the color drifted, some minor defect is gone, so much the better, rather like.</li>
            <li> Great for Halloween, otherwise a true fake cheap clear coat</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and offers a high-shine finish and extends the life of my manicure!  </li>
            <li> As someone who always mess up a perfectly good polish job by bumping into something or touching it before it completely dries (no matter how long I waited), the Seche Vite Fast Dry Top Coat is a miracle in a bottle!</li>
            <li> I would put in a lot of time and effort and have beautiful designs only for it to chip in less than a day.</li>
            <li> I bought this clear coat nail polish because I am learning how to do acrylic nails, it came in pretty quick, within a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Positive:</li>
            <li> I bought this solely based on all the positive feedback.</li>
            <li> Works as positive reviewers claim.</li>
            <li> a positive note</li>
            <li> After reading all of the positive reviews regarding this product, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> It peels off each nail in one clean little sheet of polish and top coat.</li>
            <li> This product really does what it says - it dries FAST!</li>
            <li> for Seche Vite not working with three-free polishes, I pretty much exclusively use Zoya nail polish, and I do not have a problem with using Seche Vite as the topcoat.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to wrap the polish onto the underside of the nail to set a manicure for a long stay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so passionate about a top coat in my life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also dries pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Got here pretty fast too.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty intensely for about a day after applying, but it goes away.</li>
            <li> As in, I could have done pretty much anything without messing them up.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says....dries fast.</li>
            <li> thing that is clear is that one&#x27;s nail structure and products used with Seche can play a big role in how well it will work for you - it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!e&#x27;s proprietary thinner to be able to get anywhere close to finishing a bottle</li>
            <li> So, when I stopped using this top coat, my manicure lasted twice as long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of this top coat.  </li>
            <li> This product does exactly as it says it will, it dries fast.  </li>
            <li> I will say that it smells more than other polish, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> It dries really fast and leaves my nails very glossy!</li>
            <li> For a busy student and full time worker, this is important!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It arrived the other day and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I usually get good 24 hours</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the only top coats worth using.</li>
            <li> The old bottle is still 2/3 full</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I only gave 4 stars is because I bought this top coat just a few months ago and already the brush is funky like it&#x27;s not spreading as nicely.</li>
            <li> I think this works just as good (if not better)</li>
            <li> So far this is probably my favorite of all the brands I&#x27;ve tried but there are a few pros and cons as with most things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product and seller.&lt;br /&gt;Price was right and got it quickly.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> My nails dry SO FAST with this, goes on beautifully, and makes my polish last much longer than with any other top coat product I have tried.  </li>
            <li> This top coat is really amazing except, it is just a little too thick for me as a top coat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, shiny and quick dry.</li>
            <li> It dries super quickly and contrary to what the number one critical reviewer claims</li>
            <li> Makes your nail polish last much longer and makes it very shiny and pretty!!!  </li>
            <li> I was impressed how it helps to dry the other layers of polish underneath it, really - no other topcoat like it!</li>
            <li> Because of how fast it dries, you really have to get it right - do-overs or fix-ups are very difficult.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because of how fast it dries, you really have to get it right - do-overs or fix-ups are very difficult.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I picked up Seche Vite Dry Fast Top coat while I was in a hurry at Beauty First.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a long lasting, strong Top coat, then this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat</li>
            <li> Only positive a can give is that it dries very quick and leaves a shiny finish.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a top coat that dried fast and left a nice shine  </li>
            <li> The author highly recommended it, so I searched the Net and learned that many nail artists recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Dry super fast!!!</li>
            <li> I also wait 12 hours or so after applying the polish before putting on a final Seche Vite top coat, because I found that this somehow makes the polish last significantly longer before chipping/bubbling...    </li>
            <li> it smooths out the gritty surface tons better than any other top coat b/c</li>
            <li> I feel like this is a much more solid coat than other top coats I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> It really protects my manicures/pedicures and makes them look freshly painted way longer than any other top coat.</li>
            <li> After 10 minutes, I can cook, do laundry, do just about anything that would normally ruin my nails right after painting them.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and easily, even though it is thick.</li>
            <li> It also gives a great glossy coat to the nails....not dull at all!</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff,it stays on my nails for very long time and looks like gel manicure,gonna buy more,thank you</li>
            <li> It adds great shine and does in fact dry very fast, despite being extremely thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will admit that the Jet Dry leaves your nails with a better shine than Seche Vite but</li>
            <li> If you are having problems with bubbles in your polish or just can&#x27;t sit around and wait an hour for your nails to dry, this is the top coat for you.</li>
            <li> Big brush and goes on easy with no globs of polish.</li>
            <li> The first time I topped off my carefully executed manicure with this delectable treat, I knew I would never use another top coat ever again.</li>
            <li> Very shiny, very durable, dries FAST, too!  </li>
            <li> It is basically clear goo that hardens quickly.</li>
            <li> Dries so quickly and makes manicures look professional.  </li>
            <li> I had tried OPI&#x27;s top coat which takes forever to dry</li>
            <li> 5 minutes before touching it and to my surprise it was completely dry.</li>
            <li> To make sure they&#x27;re totally dry</li>
            <li> I used this topcoat for a long time years ago and completely forgot about how much I liked it.  </li>
            <li> top dry (nail dryer) coat.</li>
            <li> The top is dry but the stuff underneath is not.</li>
            <li> That is the faster dry top coat I even use.</li>
            <li> It dries quick and makes your nails look professionally done.</li>
            <li> It makes your manicure look professional and super shiny.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and crystal clear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 3 days since I painted my nails using this top coat and so far, it has barely chipped.</li>
            <li> With this on top, it was dry in like..</li>
            <li> but it seems to easily flake away a day later, even when I apply a PH balance to my nails.</li>
            <li> i followed with it the top dry coat.</li>
            <li> Not only does it dry your nails quickly but is also hardens them, I buy a jar a month because I do my own nails 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I let my 2 coats of Butter London polish dry for about 2 minutes and then put on this top coat.</li>
            <li> alot of times you think your nails are dry on top</li>
            <li> I was using Sephora&#x27;s Top coat which took like 20 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the chemicals in it will probably effect me in the long run since I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years, but I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> I like the top coat nail dry &amp; use it when I get a mani or pedi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to bleed color off the polish under it, and stays clear in the bottle unlike a lot of topcoats I have tried, quick drying and otherwise.</li>
            <li> it was the super clear coat.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s better than waiting for nail polish to dry.</li>
            <li> but this top coat made my polish dry</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to a normal top coat.</li>
            <li> It is really clear, shiny, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> With this nail polish it happens no more which is the most important to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With this I put the top coat on &amp; my nails are completely dry in 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no waiting for an hour for color to dry just so you can apply a top coat.  </li>
            <li> this one took more time to dry even with me waiting 20 min.</li>
            <li> I also let the tips dry just to make sure.</li>
            <li> Sometimes this means they take longer to dry, or stay &amp;#34;malleable&amp;#34; after I have put on the top coat.</li>
            <li> But looks nice for the first few hours..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: 8/27/15 My manicure is going strong, 3 days later.</li>
            <li> This top coat is super shiny and actually does dry super fast.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat it works super well on my nails and lasts a long time for a heavy nail and hand user.</li>
            <li> It gives the nails a good shine, but does not stop paint from chipping or long lasting wear!</li>
            <li> The smell is the only thing that bothers me, is a bit too strong.</li>
            <li> At first, I was reluctant to purchase Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat because I really didn&#x27;t want to spend $5 for one bottle.  </li>
            <li> Only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the strong smell.</li>
            <li> However, this has such a strong smell.</li>
            <li> My nails actually bend now, they are usually strong.</li>
            <li> I ordered Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat based on all of the positive reviews</li>
            <li> With the top coat lasting much longer than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> After 5 minutes, I was able to press down on my freshly painted nail and it did not get messed up AT ALL.</li>
            <li> The top coat produces a very high shine that lasts a long time and really seemed to protect the surface of my nail color.</li>
            <li> If I were to only plan on wearing a manicure for one day, such as for a special occasion, this polish&#x27;s drawbacks would be more of a non-issue.  </li>
            <li> If I were to only plan on wearing a manicure for one day, such as for a special occasion, this polish&#x27;s drawbacks would be more of a non-issue.  </li>
            <li> I will say I never get dent marks on my toenails from certain shoes or socks anymore</li>
            <li> With certain polishes and glitters it causes shrinkage.</li>
            <li> It certainly leaves a gel coat look.</li>
            <li> Just be smart and ventilate.</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff really dries quickly and it seems to dry the underlying coats of nail polish when used as a top coat.  </li>
            <li> Nails dry super fast and left a nice shiny coat.</li>
            <li> No matter how many times my ADD leads me astray, I always come back to Seche Vite, and so far I haven&#x27;t found anything else that consistently delivers mani after mani.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mix and match different brands, because I&#x27;ve found that within a single brand will always have some polishes that chip easily and some that look good and last.</li>
            <li> After waking up with sheet marks numerous times, even when I would do my nails at 4:30 in the afternoon, I decided it was time to start looking for a new top coat.</li>
            <li> Most polishes I&#x27;ve tried loose their shine after a day or so.  </li>
            <li> It truly is amazing how fast my nails are mess-proof, it probably takes less than a minute</li>
            <li> Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Cost puts an end to all that.</li>
            <li> This dry fast top coat does wonders.  </li>
            <li> Thumbs up to this dry fast top coat.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try an air dry gel top coat before purchasing a UV lamp.</li>
            <li> That has always been a problem for me in the summer heat and humidity and was the reason I started using fast dry top coats.</li>
            <li> For someone like me, with 3 kids, a legitimate fast dry top coat, is a necessity.  </li>
            <li> It glistens and shines and you end up staring at your hands far more than is socially</li>
            <li> Not with the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Someone who reviewed the Quimica product also recommended Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Nail Coat, 0.5 Ounce, so I got it.</li>
            <li> FAST DRY Amor LOVE this</li>
            <li> Was amazed that my dry was ACTUALLY fast &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> After some research, I found a blogger that recommended Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Nail Coat.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll be a Seche Vite Dry Fast top coat user</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s a characteristic that most fast dry top coats have, so I&#x27;m not complaining too much.</li>
            <li> This top coat works really well to make your nails dry faster.</li>
            <li> I put this top coat on when I did my nails yesterday and it did dry fast.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t dry as fast if I put more than 2 coats and it smudges.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> No matter how many layers of nailpolish you put on, this stuff will dry it REALLY fast.</li>
            <li> With the Seche Vite dry fast top nail coat (which you can get on sale at Sally&#x27;s sometimes), my nails always look like I had a salon-manicure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a top coat that stayed so shiny and dried so quickly.</li>
            <li> to SECHE VITE DRY FAST TOP COAT: when I am not doing a gel manicure (which is always)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s because it dry fast, I won&#x27;t be able to finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> I thought i used this product before with better results—maybe it wasn&#x27;t the fast dry.</li>
            <li> I love the way it is designed to dry fast it dries in about a minute or sooner.</li>

            <li> It certainly dries fast.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my other quick dry top coats that I was using before I tired Seche Vite.  </li>
            <li> 1 or 2 layers of polish will hold up really well, but if you layer on 4-5 coats of polish and then put this top coat on (which is very often done because it will even harden those really thick gummy manis very quickly)</li>
            <li> I then applied the 2nd coating of color on my right hand and quickly followed with SV.</li>
            <li> this IS a Gr8 product, my shipment was eather old or maybe got too hot during shipping?!?</li>
            <li> I love this top coat, it dries quickly, and actually keeps nails chip free for days, regardless of if you&#x27;re using expensive nail polish or dollar store polish.</li>
            <li> This top coat really does dry your nails in almost a minute!</li>
            <li> This glides on smooth, it doesn&#x27;t pick up the color of the nail polish underneath and dried quickly!</li>
            <li> I should have bought this as my main top coat a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Other than this small con, i think this top coat is great for anyone looking to extend their manicure life and make their nails look professionally done, even when it wasnt.</li>
            <li> Thick and makes your nails super shiny, I highly recommend everyone buy this top coat!</li>
            <li> I always heard great reviews of this topcoat, and I was sorely disappointed when after just a day my polish would peel off very easily.</li>
            <li> it may not dry as fast but its pretty dang quick.</li>
            <li> The top coat leaves a high gloss look and keeps my nail polish from chipping for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry to the touch after about 15 minutes, as with most other fast drying top coat products.</li>
            <li> I painted my nails last night and by noon today they had huge chips in them.</li>
            <li> and I just want to say it makes my cheap nail polish last sooo much longer[week to two week range bro] and makes it shiner as well.</li>
            <li> Definitely a huge time saver and makes nail polish extra shiny.</li>
            <li> Only used a few times, but this works great.  </li>
            <li> Great for when your last coat hasn&#x27;t dried yet and you need your hands back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> goes on smooth and makes my polish last so much</li>
            <li> It dries really fast and its such a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> This gives your nails such and amazing shine and idea make your manicure last longer.</li>
            <li> Drys so fast, no issues with crappy nail polish getting smudged or ruined 15-20 minutes after you are finished painting your nails.</li>
            <li> Make sure you put it on while the rest of your nail polish is still wet, otherwise it will all peel off within a day or two.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> Additionally, shipping was extremely fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really extends the polish much.</li>
            <li> That said, it dries MUCH faster than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried, and continue to use</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s very annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> like how fast this topcoat dries, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent chips as well as</li>
            <li> It drys fast.</li>

            <li> This product is absolutely life changing.  </li>
            <li> It dries fast and leaves the nail looking really shiny.</li>

            <li> Very durable wear.</li>
            <li> Dries fast to a patent leather, liquid shine.</li>
            <li> Dries polish fast</li>
            <li> This still chips on me, even using top quality color, but I am a waitress and that is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> IT DRIES FAST</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if this top coat is better than the cheaper ones, as this is my first time actually using one.</li>
            <li> It dries really fast...</li>
            <li> You really do have to try it to believe it.</li>
            <li> It seems thicker even and is very stringy as I apply.</li>
            <li> but this ear problem really bothered me.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it HIGHLY!</li>

            <li> , I give this a 5/5 for how fast it dries.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite does (must apply to wet polish, starts to thicken as you use up the bottle), but I do believe it is much, much better.</li>

            <li> It dries fast, like really, really fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very shiny.</li>

            <li> It dries fast and doesn&#x27;t chip in a day.  </li>
            <li> Dries fast with glossy shine.</li>
            <li> I had a lot tip wear from the shrinkage and peeling especially near the cuticle.</li>
            <li> Thanks Pro Concepts.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much on the brush, just one coat should do for optimal results.</li>
            <li> This gives me that wet sheen that looks killer on top of any color of polished.</li>
            <li> Very wearable and prevents chipping.</li>
            <li> Dries fast without scuff marks.</li>
            <li> Who has that many hours to be careful with your nails?  </li>
            <li> But that aside, you really can do just about anything without worrying too much within 15 minutes and by 20-30</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s held up really well.  </li>
            <li> It does the job of a shiny finish while drying fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t polish my fingernails very often, but I do like to keep my toenails polished.</li>

            <li> in all i&#x27;d HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who uses nail polish!</li>
            <li> It dries on fast like a gel.  </li>
            <li> It dries so fast and does not clump.</li>
            <li> Really fast drying time.</li>
            <li> When i say really fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Drags color underneath from my fresh manicure, making designs nearly impossible&lt;br</li>

            <li> I really like everything about it.  </li>
            <li> I glides on smoothly without smearing my nail art, smooths everything out, and it dries &amp; sets almost instantly no matter</li>

            <li> Shipping was extremely fast.</li>
            <li> but otherwise it dries really fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am definitely, absolutely buying this product again.</li>
            <li> so I know using this product really works.</li>
            <li> Recomend it to every one that wants carefree nails.</li>
            <li> It also dries really fast.  </li>
            <li> It dries to a really glossy coat in no time at all</li>
            <li> It drys fast and helps protect and seal my polish.</li>
            <li> Dries fast.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This really works well....</li>
            <li> So much cheaper to buy it on amazon and shipping</li>
            <li> This stuff does what it says--dries nail polish fast.  </li>
            <li> I have crazy-strong, fast growing nails.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than in the stores too.</li>
            <li> and I am ready to go, doesn&#x27;t peel.</li>
            <li> but they still chipped within a day and without much activity.</li>
            <li> the whole thing would come off.</li>
            <li> It dries so fast.</li>
            <li> It really makes my nails look like I got it done at a salon.</li>
            <li> I can not believe how fast this dries.  </li>
            <li> I get so much compliments for my nails</li>
            <li> /&gt;Breakneck fast drying.</li>
            <li> really fast but scared when i read the label ...</li>
            <li> It stays shiny the whole time.  </li>
            <li> Really brings out the colors in the polish I use.</li>
            <li> Nothing really seems to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone up to 3 whole days with no chips</li>
            <li> description describes the polish in a nut shell very well.</li>
            <li> It really does as it is described to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast drying and protects the nail color for days.</li>
            <li> It dries your nails fast.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, it makes your polish chip too fast.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> Drys fast</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer stated, literally 10-15 minutes after using, I was doing my hair with not so much as a smudge.  </li>
            <li> After applying, the next day or two, the polish will completely peel off and shed the whole nail top like a snake sheds it&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic and only cost $6 on Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li> Dries fast, like in 1 minute.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Dries fast and stays put.  </li>
            <li> I do my nails and make sure to apply the Seche Vite when they are still wet.  </li>
            <li> It really dries fast.</li>
            <li> Dries really fast.</li>
            <li> It relly works and it dries really fast</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend it..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really mind the smell.</li>
            <li> I like it because it dries fast</li>
            <li> BUT RUNS OUT FAST.</li>
            <li> exposing the white of the tips of my nails (in spite of capping the free edge generously), but my polish also started to chip after one day.  </li>
            <li> Nail coat works for me very well.</li>
            <li> Actually, within 2 minutes you are dent free, and don&#x27;t have to worry about bumping your manicure and denting your polish.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really help the polish stay on too much longer</li>
            <li> Dries fast.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this top coat seeing as I spent the money on it, but I don&#x27;t think I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> Very prompt.</li>
            <li> Fast Drying, high glossy shine!  </li>
            <li> My nail polish really lasts when I wear this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have an intense love/hate relationship with this product.</li>
            <li> It dries so fast.</li>
            <li> It also dries fast too.  </li>
            <li> I apply the top-coat while my color coat is still wet and make sure to apply and additional swath of product over my tips.  </li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> I put it on over 5 layers of polish and gel finish, and it was almost as if the top coat sinks into all the layers of nail polish and hardens it to perfection.  </li>
            <li> Its very shiny &amp; dries fast.</li>
            <li> Very shiny and no scratches or dents from the sheets.</li>
            <li> But really, this may have put me over my beauty carcinogenic limit for the month.</li>
            <li> so I have to continue to buy more before empty.</li>
            <li> price fast</li>
            <li> If a nail does chip, the whole fingernail of color will often come off, since the topcoat holds it together so well.</li>
            <li> Really does shorten drying time, and is very glossy.</li>
            <li> This dries incredibly fast, and protects the color underneath.</li>
            <li> Dries fast (but chips by day 2).</li>
            <li> Like really fast.</li>
            <li> It dries up fast and looks amazing/shiny on my nails.</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast this stuff dries my nails.</li>
            <li> The shine never dies and it prevents the color from chipping very well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this bottle to anyone.</li>
            <li> It dries so fast that my manicures aren&#x27;t ruined minutes after I finish them.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> There is no way this is the real product.</li>
            <li> To my fellow polish connoisseurs, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> it also makes them very shiny.</li>
            <li> I like seche vite for the thickness &amp; it really helps strengthen my nails.  </li>
            <li> i bought this figuring i&#x27;d try and see how fast it dries and maybe save some money on manicures.</li>
            <li> highly recommend seche vite!</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of protecting from chips and peels.</li>
            <li> My nail polish lasts so much longer now.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like the whole I have to wrap the end of my nails or</li>
            <li> Dries fast and has a gel-like finish and shine.  </li>
            <li> , I have not had a chipping issue or a whole nail peeling off.  </li>
            <li> it works really well too</li>
            <li> /&gt;PROS -&lt;br /&gt;-Extremely fast drying, fastest I&#x27;ve ever seen</li>
            <li> It is very shiny also.</li>
            <li> Drys just as fast as it says it will.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Works fast just like it says.  </li>
            <li> Very glossy.</li>
            <li> Even through daily washing of dishes and light yard work.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It dries fast without altering the shine or finish of the polish.</li>
            <li> Really hardens the polish.</li>
            <li> It leaves nails really shiny</li>
            <li> works very well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so glossy and dries fast.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> but it is much cheaper on amazon.com</li>
            <li> it got my whole family using it now</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need to put much on.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s very safe.</li>
            <li> but my nails look really shiny and glossy.</li>
            <li> Dries extremely fast and lasts for days.</li>
            <li> Dries fast with a shiny finish.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive for the quality.</li>
            <li> The way it peeled up, I just tugged and watched my polish come off in one whole piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it dries fast ;</li>
            <li> which allows me to do my nails at night and go straight to bed.  </li>
            <li> (cos I don&#x27;t like when the color&#x27;s still wet and taints the top coat in the bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she said her polish chipped fast also.</li>
            <li> Fast drying and shiny, what else can you expect?</li>
            <li> Pink Armor is much better.</li>
            <li> This really locks in your nail polish -</li>
            <li> Who knows if its real or not - but read some articles and decide for yourself.</li>
            <li> Have to use up the polish fast</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments on my nails thanks to this product.  </li>

            <li> Now my whole family is hooked on this stuff.</li>
            <li> I like how it really seals the nail color/design that you have on your nail.</li>
            <li> Fast drying and the strongest one you&#x27;ll find on the market, no doubt.</li>
            <li> This works so amazingly fast</li>
            <li> fast</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- really shiny</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Fast drying, VERY shiny.</li>
            <li> It works very well and drys fast.</li>
            <li> so really doesnt</li>
            <li> Dries fast, looks shiny...</li>
            <li> As for shine,there really isn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li> and it dries fast too.</li>
            <li> and thats even without you washing your hands too much.</li>
            <li> It really does make a difference on the shine.  </li>
            <li> I will forever buy this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Once you get about 1/ way through with the bottle it gets really goopy and stringy</li>
            <li> also very shiny coat.</li>
            <li> Halfway through the bottle I am starting to notice that is gotten a lot thicker and does not go on evenly and as smooth as it used to.</li>
            <li> I have had the entire nail-full of polish pop off as if it were one of those cheap glue on nails.  </li>
            <li> And sometimes, if my color could use some shine, Seche Vite doesn&#x27;t really help too much.</li>
            <li> This came on time and works very well.</li>
            <li> It is definetly fast dying.</li>
            <li> AND ITS SO MUCH CHEAPER HERE</li>
            <li> Dries exceptionally fast.</li>
            <li> Really lives up to reputation in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely a MUST have for every nail polish</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s VERY noticeable.</li>
            <li> This dries your nails FAST and LASTS.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s SO much cheaper on Amazon than it is in stores, even w/ a beauty license discount.</li>
            <li> And it really protects the polish from chipping.  </li>
            <li> Thanks guys...  Cathi</li>
            <li> Dries really fast...</li>
            <li> But dries fast and shiny.</li>
            <li> Dries really fast</li>
            <li> Fast drying, leaves shiny coat, and really protects color.</li>
            <li> but I really like this product.</li>
            <li> though it says and seems it&#x27;s fast drying.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am a bit more rough on my nails</li>
            <li> Fast drying.</li>
            <li> Will absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li> too (this stuff dries lightening fast</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I prefer revlon colorstay topcoat though both did not help fasten the drying time that much</li>
            <li> Seriously fast.</li>
            <li> Dries fast though.</li>
            <li> It dries in around 10 minutes and around an hour to really harden.</li>
            <li> It dries incredibly fast, (and I have yet to see it clump on me</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;It dries my nail polish so fast...</li>
            <li> You can polish your nails, put on the Seche Vite, and in 1 minute you are ready to go.  </li>
            <li> If you reapply a top coat everyday your polish will last up to a week or more.  </li>
            <li> It was only $4.40 with free shipping</li>
            <li> It dries fast.</li>
            <li> If you apply too much to the nail, no worries.</li>
            <li> This product literally is fast drying.</li>
            <li> Heard so much about this brand, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay almost $10 for a bottle in the stores.</li>
            <li> but this one was much stronger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast drying and anti-chipping.</li>
            <li> It really does protect your color.  </li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> Drys insanely fast</li>
            <li> Dries fast too.</li>
            <li> Really seals it it to help the manicure&#x27;s staying power.</li>
            <li> Dries SO fast</li>
            <li> Keeps nail polish on for over a week and fast drying.</li>
            <li> The smell is absolutely toxic, but I guess it&#x27;s forgivable if it does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I really like how fast Seche Vite dries.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> and it dries so fast.</li>
            <li> and I just don&#x27;t like them as much as seche vite.</li>
            <li> Now in the summer I change my nail color every two days, and it helps to have a fast dryer.</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s really takes care of my nails.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> After carefully placing my designs on each nail, I would unavoidably find it smudged with the top coats I was using.  </li>
            <li> This chips/peels off too fast for me.</li>
            <li> the product, it works very well, as promised.</li>
            <li> dries fast, very shiny and protects well.  </li>
            <li> I can not beleive how fast my polish dries using this.  </li>
            <li> /sets polish very quickly&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly shiny</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Contains toluene&lt;br /&gt;Smells really bad&lt;</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t notice much difference.</li>
            <li> And remember to wipe your nails with acetone-based (or straight aceton, as I opt to do) nail polish remover so that the nail polish &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; and your at-home manicure lasts.</li>
            <li> But it chips just as fast.  </li>
            <li> one is because it dries fast and is shiny.</li>
            <li> Dries insanely fast.</li>
            <li> It is very glossy.</li>
            <li> absolute must have for doing your nails at home.</li>
            <li> And to make matters worse, most of these so called &amp;#34;top rated top coats&amp;#34; peeled within three days of me applying my nail polish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make a long story short, I was very pleased with my results.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t yellow like many clear polishes.  </li>
            <li> My nails are nice and firm, very shiny and my manicure now lasts about a week.</li>
            <li> But I definitely got longer wear from my old top coat.</li>
            <li> This polish does dry super quick.  </li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s like any regular old top coat.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it helped dry everything super quick</li>
            <li> I am even able to intricately and properly do my 12yr old&#x27;s nails</li>
            <li> There is some small smearing, but not NEARLY as bad as big brand top coats, as in the kind in the makeup isle at your local grocery store.</li>
            <li> I like thick topcoats a lot because I find that they are longer-lasting and provide superior shine.</li>
            <li> Good to note that it is is a thick polish and needs to be spread evenly (you can see drastic differences or if you missed a spot).</li>
            <li> So, this is my hope for Seche Vite, I can paint my nails and have it last a good 5 days before I have to look down and think \\&quot;Hot mess!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> The brush pulled the colored polish right off my nail, unbeknownst to me, and tainted the entire bottle when I dipped the brush back in for more.</li>
            <li> it beats other top coats ive tried and loved, like out the door and hard as nails..</li>
            <li> Wow!!!  </li>
            <li> Normally when I put on a top coat it takes forever to dry</li>
            <li> The only real benefit it has is the quick dry time, but I feel as though that quickness could be achieved with another fast drying top coat.</li>
            <li> This top coat has a strong bad smell, doesn&#x27;t go on smooth, and chips off quickly.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new, so this was the first one.</li>
            <li> I am pretty hard on my nails , but I&#x27;ve had cheap clear polish hold better than that.</li>
            <li> Dries much quicker than any other top coat I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My other fast drying top coats have now been demoted to doing pedicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes the polish shiny and stay much longer than other top coats.</li>
            <li> It is really shiny and does not interfere with the polish underneath as you apply it (some other top coats streak the nail color that they&#x27;re being applied to).</li>
            <li> i was used to painting my nails every other day, mostly because they start chipping, but this preserves it for much longer.</li>
            <li> Apparently you should not use if you are pregnant or want to have kids.</li>
            <li> Unlike other fast drying top coats though it does not chip.</li>
            <li> It really does dries your nails quicker than any other top coat polish out there.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite, however, has provided a much clearer and glossier finish than any other top coat I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> makes your polish last super super super long.</li>
            <li> it chipped the same day, it literally lasted as long as the cheap $1 clear top coat.</li>
            <li> Whether you are looking for quick dry (it sure does dry fast!)</li>
            <li> The only fast dry top coat I use!</li>
            <li> After all the&amp;#34;hype&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve heard about this particular Seche product,I expected more.</li>
            <li> Gives a fabulous gel like shine and dries hard SUPER FAST!!</li>
            <li> Seche Vite, while completely unpronounceable, forms this amazing hard shell over your nails and dries super fast.</li>
            <li> The formula and brush make it very easy to apply and it definitely helps make my polish last longer.</li>
            <li> its durable and shiny but dries faster than any other top coat without leaving the polish layers mushy underneath.</li>
            <li> other top coats try to imitate it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which polish is improving the longevity more, but everything put together is working!</li>
            <li> The clerk at Sally Beauty Supply gave me a tip; always use a top coat or your polish will peel off in one sheet (as other reviewers have mentioned.)  </li>
            <li> The first thing you will notice when you open the bottle is the odor - it is overwhelming and gives me a headache after only moments.</li>
            <li> usually do two coats of my polish and wait about a minute or more to apply the top coat, after about 2 minutes its not longer tacky to the touch, but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest you start playing with rocks just yet, however, you can go about your day with some caution for the following 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t afford manis/pedis more than about once per year, but I&#x27;m extremely picky when it comes to DIY nail polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;mmoving on to other top coats.  </li>
            <li> I originally gave this only 1 star.  </li>
            <li> and that gets it back to its original form.</li>
            <li> I change mine about every other day and this top coat holds up well for 2 days and then begins to chip away.</li>
            <li> reason I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because it definitely does not stop chipping, which is the reason I originally purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other night I finished painting my nails and had about 10-15 minutes to go until I needed to go to bed, and with this product that was able to happen.</li>
            <li> After awhile of letting the layers of polish set, I won&#x27;t even get dents in my nails if I touch something (which always happens with other top coats).</li>
            <li> and I tried a couple other top coats but each time I used it my nails would end up with a smudge or</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any other top coat out there yet that self-levels the way Seche Vite does.  </li>
            <li> Also it will not smear nail art like other top coats...</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t get any other top coat after using this one.</li>
            <li> I do not put any other top coat on my nails anymore.</li>
            <li> A problem I&#x27;ve had with other top coats is that when my nails are bent, the nail polish will loosen and chip.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it gets goopy, but any nail polish thinner (I use Beauty Secrets) should restore it to its original consistency.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other top coats and this one works wonders, staying on for days and fighting to protect your nails from the world.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had only a couple of instances where use of this topcoat has not resulted in significant peeling.  </li>
            <li> I would never consider any other top coat after using this.  </li>
            <li> It kicks all other top coats to the curb.</li>
            <li> the price is way better than any other online site.</li>
            <li> I keep trying other topcoats but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> and and I have already disposed of all other top coats in my house.  </li>
            <li> Dries quicker than any other top coat I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> A lot of the other top coats I have tried would smudge my nail art/designs</li>
            <li> I used to have other top coats</li>
            <li> I normally take this off before it begins to wear!</li>
            <li> They also stay shinier longer than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> and after i applied it my nails were noticeably dryer than they had been with other top coats.</li>
            <li> My nailpolish no longer chips as much as other top coats.</li>
            <li> My polish usually lasts about 5 days without any chipping...and that is a pretty long time to me as I have used other top coats and experienced chipping within a day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wake up with waffle nails which was my struggle with all my other top coats!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just seems to work better than all the other ones, and a lot of salons use it.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d recommend using Seche Restore which provides the ingredients that have evaporated from the bottle over time to get it back to its original consistency.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, the next time I purchased a bottle it was received in an original box that stated \\&quot;BIRTH DEFECTS AND REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES\\</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a lot better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> /&gt;Incidentally, the other top coat I use when taking a Seche Vite vacation is Revlon.  </li>
            <li> I applied a second coat for more protection and shine several days after the first with no problems.  </li>
            <li> It provides a high gloss finish with extremely fast drying and really seals in your polish with just one coat.</li>
            <li> Love this clear polish, it really does dry incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> Dries very quick and lasts long!</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t even know it was possible for top coats to dry so fast!), and leaves your nails really shiny (which is nice because it helps to camouflage little imperfections).</li>
            <li> the edges lift and literally the entire coat of polish will peel clean off.  </li>
            <li> Worth more than the small price.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is that it&#x27;s not big 3 free, so I won&#x27;t be using it while pregnant.</li>
            <li> I wondered why it looked so much better and lasted so long when I got a professional pedicure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how long my  manicures last!</li>
            <li> I love this clear polish it makes it dry fast</li>
            <li> it really does dry your nails quickly!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a top coat that can make my nails last more than a couple days without chipping... and after trying several complete failures, I&#x27;ve finally found it.</li>
            <li> It does dry very quickly.</li>
            <li> This top coat saves you fifteen minutes worth of dry time and only takes 30 seconds to a minute.</li>
            <li> Dries really fast, always goes on smooth and shiny, doesn&#x27;t chip for a long time.</li>
            <li> They dried super quick!</li>
            <li> It does have a strong odor during application that I don&#x27;t notice when dry.</li>
            <li> Love how it drys super fast and don&#x27;t have to wait for my nails that long to dry.</li>
            <li> This is a nice lasting top coat and it does dry faster than the other brands I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> It provides a great shiny top coat which brings alive any nail polish color and helps it to dry super quick...even with dark tones of nail polish which usually take longer.</li>
            <li> It gives polish a high gloss finish and it&#x27;s very durable.</li>
            <li> It is thick and has a strong odor, but I am sure that odor comes from the chemical that allows it to dry so quickly.</li>
            <li> Makes my nails look like I got a professional manicure and dries very fast.</li>
            <li> While it will take several days more before I can comment on Chip resistance, let me just say that this is much shinier than any other fast drying top coat I have tried, and the equal of some high gloss coats.</li>
            <li> (if you bump a nail, you make mess it up, but if it&#x27;s a light bump, it evens itself out pretty well!</li>
            <li> It really does dry super fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the fault of the OPI polish and not this top coat, seeing as the other brands/colors last a long time.    </li>
            <li> This really does dry SUPER FAST!  </li>
            <li> Goes on thick but smooth and clean crisp finish.</li>
            <li> It dries nail color quickly, however, it does dry pretty fast when exposed to air.</li>
            <li> Dries super quickly, but when I use it just directly on my nails, it turns a strange color brown at the ends after a day or two.</li>
            <li> Amazing, dried my newly painted nails in about 3-5min.  </li>
            <li> However, 5 days later it literally peels right off the nail, along with the nail polish underneath it!  </li>
            <li> My only very minor complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t dry with that awesome glassy look that some top coats have</li>
            <li> It dries super fast and solid!</li>
            <li> The only thing I will say is that if you are sensitive to the strong scent of nail polish, do NOT order this product.</li>
            <li> Within 2-3 minutes, my nail polish is completely dry and I am able to do something as touch sensitive as moving clothes from the washer to the dryer.</li>
            <li> Drys super fast and makes my polishes last longer.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I&#x27;ve always had a peeling problem with my polish, never having had a manicure last less than a day.</li>
            <li> It definitely dries super fast</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the super thick consistancy it has</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be a bit challenging to find in stores, so I was excited to find it on Amazon, and at about half the price we pay in the local stores.</li>
            <li> and I have my nails looking fabulous all week long.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and adds shine and protection but not for to long.</li>
            <li> as long as you get the free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I have another quick dry top coat called Jet Dry by Kiss</li>
            <li> I use various base coats, but Seche Vite is the best top coat out there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(The nail color in this photo is Hello Pretty in Sally Hansen&#x27;s Complete Salon Manicure line.)</li>
            <li> My nails have never dried so fast!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to smell</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own nails for the past year</li>
            <li> The average wear I get out of my polish with Seche Vite top coat is between 5 and 8 days before I get a chip.</li>
            <li> Nails dry super fest!</li>
            <li> It makes your nails dry so quick and leaves them looking like glass and feel like gel!</li>
            <li> This tends to make my nail polish chip/peel much faster than normal.</li>
            <li> If that doesn&#x27;t scream hazardous, not sure what else would.</li>
            <li> i did my nails just 15 min before leaving the house to go on a date and by the time i got to my destination, they were completely dry and super shiny!</li>
            <li> will note that this is a really thick top coat, so you have to make sure you cover the entire nail or else</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: While everything I wrote above remains true, I&#x27;ve encountered a problem.  </li>
            <li> However, I am just not willing to spend more than a couple dollars for a bottle of nail polish, especially when you buy so many different colors.  </li>
            <li> I have a base coat made by the same people and I have always loved it--works great.</li>
            <li> This top coat does dry very quickly even when I apply multiple coats in a short time span.  </li>
            <li> There is a trick to reducing that problem but most of us just want to polish and not worry about bowing down to a product.</li>
            <li> this stuff will dry everything up pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> You have to coat your nails pretty quickly so that the product doesn&#x27;t dry itself out.</li>
            <li> But it hardens quickly in the bottle half way full.</li>
            <li> Makes polish dry super fast!</li>
            <li> Everyone is amazed that this quick dry really works!</li>
            <li> Makes polish dry super fast!</li>
            <li> I cant wait to use it more often with other clients !</li>
            <li> I have been able to do my nails a lot more than usual because I don&#x27;t have wait forever for them dry.</li>
            <li> there is a little shrinkage, so make sure you coat the whole nail.</li>
            <li> This is my new go to top coat, I won&#x27;t be using anything other than this.</li>
            <li> this is my new topcoat!</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and thought I had found a new top coat.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I got this the other day because I needed a new top coat.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it now that I&#x27;ve tried it!</li>
            <li> My third time purchasing this top coat, long lasting and smooth.</li>
            <li> It is very thick which works great to make your nails shine and your designs looks professional.</li>
            <li> Usually, the first place my nail polish will wear is on my thumbs, and this is the first top coat I&#x27;ve had that has stopped that completely.</li>
            <li> , it dries so fast, leaves your nails so shiny and hard, and its amazing.</li>
            <li> , it dries faster than any OPI top coat I&#x27;ve used or any other brand top coat for that matter, and over the years I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> My nails dry so fast, are super shiny, and I never get that bubbling effect that I&#x27;ve seen with other polishes and top coats.</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii and it came thru fast.</li>
            <li> This has become my go-to top coat because it dries quickly and does not create any air bubbles, which is a big trouble with other top coats.  </li>
            <li> Seche Vite top coat does go on smooth and dries very fast, but it does chip after a few days, but overall it is a better top coat than a few others that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> There are reviews on here that ask how this top coat has gotten good reviews, but I don&#x27;t understand how it got any bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> and then I am free from the bondage of waiting for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li> Super fast dry, very shiny.</li>
            <li> The first day is fine, but by the third day the polish has seem to shrunk back from the tip.  </li>
            <li> In the end I picked 4 because this stuff is magical in the sense that it dries in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I kept hearing about this top coat as a &amp;#34;HG&amp;#34; (holy grail) product, but never bothered to pick it up because I felt obligated to finish up the previous bottle</li>
            <li> I applied the Seche Vite while my nail polish was still wet and found it absolutely EASY to apply.</li>
            <li> By a couple of days in, I&#x27;ve had half of a nail peeling off, usually more than one.  </li>
            <li> My nails started chipping at the tops slightly after a couple of days, but I like this top coat regardless.</li>
            <li> I think the OPI top coat is slightly easier to work with.</li>
            <li> I used the top coat and in less than 24 hours it began to flake off all of my nails.</li>
            <li> Did not last any longer than other top coats I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> If you go in their shops and ask to buy a top coat, this is the only one they will sell you, and the only one they will use.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple top coats and this is always the one I go back to!  </li>
            <li> Well, it dries the outside of the polish quickly.</li>
            <li> Now you do have to be realistic with yourself.  </li>
            <li> read about this product in one of the In Style product reviews years ago and have been a steady convert since then.  </li>
            <li> I like to do my nails at home because I&#x27;m lucky enough to have a steady hand</li>
            <li> Before this I had a top coat that literally cracked and chipped my manicures like 2 days after doing them, and then finally I had enough.</li>
            <li> so they are sure to use mine not any random top coat</li>
            <li> This concerns me not so much personally for the birth defects as I am in my mid 40&#x27;s with teenagers and don&#x27;t plan on having more children.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a top coat that dried this fast.</li>
            <li> Recently I&#x27;ve been struggling with top coats that several hours after I applied them were still developing bubbles or I would wake up the morning after doing my nails the afternoon before and discover sheets marks on my nails.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice when you have an impatient 3 and 5 year old always wanting or needing help with something.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and provides lasting shine.  </li>
            <li> I will say that while it dries fast, it will take a few minutes to &#x27;cure&#x27; the nail polish if you have many layers on.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly, provides a glossy finish, AND helps polish last longer.</li>
            <li> I have been able to stretch manicures for almost a week whereas before they would only last for a day or two.</li>
            <li> This top coat even worked better than all the fake nail dryer systems I purchased.</li>
            <li> Dries quick and makes me polish last!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different top coats.</li>
            <li> I also bought the Seche thinner which has breathed life into my older gloppy polishes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t count how many times where I have painted my nails last minute before going out and it dries instantly!</li>
            <li> and it always seemed like they were putting polish on so quick after the final coat.  </li>
            <li> I can put on three coats of polish and this top coat and ten minutes later be washing dishes or getting dressed with no worries!</li>
            <li> Oh yes.  Great as a base, or top coat or alone.  </li>
            <li> Most of the times I&#x27;ve used this have resulted in chipped manicures on the 2nd or 3rd day.</li>
            <li> but this....this is my main squeeze.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and provides just enough shine.</li>
            <li> Putting this on my OPI nail polishes definitely helps prevent my nails from chipping for about 4 extra days. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a top coat that dried this fast and the polish looks so shiny.  </li>
            <li> I am never going back to a regular top coat.</li>
            <li> The only reason this doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t stay super shiny for longer than a day or 2.  </li>
            <li> only that part chips off quickly.  </li>
            <li> While I love the way that it makes my nails look, it&#x27;s useless when the top coat peels off (along with the nail polish underneath) over the course of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and provides a lasting glossy shine.</li>
            <li> This is the only top coat I have used for the last two years.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase this again in the future. :)</li>
            <li> This top coat has some big pros, and some big cons for me.</li>
            <li> Now I haven&#x27;t tried any OPI top coats, heard they do well, but they are even more expensive, so I didn&#x27;t try it yet.</li>
            <li> Dries really quick and keeps the shine for several days.</li>
            <li> so quick i do not mind doing the regular manicure!!!</li>
            <li> Ill be buying more for sure.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While the product does dry my nails super fast and make them shiny, I would have to touch them up repeatedly starting on the second or third day to keep them looking good.  </li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as this top coat, my manicure will last much longer.  </li>
            <li> Makes my home manicures last longer than any other top coat I have ever used before!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too expensive when purchased online, so overall I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I use this top coat with the gelous base coat and its great.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and leaves a lasting shine that looks like you stepped out of a nail salon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This will definitely be the only top coat I ever use again</li>
            <li> i think this chips a decent amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying I wasn&#x27;t doing anything wrong, but I sure as hell wasn&#x27;t able to figure out what it was, try as I might.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only use this top coat for the last 4 years!</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, however, starts chipping either the very same day when applied or the day after.</li>
            <li> I am guessing because it dries so quick that when it is open</li>
            <li> The next time I tried it, with a different nail polish, I alternated between applying color and this top coat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the longest time I&#x27;ve been trying to find a top coat that worked well and dried fast.</li>
            <li> stuff dries fairly quickly, but isn&#x27;t INSTANT.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Strong smell, STRONG smell&lt;br /&gt;Takes longer on wet polish</li>
            <li> This has the expected strong polish scent so no surprises there.</li>
            <li> It has a strong chemical smell, which is to be expected considering the ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong (and no I am not pregnant or overly sensitive to smells).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Butyl Acetate (main ingredient)  can also be narcotic in high concentrations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very glossy clear coat/top coat!</li>
            <li> I was recommended this top coat instead of the more expensive one I normally buy.  </li>
            <li> I have a very busy life and can&#x27;t sit around waiting for polish to dry--this has been a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> I use has the exact same smell, so this really didn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li> the whole coat peeled right off, the same evening.  </li>
            <li> The smell is pretty strong and my manicure did chip after a few days.  </li>
            <li> So, be sure to tightly cap it after every use, and be prepared for it to thicken up.</li>
            <li> I make sure to screw the cap on tightly as a result, this seems to help.</li>
            <li> It makes your polish dry to the touch quickly and is better than any other one that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> High shine, even over matte polish&lt;br /&gt;Dries</li>
            <li> So...I won&#x27;t be getting any additional bottles of Sache Vite and will continue to look for a product which leaves nail with a high shine.</li>
            <li> Also leaves a high shine and smoothes any nicks, bubbles, or blemishes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> also it seems to yellow very fast with light colors like white and light pink, and also alters the color of my nude polish after a day or so.</li>
            <li> Nails still chip after 2 or 3 days, and the high gloss finish isnt as glossy as the company would like you to believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I experienced.&lt;br /&gt;- Has a high glass shine.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> After using Miracle Shine for a year, this polish has a faster drying period, high gloss, and longevity.  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> The nail technicians speak highly of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> But you are not getting the highly glossy look probably at that expense.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> On balance, it&#x27;s still worth it because my nails still look nice and air bubble free for at least a few days.  </li>
            <li> It is better than &amp;#34;out the door&amp;#34; and just about any other clear coat, however.  </li>
            <li> thing that is clear is that one&#x27;s nail structure and products used with Seche can play a big role in how well it will work for you - it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I was able to smooth onto nails while still wet, less than 1 minute after application.  </li>
            <li> As my others run out, this will replace all my other clear top coats.</li>
            <li> It does dry really fast, but it doesn&#x27;t last for many days ..</li>
            <li> I would love to see this have a flat brush instead of the standard.</li>
            <li> With this dry fast top coat i can get to my daily routine without smudged nails.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER had a fast dry top coat that actually worked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if you don&#x27;t need your manicure to last more than 4 days and want your nails to dry fast, this works.</li>
            <li> used to love this for the fast dry time, but ultimately I don&#x27;t think it outweighs the cons.</li>
            <li> Now, for those of you girly gals that don&#x27;t dig chemicals I believe Seche Vite (regular fast dry top coat) has Formaldehyde in it and for those ladies who don&#x27;t care (like myself)</li>
            <li> Makes polish dry really quickly and very high gloss shine.  </li>
            <li> But lucky for me I found this little gem, and now I only have to wait a few minutes regardless of how many coats are beneath this top coat.</li>
            <li> but then I put Seche Vite over it and it fixed the smudges!!</li>
            <li> for a little while I thought I found my Holy Grail top coat...</li>
            <li> Wet n Wild&#x27;s 99cent topcoat actually does a better job preserving a manicure!</li>
            <li> The top coat may get a little scratched on the surface</li>
            <li> When I first used this, I decided to use it on only one hand, and use my inexpensive drug store top coat on the other.  </li>
            <li> It makes toenail polish last for several weeks, and makes it look so much more professional!</li>
            <li> It costs a little more at stores like riteaid or cvs...</li>
            <li> I also love that it fills in any little bumps or ridges that might have formed with the color polish.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact the OPI top coats created little bubbles on my nails.</li>
            <li> I did remove a star because I noticed a little &amp;#34;shrinkage&amp;#34;, i.e. the nail color pulling away from my edges and cuticles as the top coat dries.</li>
            <li> Lasts two weeks, makes your nails look like they were professionally done!!</li>
            <li> heard about this stuff on Pinterest and WOW!!</li>
            <li> Also when painting your nails with this top coat make sure to not be a messy, ie getting polish all over, that&#x27;ll mess up your manicure as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you want your nails to dry super fast with no smudges</li>
            <li> Super fast dry.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does dry super fast, BUT</li>
            <li> Even when my color is not dry yet I can use this top coat and my nails are dry in seconds.</li>
            <li> So I would recommend this if you need to make your nails dry very quickly, AND you like re-polishing your nails quite frequently.</li>
            <li> Nails are dry super fast.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t hurt that it does dry super fast.</li>
            <li> Dry super fast.</li>
            <li> My nails dry super fast and they look like glass.</li>
            <li> Nails shine, and dried super quick.</li>
            <li> drying time is unreal, super fast, and super slick.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s kind of hard to get off with polish remover.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have reported, it does have a strong chemical-ly smell, but</li>
            <li> Dries my nails with a nice hard coat and a shine.</li>
            <li> I am have a hard time not smudging when I do my own nails</li>
            <li> am not a professional manicurist so, maybe there are special ways of using this product?&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, will not buy again..</li>
            <li> I normally have to reapply the top coat in the middle of the weak to keep my polish looking fresh, but I only have to use this top once</li>
            <li> Not the best or worst of top coats - it does dry quickly but it doesn&#x27;t prevent chipping either - regardless of the quality of the nail color.</li>
            <li> This really does dry very fast!  </li>
            <li> For those who are encountering problems with shrinkage due to their polish being three-free, it might be a good idea to let the polish dry completely.  </li>
            <li> apply to very wet polish or it&#x27;ll peel off easily</li>
            <li> So at this point not so sure if better than other coat top polish that takes more time to dry :(</li>
            <li> so i got a little worried, but it dried quickly and created a beautiful, smooth, hard, protective layer over the color of my nail polish.</li>
            <li> I was a tad intimidated by the bad reviews here on Amazon, but I&#x27;m happy I went ahead and purchased SV anyway!</li>
            <li> The idea that it penetrates all layers of polish to make one, solid covering sounded intriguing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of glitters,shimmers,and chunky polishes in general,love the look,hate the rough finishes</li>
            <li> but hey, I can deal with that if I&#x27;m not forced to sit around and wait an hour for my touch up to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> It dries fast and the clear coat is not sticky.</li>
            <li> Dries fast and makes your nails look shiny and professional.</li>
            <li> and it is not thick</li>
            <li> Fast drying, clear.</li>
            <li> Pros: very shiny, professional looking finish.</li>
            <li> Works very well, but if you are sensitive to smells at all, skip it.  </li>
            <li> Has a weird smell but works great</li>
            <li> It dries to a gel-like clear, polished, protective finish very rapidly.</li>
            <li> Great price on amazon though, can&#x27;t go wrong there.</li>
            <li> It really dries completely within 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic for a quick dry, it lets my nails dry with in 20 minutes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many coats below (three at MOST, and only with a thin polish)</li>
            <li> I will say that it seemed to preserve my polish a few days more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about this top coat from an Ulta employee but just thought it would be a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Shiny nails and super fast dry!</li>
            <li> I first heard of it from every nailpolish blogger ever (thanks, pinterest - who knew such things existed??)...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably the most impatient person to ever give nail art a try.</li>
            <li> It does have a kind of strange smell, but for the end result, I absolutely do not mind.</li>
            <li> Most polishes have the scent for a few hours, but this scent disappears in minutes.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, this polish is inexpensive enough to always have a fresh bottle for a truly miraculous home-polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t post stuff like this</li>
            <li> It led not just to the chipping of polish, but to my fingernails breaking, unevenly, along the top.</li>
            <li> My nails grow pretty fast but after using this product, my nails tke 10 years (not literally) to grow back!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the low ratings it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using the Seche Vite, I thought it was just going to be what I used years ago, I only wear top coats on dark nail polish.</li>
            <li> I paint my nails with the color of my choice and let it sit for a few minutes then place the top coat on and wait 20 minutes</li>
            <li> Peels off after normal wear in one day.</li>
            <li> so idk if that is normal.</li>
            <li> I normally can&#x27;t go for even a day without my manicure chipping.  </li>
            <li> I find that this top coat dries in a matter of a few minutes.</li>
            <li> which is actually a few dollars more than this.</li>
            <li> So I asked a few friends for suggestions and a friend recommended that I used Seche Vite as my top coat.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a few more bottles just to have on hand.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway I decided to do a fresh mani with Brucci Gianna&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Blue.</li>
            <li> I had this top coat a long time ago but only used it a couple of times before my sister took it.</li>
            <li> I find that my non-smelling top coats last as long if not longer than this one.</li>
            <li> , you can apply it on top of wet nails and it will suck the moisture of the layers of nail polish below it so all of your nails dries within that time :O</li>
            <li> Also, after a day or so of normal wear</li>
            <li> and I use to make my manicures last longer---sometimes as long as 2 weeks---way better than even using nail gels.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;However, the rumors about it completely peeling off an entire nail are true.</li>
            <li> I have never had a top coat that dried within the 5 minutes that I applied it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; a few of them to friends who love it after trying it from me.</li>
            <li> The extra coats I use revive the manicure so it looks fresh again.</li>
            <li> I cycled through so many brands of polish and top coats, always ending up with the same frustrating dents and marks.</li>
            <li> Long lasting top coat in centuries.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product for anyone that wants pretty nails</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t leave reviews but for this I had to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally use this with China Glaze polish</li>
            <li> A few days after I get my nails done, I paint this top coat over my nails and it helps prevent my nails from chipping.</li>
            <li> Essie Good to Go does everything this claims to do (if not better) and actually lasts and can be re applied.</li>
            <li> Although it goes on as a nice thick protective coat and is shinny, salon quality, it started peeling alot sooner</li>
            <li> It also gives it a nice, thick gloss</li>
            <li> The stuff does dry very fast and its cheap, which makes up for the vile smell that comes from that tiny bottle.</li>
            <li> I am hard on my nails and not patient enough to wait for them to dry completely before going on with my day, so this product is perfect for</li>
            <li> I am a new fan and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> 2 diaper changes and a couple tantrums later (literally 5 minutes after I painted my nails), my nails were still smooth and fresh and as dry as a 3 day old manicure.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff is magic, I&#x27;ll never use another topcoat polish ever again!</li>
            <li> and I was very excited to find it online for much cheaper than the usual $10</li>
            <li> It really does dry really fast and leaves my nail looking very shiny!</li>
            <li> I bought Seche Restore to deal w/this problem, but IMO the formula is never the same as when the bottle is new &amp; fresh.)  </li>
            <li> When I smelled the polish itself, it had a too strong odor that most fake polishes have.</li>
            <li> Nail polish and top coat dry within 5 minutes of application, and nail colors last longer without chipping!</li>
            <li> It also tends to dry only the top layer, often crumpling the under-layers of polish.</li>
            <li> Now with this I only wait 30 mins to make sure its really dry</li>
            <li> This top coat is a miracle your nails get dry within minutes even if you have several coats of polish!</li>
            <li> now, I&#x27;m still looking for a toluene free, less stinky alternative that dries my nails fast</li>
            <li> Dried very quickly, used over nail polish and put a real shine on my nails.  </li>
            <li> If you use it over dry polish, it&#x27;s much more likely to peel up.</li>
            <li> I love how I can layer this over a not yet dry second coat of nail polish!</li>
            <li> This top coat, named \\&quot;Dry fast\\&quot; in French, does what it says it will.  </li>
            <li> Goes on thick and smooth and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> and I usually have pretty strong nails...</li>
            <li> and i really dont see myself going back to any other top coat ive used.</li>
            <li> As for protecting the nail polish and keeping the color on, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be more durable than other top coats, at least for my nails.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn it long enough to know if it chips/lasts, but I&#x27;m pleased just with the quick dry time.</li>
            <li> if it doesn&#x27;t peel off right away by the next day it will.</li>
            <li> use my mask right now, and I will probably stop using this product because my mind is not totally at peace with it yet..</li>
            <li> I did this to test it and managed to severely smudge the tips of two of my fingers (right pointer and left thumb).  </li>
            <li> I put it on right after I put several coats of everything before</li>
            <li> This stuff caused every manicure I used it on to peel right off in one big piece within a day or two, almost like plasti dip for cars.</li>
            <li> Yes, it smells but the high gloss and quick dry make up for it.</li>
            <li> What I love the most is that the product is dry and hard within 15 minutes!   </li>
            <li> This is the only top coat that at least somehow prevents my nail polish from chipping the first day, and the only one that goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> time just isn&#x27;t as long as needed for a quick polish.</li>
            <li> I use to have to reapply every other day after cleaning and washing dishes but with this top coat I am going on 2 weeks and my nail polish has barely chipped, keep in mind</li>
            <li> It peels the whole polish in a matter of days, if not less.</li>
            <li> This is probably the Cadillac of top coats, but I probably would not have bought it if I knew that it &amp;#34;contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause birth defects and other reproductive harm.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m not looking to have a baby, but I will look for a less toxic formula for my next top coat purchase.</li>
            <li> It does take longer to dry than you&#x27;d expect from a fast dry top coat though.</li>
            <li> I put this over a new coat of polish last night right before bedtime</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it did nothing special for me and has a VERY strong smell.</li>
            <li> This top coat dried very fast and helped my manicure last longer.</li>
            <li> I am nail polish obsessed and have at least 5 different top coats, this one is without a doubt the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Dries extremely fast, and if you nail polish is still a little sticky the top coat will still dry fast!</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not quite as long as a typical gel manicure, the price and quick drying time easily makes up for it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my manicure last any longer or make my nails shine any brighter, so it&#x27;s really just an average top coat</li>
            <li> I have been using Seche Vite for several years, and within those years I have tried other top coats, you know, to see if I can find a top coat a little cheaper, and like they say, you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> importantly, there is a warning label on the bottle saying that &amp;#34;this product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.</li>
            <li> All of these can be tough on a manicure, but I&#x27;d still expect more than a days worth of wear.</li>
            <li> I am new to this nail care stuff.</li>
            <li> How did I live 23 years without this?</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll live.</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Works like new after adding some nail polish thinner.</li>
            <li> Keeps my mani&#x27;s shiny for 3-4 days, then I apply a new coat</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s brand new again.</li>
            <li> But for the price, I don&#x27;t mind purchasing a new bottle.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am new to the world of nail art stamping, and anyone that makes rounds on youtube will tell you that this topcoat is all the rage.</li>
            <li> I sometimes reapply after a week to get that shiny, newly manicured look.</li>
            <li> I found that these do not chip (if you&#x27;re using a brand new bottle) but will eventually after a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> So, I needed a new one.</li>
            <li> It is fixable with the polish refresher (another $10), but I don&#x27;t feel like I should have to do that with a brand new bottle.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I had no way to get it where I live.  </li>
            <li> This top coat dries fast and hard and won&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be aware that it will dry out after a few months and become thicker and harder to use, though it will still dry perfectly even when it&#x27;s started to thicken up.</li>
            <li> Can be found for a reasonable price if you know where to look - online and small shops tend to be much more realistic than major retailers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the only thing that is kind of annoying is that the topcoat get a little gloopy after a while so make sure you have a good nail thinner to go with it</li>
            <li> This stuff is super shiney, and stays on for a long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never created such a great manicure with any other topcoat, in such a short time.</li>
            <li> This helps regular nail polish dry much faster and helps smooth out the tops.</li>
            <li> Dries SO fast and chip free for a few days.</li>
            <li> But the thinner they sell as this does dry out quickly.  </li>
            <li> When I saw the massive number of 5 star reviews for Seche, I ordered a bottle expecting it to be at least as good as the Sally Hansen topcoat.</li>
            <li> For starters, it goes on extremely thick, so you have to make sure that don&#x27;t pick up too much on the brush.</li>
            <li> It drys quickly, so there&#x27;s no accidental oopsies while waiting for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li> Because of the toluene Seche Vite simply does not work with Big 3 Free polishes.</li>
            <li> It dries (enough to touch without smudging) within a minute, and with a smooth, glossy finish that I didn&#x27;t even know was physically possible for nail polish to have.</li>
            <li> It also makes your nails dry quick.</li>
            <li> I love that it only takes like 5 to 10 mins to dry completely</li>
            <li> It is really thick and while putting it on I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be smooth when dry.  </li>
            <li> Makes nail polish dry quickly.</li>
            <li> Ive been looking for a quick way to dry my nails for about a year.  </li>
            <li> its simply amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;Paint a coat on and it not only looks like you have had your nails gel painted, but it dries super fast even when you put on a couple coats of a polish under it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does dry incredibly quickly.</li>
            <li> I always apply this in a super ventilated area such as outside my home haha.</li>
            <li> But since it dried super fast, I really don&#x27;t mind redoing the nail over.</li>
            <li> It dry&#x27;s fairly quickly</li>
            <li> Makes your nails dry quickly which it was</li>
            <li> It goes on nice and glossy, tacking within a minute of application and drying in the next few minutes afterwards.</li>
            <li> Always does the job when you need your polish to dry quick.</li>
            <li> when I did it, I have Seche Vite to make it dry quickly.</li>
            <li> love that i can do my nails and not spend a day being extra careful not to smear it.</li>
            <li> This is a quick way to get your nails dry if you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li> This top coat would definitely work well for busy moms who don&#x27;t have the luxury of waiting for their nails to dry.</li>
            <li> It definitely keeps my polish looking better for longer with minimal chipping.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this because I need quick dry</li>
            <li> It has a smooth and glossy finish, and I can actually use my nails to unbutton my jeans to pee within ten minutes of applying it</li>
            <li> Nails are super shiny, and dry in 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Essie Quick Dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry quickly at all.</li>
            <li> I generally use higher end polishes like Butter London, OPI, China Glaze, Zoya, and others, but have a busy schedule that makes doing my nails a trial without quickdry topcoat.  </li>
            <li> I used drying drops on these, so I cannot say how quickly it would dry without that.</li>
            <li> Even if my color application is messy this top coat makes it shine and look professional.  </li>
            <li> No matter what type of polish I use under this top coat (whether it&#x27;s cheap or expensive)</li>
            <li> They then get completely dry quickly, which otherwise takes hours, for those of us who have woken up with blanket weave marks in our nail polish.</li>
            <li> It makes your nails super shiny and within minutes they are dry.</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected and it is a phenomenal product.</li>
            <li> quick dry, and</li>
            <li> I have found that quick dry topcoats, quick dry sprays and drops, etc.</li>
            <li> Except for the quick dry thing.</li>
            <li> Except for the quick dry thing.</li>
            <li> This top coat was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> It does help dry nails quickly.</li>
            <li> Definitely put on the top coat when your polish is wet</li>
            <li> Dry&#x27;s quickly &amp; durable.</li>
            <li> and it helps dry your nails quickly meaning NO SMUDGES.</li>
            <li> A thin coat dries quickly (about 3 minutes) and has such a nice, shiny finish.</li>
            <li> I love that it dries fast and thick.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The brand&#x27;s base coat is not as good as the top coat though.</li>
            <li> The Seche Vite Dry Fast really works and keeps my nails looking great for at least a week!!</li>
            <li> Goes on really thick and smells very strongly of chemicals.</li>
            <li> No other topcoat has really worked for me like this one has.</li>
            <li> It dries insanely fast and gives a shiny, glossy finish like no other.  </li>
            <li> The pros: it is pretty glossy (although not really any glossier than any other top coat I have used).</li>
            <li> It dries in about 10 mins flat, meaning that I can paint my nails right before bed and not worry about ruining my nails.</li>
            <li> It makes any polish look professional and high gloss.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting this product directly FROM AMAZON.</li>
            <li> I am very busy at home and had nail polish chip on me day 2.</li>
            <li> This dries very fast but my nail polish bubbled and peeled or chipped the next day.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was interested in the Sache Vite (or some product) for shine and not necessarily for a quick dry.  </li>
            <li> This makes multiple coats of polish dry super fast!</li>
            <li> In fact I think just plain old Sally Hansen is better.      </li>
            <li> This product is amazing plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected !!!!</li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other brand, this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> FAST DRY for real!</li>
            <li> I tried it on myself today and it does dry pretty fast.</li>
            <li> how long I let the polish dry before applying the top coat.</li>
            <li> My nails dried super fast in 5 minutes and shiny too!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, it dried pretty darn quick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously used Essie Good to Go quick dry topcoat and SV is definitely a step up when it comes to dry time and high shine finish.</li>
            <li> BUY ANY OTHER DRY FAST TOP COAT.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands of fast dry top coats for years</li>
            <li> There are endless raves on the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat, and this is just another in the pile.</li>
            <li> This would be really upsetting especially if you are trying really hard to make it look nice.</li>
            <li> It really does dry faster than any other top coat I&#x27;ve ever tried, has longer hold, goes on smoother, and shines like no</li>
            <li> It dries superbly fast and will even dry your old nail polish! ;)</li>
            <li> what i like about this dry fast top is it doesnt decrease the number of days the polish stays on like some other ones i noticed do.</li>
            <li> It definitely dries faster than most other top coats I&#x27;ve tried, but I&#x27;m still having tons of smudging, even after I let my nails dry for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was my initial coverage not being as thick with the polish colors, the top coat, or perhaps these nails were more dry when I used the top coat.</li>
            <li> My nails usually chip the first day I paint them, and with this topcoat they last a good 3 days before a single chip.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but this stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why most don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
            <li> I usually buy this top coat at my nearby Sally&#x27;s whenever they have a BOGO sale on Seche.</li>
            <li> but I usually use Sally Hansen Diamond Strength Diamond Flash top coat</li>
            <li> I asked the clerk at my local Beauty First what she recommended</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it was such a dud the first time I tried it out of the box</li>
            <li> It took a longer that I expectec to receive my package... other than the slow shipping the product its great</li>
            <li> professionally done!  </li>
            <li> It dries any polish in minutes, and smooths most small nicks.</li>
            <li> - As soon as you&#x27;re done with your last coat of polish on your first hand, apply this top coat before you move on to applying the second coat to your other hand.  </li>
            <li> I used it over a Wet &#x27;n Wild polish that I absolutely love but that only lasts for about two days.  </li>
            <li> Makes even sub-par nail polish look professional!</li>
            <li> other day I made the mistake of using my Esse 3-way gloss top coat, and by the next morning I had bubbles and sheet marks.  </li>
            <li> and WOW DID IT!</li>
            <li> Now my manicures can even last over a week, dries my manicures fast, intensifies the color, smooths the surface, protects from chipping and shines so radiantly!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase of this bottle &amp; i havent even finished my first bottle yet.</li>
            <li> This far exceeds my expectations!  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll recommend this product to anyone whos interested especially people that do nails.</li>
            <li> I like to layer my nails to get a shading look from dark to light</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li> Another quick-dry top coat to add to my usual lineup.</li>
            <li> It makes my nails slick and shiny :)</li>
            <li> I applied it over wet nail polish (thickly to avoid touching the polish beneath), and capped the free edge.  </li>
            <li> makes polish QUICK DRY!</li>
            <li> It gets thicker and gloopier over time, and it generally only lasts two or three days without pealing away, but it is SO worth it because of the shine and, really, because it dries practically instantly.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that I&#x27;ve noticed that my polish cracks sooner than if I had used regular top coat, like after 3 days as opposed to 5 days with regular.</li>
            <li> I also always keep Seche Vite around for occasional use when I&#x27;m in the mood for super-killer shine &amp; am willing to tolerate the shrinkage.</li>
            <li> I usually go to bed and wake up with creases on my nails after an hour of drying with Sally Hansen, OPI, etc., but not this Seche Vite Top Coat.</li>
            <li> I notice a difference when I don&#x27;t use this - even when I get my nails professionally done!</li>
            <li> After using this product for the first time, I&#x27;m hooked and currently searching nail polish colors online!</li>
            <li> Yeah, well those marks become a thing of the past when you use this top coat.</li>
            <li> This product goes above and beyond any other top coat I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> It DOES dry fast; very quickly your nails are dry to the touch.  </li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re surprised that I DIY it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over how quickly these dry my nails!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I’ve tried the top coat without the base coat and though it still looks great, I’m convinced the base+top coat combo is the key.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use top coats that often</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if this is a phenomenon of all top coats, or if it&#x27;s reacting with the nail polish that I use.</li>
            <li> HECK YES!&lt;br /&gt;Shipped a day early too!</li>
            <li> I found that Seche has a higher tendency to lift polish than others I have tried, even with proper application.  </li>
            <li> I found that Seche has a higher tendency to lift polish than others I have tried, even with proper application.  </li>
            <li> I am in healthcare and wash my hands non-stop and with this polish and a great base coat, my nails can last for more than 1 week.</li>
            <li> My nails also last 2-3 times longer than they do with any other top coat.</li>
            <li> There are other top coats out there that can do the same things but may be safer.</li>
            <li> I painted my nails with two coats of polish, waited about a minute, no more than that for sure and then applied Seche Vite.  </li>
            <li> Overall,it&#x27;s a fine topcoat that i got for like half price.</li>
            <li> Just recently I got my first &amp;#</li>
            <li> The only thing i dont like is the smell but other than that i like it because it give my Esse colors a gely look and feel :)</li>
            <li> At the price of $5 and free shipping, this completely beats any other seller I have found, including target and walmart.</li>
            <li> My fave by far!</li>
            <li> This top coat is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I will simply not use any other top coat.</li>
            <li> can usually get a week or more out of a manicure with this polish-</li>
            <li> It makes the polish pretty shiny and seems to help it last longer.</li>
            <li> A manicure isn&#x27;t a professional looking one without this stuff!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle of Seche Vite at Target and painted my nails only once with it.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a product that I can use that drys fast and wont chip!</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, if you are reading reviews of top coats / fast drying products, don&#x27;t waste another second.</li>
            <li> well only one word very good top base and protect and dry fast  </li>
            <li> Clear and will not dull color.</li>
            <li> It does smell a little strong</li>
            <li> The smell is a little bit strong though so beware of that, however once it dries it doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like nail polish though, the scent is a little strong.</li>
            <li> Has a little strong smell, so try not to inhale that.</li>
            <li> My nails were dry by 1 minute and even when I did 2 coats on one nail and did a thicker coat on another, it still was dry by 1 minute * 1 minute 12 seconds at the most</li>
            <li> Super shiny and makes ur life less of a hassle really</li>
            <li> It allows the polish to dry quickly and chipping is nearly non existent.  </li>
            <li> This quick dry is a life saver for a busy girl and mom.</li>
            <li> Out the Door may feel dry on top, yet not be totally dry underneath.</li>
            <li> So my old standby is the Sally Hansen quick dry topcoat in the reddish orangish bottle.  </li>
            <li> is long lasting and is super affordable!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it will not dry quickly and will soften the polish enough to make it &amp;#34;move&amp;#34; and smudge if you touch or rub up against something.</li>
            <li> It dries SUPER SUPER FAST, very hard</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t just dry the top coat of you polish like most other products, it seeps into the bottom and dries all the polish in just a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does dry to the touch pretty fast, but is still soft for 30 min or so.</li>
            <li> it dries my polish fast and it leaves my nails super shiny and helps my polish last a long time.</li>
            <li> Works well and fast, but has a strong lasting odor and if you get your fingers near your mouth they taste very, very bitter.</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;m a very impatient person.</li>
            <li> For $5 a bottle, it lasted longer the high end stuff, the shine was gorgeous and the application wasn&#x27;t as difficult as some said it would be.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s back to conventional top coats.</li>
            <li> With the Seche Vite, I&#x27;ve been able to change a diaper or put my toddler in his carseat 5 - 10 minutes after applying it without ruining my polish job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, and this is something I&#x27;ve never experienced with other top coats I&#x27;ve tried...</li>
            <li> In under a minute, the top coat was completely dry--and with very little smell, either.</li>
            <li> product will thicken up quite quickly if you leave the cap off or loose, so don&#x27;t do that!</li>
            <li> It dries super fast and holds tight, securing your manicure in a matter of a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard and I think I&#x27;ve finally found my new top coat!</li>
            <li> While a cheap top coat leaves your nails shiny, it doesn&#x27;t last very long, and your nails usually start chipping within two days.</li>
            <li> This top coat makes my nails last well throughout the week, and only when i cook and clean extensively do the nails chip slightly.</li>
            <li> Aside from that advice enjoy the LONG lasting shine and colour</li>
            <li> Dried polish very quickly.</li>
            <li> Does not dry fast.  </li>
            <li> not only does it dry super fast</li>
            <li> Dries very quickly but tends to peel off after a few days.</li>
            <li> Especially if you are in a rush to get ready &amp; need your nails to dry quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Seche Vite Top Coat for about 3 months (the same bottle), and I change my nail polish on average about every 4 days.</li>
            <li> This actually does make your nail polish dry quickly, through all the layers!  </li>
            <li> It is a thick quick dry top coat you can apply as soon as you are done painting your nails.</li>
            <li> Not only does it dry quickly, its leaves you with shiny, polished nails that look like shellac!</li>
            <li> I either was waiting too long to apply the top coat (it should applied while polish is wet)</li>
            <li> Wow does this polish dry amazingly fast and shiny!!</li>
            <li> It dries so fast it&#x27;ll make your head spin, then to make matters inconceivably better, the finish is super hard, shiny and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> In fact it was not until the 12th or 13th day that I noticed the color was coming off from the bottom up, noticed the top down.</li>
            <li> quick dry!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s positive reviews, however I have mixed feelings about</li>
            <li> One issue I&#x27;ve noticed is if I apply too much color polish and then try to topcoat with this I sometimes get little &amp;#34;waves&amp;#34; in my work if I accidentally touch something because the top of the layer of paint will dry quick, but the bottom will still be wet.  </li>
            <li> It made a huge mess and was embarrassing.</li>
            <li> My nails usually have a light shine to them after putting a top coat, but that shine goes away after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Pretty much as soon as you finish painting the last nail, open your Seche Vite and start applying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t read the directions and I didn&#x27;t use enough, but my nails still dried in record time, but they chipped after a day or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the directions (always important) and letting the drop form at the end of the brush before brushing it on, my nails have lasted days, even though the nail color I used is one that is notoriously flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, it dries pretty fast, but it starts peeling by the second maybe third day.</li>
            <li> If I wasn&#x27;t constantly doing dishes and cleaning, I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t chip as much, but I can usually make it through 5 or 6 days without any chips.</li>
            <li> As long as you are deliberately trying you will NOT mess up your fresh nails.  </li>
            <li> Good the first few uses then, too thick</li>
            <li> It really does live up to its claims of drying instantly.</li>
            <li> It really helped my color dry faster and did not chip as fast.  </li>
            <li> Some people say that you have to apply to wet nails, but I have always applied it to dry polish (mostly because I stamp my nails</li>
            <li> It does dry fast, but it also chips fast.</li>
            <li> My nails dry so fast and polish stays on so much longer</li>
            <li> Yep, this dry fast nail coat really works.</li>
            <li> It does look very shiny and helps dry nails fast.</li>
            <li> It does dry really fast but does NOT go on really well.  </li>
            <li> It really does dry fast and it stays looking shiny for days.  </li>
            <li> The brush brings me to my next gripe, when I opened my particular bottle, the bristles of the brush are stuck together and it sucked trying to get them apart to where they&#x27;d apply the product decently.</li>
            <li> yes my nails dried fast &amp; were super shiny.</li>
            <li> If you put on shoes to quickly your entire pedi turns into a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nail polish last for 2 weeks!!!</li>
            <li> As soon as it arrived I opened it and put a coat on my polish and it dried fast and was super shiny.</li>
            <li> I did use it once, it dried quickly but didn&#x27;t make my nails very</li>
            <li> it dries relatively quickly, gives a deep glossy finish, and protects even the cheapest nail polish, making it last 2+ weeks on my toes.  </li>
            <li> only downside that I can see is that it smells strong when wet.</li>
            <li> I am a starting out nail enthusiast, my collection is slowly growing, I am trying out new things and finding better brands for certain jobs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of girl who paints her nails at least three times a week, so I rarely wear a manicure long enough for this to become an issue.</li>
            <li> it does dry right away</li>
            <li> I find that there are some minor flaws with the product, but it works better than any other brand I&#x27;ve used thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of quickly dry top coats but what makes this one different is that the brush reaches all the way to the bottom of the bottle</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s going straight into the trash, because the Seche Vite actually does the job in the promised time, and leaves my nails feeling like they were professionally done!</li>
            <li> By the time I&#x27;m done applying over my freshly painted nails... they are completely dry!</li>
            <li> Pretty much the cure to sheet marks and other evidence of improper drying.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other quick dry top coats I&#x27;ve tried, you use this while polish is still wet</li>
            <li> It drys fast, which I happen to find phenomenal because I am so impatient when it comes to waiting for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li> Let it sit for a minute, and all the polish wipes away in one simple swipe (I always use pure acetone.</li>
            <li> I would definitely continue to use and certainly recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> But it only effects certain polishes.</li>
            <li> I need to buy the large refill bottle next time.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite applies easily and smoothly a thick durable layer that dries faster than the other fast dry top coats.</li>
            <li> All in all despite the bad smell, This is the only top coat I will ever use (except when I am using a matte top coat!).</li>
            <li> Very disappointed -- so my search for a good fast drying top coat continues.</li>
            <li> I love how thick the formula is (without being goopy) and it really does dry so much faster than other \\&quot;quick dry\\</li>
            <li> So when there was a little gift set of this top coat and a China Glaze color at my local Sally Beauty Supply...</li>
            <li> It dries your nails in like 5 minutes they are hard as rock, it doesnt matter how many layers of polish you have on.</li>
            <li> Just remember to get it on there while your nails are still super wet!</li>
            <li> Keeps the top hard and protects from scratches and smudges.</li>
            <li> It also dries for the most part in like a minute, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about ruining your hard worked nail design.</li>
            <li> It also dries the other layers of nail polish quickly</li>
            <li> I love changing colors and it will be hard to justify taking the polish off if its not chipped.  </li>
            <li> The main problem with this polish though is that is does no better than any cheap-y, generic top coat polish.</li>
            <li> And, if the color starts to look dull, I apply another top coat to shine it</li>
            <li> Other than that, still worth it, as I went on Amazon and bought another brand new bottle because I couldn&#x27;t resist.</li>
            <li> I have heard that this is a side effect of using fast drying top coat over very thickly applied polish</li>
            <li> where the other top coats I had to wait up to 30 minutes just to dry .</li>
            <li> Dries very quickly - its definitely faster than other topcoats on the market.  </li>
            <li> There are top coats from other brands that dry just as well/quickly without peeling off immediately.</li>
            <li> I was thinking that it would be $10.00 per bottle or more, but it costs about the same as my other fast dry topcoats.</li>
            <li> This topcoat dries quickly and it lasts me up to 5 days with very minimal chipping.</li>
            <li> I have also used it alone as a clear polish</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to do that because I can get it done in 20-30 minutes total with base coat, color coat, and this top coat without taking such a huge chunk of time.    </li>
            <li> It dries so fast and it CLEAR that I don’t mind taking the extra 30 seconds to throw on coat.</li>
            <li> The issue is the one I received was clearly used.</li>
            <li> the clear coat seems to pull up the polish.</li>
            <li> After all I thought it was just clear nail polish</li>
            <li> I was in need of a clear polish to apply to my nails, and this polish chips and peels after a day or two.</li>
            <li> Clear coat, not bubbles.</li>
            <li> I bought it to go over Konad nail polish while stamping, because it is a thicker clear coat and wouldn&#x27;t smudge the design.</li>
            <li> I like the outsides around my nailbeds to be clear of polish anyways</li>
            <li> so there is no color stain on Natural nails</li>
            <li> Mani last so much longer using this product.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised to find that my nail polish chips</li>
            <li> So after having done some research from reliable, credible sources, I stumbled across a few facts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keeps nail polish from chipping longer and provides professional shine that you get at the nail salon.  </li>
            <li> Manicures last much longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a busy woman.</li>
            <li> but it takes the polish completely off with it.</li>
            <li> in love with this I have to buy at least one for each of my aunts and my mom and sister ....</li>
            <li> al I can say is wow</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> wow ...</li>
            <li> I can guarantee this is NOT the case for this product, it is definitely the real deal.  </li>
            <li> Fast forward to when I finally got around to purchasing it.</li>
            <li> My polish lasts atleast 5 days at least with this top coat.</li>
            <li> and I completely agree.</li>
            <li> A few important tips.</li>
            <li> My ONLY gripe about it, is that about halfway through the bottle, it thickens almost too much to use.</li>
            <li> The only reason this gets two stars is because of how fast it dries.</li>
            <li> - completely colorless</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes I could use my hands freely without smudging my nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fidgety - meaning, of course, that my manicures are infallibly ruined within ten minutes of me finishing them.</li>
            <li> and was completely giggity over how well</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> but so far I haven&#x27;t needed to use them.  </li>
            <li> My only COMPLAINTS are that it gets goopy really fast.</li>
            <li> are never damage my designs always last thanks to this product</li>
            <li> It works incredibly fast and gives my nails an extra layer of strength.  </li>
            <li> far as durability</li>
            <li> It looks like I went to a professional manicurist when I did it by myself at home.</li>
            <li> Was already goopy and old by the time I got it.</li>
            <li> It will keep an at-home paint job for a week and dries completely in about 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> so I just completely gave up and stopped painting my nails until I found this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely sold and</li>
            <li> The polish last much longer as well.</li>
            <li> And most nail polishes stink so I don&#x27;t understand why that is even a complaint.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s all I have besides Sally Hansen top coat and at least it doesn&#x27;t shink your polish)</li>
            <li> I have saved a ton of time thanks to this stuff, and it makes painting my nails a possibility again even when I am short on time.</li>
            <li> Like an industrial chemical, believe it or not, worse than actual nail polish.</li>
            <li> Drys so fast and last for about a week for me without chipping.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the shine it leaves.</li>
            <li> Also dries completely with in 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li> This has completely changed the way I do my nails and nail art.</li>
            <li> This top coat maintains my nail polish for at least a week.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works well on real nails only, but didn&#x27;t work on my gel nails.</li>
            <li> and she could instantly tell it wasn&#x27;t the real stuff.  </li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re sensitive use a well ventilated area to do your manicure.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I tear through bottles TOO fast :]</li>
            <li> It is completely indispensible to the process.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even to use nail polish remover, I can just peel it off completely without any effort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> Plus there&#x27;s the whole controversy about the ingredients possibly causing birth defects...</li>
            <li> For those that are always on the go and don&#x27;t have time to waste, this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> the more you use it, and about halfway through the bottle it loses its quality.</li>
            <li> I have 9 month old and sometimes nap</li>
            <li> Extra shiny and fast drying.  </li>
            <li> However, for me, it still saves money going to get my nails professionally done</li>
            <li> Has completely transformed doing my nails at home.</li>
            <li> (Don&#x27;t use nail polish REMOVER, it ruins nail polish, just pick up a small bottle of thinner at your local beauty store, inexpensive and works great).</li>
            <li> As far shrinking I have noticed any.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how this polish got such a high star review!</li>
            <li> Seche dries my polish completely within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> This finish makes even an amatuer nail polisher, such as myself, look like an absolute pro.  </li>
            <li> My problem WAS polish never dried on my nails.</li>
            <li> It is professional quality and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> I had never tried this before, and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Extends the life of my manicures by a week and my pedicures by nearly a month.</li>
            <li> but it is professional polish.</li>
            <li> Makes my polish last so much longer.  </li>
            <li> My nails look professionally done (combined with OPI nail polish).  </li>
            <li> remember seeing this in the salons and thinking, wow, I should pick this up.</li>
            <li> They stay soft underneath.</li>
            <li> Wow, who invented this stuff?  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to awake with ZERO sheet lines on my nails.  </li>
            <li> It also dries fast, which is a big bonus!</li>
            <li> Mega shine is glossy but chips easily on my busy hands.  </li>
            <li> It makes the polish near the nail bed look cracked when it shrinks &amp; the tips end up looking worn.  </li>
            <li> but underneath they are still soft and u get a dent or a sheet imprint.</li>
            <li> It completely dries my nails in 10 minuntes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read so much about Seche Vite on various nail blogs</li>
            <li> Then my friends wanted to go out for late night munchies and I was able to function without screwing up my nails.</li>
            <li> This never happened with my old topcoat.</li>
            <li> Fast totally rocks.  </li>
            <li> so I can get on with my busy life.  </li>
            <li> After the color has set, but not dried completely, I apply Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> But wow.</li>
            <li> and I can be completely functional and go about my business in about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li> look professionally done</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s far cheaper here.</li>
            <li> Wow..</li>
            <li> But with this product, it doesn&#x27;t even last 5 whole days before it peels off.  </li>
            <li> smoothes the surface of your nail (minor bumps go away), and it dries fast!  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind the smell as much if it smelled like regular nail polish...</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised that the Seche Vite nails peeled like they did.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised with Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> it will completely peel off.</li>
            <li> so beware if you are sensitive.  </li>
            <li> but this one beats them all by far.</li>
            <li> I was told I may have an old polish.</li>
            <li> Wild</li>
            <li> Does get tacky if not used fast enough.</li>
            <li> It also provides professional shine that you get at the nail salon.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like it and will continue to use it, but just fyi about the shrinking polish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> People always make comments about no4 gelieving that my nails are not done professionally.</li>
            <li> It has saved all my old polishes that I was going to have to throw away</li>
            <li> With my China Glaze, they lasted for nearly two weeks without chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries so fast and my manicure seems to last longer with it than without it.</li>
            <li> It gives my mani a professional look.  </li>
            <li> This product makes my nails look professionally done and prevent my polish from chipping for a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> Plus the shine is professional quality.</li>
            <li> but it was getting old.  </li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I received all 3 bottles of Vite very soon after order...I will buy from you in the future as well.  </li>
            <li> so far no chips</li>
            <li> You may use any polish under it and it makes even the cheapest clearance bottle of color look like a professional manicure.</li>
            <li> However, chips are pretty minor</li>
            <li> It looks glossy and professional when it dries.</li>
            <li> dries fast and  makes my nail polish last way longer !</li>
            <li> I am very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> only con is it is very smelly.  </li>
            <li> It makes my manicure last much longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a busy mom</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is great!&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I thought it was, but only because it dries so fast.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It was a busy day at work.</li>
            <li> OLD REVIEW:</li>
            <li> It makes your nails looks as though they were done by a professional.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that different nail polish brands used underneath it can really affect the chipping and peeling of it.</li>
            <li> and they think they look professionally done.</li>
            <li> and I never have marked up nails in the morning.  </li>
            <li> and i am usually really sensitive to smells because of my migraines, but had no problems.</li>
            <li> and I leave nearly an hour for drying--even though it isn&#x27;t needed considering this stuff dries in like 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> So far it has not chipped like before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she is far from patient-</li>
            <li> I completely regret buying this.</li>
            <li> My color was completely ruined with chips in about 16 hours.</li>
            <li> This is a bit more expensive but worth it I think.</li>
            <li> my polish never last more than a few hours on my fingers and toes</li>
            <li> people say is true, it does tend to not last long, so</li>
            <li> Then use this top coat and be all set to go a few minutes later.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few years ago when it was recommended to me and it is the only top coat that I have bought since then.</li>
            <li> Apply it as the final top coat, wait a few minutes</li>
            <li> /&gt;Absolutely worth the five bucks I spent.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Absolutely worth the five bucks I spent.  </li>
            <li> so I did not apply the Seche Vite to fresh, wet nails.</li>
            <li> hand with DL ATS topcoat had a nice subtle shine, dried just as quickly</li>
            <li> also want to add I have used this top coat while working with children and doing jobs where I&#x27;ve had to pry open drawers, and cash registers, and use harsh chemicals,</li>
            <li> In fact when you try to use your nails too quickly after applying the quick dry topcoat, you will find smudges/ridges, and your nails become messy.</li>
            <li> I had bought the OPI top coat but it turned really thick</li>
            <li> Which I love, but about halfway through the bottle, it gets thick and stringy.  </li>
            <li> it sounds scary, but it&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this polish works best without a base.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really impressed, but it&#x27;s good for the price.</li>
            <li> to thin it out again which is kind of a pain.</li>
            <li> to apply a thick layer on top of my nail polish and  it dries so</li>
            <li> The top coat is thick.</li>
            <li> This with the Gelous Nail Base makes for an incredible home manicure!</li>
            <li> Now this top coat is not as shinny and thick as it used to be, and it bubbles up.  </li>
            <li> If you want a top coat that never gets thick use Revlon.</li>
            <li> So...I thought one more try because I really wanted to like it and applied it in thin coats.</li>
            <li> I bring along my own Base &amp; Top coat because this way regardless of the quality of the polish&lt;</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure the bottle gets thick over time</li>
            <li> Not only does it dry very fast, it dries the polish layers underneath, making my nails ready to go in minutes.  </li>
            <li> Oddly, my favorite is a discontinued base and top coat by Max Factor (yes, really) -- it was long lasting and effective, didn&#x27;t change my polish colors, and just imparted a slight shine, with a bonus of being dual purpose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seemed to dry fast and leaves a glassy, high shine layer.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations due to outstanding reviews and a great reputation, only to be severely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I paint my nails a LOT (mainly because I get bored with what is on my nails and have to change it to keep things interesting!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually pretty bad about applying a top coat, but this brand definitely makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does dry very fast.  </li>
            <li> And it does dry very fast</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;It dry very fast as its name.</li>
            <li> It does dry very fast however.</li>
            <li> When i&#x27;m in a rush but need to paint my nails, this helps them to dry very fast to where I can grab things without my nails smudging.</li>
            <li> Dry&#x27;s very fast</li>
            <li> The real product tends to be somewhat thick but spreads easily and covers minor flaws and evens the bumps from nail art and leaves a very shiny surface.</li>
            <li> I typically use Essie or OPI underneath and the polish lasts at least 5-7 days without chips or scratches, which is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> By the time I got done applying the topcoat to my second hand, my first hand was absolutely and completely dry.</li>
            <li> It does dry really fast, faster than any top coat I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, plain and simple!</li>
            <li> Put it on right after you finish your last coat of polish and then immediately put the second coat on after you finish the first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fourth try was with 3 coats, it just peeled right off next day.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and its long lasting.</li>
            <li> like it because it does dry fast, but within the limitations of normal work.</li>
            <li> The smell kind of smells like spray paint almost, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming and won&#x27;t stink up your house and dissipates once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> I will admit that it dries very quickly and leaves a nice shine, but the shrinkage it causes drives me crazy!</li>
            <li> The chemicals it had, good and bad reviews, compared it with other top coats, etc.</li>
            <li> The reason I tried it, was that all the nail art vloggers  (The ones I like, I mean, on you tube), use Seche Vite, and mention it that it is their favorite topcoat.  </li>
            <li> Makes my manicure last several days longer than other top coats.</li>
            <li> my nails dry fast and can stay chip free far longer than the previous two tops coats I have used.</li>
            <li> However, with Seche Vite Dry Fast, I didn&#x27;t have to worry after a half hour (more like 15 minutes actually).</li>
            <li> If you do nail art, be sure the colors are dry before applying the seche vite, or apply with a light hand as it can smear colors (i had trouble with a design using a black Essie).</li>
            <li> I spent time getting just right</li>
            <li> You just have to be careful not to pick at your nails in the shower or right after.</li>
            <li> I paint right over wet polish with no problems.</li>
            <li> When it first arrived, I was so excited I put a coat over the pinky nail of a day&#x27;s old manicure (Wet n wild quick dry black, topped with Sally Hansen HD Byte, LCD, DVD, and some generic clear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a success above the rest of the new age dry fasts.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even need to let your color polish dry first and after a minute</li>
            <li> I always paint my nails after work in the evening and even after they seem dry it never fails that when I go to bed</li>
            <li> Adds fantastic shine and truly does dry quickly, never used a polish that really dries the way this does.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple brands of top coats to try and achieve that glossy, long lasting finish you get with a professional manicure and this is the only one that is comparable.</li>
            <li> By the time I am doing both hands the nails on my first are already dry to the touch.</li>
            <li> I have never seen anything dry so fast!</li>
            <li> For me, it is much thicker than some typical drug store top coats I typically buy.  </li>
            <li> It is really dry fast!</li>
            <li> so the first time around, I was applying it to mostly dry polish.</li>
            <li> The only downside that I&#x27;ve found is that although it dries extremely quickly, if you have multiple layers of polish underneath, those layers do not dry.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, but last for only a couple to a few days.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff - dries very fast - no more smudges for me!!!</li>
            <li> so it doesnt last as long as i thought it would, maybe with a second coat it would make your nail polish last longer, but i love it regardless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s because of this that I decided to look into a top coat that could dry my nails in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> This top coat makes your nail polish dry in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pronounced &#x27;sesh veet&#x27; French for quick dry)</li>
            <li> The only upside is that it does dry extremely quick.</li>
            <li> Not only does it dry extremely quickly (and it dries all the layers of polish underneath, too), but it produces a mirror-like shine.  </li>
            <li> While the product did dry quickly, it peeled off my nails next day!</li>
            <li> I have been using the quick dry Sally H product and thought it was sufficient but after using this I will NEVER go back.  </li>
            <li> Nails dry quickly, have a shiny finish, and last longer.</li>
            <li> it makes your nails dry faster last longer and look super shiny</li>
            <li> Only slight downfall is it has a strong odor until it dries.</li>
            <li> Sets polish quickly so it cuts down on smuggling.</li>
            <li> With my fast dry drops, it truly is dry in 5 minutes though, and gives a shinier appearance than any other top coat  have used.</li>
            <li> there is a little bit of an art to putting on enough so that you can cover the nail before it sets without globbing on so much that it won&#x27;t dry, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> great top coat or if using a DARK color as a base if need be</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands that people have had success with, but nothing, in my opinion, works as well as Seche Vite for me.</li>
            <li> No mess, it dries, i seconds.</li>
            <li> It works everytime, in every season, lasts for months and worth the money spent!</li>
            <li> Read a few reviews on the product, was really excited about ordering the product esp for the price</li>
            <li> It dries your nails fast and gives them a wet look (high gloss shine).</li>
            <li> But please wait at least one minute for your nail polish to dry before you put on this top coat!</li>
            <li> I definitely consider this a new staple in my nail polish collection!</li>
            <li> Dries fast, has a long shelf life and its crystal clear.</li>
            <li> However, I know many view it as a serious product fault</li>
            <li> Seriously you won&#x27;t be able to stop looking at your nails!&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> the first is already dry!</li>
            <li> Yes, it does chip fairly easily after a couple of days but imo, if you are changing your polish regularly its really not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> WARNING: using this ridiculously fast-drying top coat may cause you to DRAMATICALLY increase your nail polish inventory</li>
            <li> and this top coat is serious business.  </li>
            <li> dries in seriously, seriously, 5 minutes top.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super shiny, actually does dry fast, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> so disappointed, I&#x27;ve been better off just using polish without a top coat than using Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> It is super shiny and dries in less than five minutes.</li>
            <li> No matter how hot and humid it is outside after one application of Seche Vite I only need to sit for one drying cycle at the salon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super shiny and seriously dries so fast!</li>
            <li> It does &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; super fast, in about a minute, but it remains soft for at least an hour.</li>
            <li> For me, usually two coats of polish without a top coat last about a day.</li>
            <li> The next day however did have some peeling just replaced top coat and no more problems.</li>
            <li> It makes my manicures last for a significant amount of time longer than other tops coats.</li>
            <li> I also found that this stuff runs out pretty quickly--make sure to apply a thin coat!</li>
            <li> My nail polish ends up chipping rather quickly and it shrinks up on the polish, making it look odd.</li>
            <li> This was my second try with it and these are the same results as the first time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it sometimes reacts weird with certain polishes resulting in what is known as &amp;#34;shrinkage.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve never had much problem with shrinkage but many people have.</li>
            <li> high gloss, a thick but not too thick clear layer, smooth smooth smooth, and it even evened out some knubbly areas where my polish had clumped as it dried.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong, but just open the window</li>
            <li> This is a major polish extender that every busy mom should try.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when it arrived and promptly used it, and put it to the test putting it over a polish that takes FOREVER to dry, and I kid you not, within one minutes of putting Seche Vite on, my nails were COMPLETELY dry, and my jaw hit the floor.</li>
            <li> It is very shiny and super hard.  </li>
            <li> Its super shiny, dries fast and hard.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for your final step of polished nails......</li>
            <li> Love this product, everyone asks me if my nails are gel and they are always shocked when I tell them it&#x27;s regular old nail polish and this top coat.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t recommend this high enough.</li>
            <li> and your whole nail is dry in less then 10 minutes ( depends on how dry your coats where before you applied the top coat)</li>
            <li> More importantly, this top coat contains Toluene which rates a 10 (the worst possible score) on the Environmental Working Groups rating of harmful cosmetic ingredients.</li>
            <li> It settles on the nail and smooths out, so for people who have shaky hands or something, it will smooth out and give a slick and even top coat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if you have nails that tend to be unhealthy like I do (thin, cracks easily, etc.), you may want to look at a different top coat, either that, or alternate this top coat with a different one (which is what I do).  </li>
            <li> so i got a new one when i had about 1/4 left in my old bottle.</li>
            <li> If you use it right, your polish will last as long as shellac.</li>
            <li> If there is a smudge on the nail polish or the color is slightly uneven, this covers it right up!</li>
            <li> This is worth it and last a very long time.</li>
            <li> The other major problem I have with it is that it tends to pull the underlying polish away from the nail edges, which significantly cheapens the overall look of the manicure.</li>
            <li> I was actually going to give this to my mom and use it on my little tiny sister, so I am glad I found out before.</li>
            <li> It only starts chipping a week or more in, and then only a little bit.</li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;s not as fabulous the 2nd half of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this product, I looked for reviews of fast dry clear coats.  </li>
            <li> I was in need of something fast drying because I just don&#x27;t have the patience to let my nails dry completely.</li>
            <li> It dried my 4 layers of polish quickly and completely.  </li>
            <li> Even after it dried and I washed my hands the next day, it still smelled like a strong acrylic chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> good for AT LEAST 2 and a half weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course, I&#x27;d still let it dry as long as possible just to ensure that your  nails are done, but this top coat definitely prevents the accidental smudging.</li>
            <li> I have used many dry fast items in the past, but this is the only product that has worked 100% for my nails.</li>
            <li> I was tired of smudges with every single color change or touch up, but then I read good stuff about this product.  </li>
            <li> so this isn&#x27;t a huge deal for me, but if you don&#x27;t get close enough to the sides and top of your nail it could look funky, so take this into consideration when painting and don&#x27;t be afraid to get a bit closer than usual.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Almost dries too fast for really long nails</li>
            <li> It stays very shiny for a long time.  </li>
            <li> it dries fast and lasts long</li>
            <li> However, it is not a good top coat.</li>
            <li> I have naturally long nails, which makes my life so much easier.  </li>
            <li> I am not a professional and don&#x27;t have much to compare this to</li>
            <li> I swear by Seche Vite, any other top coat is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am able to do my nails and within a few minutes can get back to my daily life.</li>
            <li> Normally polish only lasts a day or two, even before I worked in a nursing home.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not worth the type, not worth your money.</li>
            <li> I keep my nails to just a bit longer than my fingertips, and I&#x27;m pretty rough on them</li>
            <li> It goes back to its normal hardness after about 20 minutes of being out of the shower.</li>
            <li> the first use of the product i found i was applying the polish incorrectly, the polish is to be applied while the color polish is wet.</li>
            <li> My first couple of tries with Seche Vite...</li>
            <li> It works and doesn&#x27;t get the color onto the brush (i used with OPI hot pink and nude).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> U normally can only get a shine like that from a UV gel polish.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my nails covered and lasting longer than it would normally.</li>
            <li> Second, if you&#x27;re planning on painting on art of some kind (polka dots, stripes, whatever your fancy), I do my base color, then Seche Vite, my art, then more Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> If you use it, be certain the nail polish is dry before applying it.  </li>
            <li> I can put it on right after finishing my second coat of color and within 3 minutes, my nails are dry.</li>
            <li> It dry&#x27;s quickly and lasts long</li>
            <li> It keeps the polish looking fresh and shiny, and keeps the tips from wearing down or chipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus when it starts to come off, it comes off in huge pieces instead of little chips, which I like, makes it easier to remove with polish later.</li>
            <li> Not only is it quick drying it is also long lasting.  </li>
            <li> My polish dried quickly and didn&#x27;t give me enough time to do anything to ruin my manicure the way I normally do.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easy and dries my nails quickly to a hard shine.  </li>
            <li> I like my normal polish manicure (with a little bit of nail art on ring fingers to make me feel pretty)</li>
            <li> Just to make sure they were fully dry, I wait at least an hour before I resume &#x27;normal&#x27; activity.</li>
            <li> My manicure at home now only takes no more than 15 minutes and it actually looks much better than professional ones I used to pay for.</li>
            <li> It also dries and hardens in much less than time than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing this quick wearing process is due to it drying into one solid coat with the nail polish beneath (according to the description in the packaging).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to take off but it lasts longer than a regular top coat.</li>
            <li> Fast Top Nail Coat has gone down over the last few years.</li>
            <li> If I reapply every other day, my manicures can last a week or more with minimal tip wear.</li>
            <li> I usually were OPI fast dry top coat but found that it gets thick very fast, and I have to purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something I can live with for the overall quality.</li>
            <li> I put two coats of this stuff on my new tiffany blue nail polish, after two hours, I already had chips!</li>
            <li> Not only does this topcoat dry fast and leaves nail polish looking very glossy, it prevents my polish from chipping much longer than other quick-dry topcoats.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to rate it accurately - I think 3 is too low but 4 is too high.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand before and loved it, but purchasing it from this seller, I don&#x27;t think this is the real product, or I just got a really bad batch.</li>
            <li> While it does help the polish dry much quicker, it creates this peeling effect.</li>
            <li> All that sitting around waiting for drying was really cramping my style, it was like I was sitting there watching my life pass before my eyes waiting for nail polish to dry.  </li>
            <li> When it says dry fast, it isn&#x27;t kidding.</li>
            <li> and it does dry really fast</li>
            <li> Used to use OPI but didn&#x27;t dry fast so gave this polish a try</li>
            <li> Shiny and dry fast.</li>
            <li> This really speeds up the amount of time it takes for my nails to dry.  </li>
            <li> It does dry fast and leaves it shiny</li>
            <li> It does dry fast.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really want to sit around for 30 minutes waiting for my polish to dry...</li>
            <li> It says FAST DRY</li>
            <li> It does dry incredibly fast, and I&#x27;m not exaggerating</li>
            <li> the words means dry fast..</li>
            <li> To dry (fast nail dryer)</li>
            <li> I typically do my nails about 20 mins or so before going to bed and the top coat is dry enough that it causes no problems and</li>
            <li> It makes nail polish dry much faster than without it</li>
            <li> It works wonders and the insanely fast dry time is no lie.</li>
            <li> It also doesnt dry that fast.</li>
            <li> and they dry so fast.</li>
            <li> It does dry your nails fast.</li>
            <li> It makes my polish dry fast</li>
            <li> I painted my nails before I went to bed just to see how fast it would dry my</li>
            <li> This product does dry fast like others have said.</li>
            <li> it really helps the dry polish to dry fast.</li>
            <li> I gave two stars because my nails did dry fast.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does dry fast.</li>
            <li> It dries my nail fast and now I don&#x27;t have to wait hours for my nail to dry.  </li>
            <li> It does dry fast however.</li>
            <li> Dry Fast.  </li>
            <li> Makes my nails so shiny and there are no smudges because they dry so fast</li>
            <li> and this helps the polish to dry fast.</li>
            <li> dry very fast&lt;</li>
            <li> Literally, 2 minutes and my nails are dry an ready.</li>
            <li> My nails dry so fast</li>
            <li> It helps the polish dry fast, shiny, and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the products that say fast and take forever to dry.</li>
            <li> it really dry fast</li>
            <li> Dry really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> As  others have stated, it does dry fast and in under  5  minutes.</li>
            <li> It does as it promises, it does dry fast...</li>
            <li> , it drys in less than a minute and becomes rock solid afterwords, its super shiny and adds a professional look to any nail polish/art.</li>
            <li> The quantity of the ingredient is so low, the only way you&#x27;d really do damage is if you sat there and huffed the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY quick dry product that actually dries my nails within a minute.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it solid and fast drying, it never yellows.</li>
            <li> on to the negative: I have to constantly redo my nail with the top coat polish.</li>
            <li> This stinks like hell and makes my husband want to puke, but dries fast and gives nice shine and protection.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as the Sally Hansen top coat that I was using before, however it&#x27;s still pretty durable.</li>
            <li> makes any polish you use last for at least a week, won&#x27;t used anything but this now as top coat</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry super fast, it takes about 15 minutes to dry enough so my nails don&#x27;t stick when I press them together, but after 30 minutes to an hour, it dries to a very solid layer over my nails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a somewhat thick texture that makes your nails dry fast and last more than 7 days.&lt;br /&gt;The high-end nail salons around my area also use it.</li>
            <li> If I get a nice thin layer it seems to last longer.</li>
            <li> This goes on so thick, and dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I think the most I&#x27;ve tried was with 5 coats as I did glitter on top of a color base.</li>
            <li> Man o man it dried quickly</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is the top coat or the top coat and base coat combined</li>
            <li> It goes on pretty thick and dries extremely fast!</li>
            <li> I noticed this doesn&#x27;t do much in terms of top coat strength unfortunately.</li>
            <li> My nails are shiny, thick and strong.</li>
            <li> But it smells really strong and it gets goopy and thick after a while,so you have to buy the &amp;#34;restore“</li>
            <li> leaves your nails feeling strong and thick.</li>
            <li> If you ding your nailtip, a single layer will chip off much easier than layer over layer over layer.</li>
            <li> Not sure the shine is worth the pain!</li>
            <li> There is no other.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t had ANY major chips or nicks</li>
            <li> Major dissapointment.  </li>
            <li> Using this top coat makes removing the nail polish slightly more difficult, but it&#x27;s not a significant enough difference to ding all the positives here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still...I&#x27;m looking for alternatives to this as I am now aware of the risks in using this product, but I do plan to continue using it every other manicure until it&#x27;s all gone.</li>
            <li> I am an avid rock climber and this is the only polish that has kept my nails from chipping after a long day at the crag!</li>
            <li> If any major brands make a topcoat, I have it.</li>
            <li> major issue is with the packaging.</li>
            <li> and I always get major shrinkage.</li>
            <li> MAJOR shrinkage.  </li>
            <li> I use no other.</li>
            <li> Use China Glaze Strong Adhesion Base Coat as your first coat on clean nails.</li>
            <li> I dont think the brush is quite long enough and it gets kind of thick and gooey at the end of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Right now my nails are about 6 days old, and I have a few noticeable chips at the tips of 3 or 4 fingers.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I&#x27;ve never been able to finish a bottle of SV - a quarter of the way into the bottle, the polish begins turning gummy, and by the half bottle mark, it&#x27;s more like spreading gluey paste onto my nails than painting with polish.</li>
            <li> Top coat dried super fast and my nail polish lasted through the crazy New Years holiday weekend.  </li>
            <li> My nails are fully dry in as little as 4-5 minutes...not just the top, but the entire nail.</li>
            <li> By the time I finish painting the second hand, the first hand is dry.</li>
            <li> Nothing feels worse than topping a flawless application and having it look cracked and sloppy because of the topcoat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use my hands for work other than constant typing, so my polishes tend to last longer than the average persons anyway, but this top coat definitely extends the life of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very hard to smash after using the top  </li>
            <li> I was really just looking for something simple, but tthis is a miracle in a bottle and completely worth a few extra bucks.</li>
            <li> My nails are very thin and this top coat keeps my nails from breaking and it&#x27;s very shiny.</li>
            <li> It was so frustrating to spend an hour making my nails look perfect and then having the base, polish, and top coat pop off in one solid chunk.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your nail polish looking extra shiny and it helps it dry super quick no matter how thick your nail polish is.</li>
            <li> Not only a quick dry, but super shine and thick without bubbling so</li>
            <li> This one is seriously terrific as far as fast dry and hardening go.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t love the thickness and chemically smell, but its worth having my nails dry in mere seconds.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I have &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; nails or what the problem is, but I did clean nails well before applying polish.  </li>
            <li> It completely smoothed out the rough glitter polished, gave my nails a manicure finish and dried very quickly.</li>
            <li> thick and dries quick!</li>
            <li> Leaves them thick and super shiny, I have received lots of compliments when using this!</li>
            <li> only thing I found that is the top coat seems to wear off quicker than I&#x27;d like which makes my nails look dull, but other than that, I highly reccommend this!</li>
            <li> It makes the polish last a while and nail polish tends to peel off my nails pretty quickly because they are so soft and thin.</li>
            <li> However as far as chipping, it&#x27;s no better than any other top coats.</li>
            <li> It dried so fast!!</li>
            <li> This product gives you super fast speed drying and a crystal hard and shiny finish!</li>
            <li> Usually I end up messing up my paint job before my nails are dry, but this top coat dries super fast and very hard.</li>
            <li> I literally felt my nail lightly after less than a minute and my nail was dry.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous yet at the same time I can&#x27;t help but be amazed that it does that yet gets soo many people raving about it.</li>
            <li> Both dry quickly, although the Seche feels &#x27;harder&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Also this top coat is very thick.</li>
            <li> As most people have said, the consistency of Seche Vite is very thick and goopy, and takes a handful of applications to get used to the texture.</li>
            <li> But I can live with it because it&#x27;s still a 5 star product and we all know perfection is impossible and seche vite came pretty darn close. :)</li>
            <li> It makes a hard smooth finish that lasts.  </li>
            <li> It dries super quickly (I&#x27;m not sure exactly how quickly because I didn&#x27;t want to mess up my nails, but it was definitely less than 5 minutes, probably 3-ish?)</li>
            <li> While I hate that Seche Vite wears on the tips so easily, and it also gets goopy once you&#x27;re halfway through the bottle, I&#x27;ve been spoiled already by the super fast drying time!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so quick drying that, if you&#x27;re not careful, it can start drying right in the bottle and become thick and harder to work with.</li>
            <li> While I have noticed some shrinkage on certain polishes (mainly glitters) when I wear Seche Vite, I love the fact that this makes my nails completely dry and rock hard within just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> After 3 or 4 minutes my nails are dry enough to do pretty normal things around the house, and after 5 or 6 minutes they&#x27;re completely dry.</li>
            <li> lasting, won&#x27;t chip especially if you use in combination with high quality nail polishes</li>
            <li> this product dried in under two minutes just what I was searching for goes on well and is inexpensive also shipped very fast  so far after cleaning my house</li>
            <li> So while you don&#x27;t have to be immobile as with wet nail polish, it&#x27;s still easy to mess them up if you&#x27;re not careful.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny spent!!!</li>
            <li> I am hard on my nails so they do chip occasionally, and with this top coat, it does peel off in bigger pieces...</li>
            <li> I do mean DRIES, all the way through - so quickly!</li>
            <li> My only other caveat is that it can chip pretty easily if you put it on too thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this Seche Vite fast dry topcoat with polishes from a variety of manufacturers, some higher end and some less so (including, but not limited to Sheswai, Zoya, OPI, Seche Vite, and Revlon).  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it&#x27;s amazing and sets polish in seconds</li>
            <li> generally I topcoat the day after I polish or after a pedi</li>
            <li> and it keeps my nails glossy and chip free for at least a week.</li>
            <li> My nail polish lasts at least twice as long with this top coat.</li>
            <li> Shines wonderfully, is fast drying, smoothes out imperfections and helps my manicures last twice as long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not easy on my polish either - I have kids and an OCD clean house, so I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands and cleaning, playing around with the kids, etc.</li>
            <li> (I know I&#x27;m probably the only person who has natural nails)</li>
            <li> I have a desk job, so I&#x27;m constantly typing, and I&#x27;m also a busy mom and wife.</li>
            <li> wow totally with the money</li>
            <li> /&gt;Dries very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Can be applied over wet polish.&lt;br /&gt;Protects your manicure to give it some staying</li>
            <li> :O</li>
            <li> That is just too much time to sit around with wet nails.  </li>
            <li> The thing you need to keep in mind with this that I had to learn is that you really need to apply it to nails that are still wet.</li>
            <li> I even put it over my professionally done manicure to make it last longer!</li>
            <li> It also allows me to complete nail art following a shorter drying time.</li>
            <li> My nail polish barely lasts a day.</li>
            <li> It helps my polish last far longer</li>
            <li> It bonds so well to my polish that when I finally start to nervous-pick at me nails the polish comes off completely in-tact.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going on two weeks now and my nail Polish is barely chipping.</li>
            <li> Apparently not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the only downside is that once you get near the end it gets gloopy and un-useable so i suggest buying seche restore with it.</li>
            <li> However, it pulls back &amp; shrinks after it dries completely.  </li>
            <li> but I have to share my experience with this product because it differs, apparently, with a thousand of others.  </li>
            <li> Came fast, works just as expected.</li>
            <li> This will be my last time purchasing this just because of how sensitive I am to the smell.  </li>
            <li> Apparently you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Thanks to another reviewer, I found out that this must be applied to wet nails.  </li>
            <li> Fast-drying, very glossy, and doesn&#x27;t drag nail art.</li>
            <li> My nails have barely chipped in over a week</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really hold up like I expected.</li>
            <li> I have tried it three times so far and always the same story.</li>
            <li> Use in a well-vented area and the smell is barely discernible.</li>
            <li> Dries so fast and doesn&#x27;t smudge wet nail art.</li>
            <li> I am not a rough person.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m pretty rough on my hands throughout the day (especially because I&#x27;m a musician), and my nails endure a lot of wear.</li>
            <li> however my nail polish doesn&#x27;t last longer than normal, instead of chipping off it started to peel off entirely.</li>
            <li> The shine is crazy good..</li>
            <li> Again be realistic, thin coats will dry better.  </li>
            <li> Kind of scary</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also mega shiny and since it&#x27;s so thick, it can smooth out flakie and glitter polishes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I kind of like it A) because I am weird like that and B)</li>
            <li> Kind of scary.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff, i will never go back to not using a base and top coat.</li>
            <li> I manicure my nails at home and use the Seche Vite top coat and Seche Clear base coat with a variety of nail polish brands like Essie, OPI, Orly and even Sally Hansen - all with fabulous, long-lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The glass of  top nail coat  was  totally broken when I receive the product.</li>
            <li> Throw your ideas about thin coats out the window with this one, and you&#x27;re okay.  </li>
            <li> Throw your ideas about thin coats out the window with this one, and you&#x27;re okay.  </li>
            <li> The reason it makes your polish chip is that something weird in the formula makes every layer of polish on your nail kind of &#x27;melt&#x27; together into just one layer.</li>
            <li> then the Deborah Lippmann Addicted to Speed top coat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not 100% effective, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> If anyone out there wants a really good product of this type, you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Though the &amp;#34;no chip&amp;#34; claim that all top coats boast, once again proved false.</li>
            <li> But if you do it right, and don&#x27;t drag it across the nail polish too much with too little, it&#x27;ll work like a charm.</li>
            <li> The ONLY drawback that I have found is that because of the fast drying nature, air exposure from use causes it to get a little thick pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe I just finished my last nail and my first one was dry!!</li>
            <li> I mean, the others (Essie, OPI, i.e.) provided brilliant shine and all, but the complete game changer for me was how fast the Seche Vite dried.  </li>
            <li> your nails are dry in minutes, with a high gloss finish.  </li>
            <li> the very expensive topcoat lasted slightly less but didn&#x27;t chip nearly as much, but both were great products.</li>
            <li> The fact that I can do a quick manicure and get on with the things I need to do without worrying about my nails getting messed up makes it worth the minor inconvenience of having to keep another product around to thin it out.  </li>
            <li> Second, it does dry fast.  </li>
            <li> but they just dont dry fast enough.</li>
            <li> When it finally does dry, which takes a whole lot longer than advertised, it dries to the consistency of rubber plastic.  </li>
            <li> This nail polish does dry fast, but it doesn&#x27;t make my nail polish last any longer.</li>
            <li> Helps nail polish dry much faster and last longer.</li>
            <li> I give them a minute or two, to where they&#x27;re still tacky but not super wet, then put it on, and seal the free edge.</li>
            <li> After waiting a few minutes it was perfectly smooth and totally dry.  </li>
            <li> The French name (dry fast) says it all.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite (French for Fast Dry) dries oh too well.</li>
            <li> I used to wait a whole hour for my nails to dry, but now I only wait 20 minutes</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thickening - By the time your bottle is half empty, the polish will have thickened to the point where it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> or it didn&#x27;t dry fast enough so that I&#x27;d wake up with imprints of my bedsheet on them.  </li>
            <li> It lets my polish set and dry so fast and make it last longer.  </li>
            <li> Overall, the topcoat did dry fast.</li>
            <li> my nails are dry so fast and my manicures last over a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Obviously it will dry fast.  </li>
            <li> so you are less likely to damage your freshly painted nails.</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is definitely worth the price here, which is half of what it costs to buy in stores.</li>
            <li> I found it to get thick very quickly, though, so I never got to use the entire bottle.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is good for finishing complicated nail designs when you don&#x27;t have time to sit around for hours waiting for it to dry.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint is the chemical smell which is strong.</li>
            <li> with this top coat, several layers are hard to the touch in 10 minutes flat!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost due for a new bottle!!</li>
            <li> Ok, I know there are some bad reviews of this product because of the smell and the Toulene, but I have used other top coats and nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li> I have a huge problem with my nail polish chipping off (usually within a day of putting it on!)</li>
            <li> I mean prolly the fastest delivery from anything I bought off here esp for it being a free delivery.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sheet marks&lt;br /&gt;Being impatient and screwing over your manicure right after doing it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Without this, your nails might be &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;, but not really - when you run your fingers over the nail, it&#x27;s dry at a light touch, but then clearly it isn&#x27;t dry underneath.</li>
            <li> Normally I get a dent or 2 even if I&#x27;ve let my nails dry for about an hour.</li>
            <li> The polish stays on longer as a result and chips less in the first day or two.</li>
            <li> I let it dry longer than normal thou.</li>
            <li> After about 6 months and with half a bottle left, my last bottle started drying so quickly that I couldn&#x27;t even get it on the nail.  </li>
            <li> People who do nail art should definitely invest in this item so your art can last longer and look professional without the cost!d my nails without it!  </li>
            <li> People who do nail art should definitely invest in this item so your art can last longer and look professional without the cost!</li>
            <li> Since I took a trip out of town for the weekend and did none of my usual chores around the house, I figure I was lucky to get 3 days out of them.  </li>
            <li> You can see a little flaking on the side of my middle and index fingers, and the color (Essie Mojito Madness) is a little dull, but still looks good!</li>
            <li> It does dry fast but at the end of the bottle, it gets really thick and stringy and does not dry as quickly and is susceptible to bumps and scratches, screwing up your (and my) manicure.  </li>
            <li> Only the top edges had worn down a little but the polish design had no damage to it.</li>
            <li> This is the only fast dry I use!</li>
            <li> Previously I had used Sally Hansen&#x27;s hard as nails line, which when dry, is very nice and helps with growing longer nails, but takes longer to dry than I am patient.  </li>
            <li> Believe the other reviews - this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Take it from someone who is a really hesitant buyer, is extremely cautious with her money, and does a lot of research before buying.</li>
            <li> Yes, it dries fast, but I agree with the other reviews...</li>
            <li> dries so much faster than any other i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It lasts so much longer than any other that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well at fast drying as well as protecting the polish.  </li>
            <li> It finishes like a gel manicure and it lasts much longer than other topcoats I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> being said, I have two nail polish racks full to the brim with 100 different shades of the same few pinks, grays, whites, and blacks.</li>
            <li> so at the end of your wear, it creates a thick enough layer that you can pretty much peel your polish off.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly and forms very few (if any) bubbles.  </li>
            <li> Dries fast and hard, stays really glossy.</li>
            <li> This was watered down and doesn&#x27;t have near the same consistency as a REAL seche vite.</li>
            <li> Scrubbing countertops with chemical cleaners, stocking the cooler, counting change in the registers, and not a single chip or dent in my nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only fast drying, but it&#x27;s very long lasting.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I was off to cook dinner within moments of having finished my nails, and they were still as sleek and smooth as all get out when I set dinner on the table.</li>
            <li> The crazy fast drying speed of this magic potion is a deal maker.  </li>
            <li> Only takes a few minute to dry and it goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li> It dries incredibly fast allowing me to paint my nails even with an active toddler running around, without fear that my nails will get messed up.</li>
            <li> Dry times at least 60% faster than regular top coat polish.</li>
            <li> Way different from the standard clear polishes out there</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be the solution to my constantly smudged nails, but, it didn&#x27;t dry fast enough for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this through amazon and only wasted half the amount that I would&#x27;ve if I had gotten it at a beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li> A lot of companies advertise this type of result, but so far this is the only brand I&#x27;ve found that actually delivers.</li>
            <li> The ONLY flaw is that I got chipping the next day, and the day after that two nails completely chipped off.</li>
            <li> I was about to give up on natural nails because nail polish would only last a day or two, but then I found this product.</li>
            <li> shortly after I painted my nails the last time, I realized how screwed I was since my boys woke up too early from their naps.</li>
            <li> It dried really fast, and it looks like a professional manicure.</li>
            <li> I think some companies sit around and get a kick out of making polishes that never dry</li>
            <li> I used it on wet polish and it dried shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Did not dry fast--was tacky and made my polish bubble.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this, my polish would chip within the first hour or so no matter what I did or the quality of the base color, so I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> It dried pretty quickly and my manicures lasted a bit longer than usual.</li>
            <li> This top coat goes on a bit thick so be careful</li>
            <li> this on dry nails&lt;br /&gt;Apply two coats for a very professional look&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> Not only did I have major &amp;#34;shrink back&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I did struggle with it a little at first however.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I had a little freak out because I thought I ruined my mani</li>
            <li> Nearly all of the nail polish I purchased was less than $1.50 a bottle, so it was by no means high quality.  </li>
            <li> I will then fix the chip, add a second top coat of it, and by 48 hours, the majority of my nails have chipped pretty bad, and I have to completely redo them.</li>
            <li> Seriously it dries super fast and leaves a long lasting shine too!</li>
            <li> Just what I expected this is a high shine polish.</li>
            <li> And yes, my nails dried very fast.</li>
            <li> And dries my nails quick, meaning to the point I can do light things, if I were to rub my finger nail hard on my jeans, yes it will mess them up, they dry them enough to where you can do things and not worry about if something touches your nails, and definitely keeps the polish from chipping or fading.</li>
            <li> I got this b/c I started using Julep polish and for me that polish was taking to long to dry but having that sticky factor after words.the seche vite really douse dry fast and has long wear before chipping.</li>
            <li> first bottle didn&#x27;t goop up on me, but the second slightly did-</li>
            <li> One odd thing is that I have noticed by then end of one week, the nailpolish looks a tiny bit darker than when I first painted them so there might be an issue with discoloration.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of top coats in the past, and decided to purchase this one based on previous reviews.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty before the shine dulls (3-4 days), and it DOES dry my nails super-fast, but I&#x27;d prefer my nail polish not chip between manis (every week).</li>
            <li> But the real reason for the low rating: it also stinks like no other top coat I have used recently.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Dries up quickly if you keep the cap off for too long, hence becoming thick, and leaving a thick coat (again not a problem if you use Seche Restore)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Naturally, the quick wear and frequent mini manicures mean the bottle doesn&#x27;t last very long.   </li>
            <li> I thought this was a great product reading the reviews :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed because the reviews said it was so great.</li>
            <li> Awesome top coat, no bleeding when doing designs like galaxy or thin art work, but the smell is awful, like paint thinner!!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and was nicely secured so it wasn&#x27;t broken or damaged the least bit.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the smell but still totally worth it!</li>
            <li> B000J63372 Essie First Base Coat Nail Treatment]]) to other nail salons because I prefer these products and several have all remarked on what a great topcoat this is.  </li>
            <li> I have long, natural nails and never painted them because my polish was chipped or smudged within an hour of a manicure.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hands frequently and type all day long, so my polish takes a beating.</li>
            <li> I am going on day 5 with one tiny chip that is barely noticeable , no shrinkage or tip wear.</li>
            <li> Also, I applied a second layer and my entire french manicure completely lifted and basically just fell off.</li>
            <li> The shine lasts long too and it leaves my nails looking as if I had the professional gels done.</li>
            <li> I usually do my nails at home and bough Seche Vite to make my manicure last longer and all I can say is that it&#x27;s the same quality as any other top coat you can buy at any drugstore.</li>
            <li> As long as your nail polish isn&#x27;t so old</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t even imagine what chemicals could be in it &amp;#62;.&amp;#62; It also warns about possible birth defects on the bottle :o</li>
            <li> I  don&#x27;t know if it has been sitting too long and is old.</li>
            <li> My nails dried so fast!</li>
            <li> - smooth, glossy feel... can apply a thick, smooth coat or a thin one.</li>
            <li> No more hair marks or dings on your freshly painted nails.</li>
            <li> It dried SO FAST!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t drag the polish, doesn&#x27;t shrink, doesn&#x27;t crack or chip under normal use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and glossy and dries quicker than any other top coat I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good for at least a week and a half!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong and if that gives you trouble, then you may have a hard time using Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> Now there&#x27;s no excuse for you to go home and slop it on over day-old dry polish, or straight on a dry nail bed.</li>
            <li> Easy dry and nail polish stays on for at least a week.</li>
            <li> And it really cuts down on the chipping.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it chipped very easily and by the next day it was chipping/peeling on on my nails.</li>
            <li> Well if there was one out there that makes any polish dry fast and last a long time, I had been yet to find it.  </li>
            <li> was skeptical at first, but after my first pedicure and manicure, I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> It dries quickly &amp; makes your nails shiny &amp; hard, smoothing out any mistakes along the way.</li>
            <li> And, because it is so shiny, it is super noticeable - because the polish coat underneath is dull by comparison.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This top coat stinks to high heaven (gives my boyfriend a headache), but it does its job.</li>
            <li> I started painting my nails so much frequently after getting this product because it cuts down on the amount of time you have to wait for your nails to dry by so much.</li>
            <li> I also think it helps to dry the polish under the topcoat; the Revlon polish I used recently was kind of thick and took a long time to dry between coats.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I honestly really found nothing wrong with this top coat.</li>
            <li> used to dedicate about 3 hours every 3 days to maintain my OPI base and top coat manicure, and more time with other brands.</li>
            <li> I even got a small snag in a nail and was able to file it down and the polish did not chip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding!</li>
            <li> That isn&#x27;t usual for an older bottle of Seche Vite, but I have never had that happen with a new bottle.</li>
            <li> I was SHOCKED the first time I used this top coat.  </li>
            <li> Just from scratching your head over night in your sleep, you may very well see slightly worn tips in the morning depending.</li>
            <li> I have 3 kids, so I am not exactly super gentle on my nails and this keeps my nails from chipping and continues to make them look shiny and just painted...</li>
            <li> It would start to bubble and take ages to dry, the finished result would look like a 5 year old</li>
            <li> and I have to wait a while for it to dry completely because if I do it too soon it will smear.</li>
            <li> Even after allowing my nails to dry for a considerable amount of time they still get dents and sheet marks.  </li>
            <li> Dries to the touch in under 5 minutes, complete dry between 1-2 hours depending on the amount of polish I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It also becomes very goopy half way through the bottle.</li>
            <li> It makes it look like I had my nails done professionally, and helps my polish last a long time.</li>
            <li> I still noticed it discolored my white tips- turning them pinkish, but it also gave unnatural brassy color to my bare nails above the white!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before I knew something like this existed, I put off repainting my natural nails for as long as possible because it was quite literally an all-afternoon job for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few manicures last a whole week with this!</li>
            <li> It dries quickly; however, you still have to be delicate with your nails.  </li>
            <li> I had been using OPI and Sally Hansen top coat for the past few years now, and ordered a bottle of this just to see what the hype was about.</li>
            <li> However, on the back of the bottle there&#x27;s a warning that it contains a chemical known to cause birth defects, so I&#x27;m still not sure if it&#x27;s worth it...</li>
            <li> *) I keep my nail shorts because they tend to chip &amp; break easily if I do not.</li>
            <li> Makes my nails hard and dries very fast!</li>
            <li> When I ordered from this seller, it arrived quickly, but turned thick, gooey, and unusable within 3 months.</li>
            <li> This top coat sucks!!</li>
            <li> Very Clear, Glossy Wet Look when dry.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> The only down side is it also makes my nail polishes peel sooooo much fast.</li>
            <li> It made my polish peel off in large chunks, not just little nicks.</li>
            <li> The down side: it doesn&#x27;t chip any less than any other top coat I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but if you do it right - as instructed then you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Starting chipping and peeling right away :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other high quality brands when I could not find this</li>
            <li> Using it myself now, I completely agree that it only takes a couple minutes to completely dry.</li>
            <li> But it still takes between an hour and two hours for the entire polish job to dry completely.</li>
            <li> It dries my nails completely in under a minute, so I can go back to my life and not have to sit around waiting for polish to dry.</li>
            <li> i can never do regular manicure and always go for the color gel because i do not have the patience for it to dry completely.</li>
            <li> Also when approaching the half bottle mark it begins to get VERY clumpy.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of top coats that chip after a day, and nails that seemed to take forever to dry.</li>
            <li> Enough so that it beads at the tip of the brush, and then you GENTLY pull it down the middle of your nail.</li>
            <li> It dries both your base and top coat INSANELY quick, but there is a price to pay.</li>
            <li> I am using a vitamin filled base coat to help my nails grow strong (Orly)</li>
            <li> It looks a little thick on the brush, but it goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> The dry time makes it easier for them to not mess them up.</li>
            <li> If your polish has dried even a little, then it works fine.  </li>
            <li> Makes my weak, thin nails look great.  </li>
            <li> I can not only save money by doing my nails at home, but I can have them dry in 60 seconds flat, look like a professional did them, and go on about my business!  </li>
            <li> I get a mani and pedi every other week and was unhappy with their brand of quick dry, top coat.  </li>
            <li> I used the same brand of polish a few months before with a different top coat, and it didn&#x27;t even survive past the second day.  </li>
            <li> This top coat does dry fast but it chips like crazy.</li>
            <li> Does dry fast but gets very gooey and thick in bottle after a couple months.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter how cheap, thin, or thick, your nail polish is, it will go on smoothly and dry within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Its really nothing that a little polish thinner can&#x27;t fix though.</li>
            <li> It takes a little longer to dry completely, so if you smash them too hard your polish will move, but since the top coat is completely dry you can generally push the polish back/reshape a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would not suggest using it in a closed space ( like your bathroom ) because of the possible fumes, but the smell goes away once dry, and this does dry very fast.</li>
            <li> and I try to give this top coat at least a little time as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of Base and Top coat for sometime now and finding it for $5 online was an absolute steal!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several top coats and realized how stupid I was for never knowing about Seche Vite in the first place!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said it does dry up really fast.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands that didn&#x27;t dry as fast as i needed it to and smudged.  </li>
            <li> I also have a tendency to mess my nails up within the first 5 minutes but with this stuff my nails are dry in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> unless it really is, i LOVE it it just cuts down the drying time to less then half, literally you just need to apply it and wait like a minute</li>
            <li> Since I  wasn&#x27;t too keen on changing my polish every two days like clockwork, I decided to try quick dries by a few other companies.</li>
            <li> this can be a good thing and a bad thing.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s something bad I can say about it, it&#x27;s the smelll (What good nail polish product doesn&#x27;t smell?)</li>
            <li> Really the only bad thing I have to say is that if you miss a spot with this top coat (i.e. you don&#x27;t cover your ENTIRE nail)</li>
            <li> It makes it dry to the touch in minutes and then fully dry so much faster than the polish would ever dry without it.</li>
            <li> colors that drag then get deposited back into the bottle of clear Seche and end up in your next manicure</li>
            <li> Dries my nails very fast which is nice and convenient because I hate waiting for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li> I started using this product because of a recommendation by my manicurist, but then after reading the back of the bottle, its going straight in the trash!&lt;br /&gt;In tiny black writing it states: Warning!</li>
            <li> I am very frustrated that i spent about $10.00 on this product because they said it was the best.</li>
            <li> It dries very quickly and makes nail polish underneath dry faster and very hard.</li>
            <li> top coat peels off like scales of a snake in a few days and smells awfully strong :(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only issue I had with Seche is that halfway through the bottle, the consistency changes to a thick, goopy mess that&#x27;s pretty much unusable.</li>
            <li> One big glop in the middle will spread across the nail and usually create an even coat, I don&#x27;t go back for a second swipe unless it&#x27;s on my thumb nails or large toe.</li>
            <li> Before this, I would always (and i do mean ALWAYS) end up ruining one or two nails of freshly applied polish.</li>
            <li> The only con is that about half way through the bottle it will start to thicken up on you, but you can use a thinning agent and get the same results from a brand new bottle.  </li>
            <li> I barely need five minutes for my nails to be completely dry.</li>
            <li> I painted my nails last night and in 5 minutes they were dry, completely, 100% dry.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be any different from any other clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> It does not smell better or worse than the other stuff.</li>
            <li> When they say fast dry - they mean fast dry.</li>
            <li> My nails chipped in less than a day, and i&#x27;m not hard on my nails.</li>
            <li> Takes less than five minutes for nails to be completely dry and chore ready.</li>
            <li> I put two coats of fast dry nail polish from Avon and a coat of Seche Vite less than 4 minutes before putting on my winter coat and gloves.</li>
            <li> If you add an extra coat on top if you mess up a nail, it makes it like it never happened--as long as you didn&#x27;t seriously screw it up!)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews but after using this product, I remembered how many bad reviews I had read prior to purchasing this item.  </li>
            <li> Its like any other clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> Some people on blogs and sites say that this happens due to applying Seche Vite either too early-</li>
            <li> It has other faults too - the noxious fumes when I used to use it didn&#x27;t bother me, but now it does - I&#x27;m leary of the hazards of toluene though I haven&#x27;t completely cut it out of my life</li>
            <li> I researched it and apparently I&#x27;m not the only one</li>
            <li> I use to just use any brand but realized that the cheaper brands are a waste of money as they just don&#x27;t last and will chip and are highly toxic...</li>
            <li> I am very hard on polish and it keeps my polish from chipping for full week.  </li>
            <li> This seller is amazing, as normally it would be $13/bottle, and I get them for less then $3/bottle!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> With other top coats, I usually wait a few minutes after the 2nd coat of color to apply</li>
            <li> My polish usually would last for about a week, and with this top coat it usually lasts for two weeks!</li>
            <li> You do have to work quickly with it, but I found that it wasn&#x27;t too hard to use.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> It dries very fast and sets hard as nails.</li>
            <li> I figure there&#x27;s 101 ways to get cancer, and unless you&#x27;re practically bathing in this stuff, this small of an exposure really shouldn&#x27;t be a big deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others that dried fast, but would dry cloudy on the tips of my nails or turn the polish a different color.</li>
            <li> For so long, I would only paint my nails occasionally.</li>
            <li> It is long lasting so helps keep me from having to constantly repaint my nails!</li>
            <li> to last as long as humanly</li>
            <li> provides long lasting protection in a big way.  </li>
            <li> I always wondered what to do after spending a long time painting my nails only to have them chip days later.</li>
            <li> I can see what all of the hype is about, and I&#x27;m still not sure whether it is worth the price, but I believe it is money well spent, for me</li>
            <li> I can see what all of the hype is about, and I&#x27;m still not sure whether it is worth the price, but I believe it is money well spent, for me</li>
            <li> As soon as I get home from the salon, I put at least one if not more coats of this top coat on my manicure.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, while I love the fast drying aspect of Seche Vite.... I&#x27;m so incredibly disappointed in the rest.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty annoying, and it sort of defeats the purpose of having a top coat.</li>
            <li> Not really that much more expensive than drugstore brands, so no excuse not to buy this!</li>
            <li> , left hand would be dry by the time I&#x27;m done with right hand.&lt;br /&gt;-Extremely shiny/polished look, won&#x27;t ever be dull</li>
            <li> I will keep trying with this product, but so far it has only made my manicures a big mess.</li>
            <li> I just began to notice that my manicure actually were lasting 7-9 days without a chip, while at other salons my manicures would barely make it a week.</li>
            <li> I tough the comment could&#x27;t be true, but they are.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the brush is too short and much of the product gets left unused as a result.</li>
            <li> I used to paint my nails every few days, but now I can go up to a week with a high quality polish.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes but waste of purchase for me.</li>
            <li> My only complaint, which I&#x27;ve actually noticed with a multitude of top coats, is after a couple of months it starts to get goopy and thick.</li>
            <li> Also makes my manicure last much longer with less chipping!!</li>
            <li> When I use any of the Sally Hansen topcoats, I can work my nails hard for 5 days (typing all day at work, doing dishes, taking care of my kids, etc) and I won&#x27;t get my first chip till about 5 days in.</li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s somewhat hard to take the polish off when you&#x27;re ready!</li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s somewhat hard to take the polish off when you&#x27;re ready!</li>
            <li> It dries even faster than out the door, and it leaves a pretty hard coating with a lot of shine.</li>
            <li> The Restore will last a very long time, as it only takes a drop or two to do the trick.</li>
            <li> Dries super fast, is crazy shiny, and lasts well.  </li>
            <li> This product does dry nails fast, but do not go out and pick cotton or do heavy duty stuff for an hour</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve purchased numerous shades of polishes and always have the same issue, the polish takes forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> I got.the wrong item I ordered dry top coat seche vite</li>
            <li> It can dry your wet nails completely in 30 seconds flat.</li>
            <li> this saves so much time, too, because u can put all your coats on that you need that might take hours literally to dry and it will definitely be dry in less than 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is the real product or a forgery</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it dried!  </li>
            <li> But with Biotin pills and Seche, I can keep them at a much longer length than usual.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how fast this dried my polish!</li>
            <li> I usually try not to do too much for like 30 minutes afterward, but after that I can shower, dig in my purse,</li>
            <li> I usually swap my colors out ever couple of days or so, so chipping isn&#x27;t really an issue for me.  </li>
            <li> Dries fast, but peels excessively.</li>
            <li> This has made my manicures go from average to professional.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and shiny.</li>
            <li> but it does not last long.</li>
            <li> makes your polish last so much long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I figure if I do want long lasting nails</li>
            <li> *** excuse my french</li>
            <li> I had bought this product to keep my polishes from chipping and to have them last long.</li>
            <li> Have used others but nothing last as long as this one.</li>
            <li> Keeps my nails protected and lasting long.</li>
            <li> My manicures also last really long when I use it.</li>
            <li> This keeps my nail polish long lasting and chip-free for a week or so!</li>
            <li> Long term and repeated workplace exposure to toluene affect the central nervous</li>
            <li> Long lasting, supremely shiny, durable and dries in a flash.</li>
            <li> My manicures never last long because I use my hands a lot.</li>
            <li> The UV gels, the shellac, the quick-dry, the long lasting.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Can use for a really long time (especially if you combine it with Seche Restore)&lt;br /&gt;-Long</li>
            <li> This shine lasts as long as the topcoat does, which is definitely a plus.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Seche Vite for a long time, but I always resist buying ANOTHER bottle when I start getting low, because this stuff makes my polish chip like nothing I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> it last long through all hand washing, showers, dish washing</li>
            <li> No smudging of the design, glossy, long lasting finish, and truly quick-drying!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t bubble and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t fing it makes my manicure long lasting.</li>
            <li> I have also found that it conceals minor flaws in the colored polishes it is applied over, and I have worn it over various brands of nail polish (OPI, china glaze, revlon, etc.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be using this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> 10 minutes flat exists.</li>
            <li> It also makes my polish last a really long time.</li>
            <li> It seals the polish and gives a long lasting shine to my manicure.</li>
            <li> Makes any nail polish last a long time, even drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see if it gets all gummy like</li>
            <li> It helps keep the shine and adds long lasting wear to your nail colors.</li>
            <li> It also dried faster than normal polishes which was a bonus.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not goopey or thick like most clear coats, it&#x27;s not too thin either.</li>
            <li> Not with this stuff, within 30 mins I can do normal everyday things and my work is not all marred.  </li>
            <li> First of all, if your Seche Vite is chipping or gets too thick, buy the Seche Restore.  </li>
            <li> facts from my use: it does tend to get pretty thick as it gets lower.</li>
            <li> Dries through base coat and two coats of polish leaving nails nice and shiny!...</li>
            <li> If I get a small chip -- after 3-ish days -- I file down the rough edges to make it blend in, apply my normal manicure steps -- and with these occasional touchups, I can get a whole week out of a manicure.  </li>
            <li> I can be extremely clumsy and tend to always ruin my nail polish, usually I can&#x27;t use regular top coats because they take forever to dry!</li>
            <li> I think a lot of products probably contain toxic components, but the fact that this is so strong that it&#x27;s not safe for pregnant women is scary!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the positive reviews and a product has to perform very badly for me to leave this kind of review</li>
            <li> Please be aware that serious side effects are the result of OVER EXPOSURE and that regular, intended usage is nothing at all to be concerned about.</li>
            <li> I knew I wanted to try it even though there were polar opposite mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> Not only did I not have a single blanket smudge, but I didn&#x27;t get a single bit of wear after a very computer heavy day of work.</li>
            <li> have painted my nails before with another top coat, went to sleep thinking it was dry, wake up, and the polish is smudged and indented with the sheet print, very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was old, but the color of the liquid actually looked a little yellowed.  </li>
            <li> you should be pretty solid for typically manicure destroying tasks (even dishes).  </li>
            <li> As always, even when buying products with such high reviews, you may fall under the small percentage of people that don&#x27;t end up liking the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries so fast and leaves your nails hard, so you can get back to work!</li>
            <li> The problem is it doesn&#x27;t last long!  </li>
            <li> can this be any different than any other top coat?&amp;#34; I WAS WRONG.</li>
            <li> Shiny and last long!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like that it does not last very long.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and it dries very, very fast!  </li>
            <li> It does dry very fast and hard.  </li>
            <li> Have spent $10.00 on one bottle of supposedly instant dry polish, and had no where near instant dry results!!!</li>
            <li> and I had to use a fan to make sure I am not taking in huge breaths of it because it gave me a terrible headache.  </li>
            <li> it has started coming off my nails in a clear sheet in less then</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m unsure of why I&#x27;m not getting the same dry time.</li>
            <li> But it does dry faster than others and maintains the glossiness for several days longer.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, the product does everything it promises to: apply, wait ten minutes, and your nails are dry.</li>
            <li> In an incredibly short time, your nails are dry and your hands usable.</li>
            <li> It only takes 5 minutes to dry</li>
            <li> It also adds great shine and strengthens without the thick, lumpy, artificial look you often get with acrylics and gel</li>
            <li> Love it but the outside of the polish was dirty</li>
            <li> Makes mani&#x27;s last longer and dry faster.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t do much for chipping.  </li>
            <li> Dries really fast like nothing I have ever seen before, but unfortunately chips off really fast too</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;d give this 2 stars instead of 1 is because it does dry polish</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was so disappointed as a few hours later the entire nail just peeled off like a sticker; my base,2x color &amp; the top coat.</li>
            <li> Not only does it dry within minutes</li>
            <li> Literally dry one minute after application even with several coats underneath.  </li>
            <li> It peels off the second it is dry.</li>
            <li> I avoid doing my nails because after polishing them to perfection I inevitably wreck them before they can dry.  </li>
            <li> Not only do my nails not chip, but they dry in 4-5 minutes instead of 10-20.</li>
            <li> It dries CRAZY fast (hence e name...) and leaves my nails looking glossy and fresh for days.</li>
            <li> In about 10-15 minutes (heck, maybe even less), your manicure is completely</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it for those of us who don&#x27;t have the patience to let our nails dry.</li>
            <li> Five minutes later, my nails were dry</li>
            <li> You can paint it on while your nails are only partway dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always doing my nails in a rush or before bed, thinking I&#x27;m giving myself enough time to let it dry...</li>
            <li> Never again will I go to bed thinking my nails were dry, only to wake up with the tell tale signs of bedsheet smudge!  </li>
            <li> Waiting for them to dry, obviously.</li>
            <li> so many a manicurist has told me at my disappointment at the short wear of my nail polish), and this stuff extends my manicure by days to a week.  </li>
            <li> Dry to the touch almost instantly, and fully hardened within minutes.</li>
            <li> It was terrible, surprised by all the great reviews</li>
            <li> for the 2nd polish coat to dry.</li>
            <li> Nails dry almost instantly.</li>
            <li> I put 2 coats of the color over some generic dollar store clear coat, and I got distracted for a few minutes</li>
            <li> and I felt so vulnerable because I had to make sure that I was careful about what I was doing so that my nail polish wouldn&#x27;t be messed up.</li>
            <li> Did not dry nails as expected.</li>
            <li> The neck of the bottle is super thin.</li>
            <li> It gets me up and  moving so much faster than a plain topcoat!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only other one out there that can give this product a run for its money--polish lasts just as long (about 10 days), it smells less toxic, but it takes much longer to dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way to expensive and there are other fast drying top coats out there that work just as well if not better.</li>
            <li> With Seche Vite my nails literally dry in a minute, and within 15 minutes I can do the dishes, vacuum, run my fingers through my hair, etc.</li>
            <li> I usually pour it into a new bottle after I&#x27;ve used it enough to fill.</li>
            <li> I usually use a product from Duane Reade to make my nails dry fast</li>
            <li> I am one of those absent-minded people who always end up with smudged nails after a manicure, because I just can&#x27;t sit still long enough for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Seche Vite dry fast topcoat for the past 4 years now.</li>
            <li> My nails took just as long to dry with this as they do with regular polish.  </li>
            <li> You can do pretty thick coats of nail polish, and then apply this, and they are dry within a couple of minutes.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll know a polish has shrunk when the edges have a ridge-like appearance instead of blending down smoothly to that thin line of visible nail next to the cuticle.</li>
            <li> it goes on very thick but does dry quickly.</li>
            <li> This coat seriously dries within minutes, I really recommend it!</li>
            <li> The one and only dry coat!  </li>
            <li> Only downside is if you soak your hands under water for extended amount of time (washing dishes), it&#x27;ll chip a lot quicker, so keep them hands dry!</li>
            <li> Not only did this polish dry in about 30 seconds!</li>
            <li> I use this over my French Manicure and it helps the work last a lot longer than other products.</li>
            <li> I have other issues like shrinkage and it also turns my white nail polish, yellow.</li>
            <li> Before reaching even halfway into the bottle, you are likely to encounter a goopy, stringy mess that you can barely get on to the brush.  </li>
            <li> It does dry fast and the top coat doesn&#x27;t discolor the base coats.</li>
            <li> It occasionally gets thick on me, but like I do with my polishes, I simply use a few drops of polish thinner until it&#x27;s the right consistency again, no problem.  </li>
            <li> but that won&#x27;t be for a while because you have to use so little of this for complete coverage.  </li>
            <li> The other problem with it is that if you shower in hot water, it sometimes reacts weird to it and the polish peels off in whole sheets.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I read so many great reviews, but, unfortunately, I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It makes my mani last 2x longer and the high gloss look doesn&#x27;t fade or dull over time.</li>
            <li> It takes about half an hour to an hour to dry completely</li>
            <li> Even if you used a halfway decent polish this stuff will corrupt the integrity of the whole look.  </li>
            <li> The quick dry labeling lulls you into a false sense of security.</li>
            <li> The quick dry labeling lulls you into a false sense of security.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didnt give this polish 5 stars is because the blush for the polish is tilted side ways and it is very hard to make a straight line with the brush is wanting to paint my skin and not the actual nail.</li>
            <li> All I can say is my polish was dry in no time flat -</li>
            <li> This truly does dry in five minutes flat.  </li>
            <li> My nails dry in five minutes flat.</li>
            <li> Dries fast, hard and shiny.</li>
            <li> but it dries hard so fast</li>
            <li> Drys fast and hard.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to do my nails without messing up at least a couple of them due to slow drying until I used this, it really is unbelievable how fast it dries &amp;</li>
            <li> Dries fast and hard.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that half way through the bottle it tends to get a little goopy but if you buy the restoration and use it it makes it like new again!</li>
            <li> For a little perspective, driving is by far one of the most dangerous things you can do daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal to me since it&#x27;s barely noticeable and being a little careful with applying it eliminates the problem entirely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands and nothing has the fast dry time like this does.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;diamonds\\&quot;to confuse you with \\&quot;diamond strength\\&quot;) and shown as a transparent-cover-for-your-polish-to-protect it,in photos,and never stated it was A NAIL COLOR!Deceptive tiny photo,of clear glaze as \\&quot;diamond hard\\&quot;CLEAR,like a \\&quot;diamond hard strengthener,no chip.\\&quot;,with TINY COLOR NAME IN NON-ENGLISH</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I must have got a bad bottle or something, because I tried another bottle and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I honestly find the bad reviews of this product unfathomable.</li>
            <li> It saves so much time and lasts at least 5-7 days.</li>
            <li> Why is this so expensive at salons and so cheap online??</li>
            <li> It works better than my Sally Hansen Mega Shine when you are painting on layers and layers of polish to make crazy embellishments.  </li>
            <li> This would be a 5 star review if Seche Vite was Toulene free, unfortunately its not</li>
            <li> Nail polishes, whether expensive OPI or cheap Sally Hansen, would begin to chip after one to two days.</li>
            <li> even after using the tanning bed for a few days it was clear.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in the general condition of my nails using this product over other quick-dry topcoats, even with all other practices remaining the same.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in the general condition of my nails using this product over other quick-dry topcoats, even with all other practices remaining the same.  </li>
            <li> Lasts long and adds up shine to your nails.</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected and lives up to what it says it can do.</li>
            <li> All of the evidence points to severe effects only occurring with excessive exposure, but this is the only time I personally might not take the risk simply because it is strong-smelling.</li>
            <li> Holds long.</li>
            <li> I type all day long and then do dishes by hand at night...</li>
            <li> As of day 3 using Seche Vite as I&#x27;ve described, I only have minimal wear on my tips.</li>
            <li> It is a long standing staple</li>
            <li> and I received  the item earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> It tries in no time at all - when you get done painted your second hand</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something that that works visually just as well as gel, minus the UV lamps.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s strange.  </li>
            <li> With Orly Bonder, 2-3 coats nail polish and then Seche Vite, my manicure ends up lasting me a week with minimal tipwear.</li>
            <li> It also lasted a really long time.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how ive gone this long without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to purchase this stuff.</li>
            <li> Lasts long.</li>
            <li> I am never going to waste $ on professional manicures again.</li>
            <li> and I probably didn&#x27;t even need to wait that long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for long time&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> long wear)</li>
            <li> no matter how long i waited.  </li>
            <li> But I won&#x27;t be using for long since it contains toulene.</li>
            <li> I did my nails not too long before I went to bed.  </li>
            <li> However I&#x27;m not completely won over.</li>
            <li> I must tell this, i am 66 and have had long nails since i was 10.</li>
            <li> It shines and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I went to sleep, woke up, and was surprised to see that two of my nails were missing nail polish.  </li>
            <li> This product is something that I have been using for a long while</li>
            <li> When I bought it the box to the polish was crushed, only a bummer because it was a stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> It dries almost instantaneously and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> But with OPI, I usually end up redoing my nails simply because they have grown out and left a naked strip of nail next to my cuticles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been reading about this brand of topcoat for so long now.</li>
            <li> Only the surface is the rest of the nail polish is still very much wet</li>
            <li> It will instead penetrate the layers of your wet polish and actually harden them.</li>
            <li> and it works for a long time.</li>
            <li> and I have my hands in water all day long</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long to get here.</li>
            <li> I know that still isn&#x27;t long</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and added this top coat from base to the very end of the tips while my nails were still a tad wet and my nail color has remained chip-free for over 5 days... longer than any manicure I&#x27;ve ever had (excluding gel and acrylic manicures).</li>
            <li> I used it as base and the entire nail polish cracked off the next day, definitely recommend that you only use this as top coat.</li>
            <li> It is really thick though, so if you let your nails grow out (or they grow fast)</li>
            <li> This product is thick and you&#x27;ll have a visible ridge if you didn&#x27;t quite cover the whole nail.  </li>
            <li> The real kicker is, about a month or so after I bought this stuff, it became so thick and gooey that I had to throw it out.</li>
            <li> It is thick, like a gel, and really protects my nails.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick and dries my nails fast.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve not heard good things about the Seche Vite Base)  </li>
            <li> Product very thick and chips off right away.  </li>
            <li> I end up smudging at least one because I am not patient enough to sit still long enough for them to dry completely.</li>
            <li> Dried to touch in about 30 seconds, super hard after about 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I never really understood the point of a top coat until I used Seche Vite - the reason being that my previous top coat polishes were worthless!  </li>
            <li> The formula is thin enough to be applied easily, but thick enough to protect against chips.</li>
            <li> Normally, it takes forever for my nails to dry after a base coat, two nail polish coats and the top coat.</li>
            <li> I cannot find a single thing wrong with this product and will continue to buy it for as long as it&#x27;s made.ers have mentioned, is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done many tricks to get my nails to dry faster; from using a hair dryer to soaking nails in ice cold water.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry fast, but my manicure lasts at least a week.</li>
            <li> It creates a sort of sealing coat on your polish which causes it to peel off in big sheets after only a day (or less).  </li>
            <li> Being clumsy, i always get dents on the polish because it is not dry completely.</li>
            <li> i mean really fast.</li>
            <li> I mean no one really wants to fold laundry, but you could if you wanted.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I live in a small town</li>
            <li> My nails take so long to dry and</li>
            <li> In my opinion this has a medium sized brush which I prefer since I have long nail beds (I keep my nails short due to this).</li>
            <li> Apply every other day for a long lasting manicure.</li>
            <li> It makes my polish dry so quickly, avoids nasty smudges, and keeps my manicure looking better longer.  </li>
            <li> Well I mean it does dry fast</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t time it or anything, but I&#x27;ve never done a paint job with a single base coat, 2 polish coats, and a top coat dried so fast that I was eating pizza 45 minutes later and not a smudge to be found.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same with paint thinners, gasoline, lacquers, and other industrial products made with the ingredient (or any known harmful ingredient) that the warnings be printed on the product.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit different than other topcoats, but that is because you smell something that works.  </li>
            <li> on the back it has a warning that says \\&quot;this product contains a chemical known to the state of california to cause birth defect or other reproductive harm\\</li>
            <li> I suppose alot of problems with this polish could be due with application of it and not the actual product.</li>
            <li> By the next day I could see the whites at the tops of my nails, the shrinkage was so extreme.</li>
            <li> The next morning, there were no smears or smudge marks where the polish had been shifted around due to not being fully dried/cured.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to totally prevent chipping with other drugstore polishes I&#x27;ve tried (like Revlon or Sallie Hansen</li>
            <li> - I merely need to order a fresh one!</li>
            <li> I will be using this for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe I went this long with out ever using it!  </li>
            <li> Other than a bit of tip wear and nail growth, your manicure will last for what seems like forever.  </li>
            <li> While my polish is drying, I&#x27;ll often look online at other nail polishes to try to plan my next mani.</li>
            <li> Both of mine broke during some travels -- I had other polishes with me both times but only this one broke both times.</li>
            <li> It will help your polish last 3 times longer than any other product</li>
            <li> The back of the box says: &amp;#34;This product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.&amp;#34; I wish this warning label was posted in the description, as I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this top coat!</li>
            <li> only problem I had with it was the extreme shrinkage it caused.</li>
            <li> Three stars because it is very shiny and did make my polish last a few days longer than usual.  </li>
            <li> Since my nails are completely dry within 5 mins of applying the Seche Vite topcoat, I change my nail polish choices about every other day if not daily.  </li>
            <li> So it doesn&#x27;t work on dry nails and it definitely does NOT work on wet nails!</li>
            <li> I mean, there is nothing that will truly dry nail polish, but this stuff makes it hard enough that you can live your life relatively normally until the polish does actually dry.</li>
            <li> this last thing is the reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars:  (and it could be user error, I admit it)but the very tip of my nails, the polish has pulled back on about half of my nails revealing just the tiniest sliver of white that really I can only see close up.  </li>
            <li> It does tend to get thick when you are about halfway through the bottle, but a couple of drops of nail polish thinner do the trick, and it works like new!</li>
            <li> Reduces chipping lasts a very long time</li>
            <li> When you use this polish on your colored polish it seals it in and stays for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It has seemed very strange.</li>
            <li> Keeps my nail polish on for a very long time.</li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike is how thick it is and that it is not &amp;#34;3 free&amp;#34; like other polishes (it has toluene, which I&#x27;m kind of wary about).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not THAT bad, but I&#x27;m definitely considering buying another type of top coat</li>
            <li> This is such a bad top coat and it takes for ever to dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although it&#x27;s supposed to \\&quot;dry</li>
            <li> My nails dry in five minutes after I apply this.</li>
            <li> It takes 1 minute to dry your nails and it let them shiny</li>
            <li> tro dry</li>
            <li> keeps your nails from chipping, it helps nail polish dry, and protects your nails-which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> It takes like 2 mins to dry to the touch and days in 10 mins ...</li>
            <li> plus whatever polishes I use it over it makes dry</li>
            <li> Within 5 minutes it&#x27;s dry to the touch, and in 10 minutes I can do the dishes.</li>
            <li> My nails chipped hours after they were dry.</li>
            <li> sometimes i fall asleep before the completely dry...</li>
            <li> It does dry to a glossy, \\&quot;wet\\&quot; finish.  </li>
            <li> None of that thing where it feels dry to the touch, but it&#x27;s still gooey inside</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this because she said her nails dry in 2-3 minutes and never chip.</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with a nail drying spray and my nails are dry within 5 mins.</li>
            <li> and my nails took about 2 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> If you apply it to completely dry polish you will see a noticeable difference in performance.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s either dry, or not.</li>
            <li> And once it does dry, its all cloudy.</li>
            <li> I have read that applying it over color coats that are too dry will lead to the chipping and peeling.    </li>
            <li> It can shrink too but letting your polish dry</li>
            <li> Makes polish dry</li>
            <li> My nails are completely dry within 5 mins of using it.</li>
            <li> Not just dry to the touch, but completely dry, no smudges,</li>
            <li> no chips, just dry glossy nails.  </li>
            <li> (that MIGHT have had to do with me applying it after the polish was dry, I&#x27;m not sure).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my nail were totally dry.</li>
            <li> I still try to give the one or two coats of polish time to dry</li>
            <li> and my fingernails dry faster.</li>
            <li> My nails are shiny AND DRY within minutes.  </li>
            <li> It was completely dry within three minutes, and has held up to task all week with no chipping and no peeling whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It makes my nails dry in literally 2 minutes, and after that they don&#x27;t smudge or anything.</li>
            <li> - I always manage to smudge them before they are dry.</li>
            <li> does to always dry faster than others..believe it.</li>
            <li> They were dry within 5 minutes even though i waited 10.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to sit around waiting for them to dry.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s dry but not</li>
            <li> Within 5 minutes my nails felt dry to the touch, not tacky at all.  </li>
            <li> Will continue to buy, because this is just a life saver for people like me who don&#x27;t have time to wait 3 hours till my nails completely dry.</li>
            <li> Dry to the touch within seconds</li>
            <li> before it starts to dry out</li>
            <li> and they have to be dry for the stamp to not smudge the nails) and have never had any issues with it peeling or shrinking.</li>
            <li> It will dry it in 5 minutes, after that you can bump them without having to start over.</li>
            <li> The quality of Seche Vite Dry</li>
            <li> work well over dry polish -</li>
            <li> I always end up putting away all my manicure supplies after waiting about a minute instead of waiting for my nails to dry and ALWAYS end up smearing my nail polish and putting dents in it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not 100% dry in seconds though.</li>
            <li> the bottom stuff is dry by morning</li>
            <li> I could not believe how well it works to dry</li>
            <li> My nails definitely dry faster with this topcoat.  </li>
            <li> It dry for couple mins.</li>
            <li> I have literally around 100 bottles of polish and no sprae time with 3 kids to dry my nails</li>
            <li> My nails are dry to the touch within 60 seconds with this polish.</li>
            <li> and you think it&#x27;s dry and go to grab something and ugh</li>
            <li> Polish dry in minutes.  </li>
            <li> cause I always messed them up, had no patience for it to dry.</li>
            <li> and I use a sticker on my nails I have to wait a while for it to dry</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t take forever for them to dry.</li>
            <li> Your nails dry in no time.</li>
            <li> I do like how it makes your  nails dry quicker, though.</li>
            <li> And dry meaning you can fold laundry if you wanted.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a mom like me and just don&#x27;t have that 2-3 hours to allow your nails to dry, this is your gold mine.</li>
            <li> Nails will be dry in 10 mins.</li>
            <li> And by totally dry</li>
            <li> I did have problems with it streaking the nail polish if the nail polish itself wasn&#x27;t semi dry.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this stuff and have to have at least 2 bottles around at all times. :)</li>
            <li> and i let dry</li>
            <li> However, I struggled with not bumping my nails on something as I waited for them to dry.  </li>
            <li> I also use Seche Vite Dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper, for if you go to the stores to buy just one, the cost is about eight dollars, which is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> ur nail polish is dry..</li>
            <li> This will dry your manicure in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Within 3 minutes my nails are completely dry and after 5 minutes I could bang my nails on anything</li>
            <li> I always get mushy marks and fingerprints in my nails because even though they seem dry, they never quite harden.</li>
            <li> Invariably I&#x27;d do something once I thought the polish was dry, and end up smudging it.  </li>
            <li> I put two coats of the Seche on and my nails seemed instantly dry</li>
            <li> Seche Vite Dry</li>
            <li> Dries ridiculous fast.</li>
            <li> but it doesnit take FOREVER to dry, so</li>
            <li> I can paint my nails before bed, add a coat of SV, and my nails are dry before I drift off to sleep</li>
            <li> And then when they&#x27;re mostly dry</li>
            <li> It saves a lot of time that I would be wasting sitting around waiting for my nail polish to dry.</li>
            <li> Tested it against Sally Hansen&#x27;s Dry Kwik and will use Seche Vite over that any day.</li>
            <li> Not just &amp;#34;safe to go about my day carefully&amp;#34; dry, but really dry.</li>
            <li> nails were dry in about 5 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The crackle needs a couple of minutes to, well, crack up &amp; your polish has to dry before you can use the Konad stamp thingie.</li>
            <li> Your nails dry in seconds.</li>
            <li> Like I couldnt believe that the nails were actually DRY.</li>
            <li> so that I can leave my nails to dry while sleeping.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re dry in a minute or so.</li>
            <li> Fully dry in 7 minutes.</li>
            <li> Believe the hype, your nails will dry</li>
            <li> dry time&lt;br /&gt;-Ultra</li>
            <li> I let it dry for about 20 minutes before I do</li>
            <li> I believe it helps the polish to dry a couple of minutes faster, but not immediately.</li>
            <li> I believe it helps the polish to dry a couple of minutes faster, but not immediately.</li>
            <li> and then they are dry within a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> but it is so time consuming with the dry time.</li>
            <li> This seemed to make the polish underneath dry faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to wait hours for your nails to dry.</li>
            <li> It takes about 5-10 minutes to dry to touch.</li>
            <li> I will ALWAYS use Seche Vite Dry</li>
            <li> I think it has something to do with it bond to the rest of the nail polish and maybe &#x27;shrinking&#x27; when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, \\&quot;Dry Fast\\&quot; is no exaggeration.</li>
            <li> Before this, I had that Sally Hansen insta dry stuff</li>
            <li> With this my nails are glossy and dry within 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t stay though, and once it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> dry time</li>
            <li> What used to take me 2 hours to dry now takes 10 minutes tops.</li>
            <li> Polish is dry to the touch in about 30-60 seconds and cured in about 5-10 minutes, depending on number and thickness of coats.  </li>
            <li> I am always changing my nails and this allows me to do that without having to spend 10+ minutes waiting for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li> Nails are completely dry and smudge proof in minutes.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to sit around and wait for my nails to dry</li>
            <li> I ordered one (but then impatiently bought one the next day at my local CVS drugstore when I saw it!)</li>
            <li> , I actually use it on nails that I&#x27;ve only done a few minutes before to set them</li>
            <li> but if something is sold under the same name and you get a bogus imitation, people should know.</li>
            <li> The only draw back is that after a few days the polish will peel away from the nails.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few things to remedy this such as wrapping the layers, putting an extra layer around the edge.</li>
            <li> only downside is that it can start to thicken once you&#x27;re like halfway done, so you really do need to thin it out with the Seche Restore.  </li>
            <li> This is a thick clear coat that makes my home-manis and pedis last 1 week as opposed to 2 days (even for a week on the beach!)  </li>
            <li> I may update this review later on, if it proves me wrong.</li>
            <li> I love to paint my nails but hate waiting to dry, or thinking I waited long enough to find out not quite long enough.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is the smell, but the pros far outweigh that one con.</li>
            <li> I have never had polish last for longer than a day and a half on my nails even with a good base coat and roughing them up and</li>
            <li> I fell in love with Seche base nearly a decade ago.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite top coat is made to work with the Seche Clear base coat - they create a bond with the color in between.</li>
            <li> Will not live with out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a great home manicurist and rarely make the effort because I usually mess up the polish minutes (or an hour) later.  </li>
            <li> I have recently started stamping my nails and have tried several top coats with very disappointing results.  </li>
            <li> and I woke up without even a single crease.</li>
            <li> I used to wear polish every single day -- then I had kids &amp; never had time anymore.</li>
            <li> Single.</li>
            <li> USE IT EVERY SINGLE TIME I DO MY NAILS..</li>
            <li> But....it shrinks my polish every single time.  </li>
            <li> No matter how long you wait, that black nail art penning would always streak across the white.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;Its formula allows it to penetrate through the nail lacquer to the base coat forming a single solid coating over the nail plate for a  much more durable finish which is guaranteed to not yellow...</li>
            <li> No more wearing an adult diaper while doing my nails</li>
            <li> Shine lasts for at least three days, and this is with a job that forces me to wash my hands twice as much as is normal.</li>
            <li> This has TRANSFORMED my self-done manicures from what was amateur to professional.</li>
            <li> I have read about this in some magazines and was anxious to try it, so naturally I was a bit apprehensive to buy, but now that I have I don&#x27;t know how I lived before without it</li>
            <li> My average time prior to chipping is about 2 days; Zoya polish lasted a bit longer.  </li>
            <li> That being said the problem can easily be fixed by adding a few drops of seche restore!</li>
            <li> I only had a tiny bit of trouble when I tried to put this product over really wet nail polish (don&#x27;t do that.)  </li>
            <li> But the first time it happens, it can be frustrating.</li>
            <li> It is totally worth it though, Seche Restore, will thin any of your other polishes as well.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> I would like to try this with a better base coat than what I am currently using and that may make the manicure last even longer.</li>
            <li> It does dry very fast but the smell of this top coat is horrible.</li>
            <li> So I picked up a bottle of seche vite and figured what do I have to loose??</li>
            <li> Amazingly, it actually does dry in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Literally takes less than a minute to dry and makes my polish last for about 9 days!</li>
            <li> Seriously this is the only clear coat you should ever use.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s down to personal preference.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only down side.  </li>
            <li> this is hands down, pun totally intended!</li>
            <li> What took me so long to find you, Seche Vite?!?!?  </li>
            <li> You still have to be careful not to bump your nails hard and cause a dent in the polish for a few minutes, but this absolutely stops the smearing and dries instantly!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using too much or too little, but</li>
            <li> Either the shine doesn&#x27;t last past one hand-washing or the chips start immediately, or it takes ten years to dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little rougher on my nails though so it doesn&#x27;t last as long for me as some people have said it does for theirs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had it shrink on me, which seems to be a major complaint, but I keep my nails very short, so that might have something to do with</li>
            <li> Also very few bubbles (another one of my frequent issues).</li>
            <li> I have long, natural nails that I hardly ever paint because of chipping.  </li>
            <li> nail polish&#x27;s stereotypical paint thinner smell is due partially to this chemical, which is why three free polishes don&#x27;t smell as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having lots of fun with different polish colors, and combined with the Seche Base Ridge Filling Base Coat, I put 2 coats of OPI and layer this Seche Vite fast dry top coat immediately, and I&#x27;m telling you my nails are DRY to the touch like 2 minutes later.  </li>
            <li> It does get thick after a while so you&#x27;ll have to get a new one</li>
            <li> i can now paint my nails and not wait around for them to dry!</li>
            <li> but my nails were completely dry in a min or two!</li>
            <li> Cuts dry time to around 15 minutes !</li>
            <li> but they were completely dry!</li>
            <li> Nails are completely dry in minutes!</li>
            <li> I can have dry nails in 1/2 the time!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dry!</li>
            <li> I can do my nails and have them completely dry in minutes!</li>
            <li> Just brush over polish and within seconds you are dry!</li>
            <li> My nails were dry to the touch in just 2 minutes!</li>
            <li> Makes my mani dry time a snap!</li>
            <li> Dry nails in a minute or so!</li>
            <li> Nails dry in 20 min!</li>
            <li> This stuff had my nails dry within 5 mintues!</li>
            <li> The only Con is that it gets goopey half way through the bottle.</li>
            <li> but this topcoat is no better than 99 cents Wet and Wild topcoat.</li>
            <li> I applied it when my nails were still wet from the polish and within 30 seconds - bone dry.</li>
            <li> This dries to an indestructible hardness in about 2 minutes, and will not be ruined 5 minutes later when you have to hand wash dishes for half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both nail dryers have a tiny bit of shrinkage, Seche Vite has less</li>
            <li> Om not pregnant, but I would like to be in the future.</li>
            <li> I got 2 bottles of this as it was half the price on line that is in the stores for the same sized bottle.  </li>
            <li> Usually two days later I will apply a second coat to extend the life of my mani.  </li>
            <li> I used to always mess up my nails due to not waiting long enough for the nails to dry.</li>
            <li> I used it over wet and dry polish, I prefer using over dry because if you apply it over wet polish (which is the correct way to use it I think)</li>
            <li> Makes wet nails dry in seconds.</li>
            <li> so they weren&#x27;t exactly wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first about this product, but I would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> If I get a manicure/pedicure I put this on over it as soon as I get home and can make it last for about 3 and a half weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating this only 2 starts because I am disappointed in this top coat.</li>
            <li> I order from Amazon to pay half the price of my local Duane Reade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was only half bottle used</li>
            <li> however I don&#x27;t see an advantage to painting wet polish over dry polish.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t tend to repair my polish because I&#x27;m fickle and get bored with color quickly, this wasn&#x27;t a problem for me.</li>
            <li> And after a few uses the polish becomes pretty thick.</li>
            <li> This frequent peeling makes subsequent chips large and very difficult to repair.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that over time it begins to get hard to spread over my nails because of how thick it is and how quick it dries.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and is extremely shiny.</li>
            <li> Came in weird packaging but wasn&#x27;t damaged or anything, and came very fast!</li>
            <li> Still hate the smell, but LOVE this stuff!   </li>
            <li> For one, while it dried to the touch in mere moments, it was still extremely easy to smudge it and push the polish around.</li>
            <li> My nails will be thoroughly dry only a few minutes after I apply it.</li>
            <li> To the touch in a just a few minutes, completely after less than an hour.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very glossy and thick, so any imperfections in on your color coat are smoothed out and hidden.</li>
            <li> I swear, five minutes after I put 3 or 4 coats of polish and this miracle, I can do laundry without a single smudge or smear!</li>
            <li> No more messed up home manicures because I didn&#x27;t wait long enough for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy how quick it dries!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll always come back to amazon to purchase; its a little price in the beauty supply.</li>
            <li> , if there is ANY SMELL AT ALL treat your nails as if they belong to little birds in a tiny endangered nest owned by Royalty from somewhere that</li>
            <li> and I only put a little bit on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seche Restore is specifically formulated to replace only those ingredients that have evaporated, restoring the once thick mess back to its former glory.    </li>
            <li> It dries amazingly fast and has a very thick consistency (not watery).</li>
            <li> I then checked my other nails and they were dry</li>
            <li> My nails are dry before I finish painting my other hand.</li>
            <li> Also, I read other reviews that people found applying this polish to nails that had been dry for some time made the polish flake off.  </li>
            <li> It drys hard, with a professional high-gloss look.  </li>
            <li> I recently took my acrylics off and my nails were tissue paper thin and the Seche Vite really helped to make my nails just a little bit stronger.</li>
            <li> You just apply your final coat of color, let it dry a few minutes, then apply Seche Vite just like any other topcoat.</li>
            <li> Ok, so what if I just got a bad batch of it?  </li>
            <li> Because so many friends recommended it, I&#x27;m prone to think that I got a bad bottle of the polish.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s some shrinkage, as there will be with any fast-drying top coat, but it isn&#x27;t as bad as with Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> I love the shine it gives, not going to lie, too bad it peels within minutes of putting it on my nails....</li>
            <li> at least the company has clearly stated warnings on packaging.</li>
            <li> What a huge fail and waste of money.</li>
            <li> Smooths out inconsistencies.</li>
            <li> You do still have to be careful for a bit-</li>
            <li> /&gt;After doing my nails a few times I noticed a lot of shrinkage and chipping the very next day after painting them.</li>
            <li> Just be careful with that.</li>
            <li> Makes my nails harder to break as well.</li>
            <li> The Sally Hansen and Essie I returned to the store as they cannot be applied to wet polish without messing up a manicure.   </li>
            <li> Seche Vite was the only one I tried that *completely* dried in minutes.   </li>
            <li> Remember to put it over WET nail polish.</li>
            <li> I did not even have to be careful, I took out the garbage ect.  </li>
            <li> You will notice as this happens that when you apply it onto your wet polish the polish will drag, wrinkle, and look streaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You MUST apply Seche Vite to wet polish.</li>
            <li> I told her she had to put in on while her nails were still a bit wet.</li>
            <li> It actually layers off my nail a few days after putting it on.</li>
            <li> I decided to finally use this product with a base coat, followed by 2 coats of polish and the Seche Vite on top of the 2 coats of WET polish.</li>
            <li> Several reviews say they&#x27;ve had chipping problems, but I haven&#x27;t had that problem yet, even over a few days.  </li>
            <li> This turned my Tiffany Blue nail-polish GREEN.</li>
            <li> Be careful</li>
            <li> your polish under it isn&#x27;t TOO wet though.</li>
            <li> It lated about as long as an average manicure should.  </li>
            <li> I hear a lot of people say to put Seche over wet nails, but for me that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Still have chipped edges after a few days but that&#x27;s almost inevitable.</li>
            <li> My iteam came sooner then expected.</li>
            <li> so when the bottle gets low, you won&#x27;t waste any.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;I put it on while my mani is wet, but have also used days after the fact.</li>
            <li> It dries in a few heartbeats and is totally smudge/budge proof after it cures.</li>
            <li> So, I would be careful breathing it in.</li>
            <li> I put 2 coats on because my nails are thin and my nails are so much stronger.</li>
            <li> You apply it when the nail polish is still wet, and then it dries it all.</li>
            <li> when the polish is still too wet-</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions though, needs to be put on while polish is still wet to avoid shrinkage.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this is not really Seche Vite?</li>
            <li> It dries quicker and harder; no lines or sheet marks.</li>
            <li> I have been polishing my nails (and actually caring how it looks) for a few months now</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shrinks nail polish back from the tips of your nails.&lt;br /&gt;Peels off after a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your nails will feel silky, be stronger, and will absolutely not chip...</li>
            <li> Seche Vite flows over the wet nail polish without dragging or streaking the underlying</li>
            <li> the still look wet</li>
            <li> my manicure lasted for 9 hours before several nails were missing polish.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and applied over deep green Essie polish and no kidding....</li>
            <li> I went up to 2 weeks with minimal chips.</li>
            <li> I never really saw a point in topcoats until I tried my sister&#x27;s Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> It dries to the touch in a few minutes and will help you polish last</li>
            <li> it also makes your nails harder when it is on.</li>
            <li> I painted my nails before I went to bed, they dried instantly and did not smudge.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> It got here faster than i expected.</li>
            <li> the $1 Wet n&#x27;</li>
            <li> IF I&#x27;M IN A HURRY... &amp; MY NAILS ARE STILL WET..</li>
            <li> Came in a lot quicker than expected</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a scam to me that you have to buy the thinner to fix it after only a few months of use.  </li>
            <li> When I started using an OPI base coat, 2 coats of quality OPI or China Glaze nail polish, and a coat of Seche Vite on top, my manicure would last roughly 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so can you please... pour me a drink my nails are wet?</li>
            <li> , just a few days later, it started to peel/flake off.  </li>
            <li> Put it on over wet polish</li>
            <li> You apply it over your color while it is still wet, and it seeps through all layers and hardens within minutes.</li>
            <li> However, it did arrive on time if not sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re careful and don&#x27;t get the edges of your nails caught on anything it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s not very flexible.</li>
            <li> Maybe those people aren&#x27;t using it correctly, as the directions say to apply while polish is still wet.  </li>
            <li> You put it on your nails when they are still wet, it dries in a couple minutes to rock hard.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I´ve tried to used last week and it was heavy</li>
            <li> Be careful - this product is not compatible with every nail polish and may result in shrinkage or warping.</li>
            <li> I had a box of polishes going to waste because I dreaded the drying time and the inevitable dents and dings in my half-dry manicure.</li>
            <li> If I apply several heavy coats of Seche Vite it seems to &amp;#34;protect&amp;#34; my polish and keep it from chipping.</li>
            <li> it is thicker than I expected, but that doesn&#x27;t interfere with the way it works.</li>
            <li> I figured out there&#x27;s a trick to applying it to wet polish.</li>
            <li> The directions say you have to apply it to wet nail polish.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen gives you the shiny mirror-like look you want, smooths out nail ridges, and doesn&#x27;t drag polish designs.</li>
            <li> People should not really use this product...</li>
            <li> The smell really isn&#x27;t any worse than nail polish remover smell</li>
            <li> So just be careful when traveling with it.</li>
            <li> However, the harsh smell will definitely take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> It also shrinks the polish on my nail if i apply it after it has already dried, like if i wanted to touch it up mid week or something.</li>
            <li> I bought this and followed recommendations to paint over still wet nails.</li>
            <li> I also got the nail polish shipped to me sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I even double coated and used a base coat before using this as the top coat.</li>
            <li> Love that it drys fast but smell is horrible.</li>
            <li> It kind of flaked away from nail polish leaving a weird matte finish behind after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Yes, it dries fast, but it is so thick and goopy that if you bang a nail at the wrong angle the whole nail of polish literally rips off.</li>
            <li> Base coat with Top Nail make my manicure last longer.</li>
            <li> i used to hate to do my own nails.  </li>
            <li> I always used to smudge my wet nails, but with this they dry in a minute or less and even I can&#x27;t mess them up in that short a period.  </li>
            <li> As you get down to the second half of the bottle, the product starts to thicken considerably which makes it hard to spread onto your nails.</li>
            <li> Try to finish the nail off in 3 strokes, one down the middle, and one down either side.</li>
            <li> As a mom to two little ones, I need polish to cure quickly (actually harden, not just surface dry!!!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that the peeling problem is due to letting the base color dry for too long, and yet the shrinkage is supposedly cause by putting the top coat on a color that is still too wet.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally guilty of always wanting to paint my nails right before bed</li>
            <li> The easiest way is to unroll a cotton ball, then tear it in half down the middle.</li>
            <li> (I usually wait about 15 min just to make sure, especially since I go a little crazy with the layers.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend re applying to the tips everyday or every other day to make it last for weeks. .</li>
            <li> Completely dry in less than a few minutes and when paired with quality nail polish, a manicure can last a week without chipping!</li>
            <li> My manicure lasted half as long as it would have if i hadn&#x27;t used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the person who goes to get their nails done and walks out only to mess them up immediately!</li>
            <li> only real complaint is that sometimes one of my nails will chip off in one big chunk, leaving me with a naked nail.</li>
            <li> First, you MUST apply this gently, while your base color is still wet.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why people rave so much about this product, i have tried it and it is absolutely terrible, it creates a film on the surface of the nail , which starts to peel off almost immediately, doesn&#x27;t even last 2 full days,</li>
            <li> I applied two coats of color, let them dry for a few minutes, and then applied a single layer of seche vite.</li>
            <li> before it starts to get thick (but even when it&#x27;s thick, the drying rate is still very fast).</li>
            <li> Mine are usually dry in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> but it took half an hour to  dry on my hands</li>
            <li> You still have to wait before putting away laundry or things that would typically damage partially dry nails.</li>
            <li> Nails are glossy and dry in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Are not really quick dry at all.</li>
            <li> I wish it didn&#x27;t dry out half way</li>
            <li> I let them dry for 2 and a half hours before going to work.</li>
            <li> I would rather let my polish dry to avoid accidentally smearing the design, and you have less shrinkage.</li>
            <li> I was using Sally Hansen&#x27;s Xtreme polish which is tacky dry in less than 30 seconds</li>
            <li> And you can apply while the color is still a little wet and it&#x27;ll make it all dry faster.</li>
            <li> My polish didn&#x27;t shrink and I have a total hard dry.</li>
            <li> Like I said in my last rating of the CND sticky base coat, I have other, way less expensive fast dry top coats, that work just as well,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I started to notice that it starts to flake very fast.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that after about 3-4 months, it becomes a bit thick and slightly more difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I always mess up my nails waiting for it to dry.</li>
            <li> I hate doing my own nails because of the time it takes them to DRY!!!!</li>
            <li> this stuff is so bionic it will stand up to a generic watered down remover!!  </li>
            <li> I usually just buy a new one or a refill at that time, and I would totally recommend Seche Vite to EVERY nail polish fanatic!</li>
            <li> I usually dont like to paint my nails during the week after work because of how long nail polish takes to dry.</li>
            <li> I usually have to keep my hands where I can see them until my nails completely dry (a long time), until this.</li>
            <li> The process destroyed my nails after a few weeks and it was super expensive.</li>
            <li> After struggling with bubbles and time constraints waiting for other products</li>
            <li> /&gt;(for the other reviewers who mentioned it</li>
            <li> I get asked almost every other day if I&#x27;m sporting gels.</li>
            <li> It has a warning, \\&quot; this product containers a chemical known to the states of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> Now, one thing I MUST point out is that, over time, this product will begin to thicken due to evaporation.</li>
            <li> but after reading some of the other review I do not think that is the case.  </li>
            <li> By day 2-3, your nails appear to be over due for a manicure.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Came sooner than expected as well!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a pretty mediocre product.</li>
            <li> Faster than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> It did not peel off in one sheet as other said.  </li>
            <li> If you gob on a ton of nail polish and a ton of the top coat it will take longer to set and you might goof them up and be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Other times I&#x27;ve used it I&#x27;ve gotten some shrinkage</li>
            <li> Used it before and it worked extremely well.  </li>
            <li> other people stated.</li>
            <li> That being said, I have been through countless other top coats that claim to never chip and have found myself in the realms of disappointment when they indeed chipped or, worse, peeled.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item through Amazon on two to three separate occasions using this account or one of my other ones.</li>
            <li> contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I also woke up in the middle of the night with a headache; not sure if the polish had anything to do with it?</li>
            <li> I reapply every other day to maintain shine.</li>
            <li> TO CAUSE BIRTH DEFECTS OR OTHER REPRODUCTIVE HARM please do not buy this</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on other reviews and I am not disapointed.  </li>
            <li> I have small hands, tiny nails and an obsession with nail art.</li>
            <li> Its extremely toxic though it works.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to purchase this at first</li>
            <li> Ive only used this stuff for the past year.</li>
            <li> With any other topcoat, my nails will at least last a few days, and my toes will last 3-4 weeks without any chips, but with this topcoat, it is chipped within a day.</li>
            <li> ...cause in my experience of using other brands..</li>
            <li> Overalls, it&#x27;s basic, not much better than anything else I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.</li>
            <li> Continued use of a product containing butyl acetate may cause skin to crack and become dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s warning label on the box:&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: \\&quot;This product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive</li>
            <li> The one small issue is it does contain big 3.</li>
            <li> I have washed dishes and did other chores without gloves</li>
            <li> No matter what other brands or kinds</li>
            <li> If you do housework ie dishes laundry and other things</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after reading other reviews.....</li>
            <li> I am a mom to boys and a small dog with hands that are constantly cleaning, sweeping, wiping etc...and no polish came off.  </li>
            <li> I did not notice any chipping, peeling, shrinking, or anything other than quick-drying CRAZYSHINE on the pinky nail, while my other nails continued degrading as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is an extremely smelly topcoat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be careful to use it in a well ventilated area!</li>
            <li> It flakes off quicker than I expected and doesn&#x27;t stay on my nails as I would have hoped!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try reapplying it every other day.</li>
            <li> The nail polish fell off the next day as usual.</li>
            <li> I think I saw it in Ulta the other day for upwards of $10.</li>
            <li> Comes off just like any other polish.  </li>
            <li> Usually my nails will start chipping the same day I apply polish</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing is that it bonds with all the other nail polish you have</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, not only CAN you apply it directly onto wet nail polish immediately after application, but I&#x27;ve heard that you SHOULD do so to avoid weird cracking and chipping.</li>
            <li> I usually do gel polish, but I like to use regular now and again.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold up against chips and scratches quite as well as other people say, but it does still help.</li>
            <li> NO MORE SHEET MARKS on your nails the next morning.  </li>
            <li> I keep trying other products</li>
            <li> I ordered it on Amazon, but due to holiday mail traffic it is scheduled for delivery in a week.  </li>
            <li> well, this one works but would buy the other brand over this one.</li>
            <li> However, I was sort of disappointed by the top coat.</li>
            <li> it cuts the amount of time needed to dry down to minimal!!</li>
            <li> It tends to dry out in the bottle a little</li>
            <li> I use 2 coats of polish and put the Seche Vite on immediatly, no need to wait for polish to dry a little.</li>
            <li> I was reduced to wearing clear or light polish on my fingernails so those annoying chips and dings would be less noticeable until I had time to do a proper manicure or at least slap some polish on the tips.  </li>
            <li> (clerical lots of typing) and at home I cook, clean, wash dishes all without using gloves... needless to say my hands go through a lot and in the past whenever I&#x27;ve worn polish</li>
            <li> i can paint my nails before bed and in a minute they are dry - not tacky but dry - no more sheet marks on my nails.</li>
            <li> Definitely a game changer when you&#x27;re in a time crunch or are impatient with a normal dry time.</li>
            <li> I still have to be very careful for an hour or two to not bump my nails into anything.</li>
            <li> I was still very careful with my fingers for a bit afterwards, but within a couple of minutes</li>
            <li> So I was applying it on very wet polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impatient and this definitely helped keep my nails!!!</li>
            <li> After using Seche Vite over my wet nail polish they were dry to the touch in about a minute and fully dry and hard at around 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Nails dry in a just few minutes.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re someone who, like me, tends to smudge your nail polish or be impatient waiting for it to dry - this is your product.  </li>
            <li> My manicure lasts for about 5 days, and that&#x27;s with being active, doing dishes, etc.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who uses neons knows that they can require a few coats to get a uniform color, which is a pain to let dry.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes, my manicure is completely dry</li>
            <li> listened to previous reviews about applying it while previous layers aren&#x27;t completely dry.</li>
            <li> I can paint my nails, let dry for a few minutes</li>
            <li> Through previous habits (having only bought the base/top combo forever before), I applied this as a base coat... and it sheds the entire nail polish job right off.  </li>
            <li> Within 15 minutes (sometimes less!) of painting my nails, it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> Has my nails dry in less than 10 minutes!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Con:  thick, gets stringy after awhile, not really long lasting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> other people on other Web sites have complained of the same problems.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a lot longer than any other top coat I&#x27;ve tried and if it does come off before I remove it with polish remover, it comes off the nail all in one peice, which I appreciate because I HATE partially chipped off polish!</li>
            <li> do my nails at home regularly and have a bad habit  of trying to chores right after I do my nails.</li>
            <li> Dry to the touch in a minute or less, and hard enough to resist damage in less than 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> My usual product was ORLY&#x27;s sec n&#x27; dry</li>
            <li> I bought this because of a recommendation from a friend after I had complained about how long my nail polish took to dry.</li>
            <li> I love the way my nails look when I paint them, but I am so impatient and hate waiting for them to dry.  </li>
            <li> And how irritating is it to do your polish and have to wait that long, long time for it to dry</li>
            <li> and they would never dry fast enough which would leave them looking like crap.</li>
            <li> I know some people out there hate this top coat due to shrinkage and drying out in the bottle</li>
            <li> I did some research and realized it was due to me using neither top or base coats.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t receive a fake bottle, though I&#x27;ve never used this polish before I&#x27;m fairly certain this is the brand name since it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some of the main complaints have been that this polish is too thick or becomes too thick when you get closer to the end of its use, along with what is used to make this polish.</li>
            <li> It dries to a glossy, hard coat and is definitely going to be a go-to product for me.</li>
            <li> I saw a little to no difference and my nail polish started chipping off 2 days after wearing Seche Vite as a top coat :(.</li>
            <li> It is hard for me to find in the store and especially at this price.</li>
            <li> It form such a hard shiny coat on your nails.</li>
            <li> It smells a little weird at first</li>
            <li> My nails (which are generally weak and break easily) are honestly as hard as fake nails, but for a tiny fraction of the cost and time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what took me so long to decide on buying this.</li>
            <li> but lately I have been double guessing myself.</li>
            <li> Because of this, when I used Out the Door 50% of the times I woke up the next day with fabric prints in at least one of my nails.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it chips in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Not worth the effort or money</li>
            <li> , my only complaint is once you get close to the end of the bottle</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the quality is much lower.</li>
            <li> Not worth of money buying it.</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again, not worth the money for the quality.</li>
            <li> Mine last at least a week without chipping, and when I start to see it wear off around the edged</li>
            <li> MY ONLY COMPLAINT and the reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is...</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s average shipping speed in the U.S.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it will smear your matte polishes .</li>
            <li> Usually, with a few touchups of topcoat along the way, I can get it to last 10 days.  </li>
            <li> It smells really weird and it smells like it is very inflammable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth buying.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> , I just feel this product is not worth it.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that it tends to get thick and goopy about halfway through the bottle, but I recently discovered Seche Restore, which is a thinner specifically made for Seche Vite as regular polish thinner doesn&#x27;t work (I know, I&#x27;ve tried).  </li>
            <li> I used this top coat with the Seche Vite base coat (and colored polish in between).  </li>
            <li> Did my nails on Saturday -- base, 2 coats of color, Seche top -- &amp;</li>
            <li> I expect this will get thick halfway through, just like with SH, but I bought the Restore drops, which will bring this back to life.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty noticeable ridges in my nails, but the base coat completely eliminated them under polish.</li>
            <li> The formula is so thick that when you use multiple coats during the week it becomes noticeable on your nails.</li>
            <li> I have since switched to Out the Door top coat with Essie protein base coat.</li>
            <li> when it dries, you can hold your nail up to your face, sideways, and actually see  how thick the polish is.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I NEVER have this problem when combining OPI and both the Seche Base and Seche Vite top coat.  </li>
            <li> I like to use it as a base coat and top coat.</li>
            <li> I was a slave to the OPI base and top coats for years.</li>
            <li> It makes my nail polish extra shiny and provides a thick coat</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather thick and gives dimension similar to a gel manicure.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does get thick over time, but you have to buy the Seche Vite thinner to bring it back to life.  </li>
            <li> I use this top coat with the gelous base coat.</li>
            <li> I was sent the base coat and not the top coat</li>
            <li> Not only that, but it will give your nails a thick, glossy finish.</li>
            <li> i use gelous base coat and this top coat with every manicure.</li>
            <li> Hope it&#x27;s not because of this top coat because I would hate to have to stop using this.</li>
            <li> I even put it to the test by putting on two coats of China Glaze polish and a thick coat of the Seche Vite last night about 40 mins before bed and woke up this morning without sheet marks!</li>
            <li> You want to apply  thin coats with as few as possible swipes of the brush as possible.  </li>
            <li> , I use a coat of this on top of the base coat, then I put my color , then I use this as my topcoat/</li>
            <li> I like using this polish on top of my base coat.</li>
            <li> I like using this polish on top of my base coat.</li>
            <li> I have two bottles and if it gets too thick I add restore nail polish by the same company !!!!</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ll be bringing both base and top coats with me to get pedicures.</li>
            <li> was in dire need to find a top and base that could help my polish from chipping, Seche Vite (top) and Salon Sciences (base)</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product stating it &amp;#34;dries instantly, even thick polish&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I paint my 2 coats of color, wait for about a minute after second coat &amp; apply a thick bead of Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with this product.  </li>
            <li> if you use it as top and base coat, it doesn&#x27;t work either, it peels off  after just a day.</li>
            <li> i have never had this happen and wonder if they used a base coat before color and top coat.  </li>
            <li> i use seche base coat also and love it.</li>
            <li> This polish (when worn alone, as a base, or as a top coat) made my nails so brittle...</li>
            <li> The only down side is the tip shrinkage if the coat is to thick..</li>
            <li> It does dry quickly to a hard finish, but it wasn&#x27;t as shiny as I expected.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers suggested, I put Seche Vite on while my nails were still wet, and I also tried putting it on when they dried a little.</li>
            <li> Being a parent means you have very little time to sit around and wait for polish to dry.</li>
            <li> BIGGEST COMPLAINT about this product is that you only get to use about half of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This top coat (and its accompanying base coat) checked every item off my list for half the price of some of the top/base coats I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> I used to love painting my nails but always hated waiting for them to dry.</li>
            <li> A friend warned me that people like to water down Seche Vite and re-sell it.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t plan on repelling down a mountain too soon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does smell awful, but dries super fast and smell dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But the down side is</li>
            <li> This has cut down my nail painting and drying time from over an hour to about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> The down side is you can get it at the Dollar Tree for a buck.  </li>
            <li> It cuts down drying time, and leaves a glossy finish.</li>
            <li> hands down.</li>
            <li> but when I do I hope it doesn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> Even so, I broke it down into a pros and cons</li>
            <li> (so if you were to push down on your nail after you put on Seche Vite, not polish would come off, but there would be a dent).</li>
            <li> By the time you look down at your fingertips; you have to start from square one... again.  </li>
            <li> Before this my nail polish would stay on for weeks, now it&#x27;s down toonly 5 days or so.</li>
            <li> Cuts down manicure time by a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get to 2/3 down, and it&#x27;s un-usable</li>
            <li> Probably my disappointment is due to the fact that I expected so much from it.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other topcoat again!</li>
            <li> not sure why it took me so long to buy!</li>
            <li> I will not use any other brand of topcoat ever again!</li>
            <li> (I mean it will LAST until you TAKE IT OFF, believe me!)</li>
            <li> I mean I could have literally glued it back to my nail.  </li>
            <li> The other reviewers weren&#x27;t kidding!  </li>
            <li> I am paring this with the cnd stickey basecoat and its unbelievable how long my polish lasts now!</li>
            <li> With the Drip Dry my nails would dry to the touch in less than a minute, but they didn&#x27;t get really hard for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> No more waiting around for nail polish to dry.  </li>
            <li> But...what&#x27;s the point in shiny nails when they&#x27;re a mess the next day (or at least one or two nails).  </li>
            <li> I figured it would help them dry quicker than usual</li>
            <li> Mine are usually to the point, as the things being REVIEWED.&lt;br /&gt; Works as advertised..quicker dry than the Sally Hanson..which is something.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I usually do this before bed and let it dry over night.</li>
            <li> It makes my sloppy color job look professional and sleek.</li>
            <li> This is the bomb.com no more having to wait for ages for my nails to dry, this does the job in seconds</li>
            <li> I usually wait to apply this once whatever polish I have is either dry or a bit tacky.</li>
            <li> I run a small farm with organic garden and free-range chickens, so I don&#x27;t have time to sit around waiting for polish to dry.</li>
            <li> I usually paint my nails dry them in front of my fan.</li>
            <li> No more nicks, dings, or waiting forever for polish to dry.</li>
            <li> The strokes can be seen once it&#x27;s dry and that&#x27;s because the brush is way too small.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in how easily it chipped</li>
            <li> No more waiting for my nails to dry and</li>
            <li> I used this product in conjunction with American Classic Gelous Nail Gel Base Coat Nail Polish and it made my nail color last up to seven days with no chipping or peeling.</li>
            <li> Also, as you get down to the lower half of the bottle, it becomes thicker - it’s still usable</li>
            <li> I have been using other products and my nail polish will peel off and chip after just a few hours of painting them.</li>
            <li> I paid a little more for it than the drugstore brand that I hate but use anyway.</li>
            <li> They had equal shine, but the Seche Vite chipped so much worse than the other polish, AND the other polish was on my dominant hand.  </li>
            <li> Within a few minutes I glided my finger carefully over my nail expecting a little give</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish the brush was a little longer.</li>
            <li> a few other brands then bought this after I read some reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little thicker than most polish so get a bead of it on the tip of the brush, dot it by the base of your nail and work it up.</li>
            <li> Only issue is the consistency getting a little thick after being opened for longer than a month.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is after a while it gets a little thick...</li>
            <li> I got impatient and put the Seche Vite topcoat on it while it was still a little wet.  </li>
            <li> Literally makes polish dry to the touch in seconds!!!!  </li>
            <li> But I am very impatient and I always end up with smudged polish because I can&#x27;t wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> Usually I always mess up my nails while waiting for them to dry.</li>
            <li> in the past, if i did them myself, i would always mess them up before they got a chance to dry.</li>
            <li> Yes, it was closed very tightly.</li>
            <li> a gel manicure like the ones at the salons, but half the cost?&lt;br /&gt;Want</li>
            <li> a LOT sooner using this topcoat then when using my previous stuff.</li>
            <li> It made my zoya polish chip less than 24 hours after application.</li>
            <li> I come from the salon slightly mushy, add the Seche Vite</li>
            <li> As someone who was previously spoiled by getting gel manicures at the salon, I never had to worry about chipping or drying my nails.</li>
            <li> Out the Door preserves a manicure slightly longer than Seche Vite, but there is a problem with drying time.</li>
            <li> But for the love of Mike, don&#x27;t waste your money on the Seche Vite base coat.</li>
            <li> I have gotten half way through the bottle and it is now too gloppy to use.</li>
            <li> There is also a slight chemically smell to the product</li>
            <li> , I agree, that was a bit odd</li>
            <li> It dries to the touch in less than two minutes.  </li>
            <li> I can do my nails half an hour before bed now.</li>
            <li> My nails did not chip easliy and lasted about a week and a half without having to re-apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m washing less dishes too</li>
            <li> a day sometime in less then an hour.  </li>
            <li> i have always seen this in stores but they have been $10-$15 dollars so finding it online for less than $5 was a steal</li>
            <li> I put it on a week and a half ago and still no chips</li>
            <li> ...I wish they could remake it with less harmful</li>
            <li> I picked up a bottle on Amazon for half that price.  </li>
            <li> but i could care less about that.</li>
            <li> Was peeling off in less than one day</li>
            <li> Dries nails in 15 min or less.</li>
            <li> I tried it by itself on my finger nails and the tops of my nails were exposed in less then a day.</li>
            <li> It costs less then nail color.</li>
            <li> I also used it in between layers of polishes, like when I do a half moon mani</li>
            <li> However, once it is about half gone, you might as well just throw it out.</li>
            <li> Less than 24 hours after painting, and my nails already start chipping and peeling.</li>
            <li> No more sitting around 20+ mins for my nails to dry!</li>
            <li> A manicure typically lasts me about 4 days before looking haggard, this stuff keeps my nails pristine for about 8 days.  </li>
            <li> I needed two coats on slightly shimmery polish, because the shimmer particles were a bit bumpy I guess.</li>
            <li> I bought the thinner as well since the bottom half of the bottle does get clumpy.</li>
            <li> In less than 12 hours (this was over night)</li>
            <li> There is no way it will last through a few applications without being so thick it will not even brush on.</li>
            <li> so I typically get a lot of tip wear and then the dreaded chip-n-peel.</li>
            <li> Then again, I typically spend less than $5 per nail polish</li>
            <li> Plus both of those choices will make much less of a dent in your wallet.</li>
            <li> I had to throw away half of a bottle.</li>
            <li> I always end up throwing half the bottle away.</li>
            <li> the within 2 minutes or less.</li>
            <li> less than 12 hours - also chipped in addition to peeling off in one piece    </li>
            <li> Slight chemical smell but nothing too offensive, and it dries almost instantaneously.</li>
            <li> Then slight chipping on others.</li>
            <li> Nails are not quick to chip.</li>
            <li> Some shrinkage, but that&#x27;s typical of a quick-dry.</li>
            <li> a product that is used typically as a solvent and can dissolve things like paint, paint thinners, rubber, printing ink, etc.</li>
            <li> just took polish remover to the polish i applied the day it arrived, which was a week and a half ago.</li>
            <li> My polish chipped off In less than 2 days .</li>
            <li> Dries in no time - literally less than 5 minutes - and the shine is off the charts.</li>
            <li> You can return to doing whatever after less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d rather pay less</li>
            <li> It is half the price by going through Amazon.</li>
            <li> when you get to Half the bottle it starts to get stickey tacky.</li>
            <li> this make applying easier and less wasteful.</li>
            <li> About half the price than you will pay in a salon too.</li>
            <li> As a result, tip wear occurs within about half a day, chips occur within less than 24 hours, and polish pulls up from the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;Seche shrinkage\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Contributes to polish chipping in less than 24 hours</li>
            <li> The polish stays on longer and my nails are well protected from the color (I use black nail polish).</li>
            <li> in less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> You can see a little flaking on the side of my middle and index fingers, and the color (Essie Mojito Madness) is a little dull, but still looks</li>
            <li> But if you want that acrylic look without messing up your nails with glue and your really active or even just an everyday girl who doesn&#x27;t mind giving herself a mani every week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cashier at a gas station, constantly washing my hands, handling money in the \\&quot;till\\&quot; (very hard on nails) and scrubbing stuff with scrubby pads, and other than the typical tip wear, I have no complaints.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who polishes their own nails a lot knows how frustrating it is to take the time to do their nails and then have it mess up because the topcoat is bad.</li>
            <li> No more smudges &amp; mess ups while waiting for your nails to dry!</li>
            <li> last thing to be wary of is that when you put this stuff on it doesn&#x27;t always look even and the bottle can dry out faster than other products.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been a struggle because I always mess them up while they&#x27;re drying</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t mess it up.</li>
            <li> Leaves your nails a mess and goopy.  </li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t mess up my manicure trying to go to the bathroom), and expect a 7-10 day manicure with no chipping.</li>
            <li> It leaves yucky whiteness around the edges of my polish and completely ruins my manis after a few days.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t mess them</li>
            <li> I even can take a shower a minute after applying and that don&#x27;t mess up.</li>
            <li> And I ALWAYS seem to mess them up.</li>
            <li> If your like me you mess up your nails</li>
            <li> I bought this item based on all of the fabulous reviews, but I am so disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> Still chipped the next day and other customers claims were false.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s thick, it tends to drag on very wet polish.  </li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on other stuff!</li>
            <li> My nails are hard, dry, and don&#x27;t chip with this stuff on.</li>
            <li> My nails are hard, dry, and don&#x27;t chip with this stuff on.</li>
            <li> I let it dry for about 15 minutes and then tapped my thumbnail hard with the tip of another nail.</li>
            <li> Rock hard dry.  </li>
            <li> I learned that the hard way with some CND Air Dry.</li>
            <li> The Seche Vite causes my nail polish to shrink at the bottom, the sides, AND the tips, making my carefully applied polish look sloppy and uneven and gross.</li>
            <li> reviewer mentioned a heavy smell, but it doesn&#x27;t smell any stronger than any other nail polish (and it&#x27;s certainly not as strong as the smell of a nail salon.)</li>
            <li> If you impale a nail on something hard and metallic after painting it or something it still can leave some imprint, and showering or having your nails in hot water soon after will soften the polish and leave you vulnerable to dents and nicks.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a nail stamping kit, stamping plates, dotting tools, rhinestones, nail glue, 500 fake nails, and a BUNCH of new nail polish.  </li>
            <li> or too late, when the polish is too dry.</li>
            <li> I used to have to wait at least 1 hour for my polish to dry.  </li>
            <li> It makes my polish dry in a quarter of the time, makes your polish look like gel (thick and shiny), and keeps my polish from chipping.</li>
            <li> Tried a few times but my nails chipped in less than 24 hours</li>
            <li> I usually skipped it because the brush would drag through the still-wet color polish, making it look uneven</li>
            <li> The only thing that&#x27;s weird about it is that sometimes my entire nail of polish peels off in one big piece, but that&#x27;s after a few days of wear and usually worse when I pick at them.</li>
            <li> This has literally cut the time it takes to do my nails at least in half, because almost as soon as you put it on it is completely dry!</li>
            <li> It takes about 5 minutes to dry fully on two thick layers of nail polish.</li>
            <li> I took off one star just because it doesn&#x27;t COMPLETELY dry until about 10-15 minutes depending on how thick you lay it on.  </li>
            <li> Some might say that I&#x27;m obsessed, but I really think a 40-polish collection is small for girls these days...</li>
            <li> But I also use chima glaze strong adhesion base coat to help nail polish adhere.</li>
            <li> Glaze Strong Adhesion Base Coat followed immediately by the Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> If you are also using a quality base coat, this will give you really strong nails that won&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li> by the time use half of the bottle, notice the liquid is got harder that so hard to use it.</li>
            <li> only downside is when I use it with 5-free polishes like Zoya, it can shrink the polish a little leaving a small crack if I failed to cover the entire polish underneath.</li>
            <li> It makes little imperfections disappear.</li>
            <li> OR i would end up with lines from my sheets since I due my nails usually before bed.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> So after a few days, when I have to reapply the Seche Vite because the first day shine wears off, my polish just starts looking worse and worse.  </li>
            <li> but a little seche restore helps.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s because of growout or because it&#x27;s pulled away a little from the tips of my nails.   </li>
            <li> It does tend to shrink a little</li>
            <li> It does shrink a little if you don&#x27;t cap the tips of your nails though.</li>
            <li> Chipping is little or none after a week.</li>
            <li> since I was a little girl, so to me, this is a miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Cheaper polishes can run a little on the Seche Vite brush, so you may want to wait longer for that polish to set.</li>
            <li> Also wait a little longer for nail art designs like ombre nails, multilayer colors or additions like striping tape, shaped dough cut outs or stones.</li>
            <li> have noticed a little thickening of the polish, and while I haven&#x27;t tried it yet</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about it mucking up the polish</li>
            <li> I could mess up on my colors (layering unevenly etc)</li>
            <li> I used to mess up my home manicures before they dried.</li>
            <li> Buying online saves you a little and</li>
            <li> That said, a little shrinking can be anticipated and planned for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was living in the dark ages before buying this!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I keep neglecting to use the entire bottle in time, because at about the one year mark is gets pretty goopy and difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> downside to this is that if you get it even a little your skin on the edge of your nail</li>
            <li> I have three little kids and do my nails in the evening before bed.</li>
            <li> Works well to protect your polish but when you have designs it will smear them a little</li>
            <li> A little smelly but does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I understand that this item is not returnable as it is considered a hazardous material, but I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> This is far less expensive and works just as well.  </li>
            <li> I mean go do the dishes dry.  </li>
            <li> I mean DRY.  </li>
            <li> I work very hard on my nail art and the very next day</li>
            <li> after she sits for 5-10minutes, no problems(I used to hate spending 30min on her nail art only to have it ruined the minute she walked out of the room)...its like having a super hard coat of protective varnish on your nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more waiting for your nail polish to dry, put a coat of this on and out the door you go!!!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it becomes really thick when about half the product is used</li>
            <li> You know those little crease marks that you get on your nail polish if you touched something before your polish completely dried?</li>
            <li> but this one is hands down the winner!</li>
            <li> Even  tiny little chips looks horrible with red polish so multiple big ones are a deal</li>
            <li> Works amazing, Smells HORRIBLE, like a diesel in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Also,  the bottle itself was semi dirty and from experience, I know that that&#x27;s not how real Seche Vite bottles are.</li>
            <li> Yes, it dries your polish crazy fast.</li>
            <li> The price is Way too much for this...and the coating peels off before the end of the day...am afraid to use on intricate nail work...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on shipping</li>
            <li> I have few things to say:    1.</li>
            <li> This leads me to believe the product is either old or fake.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to worry about denting or smudging it while being to impatient to hold still while it dries.</li>
            <li> It would even out creases caused by my carelessness and still leave me with a glass-like finish that dried lickety-split.    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else.</li>
            <li> This happened even when I polished my nails an hour or two before bed, and waited a few minutes between coats.</li>
            <li> Unlike Seche Vite, with Out the Door you may end up with bubbles if you apply it too heavily.</li>
            <li> With Seche Vite, which goes on heavily, you still have to watch out for bubbles once you&#x27;re 3/4 through the bottle.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> but it dries inconsistently leaving the acrylic looking bumpy and messy.</li>
            <li> I just layer it every few days to keep up with my nails.</li>
            <li> but after using it for a few months I started having some problems.</li>
            <li> I would buy another bottle in case this one was defective, but I don&#x27;t want to waste anymore time on doing my nails again after 3/4 days.</li>
            <li> Definitely won&#x27;t waste my money on this again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find myself having to wait forever for it to be completely dried.</li>
            <li> In conjunction with all of my expensive products this may be the cheapest thing that I use on my natural nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done some reading and figured out the secret to this stuff to keep it from peeling and to make your manicure last.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using this with my Sally Hansen base coat and no base coat.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to all of my friends and have gotten quite a few hooked on it as well.</li>
            <li> And I have wasted a lot of money doing so.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read through some of the comments on here, and here are a few observations I&#x27;ve noticed.  </li>
            <li> A few drops will restore your topcoat.  </li>
            <li> When I received it,  I took abig sigh and hoped that I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon and because I&#x27;m impatient and I couldn&#x27;t want for it to arrive (took a week I believe)</li>
            <li> Even if the rest of your coats of polish are slightly uneven or are drying with bubbles, put this on and everything is cured.&lt;br</li>
            <li> wiped my fingernails after the nail polish color dried with some alcohol.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> This makes my nails start to chip within a few hours.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading rave reviews on a few beauty websites.</li>
            <li> but I just use a few drops of nail polish thinner</li>
            <li> My nails seem to chip within just a few days.</li>
            <li> and I have tried a few.</li>
            <li> thing is that after a few months, the polish in the bottle thickens.</li>
            <li> And it dried within a minute of applying it.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble with my nails chipping and this lasts longer than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> What a waste, I even added nail polish thinner</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble keeping polish on my nails.</li>
            <li> I applied this to my nails approximately 2 min after painting my second coat of nail polish and waited.  </li>
            <li> and it is already completely dried up.  </li>
            <li> Even when I add nail polish remover to try to thin it out, it is completely solid so nothing happens.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Dried my nails in just under two minutes</li>
            <li> It feels really heavy on my fingers, too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money  </li>
            <li> I do NOT enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m impatient</li>
            <li> attempt, I applied the base coat and one coating of color too all 10 nails, then 2nd coating of color, only to my left hand, and immediately followed that with SV.</li>
            <li> Dried my nails in just a few mins.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> To give you an idea of what my nails go through, I attend school and have a retail job that heavily requires the use of my hands and the washing of my hands.</li>
            <li> Used a 3 dimensional glitter polish with 2 coats and it dried it immediately without any smudges or chips.</li>
            <li> There are times when I want to go polish free, but I like to use the vitamin enriched base coat to strengthen and lengthen my brittle nails.</li>
            <li> There are times when I want to go polish free, but I like to use the vitamin enriched base coat to strengthen and lengthen my brittle nails.</li>
            <li> However it has a HEAVY chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I just have to reorder it fairly regularly because I am addicted to doing my nails.  </li>
            <li> i saved a few bucks on amazon</li>
            <li> I have been a fan for a few years not.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on a counterfeit.</li>
            <li> I always buy a few at a time</li>
            <li> When I received this, it was broken open.</li>
            <li> If you have trouble with:&lt;br /&gt;Dents&lt;br /&gt;Fingerprints&lt;br /&gt;Bubbles&lt;br</li>
            <li> As you can kindve tell, the brush is messy, with hairs sticking out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of the apparently few that this didn&#x27;t work for.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money for me.  </li>
            <li> Buy it now &amp; don&#x27;t waste time like I did...</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have this, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing.</li>
            <li> It worked well for a few months.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used a few.</li>
            <li> But after using it a few times, I&#x27;ve found it doesn&#x27;t hold up well at all.</li>
            <li> as it dried, it wrinkled up.</li>
            <li> It makes ur nail polish dried within a seconds&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time one anything else.</li>
            <li> I usually destroy my nails after I do it</li>
            <li> In my opinion if it were truly deadly as people make it out to be</li>
            <li> i read a few reviews that said their polish peeled off.  </li>
            <li> I swear it dried in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with my nails getting smudges and &amp;#34;sheet marks&amp;#34;/gouges-even when I would do them HOURS before any activity/bed.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan at all.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal seeing as paining takes 7 minutes.</li>
            <li> it gets thick as it gets old, i tried to thin it out with polish thinner</li>
            <li> It may be the user, rather than the product (i.e., I may have made the layers too thick, causing the whole thing to fail), but for now I would not recommend it.  </li>
            <li> One small problem is that it is very thick, so if you miss a spot while you&#x27;re applying it, the final product varies in thickness and may look slightly blotchy.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll definitely post any negative results out of the ordinary!</li>
            <li> I cannot find a single thing wrong with this product and will continue to buy it for as long as it&#x27;s made.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t settle for less!</li>
            <li> I painted my nails previously with no top coat and the polish would chip after a day or two, this has helped extend the life of the polish and I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Its usually the ones that have less chemicals in it</li>
            <li> This will guarantee less chipping!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t dream of giving it less than 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I usually use the Sally Hansen Insta-Dri topcoat, which is about half the price when bought in-store.</li>
            <li> It dried within about 2 minutes over relatively thick polish, and has extreme shine.</li>
            <li> The coat itself was hard to apply at the correct time due to the requirement of it being applied on semi-wet polish.</li>
            <li> you can wipe your finger on the nail and no smudge marks are left behind but that doesn&#x27;t mean go bang your nail on a sharp corner</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super thick and stringy and impossible to use.</li>
            <li> also use American Classic Gelous Nail Gel Base Coat.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m doing my nails at least every other day.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick and somehow seems to seal all of the colors together, making what would have been raised dots and lines on my nails because of varying thicknesses of layers of nail polish, etc., disappear into each other.</li>
            <li> I usually dread doing my nails because I hate not being able to use my hands for at least an hour afterwards.</li>
            <li> it does dry rock hard in 15 minutes!</li>
            <li> My nails were dry and hard in a matter of minutes!  </li>
            <li> I wish it dried a little faster, but that could be partly because I&#x27;m very impatient.</li>
            <li> and I am not easy on my nails.  </li>
            <li> hate* waiting for my nails to dry, and this cuts the dry time down immensely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells terrible and the odor is very very strong.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not too bad though considering I usually use 3 or 4 costs with other polishes, which ends up looking much too</li>
            <li> EXCESSIVE SHRINKING: it does shrink a little, so you have to take precautions.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a chance to mess up my nails!</li>
            <li> My bottle is now a little over ¼ way full and it&#x27;s almost impossible to use!</li>
            <li> I think I got a bad batch the first time.</li>
            <li> My nails peel pretty bad though</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t as bad as I was expecting but it worked exactly as I needed it to.</li>
            <li> a few minutes longer usually helps with that.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with fingerprints and smudges but no more.</li>
            <li> I usually do a topcoat every few days to extend the life of my manicure.  </li>
            <li> THIS STUFF!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve repurchased this product about 6 times in the past few year</li>
            <li> When you get to 1/2 down, the polish becomes thick.  </li>
            <li> My nailcolor lasts until I get bored &amp; change it, with little to no chipping at all (and I do dishes by hand, open cans, etc.).  </li>
            <li> It dries to the touch in one minute and it completely hard in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> -I learned this the hard way, otherwise it will pull your polish and make your nails look less than.</li>
            <li> I was going to finish this bottle, but I am afraid of the warning so when my new polish comes this is trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Sally Hensen last longer for me,I just bought this one to try something different but it was a bad move.</li>
            <li> AND,I&#x27;m horrible about smudges and dents in my polish because I can never wait an hour for things to dry properly,but with this fast dry solution,twenty minutes</li>
            <li> and I bought the Seche Vite restore too because I heard at about half bottle usage it starts to get thick and sticky</li>
            <li> Hated it, i can peel off so easily after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Then once you get to half a bottle, it gets so thick it is unusable, Not even restore will fix it.</li>
            <li> Planning on getting the seche vite nail polish restorer to bring back some old polishes to life and maybe a base coat if they have one.</li>
            <li> it dries quickly and protects the base color.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it gets really thick, so be prepared to thin it out 1/2 way through.</li>
            <li> (Base, 2 thin coats, and this as a topcoat) I&#x27;ve purchased it for friends as gifts also because it enabled me to start painting my nails again after years of not being able to.</li>
            <li> When you pull the brush out of the bottle it brings with it little strings of the polish!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this with a few sinful colors nail polishes with base coasts and they peeled right off.</li>
            <li> I mean less than 15.</li>
            <li> Also, be careful not to put your color on too thick or Seche Vite will dry in weird waves.</li>
            <li> There was very little chipping but the shrinkage, peeling and tip wear were problematic.</li>
            <li> The topcoat&#x27;s underwear seems to matter very little in the outcome here.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use any other topcoat anymore!!!</li>
            <li> Then all my hard work was in vain because I would completely destroy my polish.</li>
            <li> Unlike other quick-dry polishes, it won&#x27;t seal in wet polish in a bad way, not allowing it to fully dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really ever do my nails myself because it usually chips and looks so bad</li>
            <li> But the bad part is that it dries TOO fast.</li>
            <li> My nails chipped the next day &amp; it has some scary warning label that everyone has mentioned&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading so many reviews complaining about this horrible ingredient, I thought to myself, \\&quot;If</li>
            <li> No more sheet</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not magic.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought so many of these that it&#x27;s insane!  </li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> No more waiting until I go to bed to do nails when I woke up with smudges anyway.  </li>
            <li> No more sheet marks overnight or</li>
            <li> No more worries about bumping into something and messing up the polish.  </li>
            <li> Wait no more than a couple minutes before you apply it or</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t get past it and that is why I will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> No dents, unbelievable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not your ordinary topcoat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a polish thinner, so I&#x27;m not sure if it would work with the Seche brand.</li>
            <li> No more smudging.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the hype is</li>
            <li> But I usually use it up just in time.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> No more smudged polish for me.  </li>
            <li> No more hair marks or bed sheet smudges ever again.</li>
            <li> No more sitting in front of the fan for 20 mins.</li>
            <li> and it usually costs about $8.  </li>
            <li> The coat is also quite thick, which ensures that my mani doesn&#x27;t get chipped for quite a few days.</li>
            <li> and I went on about my day maybe 15 mins later and no dents or weird indications.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just small chips, the polish comes off in one piece...</li>
            <li> I usually throw a coat on in my car before work and it dries in minutes.</li>
            <li> 5 coats of polish dried with 2 minutes, no joke!</li>
            <li> I bought random topcoats in store whenever I needed them but never bothered to actually look at reviews for things online.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my nail polish lasted any longer</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst top coats I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Terrible product, Revlon topcoat is so much better.  </li>
            <li> It dried within minutes after I applied 2 coats of polish!</li>
            <li> Something that noxious is NOT safe to use.</li>
            <li> I type all day at work and usually my nails chip within 2 days of me painting them, but with this product they lasted 4-5 without chipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything in the past.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s usually a disaster.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s literally the worst top coat ever</li>
            <li> One bottle usually lasts me around three months, and I change my nail polish once or twice per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed for the price</li>
            <li> I usually paint my nails before I go to bed and would wake up with sheet imprints.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s counterfeit or just horrible top coat.</li>
            <li> It dries very quickly, usually under 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> In three years, it has been deteriorated and works worse than expected, but it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s fault</li>
            <li> I&#x60;m not sure about extending the duration of the nail polish though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t bother buying any others for the past few years after discovering this one!</li>
            <li> ultra shiny, lasts for about a week usually.</li>
            <li> Did not love.</li>
            <li> concentrations of toluene, usually from use in a confined space or unventilated area, can cause loss of consciousness, respiratory depression and death.</li>
            <li> I would find it pointless to paint my nails</li>
            <li> A waste of money!</li>
            <li> The drying time for my nails is usually between five to eight minutes.</li>
            <li> That is what&#x27;s missing!</li>
            <li> but polish becomes too thick after just a few uses</li>
            <li> Then, I have used this at home for the past 2 self- manis.  </li>
            <li> Usually my manicure lasted about 4-5 days...</li>
            <li> I usually get my nails done.</li>
            <li> Perhaps not all bottles of SV are this flimsy, but I&#x27;m not sure I want to find out.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I often shy away from doing extensive designs on my nails because the length of time it would take afterwards drying them.  </li>
            <li> drys my nails in 5-10 minutes when usually it would take hours, literally.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it extends the life of my polish (even with a base coat) and wish it dried shinier, but do like it, have used it for a few years, and will continue to use it (unless I found one that dries much shinier).  </li>
            <li> No more smeared nails...</li>
            <li> Always lasts a couple of days, if not more.</li>
            <li> I polish my nails rather frequently so usually need to buy this once a month or so.  </li>
            <li> When I accidentally touch my nails on cloth, it doesn&#x27;t get imprinted with the material&#x27;s texture like usual.</li>
            <li> and I usually get chips at the tips around day 2 or 3.</li>
            <li> Application can be difficult to master, but is definitely possible.  </li>
            <li> Application can be difficult to master, but is definitely possible.  </li>
            <li> - so glossy it&#x27;s been mistaken for gel nails a few times!  </li>
            <li> and I can usually ruin a mani within a couple days..</li>
            <li> ; I actually thought my nails were still wet because of the shine, and was shocked that it had dried THAT shiny.  </li>
            <li> No more fuss</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because of the polish or not.</li>
            <li> Also, Sally&#x27; Beauty usually has a deal, so check it out,</li>
            <li> Well, that wasted time is over!</li>
            <li> It even seemed to even out a small imperfection in my nail polish application.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you use anything else, you&#x27;re missing out!</li>
            <li> i dont think.i ll ever.use the ridge filling base coat but its worth</li>
            <li> Well, no more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it has to do with the polishes I used underneath</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Still, a small price to pay for gel-like nails which lasts over a week.</li>
            <li> , my nails usually take a beating.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not magical.</li>
            <li> I advise anyone To just go to a local ulta and pick it up, this one was fake.</li>
            <li> In the 2+ weeks that my polish usually lasts, I use only3 coats.  </li>
            <li> I was not pleased.</li>
            <li> Not pleased at all.</li>
            <li> No more waiting</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s the usual nail polish smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even seen an entire nail&#x27;s polish pop off like a fake nail.</li>
            <li> ; :/....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the drying time varies depending on the polish under it</li>
            <li> Not all my nails chip on the first day its usually just like 2 or 3 but by 3 or 4 days all my nails are chipped. :(  </li>
            <li> In the past, if I did my nails in the evening -- even a couple hrs b4 bedtime -- I&#x27;d still have blanket marks in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Probably the worst top coat I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> No more sheet imprints.</li>
            <li> No better than anything else.</li>
            <li> It helps with chipping, and you can cover any brand of nail polish that might usually chip and the Seche Vite prevents the chipping.</li>
            <li> Then when I wake up, there are always small chips in the corners of my nail.</li>
            <li> No more -</li>
            <li> The top coat is the worst I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Usually when I leave the salon i have been under their lamps and fans for 15 minutes and my nails are still damp and get scratched.  </li>
            <li> The tear was quite far down, and would have been painful to remove.  </li>
            <li> I find it a bit hard to apply since the brush is a bit stiff and the liquid is not so liquidly.</li>
            <li> I usually got very impatient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m clumsy, but this nail polish ensures that I won&#x27;t mess up my hard work.</li>
            <li> but i hate how quickly it gets too thick.  </li>
            <li> just plain sucks.</li>
            <li> It sets very firmly.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am just too rough with my hands, but I am still frustrated that no top coat actually doesn&#x27;t chip like their claims say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced this with any other polish except seche vite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it with different base coat and nail polish brands, but always the same results.</li>
            <li> If you wait until your polish is dry (longer than 5 mins) you are not using it correctly and it will cause the entire nail to peel up in a solid sheet, or chip insanely.  </li>
            <li> But after several destroyed manicures later I am fed up and I decided I hate Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on long enough, wears out. :(</li>
            <li> It seriously cuts DIY manicure time in half!</li>
            <li> I would always mess up my manicure because it wasn&#x27;t dry…not anymore!!</li>
            <li> When I think they&#x27;r dry and start to forget about them, I look down only to find ugly ridges, dents, scratches, you name it!</li>
            <li> It was loud and very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I am angry that it took me so long in my life to find this.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will continue buying Seche Vite as long as my nail hobby continues.</li>
            <li> but this usually happens if my polish or this is getting too thick</li>
            <li> In my experience I&#x27;ve found that it shrinks my polish a bit from the edges, which is pretty annoying.</li>
            <li> But truth be told, I really wanted this to work.  &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> This product cuts that time (at the very least) in half.</li>
            <li> The one thing I will say is that when you use about half of it it becomes very thick and stringy.</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting the thinner by seche vite as well because the nail polish will become very thick once it is about half way.</li>
            <li> Breathing high levels of toluene during pregnancy has been shown to result in children with birth defects and to retard mental abilities and growth.</li>
            <li> I mean, within a few minutes i could use my hands again and it doesn&#x27;t smudge!</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s that bad, it&#x27;s really not worth a longer lasting manicure...</li>
            <li> It is recommended that you buy it with the Seche Restore because it thickens as you use it, but I&#x27;m about half way through the bottle and haven&#x27;t needed to thin it yet.</li>
            <li> While Seche shrinks randomly over damp polish, it almost ALWAYS shrinks over dry polish.</li>
            <li> Or instantly dry with no shine and weird spots.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use until it dries up (which I have heard that about half way through you must buy Seche Vite Restore in order to thin out and continue with use).</li>
            <li> specially when paired up with Salon Sciences artificial base?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos!!</li>
            <li> It does not go dull after washing hands and dishes</li>
            <li> or so this stuff is rock hard.</li>
            <li> HARD in just a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> Makes nail color hard and shiny.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hard on my hands.</li>
            <li> It goes on when the polish is still tacky, and it&#x27;s shiny and hard in like a minute.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to get out-</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smear designs and stays hard and shiny.</li>
            <li> It drys hard (not at all tacky) in a minute.</li>
            <li> but it was hard like cement.</li>
            <li> Made my nail feel hard and sturdy too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bye</li>
            <li> I was so excited when it arrived, but unfortunately, I was quite disappointed in the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my nails shiny and hard.</li>
            <li> #34;It gives nails a hard, glossy finish!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the brush made it hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hard on my hands and my nail polish never holds up well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;ll see if it can withstand 6 hours of hard labor.</li>
            <li> My polish doesn&#x27;t chip hardly at all</li>
            <li> My nails are set to touch within a minute, and hard to the point of hearing an audible &amp;#34;tap&amp;#34; when flicking them, with no risk of smudge, within 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dull over time doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li> I was hard on them this week.</li>
            <li> last AT LEAST a week without chipping!!!</li>
            <li> had high expectations and am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It gives a shiny hard coat to polish and is chip proof for at least a week.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick and dries hard in minutes.</li>
            <li> It dries hard, thick, and shiny and</li>
            <li> And it is very thick so after a few uses the bottle is too thick to use anymore.</li>
            <li> Negative:</li>
            <li> Basically minimal chipping all the way until my nails have grown out from the base enough</li>
            <li> Keeps nails from chipping for at least a week and smooths out flaws in nail polish</li>
            <li> the negative side:  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on all my complex manicures lately</li>
            <li> I am someone who paints their nails at least twice a week and do nail art.</li>
            <li> I had tried this product at least 4x and kept having problems with my nail polish peeling off within a day.</li>
            <li> Also, every polish thickens and loses its pizzazz over time.</li>
            <li> Give it at least an hour before you go to sleep and</li>
            <li> at least it does what it states.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d been using it for at least a month before I gave her one.</li>
            <li> Or at least mine did.  </li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care about the smell (which others have complained about).</li>
            <li> so I figured I needed to at least try it once.</li>
            <li> When I read the packaging, I was shocked to find that it clearly states it contains chemicals that are</li>
            <li> It can turn the worst nail polish jobs into a professional looking manicure, and dries almost instantly.</li>
            <li> sucks.</li>
            <li> Manicure lasts at least 10 days.</li>
            <li> I think the negative reviews comes from the nail color brand differing</li>
            <li> This was not effective for me at all.</li>
            <li> Do not read the negative comments and make a drastic decision not to purchase because I almost did.</li>
            <li> I noticed my nails chipping a lot lately</li>
            <li> Which sucks.</li>
            <li> I am a late night manicurest.</li>
            <li> Kinda sucks because I can&#x27;t eat finger foods without the aweful smell.  </li>
            <li> My wife is crazy about this stuff, and is constantly recommending it to others.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be some really expensive stuff.  </li>
            <li> at least and since I work a lot with my hands that&#x27;s saying something.</li>
            <li> At least in my case, not so.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a late night polisher).  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend using this polish in your bathroom or any close quarter, at least without a fan.</li>
            <li> It extends the wear of your polish by at least a week.  </li>
            <li> The only annoying thing about it is that it gets gloopy and harder to apply after you use about 3/4 of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> so I will also mention that I bought this in late 2013 and have been using it</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t do anything for at least 30</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter how soon or late I apply this.</li>
            <li> I can go at least a week before any chipping occurs.  </li>
            <li> It dries in under 30 seconds and lasts for at least a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;HOWEVER, a common complaint about this product is shrinkage.  </li>
            <li> So common, in fact, it&#x27;s been dubbed \\&quot;seche shrinkage.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Your nails have to be painted at least for 30 seconds before applying the Seche.</li>
            <li> It went on thick</li>
            <li> It is rather thick, and I do notice the thicker</li>
            <li> If applied too thick it will not protect your nails.</li>
            <li> I remember reading reviews about it getting overly thick, and I did purchase the restoring drops from seche vite</li>
            <li> Also, it gives a thick coat, which I like.</li>
            <li> I buy it every time I see it because you can slop it on so thick and hurriedly</li>
            <li> The formula is thick and it is meant to be that way and within minutes I have bumped my nails thinking they were ruined and</li>
            <li> it was already too thick.</li>
            <li> It is a thick topcoat so it does the job of protecting your nails.</li>
            <li> but thick, so be judicious or</li>
            <li> it slowly wears away.</li>
            <li> a thick coat,</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s thick at all</li>
            <li> No matter how thick the dots are or how thick your polish is for a design in dries in 10-15 minutes, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> con is that you must seal it well after every use - or the liquid becomes to thick to use.</li>
            <li> so I try to keep both from getting too thick before using.  </li>
            <li> Even over thick layers of nail polish color, this dries in minutes</li>
            <li> is it starts to get thick.  </li>
            <li> It gets a but thick towards the end of the bottle which is a bummer</li>
            <li> I do know that the tend to get thick but that hasn&#x27;t happened yet.</li>
            <li> But over time it has gotten thick and lost it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Solution became quite thick and unusable.</li>
            <li> but i feel the texture is too thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> Gets thick after 5 months.</li>
            <li> It does get thick, but not until you&#x27;ve used almost 2/3 of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> getting so thick is cheaper than a manicure at a salon.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s consistinsy when it gets thick.</li>
            <li> But Don&#x27;t put a thick layer</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting a bottle of restorer as it does get thick</li>
            <li> Its also not too thick, which Essie often was.</li>
            <li> Although, it gets thick.</li>
            <li> or I was applying it on too thickly.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if this is user error or what, but his crap causes my polish to peel within hours of application and complete drying time!!!</li>
            <li> and  it has secret, hidden powers!</li>
            <li> However, there may be other base coats out there such as OPI, etc.</li>
            <li> My only other recommendation would be to use a base coat...</li>
            <li> I mean all 3/4 coats of polish.</li>
            <li> But I mean, for the price, I just got 2 bottles...</li>
            <li> Whenever I had tried to grow them out in the past, they would peel and tear (just folding laundry was an issue!).</li>
            <li> A little disappointed because I could have went to the regular store to purchase this instead of waiting days to get it.</li>
            <li> By shrinkage I mean it pulls the sides around your nail polish and overtime</li>
            <li> No more smudged nails!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t review stuff, but I just couldn&#x27;t resist!</li>
            <li> I mean skip smudging them on my comforter.</li>
            <li> The no-UV gel, the &amp;#34;looks like gel&amp;#34;, I mean it.</li>
            <li> I do not understand how anyone could not seriously love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I always mean to do my nails</li>
            <li> Not sure how I did without it before!</li>
            <li> Manicure usually lasts about a week!</li>
            <li> No chips at 3 days despite having thin, weak, previously covered in acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> One tip though, apply this to your nail polish when it&#x27;s set or gummy not completely sopping wet or your manicure will look like crap.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just laden with nasty chemicals), and after a few weeks of wearing it your nails will start peeling like crazy unless you give them a vacation from this top coat.  </li>
            <li> I usually get tired of the color and want to change it before there&#x27;s any noticeable tip wear.</li>
            <li> And nail polish on gel or acrylic nails always stay really long, just because the nail surface is artificial.</li>
            <li> My polish chipped as much or worse than usual.</li>
            <li> This was a very small order.  </li>
            <li> And I got it in less than two days!!!</li>
            <li> It may also be my new base coat-</li>
            <li> It seriously dries in minutes.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> If you paint your nails in any sort of serious capacity, you&#x27;ve probably heard of SV.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazeballs - seriously.</li>
            <li> I noticed that I had serious nail shrinkage at the tips and cuticles.</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY ever since i started using seche vite doing my nails</li>
            <li> I will seriously throw it away.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Seriously and when the polish does come off it comes off kinda like tape.</li>
            <li> Almost a subtle texture to it.  </li>
            <li> seriously.</li>
            <li> This is seriously a must have.</li>
            <li> It made my manicures dry to the touch in minutes, and added a crazy amount of shine.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this topcoat makes any manicure look like you just came out of the nail salon.</li>
            <li> Seriously, buy this product.  </li>
            <li> Oh yah, and it really has a bad odor too!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any base coat, then apply two coats of my nail polish, let it dry for just a few minutes then apply a thick layer of this.</li>
            <li> Almost feels  as if you got your nails laminated, though I don&#x27;t mean it is stiff or anything weird.  </li>
            <li> Well, I had heard a lot about Seche Vite and was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does get a little bit gloopy with age, but not to the point that it&#x27;s difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive but everything else pales in comparison.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little sad that I&#x27;m almost out of mine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the next day and my manicure has chipped badly.</li>
            <li> The reason I only give it 3 starts is it peels off REALLY BAD.</li>
            <li> prevents a lot of chipping, the only parts of my nail that looks bad is the part growing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I must have received a bad batch .would have sent it back</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a good coat because I have to re-do my nails every 4 days</li>
            <li> A fresh bottle resolved this, and it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s terribly pricy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They became peely and thin and I was too afraid to buff them to try to fix some of the flaking because it would further thin them out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used expensive ones and they chip after a few days.</li>
            <li> not good for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> I know, not good for your nails</li>
            <li> I tried every tot coat, base coat, one coat and nothing worked it never dried.</li>
            <li> my nails have grown longer and stronger because this is thick and adds strength to my thin, peely nails.</li>
            <li> The neck snapped off completely, leaving a miserable mess on our coffee table and a crappy chemical odor that wouldn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> The product was very thick when I received it and caused serious shrinking on my nails.</li>
            <li> Seals in my hard work for up to 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders on my dull looking polish!  </li>
            <li> I always have had problems with my nail polish getting dings in it just minutes after painting, but with Seche Vite, my nail polish is completely hard in 4 minutes, just like the bottle promises!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, my nails are hard as rocks!  </li>
            <li> I had just worked hard on, but fear not!</li>
            <li> If using this as just a plain clear coat, it is horrible!!  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if I am doing something wrong, but that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening to me.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m dumb</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a fake bottle or what, but this polish starts chipping within 1-2 days.</li>
            <li> smells weird, not sure if I should put it on my nails</li>
            <li> ,my nail polish doesn&#x27;t last  one day :(  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that it started peeling off the second day.  </li>
            <li> No chipping for at least a week!</li>
            <li> My nails are weak and peel, nail polish is always chipped within the hour.  </li>
            <li> Not sure whether i applied it wrongly or what</li>
            <li> Very hard, glossy finish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to remove without remover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also very hard on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Very hard to use after that.</li>
            <li> and I am very hard on my hands throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Less than 24 hours after applying it, my nails were chipping like crazy.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with its staying power.</li>
            <li> so you can imagine how thin and weak they are).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick</li>
            <li> Very thick, so it&#x27;s like a layer of protection for your nails.</li>
            <li> Product came very thick.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Seems very very thick and gooey.</li>
            <li> so it was a base coat of very thick polish, two coats of pastel and two coats of a white, then I put on the Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> I received a bad batch because after 20 minutes my nails Was still wet.  </li>
            <li> My only regret is not losing the stupid acrylic nails sooner.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have problems with shrinkage, but sometimes my nails will chip at the base a day or two later.</li>
            <li> It is IMPERATIVE that you DO NOT attempt to thin it out with acetone or nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I hate painting my nails for them to only chip in 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced this.</li>
            <li> I like how it can be applied in a thin layer</li>
            <li> Game changer.</li>
            <li> I have always had thin, egg-shell nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become obsessed with manicures lately</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the nail prep and base coat next!</li>
            <li> I use the American Classis Gelous Nail Gel Base Coat along with it.</li>
            <li> I am a poor college kid</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to nail art</li>
            <li> To thin it, however, you will need to buy Seche Vite thinner, others may cause the polish to fog up and no longer be opaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I found out recently OPI makes a Nail Envy base coat specifically to fix that</li>
            <li> I especially recommend using it with the Seche Ridge Filling Base Coat for glass-like smoothness and shine.</li>
            <li> Not great for long-lasting finish, though.</li>
            <li> It is extremely difficult to get out of the bottle and is so thick that it&#x27;s not even usable.</li>
            <li> but it just made it worse.</li>
            <li> i used to hate painting my nails, because i knew not a day if not an hour later they would be chipped, but with this i dont have to worry about it.</li>
            <li> #just decreased#.</li>
            <li> I have used all different types of polish, tried changing my base coat, and nothing helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was increasingly frustrating when I got into nail art.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy to admit it, but I&#x27;m a nail polish junkie.</li>
            <li> I hate going to salons because their manicures actually chip faster than the ones I do myself.</li>
            <li> I tell them I do them myself and the secret is Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> This is much worse on my flatter nails.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> it smells horrible but really does work.</li>
            <li> It has a thin consistency</li>
            <li> Addicted To Speed (DL ATS) topcoat.</li>
            <li> , what is the secret?</li>
            <li> I advise investing in a bottle of Seche Restore to thin it when it thickens...and it WILL thicken.</li>
            <li> I did a french manicure with a pastel base -</li>
            <li> To combat this, I just got the Seche Restore, which helped me to thin it out</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t improve or make worse the situation.</li>
            <li> You can just peel it off in giant chunks, no matter what base coat you use.</li>
            <li> Alas, I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This topcoat not only enhances the vitamin base coat</li>
            <li> This topcoat not only enhances the vitamin base coat</li>
            <li> , maybe they are putting it on too thin?</li>
            <li> I found that it makes a manicure last about 3-4 days depending on the brand of polish (and probably your base coat too)</li>
            <li> And yes, I followed all the rules I could find about thin coats, waiting forever between coats, even refrigerating my polishes to reduce bubbling.</li>
            <li> I hate it because I can never finish an entire bottle.  </li>
            <li> Your sheets will leave all kinds of funky designs behind in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries fast but looks terrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worse than any of my strong-smelling polishes and coats.  </li>
            <li> There was something annoying going on with my Esspi polish, it was going on chunky and thick and weird, so I was skeptical if it would work over such a thick amount of polish.  </li>
            <li> I do a decent job doing my nails, but nothing shocking.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed as each day I have a new chipped nail.</li>
            <li> It also does not maintain my polish for even a week, but I will say that I do dishes (a normal amount) and wash my hands (like an insane person).  </li>
            <li> I am frustrated that I cannot return this product as it was definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I would be disappointed in this fact even it were just nail polish, but considering the point of this product is to protect the other coats, it&#x27;s even worse.</li>
            <li> I hate myself for waiting so long to try this topcoat.</li>
            <li> If you can go to a nail salon &amp; handle the smell, you&#x27;ll have no problem with this because it&#x27;s not even half as bad.</li>
            <li> and I hate waiting for my polish to completely dry before going to bed.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite helps to dry your nails to the base, and you won&#x27;t wake up with sheet marks.  </li>
            <li> but I  HATE waiting for them to dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick, the bottle isn&#x27;t the same - and the brush is terrible.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of a couple of negative reviews but don&#x27;t listen to those ones!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awful but thankfully the small dissipates once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> it got tired of all the other crap they claim works</li>
            <li> Smells a little bad, but all nail products do don&#x27;t they?</li>
            <li> My problem was that I hated waiting for the nails to dry, and worst of all, you are never sure when they are REALLY dry.</li>
            <li> When I polish my nails, the polish typically lasts 1-2 days :(  </li>
            <li> I think the problem I was having before was due to not using a base coat.</li>
            <li> I feel like an idiot for ever using any other &amp;#34;fast dry&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I refuse to use any other base coat and even bring it with me when I get pedicures.</li>
            <li> According to the state of California this product has a dangerous chemical which can cause serious birth defects...</li>
            <li> I apply a thin coat of the base, wait a few minutes</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment!!</li>
            <li> very hard to get rid of the nail polish once on your nails!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this was a bad bottle from Seche Vite or if something happened on the way....</li>
            <li> I hated the days of having to wait forever for my nail polish to dry.</li>
            <li> It peels off in less that 48 hours alone or with a base...and takes the base with it.</li>
            <li> No more waiting 30 minutes before functioning in life again, worried you&#x27;ll ruin your nails, this here is the answer to all your nail prayers!!!</li>
            <li> am admittedly clumsy, after a pedicure I have a bad habit of walking into things and smacking my toes on random stuff.</li>
            <li> Fake bottle, fake seche....</li>
            <li> It dries in mere minutes to a glossy, impenetrable shield.</li>
            <li> but the nail polish come off like a fake nail....</li>
            <li> Weird thing is it wears off within a couple of days.</li>
            <li> However, in today&#x27;s economy, having two boys makes it difficult for me to continue doing so</li>
            <li> it is still vulnerable to sheet marks, unintended digs, etc.</li>
            <li> sadly it has toluene.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as I was reading the reviews, but decided to give this product a shot and purchased it anyway.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all!</li>
            <li> If you wait until the polish dries and then apply it, it tends to shrink and pull away from the cuticles which looks weird and then leads to chipping.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sad.</li>
            <li> This is a product you can&#x27;t go wrong about.</li>
            <li> worse is how damaging this stuff was!  </li>
            <li> I knew she had done something wrong because that NEVER happened to me</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> its kinda weird.</li>
            <li> Before you get the wrong thoughts, she uses it as intended, on her nails.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is because they changed the composition or if this is a fake.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it also makes my polish peel within hours of doing my nails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shrinking - Shrinking can be a random problem.</li>
            <li> It gets goopy halfway through and becomes useless.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am doing something wrong, but when I use just my polishes (I am a China Glaze fan, but alo have some others), the color lasts longer than when I put this product over them.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I keep having an issue with my polish peeling off.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s scary to think we might have that stuff floating in our blood stream.</li>
            <li> It can be rather annoying to redo the nails every few days.</li>
            <li> I looked online to see if maybe I was applying it wrong.  </li>
            <li> Then it started to get worse, my polish would start to rub off on baby wipes!</li>
            <li> Also the consistency thickens into a difficult goop over time.</li>
            <li> (you always seem to have to go at the worst possible moments).</li>
            <li> But, honestly, I&#x27;m sorry I waited</li>
            <li> So frustrating!  </li>
            <li> a chink in the armor unless I blatantly do something to cause it.</li>
            <li> I was recommended to use this by my fellow nail obsessed friends.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s like having one of those expensive gel manicures without the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sorry I wanted to like it</li>
            <li> It is expensive.</li>
            <li> Plus the smell is AWFUL and there is definitely a shrinkage issue with this polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If someone is having a problem with peeling, they&#x27;re doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> Ill do 2 coats of this.</li>
            <li> Actually obsessed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, so</li>
            <li> Me personally I&#x27;m not impressed by Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not impressed with it&#x27;s stay time.</li>
            <li> It almost feels like a fake product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this formula contains toluene, which is why I didn&#x27;t give it five stars.</li>
            <li> A girlfriend recommended this to me and since it wasn&#x27;t too terribly expensive, I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> No trips to the salon for expensive fake nails.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you need to refresh your polish, just apply another thin coat of Seche and it looks like you just did your nails!  </li>
            <li> Just like gel nails without the expensive salon price tag.</li>
            <li> Consider me addicted!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m stuck with a lousy product.</li>
            <li> If one part of the nail polish peels off it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;break off&amp;#34;  so you can fake having nail polish on for some time before it peels off completely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you wear FAKE nails</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> I read the hype but was still skeptical about trying it myself.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it looks downright weird and gloopy when I put it on.</li>
            <li> all the weird glooping and uneveness evens</li>
            <li> Makes an at home nail polish look like an expensive manicure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Dries thin&lt;br /&gt;Dries with weird wrinkles</li>
            <li> Not awesome.</li>
            <li> So weird, doesn&#x27;t smell like any nail polish I&#x27;ve ever smelled before.</li>
            <li> , I was often unable to do my nails just because I never had a 4hr block to allow them to dry(I am not exaggerating), now I do them every 2-3days</li>
            <li> There is also false advertising!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve tested this by using the Seche Vite over a very thin layer of polish</li>
            <li> Very poor quality don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> so I have to put on a very thin amount.</li>
            <li> Usually when I do my nails, I use OPI chip skip, then a base coat, 2 color coats and then this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m horrible at waiting until my nails dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;- has a weird , illegal, dangerous ingredient that produces birth</li>
            <li> Also, I had a weak polish remover w me in a hotel, and it wouldnt take this off!!  </li>
            <li> And it lasts without chips for at least 5-6 days!!!</li>
            <li> I use it with the Seche base ridge filler coat and it lasts a week at least!</li>
            <li> I also have to mention this weird smell that came along  with the bottle, I had to wash the exterior of it, it was that bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;3 stars for doing what it says, it gets two taken away for the crazy chipping.</li>
            <li> Terrible waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried different base coats in an effort to figure out what was making the edges of my polish look horrible.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks</li>
            <li> However, this stuff stinks.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Dries in seconds, helps prevent chipping and has crazy shine like glass.</li>
            <li> But the worst part is that it peels off along with the nail color in just a few hours after it dries.</li>
            <li> it peels like crazy after.</li>
            <li> It also lead to a crazy amount of peeling.</li>
            <li> However, THIS STUFF PEELS OFF LIKE CRAZY.</li>
            <li> /&gt;By the way, this coat STINKS.  </li>
            <li> The biggest difference I have is that the Seche does some crazy polish peeling on me.</li>
            <li> When I received this it was already very thick! !</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> I was so wrong!  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Seche Vite!</li>
            <li> , it can also be used to paint over fake rings to prevent them from fading and tarnishing!</li>
            <li> Oh, how wrong I was!  </li>
            <li> Sorry Seche:(</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry!</li>
            <li> Try this, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with it &amp; telling everyone I know about this product!</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this!</li>
            <li> My nails looked dull and disgusting.</li>
            <li> But that was an unpleasant surprise with this nail coat.</li>
            <li> My nails are very difficult to maintain polish anyway</li>
            <li> yes, it stinks, it has toulene,ugh, made me sick, did not stay on.yuck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s practically impossible to apply it evenly now.</li>
            <li> The smell is awful and it makes my nail so brittle and weak</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had random people stop and ask me where I got my nails done, and they were shocked when I told them I do them myself!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so bad, then why are the FDA allowing it into products at all?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The warning didn&#x27;t say whether Toluene was the bad chemical though.</li>
            <li> that it looks bad and I remove it all.  </li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> product does, however, smell REALLY bad.</li>
            <li> Smells like furniture polish gone bad.</li>
            <li> It is honestly a really bad product</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say at all-</li>
            <li> WHICH IS ONE OF THE BAD THREE IN NAIL POLISH OP</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit off putting like paint thinner, but what nail polish product doesn&#x27;t smell bad?</li>
            <li> I was going to order it but read bad reviews</li>
            <li> Keep bad, one will out</li>
            <li> I did the shellac for awhile, but I read something on the Internets about it being bad for your nails.</li>
            <li> Cannot say a bad thing about this product.</li>
            <li> But this polish is also bad because it shrinks away from the nails and peels off in one layer.</li>
            <li> When I opened it, the bad smell came from the bottle.</li>
            <li> The chemical smell is so bad that I couldn&#x27;t even use this.</li>
            <li> or I was going to have to add polish remover to them which thins them out really bad.  </li>
            <li> I guess I got a bad bottle.</li>
            <li> Oh and the smell isn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> Even though it smells really bad, I don&#x27;t mind because it works wonders for my nails.</li>
            <li> Also, it smells really, really bad, like turpentine.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch</li>
            <li> I was so frustrated that I bought a UV lamp and started doing gel color to get a longer-lasting manicure.</li>
            <li> I get so frustrated (</li>
            <li> Frustrated.</li>
            <li> I have tried A LOT of topcoats and have been sorely disappointed...  </li>
            <li> I am utterly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> which is what I desperately wanted!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Soooooo baddd,  :(  Would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Crazy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll need to research that one... :(</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed by my purchase.</li>
            <li> so dissapointed :(</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed as I wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> The shrinks your polish like crazy!</li>
            <li> i was a bit disappointed to find it&#x27;s got toluene in it -</li>
            <li> so disappointed.</li>
            <li> The reviews on this were crazy!</li>
            <li> I was sadly disappointed .</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed.  </li>
            <li> REALLY disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> I am hugely disappointed since I paid $8 for this.  </li>
            <li> However I was very unhappy with the results.</li>
            <li> but Ill take it rather than my polish getting ruined!!</li>
            <li> but label says it has ingredients that are illegal in California which harms reproductive system wtf&amp;#62;?!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t hate this product even if I want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I used it as just a base coat until I could get a color on my nails.  </li>
            <li> (for reference I used this over Essie polish without a base coat)</li>
            <li> and I hate wasting it.</li>
            <li> I use OPI and China Glaze polish as well as China Glaze and CND Stickey base coats.</li>
            <li> Now THAT is an entirely worthless, one star product.</li>
            <li> My manicure peels within a day after using a base coat.  </li>
            <li> base, two color, and two glitter layers... plus one application of Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have annoying lumps or bubbles.  </li>
            <li> I hate to wait until my nail paint dries.</li>
            <li> I used to hate painting my nails</li>
            <li> I paired it with CND Sticky base coat and a run of the mill OPI color.</li>
            <li> I hate having to wait forever to do any sort of chores, housework, or ANYTHING when I paint my nails.  </li>
            <li> So annoying.  </li>
            <li> I use this with CND sticky base coat.</li>
            <li> I would use the base coat seche.</li>
            <li> used this tip cote with the cnd sticky base coat and opi bubble bath.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t use a base coat (tried to use it as a base coat)</li>
            <li> I like to pair it with the Seche Vite Base Coat as well.</li>
            <li> Cannot be used as a base coat (it&#x27;s not marketed as one, so I did not take that into consideration when rating).</li>
            <li> I used a base, 2 coats of Essie&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I used a base coat, two coats of polish and then promptly applied the product.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t hate it either.</li>
            <li> I wish I never bought this crap.</li>
            <li> , I applied the base coat and 2 coats of color to all 10 nails, and then immediately applied the SV.</li>
            <li> It peels of within two days as a base coat.</li>
            <li> get this and the base coat.</li>
            <li> instead i got the ridge filling base coat</li>
            <li> Now, I either need to touch them up (which I hate the way it looks) or I have to redo them completely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also use &amp;#34;Stickey&amp;#34; base coat.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t bought the base coat yet</li>
            <li> I hate polishing my nails because by the time I get done I&#x27;ve messed them up already.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend OPI base coat.</li>
            <li> I hate chips.</li>
            <li> I do use a base coat but switch around types on that one.</li>
            <li> When she used it as a base the paint flaked off within a day.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not even using the rest of the bottle because the shrinkage is so bad it makes my manicure look awful.</li>
            <li> The smell is so bad!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the worst one I&#x27;ve ever used. :(</li>
            <li> Shocked that no one else wrote this in their review when I ordered it!</li>
            <li> I was shocked!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a friend as I was frustrated with chipped nail polish!</li>
            <li> I hated painting my nails, because even hours after painting, I would smudge and ruin my nails.</li>
            <li> manicures used to be god awful, after a base coat and two coats of polish</li>
            <li> I hated doing my nails before this,</li>
            <li> but my roommate in college hated the smell.</li>
            <li> Before Seche Vite, I hated painting my nails.</li>
            <li> hated that and would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Hated that.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t get over how terrible this is!  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I got a VERY annoying humming in my ears while using this product.  </li>
            <li> Chipping is awful!  </li>
            <li> But the smell is awful.</li>
            <li> I have almost forgotten the days of sheet marks and horrible smudges</li>
            <li> It also peels horribly.</li>
            <li> It smells awful</li>
            <li> 2 - Do not use this as your base coat as well, that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s intended for and it will peel!  </li>
            <li> shrinkage is awful.  </li>
            <li> : She used it as a BASE COAT, too!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s otherwise terrible.  </li>
            <li> I am horrible when it comes to painting my nails.  </li>

            <li> This polish is the worst one I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Horrible this product.  </li>
            <li> I hate that to no end!</li>
            <li> Very annoying but the gloss in seche vite just can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> and without the nasty smell.</li>
            <li> Horrible stuff!  </li>
            <li> Drys insanely</li>
            <li> The shrinkage is awful.  </li>
            <li> I Must Say, I&#x27;m Disappointed! !</li>
            <li> Extremely annoying!</li>
            <li> This is horrible!</li>
            <li> But within one hour of using it on fingernails, the coat started peeling off and looked disgusting.</li>
            <li> I buy crap on here all the time!</li>
            <li> SOOO disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Have horribly chipped nails, that&#x27;s what!</li>
            <li> This is awful, I tried this on my manicure and it would peel off in sheets, I have since then put on acrylics</li>

            <li> Disappointment!!!</li>
            <li> Horribly.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the worst part of painting your nails?</li>
            <li> Nail polish and awful smells</li>
            <li> And the worst feature in my opinion is the smell!</li>
            <li> It is terrible and with its harmful chemicals</li>
            <li> I had to knock off a star because it has an absolutely horrible smell!</li>
            <li> After Seche Vite, I tried OPI and it was equally as terrible.</li>
            <li> They look awful!</li>
            <li> it smells horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product- fast dry and great shine.</li>
            <li> Best top coat I have EVER used. Really shiny and nice, dries super fast</li>
            <li> Gets the job done.  Didn&#x27;t believe it until I tried it.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Drys so fast, no issues with crappy nail polish getting smudged or ruined 15-20 minutes after you are finished painting your nails. Love love love it.</li>
            <li> Best topcoat I&#x27;ve tried. Dries super quick and shiny. It&#x27;s very thick so you don&#x27;t need a lot. Am definitely buying again.</li>
            <li> Does what it promises - quick dries the polish without bubbling!</li>
            <li> great top coat or if using a DARK color as a base if need be so there is no color stain on Natural nails NO GEL OR ACRYLIC. (I know I&#x27;m probably the only person who has natural nails)</li>
            <li> Best Fast-Dry Top Coat i have EVER used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want a gel manicure like the ones at the salons, but half the cost?&lt;br /&gt;Want your nail polish to last 2+ weeks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then also use American Classic Gelous Nail Gel Base Coat. I swear by it. Using this combo, I have not set foot in a salon in about a year.&lt;br /&gt;(http://www.amazon.com/American-Classic-Gelous-Nail-Polish/dp/B00B8KWFJU/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1414868828&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;American+Classic+Gelous+Nail+Gel+Base+Coat+Nail+Polish)</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff. Make sure you put it on while the rest of your nail polish is still wet, otherwise it will all peel off within a day or two. Adds a nice shine and dries in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I have found.  It makes it look like I had my nails done professionally, and helps my polish last a long time. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! Shines, looks great and the price is great! I&#x27;m a huge fan of top coats and this one is just amazing, it looks like gel manicure.....is a must have!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;l never paint nails without this again.</li>
            <li> I always always always either smudged my polish or had sheet crinkles on my nails when I woke up, even I did my nails hours before bed. I use Opi, Essie, and China Glaze exclusively because as a healthcare worker the cheap polishes chip after 3 hand-washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This topcoat is magic. MAGIC, I TELL YOU. It needs about 15 minutes and then I am free from the bondage of waiting for my nails to dry. Now I always have neatly polished nails (which is a requirement for me or I&#x27;ll bite them right off).</li>
            <li> truly the very best top coat ever.</li>
            <li> Great top coat dry really fast</li>
            <li> My very favorite top coat.  Dries super fast, is crazy shiny, and lasts well.  It&#x27;s also a great top coat for glitter and can smooth out the chunkiest glitter bomb.  My one complaint is that it tends to get thick and goopy about halfway through the bottle, but I recently discovered Seche Restore, which is a thinner specifically made for Seche Vite as regular polish thinner doesn&#x27;t work (I know, I&#x27;ve tried).  So hopefully that will solve my goo problems and make this truly perfect.</li>
            <li> I am new to this nail care stuff. Whenever I did my nails they would chip immediately, so I thought I&#x27;d try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Positive: It dries super fast &amp; leaves a shiny gloss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Negative: My nails chipped the next day &amp; it has some scary warning label that everyone has mentioned&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that I read was it lasted for weeks. Well for me, it did not. I am very disappointed as each day I have a new chipped nail. I should&#x27;ve gone with the nail salon brand OPI. So I ordered that, I hope that one actually works. I was going to finish this bottle, but I am afraid of the warning so when my new polish comes this is trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Okay so I bought a bottle but I hadn&#x27;t run out of my old top coat (Essie) so I didn&#x27;t try it until today. My old top coat was not drying fast enough and I smudged the crap out of it, but then I put Seche Vite over it and it fixed the smudges!! It even works well over stamping polish, which is a huge plus for me! I am hooked and I am never going back!</li>
            <li> This is the best topcoat I have ever used. I have been using this brand for years and it never disappoints. Dries super quick and looks so glossy</li>
            <li> this top coat is hands down AMAZING! it beats other top coats ive tried and loved, like out the door and hard as nails.. its durable and shiny but dries faster than any other top coat without leaving the polish layers mushy underneath. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> Did not last any longer than other top coats I&#x27;ve used! Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this excellent product for quite some time and of course it&#x27;s a well-known top coat and quite flawless in application.  The price from this seller is awesome and I absolutely intend to purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> Does everything it says it will. Longevity to a manicure, and brilliant shine. It enhances every colour I use, and I&#x27;m delighted to accept the accolades from friends and colleagues</li>
            <li> This is a good top coat. It does what it says, dries fast, makes nails shiny and smooth. This is a great price for this product also, it is double in stores. Additionally, shipping was extremely fast. I got it within days. However, I don&#x27;t think this top coat really does much for maintaining my manicure. I don&#x27;t think it really extends the polish much.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat. It&#x27;s super quick drying and amazingly shiny. My only complaint is that after about 3-4 months, it becomes a bit thick and slightly more difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I Just Love this Top Coat! don&#x27;t like the paint smell! Awesome, Love It, Great , glad i have it</li>
            <li> I hated painting my nails, because even hours after painting, I would smudge and ruin my nails. When someone suggested Seche Vite, I snatched it up. The reviews were great, and it was a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it&#x27;s supposed to \\&quot;dry fast\\&quot; I don&#x27;t feel that it does. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using too much or too little, but even an hour later I&#x27;ll sometimes dent the nail on accident. I don&#x27;t have many coats below (three at MOST, and only with a thin polish) so I&#x27;m unsure of why I&#x27;m not getting the same dry time. That said, it dries MUCH faster than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried, and continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My BIGGEST COMPLAINT about this product is that you only get to use about half of the bottle. It&#x27;s great and convenient until halfway down. I have to tilt the polish all over to try and get it on the brush, and even then it doesn&#x27;t work well. That&#x27;s very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have problems with shrinkage, but sometimes my nails will chip at the base a day or two later. I know many enjoy the \\&quot;glossy\\&quot; look, but I prefer more matte nails. I will be a happy girl when there&#x27;s a fast-dry top coat that doesn&#x27;t have extra shine.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that has helped my nail polish stay on.  It also gives it a smooth shiny finish and dries quickly.  But the thinner they sell as this does dry out quickly.  I&#x27;ll never paint my nails without this top coat again.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat. It looks nice, goes on easily, and my nails are dry in minutes instead of hours. It&#x27;s the only top coat I use.</li>
            <li> Works great leaves nails shiny and smooth. Great for all nail designs. Does have a somewhat strong smell.</li>
            <li> I love this quick dry polish. It really works and the nails look so good!</li>
            <li> This top coat has a strong bad smell, doesn&#x27;t go on smooth, and chips off quickly. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Does its job, dries up quick! Easy to apply. Excellent price. Lasts long and adds up shine to your nails.</li>
            <li> Not the best or worst of top coats - it does dry quickly but it doesn&#x27;t prevent chipping either - regardless of the quality of the nail color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what took me so long to decide on buying this. It came earlier than expected and lives up to what it says it can do. My nails were dry by 1 minute and even when I did 2 coats on one nail and did a thicker coat on another, it still was dry by 1 minute * 1 minute 12 seconds at the most and yes I timed it*. I have another quick dry top coat called Jet Dry by Kiss but it has a thicker formula and sometimes bubbles or leaves streaks. I will admit that the Jet Dry leaves your nails with a better shine than Seche Vite but thats about it. I would take a 9/10 over a 1/10 on a product any day lol.</li>
            <li> The best there is !  Dries fast and super shiny.  A must.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great price.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this top nail coat. It really does dry super fast! Only takes a few minute to dry and it goes on so smooth. Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever! My nails dry in five minutes after I apply this. Makes painting my nails myself WAY more convenient.</li>
            <li> Love this top coat. Dries instantly and it leaves my nails looking great.</li>
            <li> My favorite top coat. Smooths out inconsistencies.</li>
            <li> great price!  it dries super fast  and keeps any polish on for days!  easy application overall just an amazing product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this top coat for years. There is some shrinkage but until I find a better top coat than this I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> Puts an awesome quick drying coat over my polish and really looks great too. Reduces chipping lasts a very long time</li>
            <li> This top coat goes on a bit thick so be careful but, man its awesome, my nails are not professionally manicured but this top coat helps my polish last approx 10 days without chipping !!! LOVE IT</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible! I always smudge my nails but since I have began using this top coat, they dry before I can smudge them! It also helps my polish last way longer. I will never use another top coat again.</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever makes every mani look good.  Mani last so much longer using this product. Best gift given to me and been using for a couple years.  When I do go to the salon its with me in my bag.  Never leave home without it. Seche vite is the best</li>
            <li> Finally!!! This stuff is amazing. I have finally found a fast drying top coat that will do what it says and DRY quickly! I put this over a new coat of polish last night right before bedtime and I woke up without even a single crease. Say goodbye to sheet creases, which is amazing if you are like me and find that the only time you ever have to paint your nails is right before you go to bed. Will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I used this top coat with the Seche Vite base coat (and colored polish in between).  Mani lasted a week and could have lasted longer if I hadn&#x27;t wanted to change colors. Great online price, much better than in store.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING. I have been using other products and my nail polish will peel off and chip after just a few hours of painting them. I am very satisfied with this product! Just not the warning on the back.</li>
            <li> It takes 1 minute to dry your nails and it let them shiny but it&#x27;s not a good coat because I have to re-do my nails every 4 days</li>
            <li> Hands down the best top coat ever! It leaves your nail polish looking shiny and decreases the drying process. Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> This by far is the best top coat I have ever had!! My polish lasted more than a week without chipping!!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wondering why this is so cheap it&#x27;s because the product is counterfeit. I noticed immediately that the box didn&#x27;t look as right. When I smelled the polish itself, it had a too strong odor that most fake polishes have. The bottle was misprinted and looked cheaply made. Also,  the bottle itself was semi dirty and from experience, I know that that&#x27;s not how real Seche Vite bottles are. On the plus side, it came with free \\&quot;OPI\\&quot; slippers which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong this topcoat is okay. But I have to say I&#x27;ve had much better results with the Sally Hansen topcoats. When I saw the massive number of 5 star reviews for Seche, I ordered a bottle expecting it to be at least as good as the Sally Hansen topcoat. I was really surprised to find that my nail polish chips a LOT sooner using this topcoat then when using my previous stuff. I didn&#x27;t even realize just how well my last topcoat was working until I used this instead. When I use any of the Sally Hansen topcoats, I can work my nails hard for 5 days (typing all day at work, doing dishes, taking care of my kids, etc) and I won&#x27;t get my first chip till about 5 days in. I&#x27;ve painted my nails twice now, using this topcoat afterwards, and by day 3 my nails are chipping all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how fast this topcoat dries, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent chips as well as the Sally Hansen brand topcoat does. I&#x27;ll use the rest of the bottle as my a topcoat on my toenail polish, since they never seem to chip anyway. But for my fingernails I&#x27;ll use something else, since with this I end up having to redo my nails more frequently than before. But I&#x27;m glad I tried it out, to see how well it would work.</li>
            <li> This the best top coat I have ever used, it drys in less than a minute and becomes rock solid afterwords, its super shiny and adds a professional look to any nail polish/art.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! If you are having problems with bubbles in your polish or just can&#x27;t sit around and wait an hour for your nails to dry, this is the top coat for you. I use OPI polish and this top coat now exclusively. After struggling with bubbles and time constraints waiting for other products tro dry I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. Miracle top coat. I&#x27;m typing this 16 minutes after doing my nails and not a mark on them! It leaves a smooth, super shiny salon finish and I&#x27;m ready to go. I&#x27;ll never be without this in my home manicure set. And I can say goodbye to salon prices!</li>
            <li> I love seche vite, it dries so quickly and gives my nails the best shine to them. Its the best topcoat i have used.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is the ish.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat out there. It keeps the shine. It drys fast. It does not go dull after washing hands and dishes</li>
            <li> This is my 4th bottle of Seche Vite and I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this top coat because it&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li> Before I talk about the product itself, I feel that it is important to mention the over-exaggerated topic of toluene. Whenever a \\&quot;health scare\\&quot; like this comes up, I always do the research. After reading so many reviews complaining about this horrible ingredient, I thought to myself, \\&quot;If it&#x27;s so bad, then why are the FDA allowing it into products at all?\\&quot; Sure, many brands have removed the ingredient, but if it were truly unsafe to use for the purpose for which it was intended, it wouldn&#x27;t be allowed in any brand. So after having done some research from reliable, credible sources, I stumbled across a few facts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, toluene is not cancer causing - so no need to worry about that. Over exposure to the ingredient can cause heart and neurological damage. For this reason alone, a warning label HAS to go on the box. It&#x27;s the same with paint thinners, gasoline, lacquers, and other industrial products made with the ingredient (or any known harmful ingredient) that the warnings be printed on the product. Please be aware that serious side effects are the result of OVER EXPOSURE and that regular, intended usage is nothing at all to be concerned about. The quantity of the ingredient is so low, the only way you&#x27;d really do damage is if you sat there and huffed the bottle. Using it for the purpose of a nail polish top coat is completely safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend using this if you are pregnant. All of the evidence points to severe effects only occurring with excessive exposure, but this is the only time I personally might not take the risk simply because it is strong-smelling. But overall, use this product as you are supposed to and you&#x27;ll have nothing to worry about. Remember to look at factual sources of evidence, and not automatically assume that someone&#x27;s anecdotal \\&quot;knowledge\\&quot; is somehow more accurate. You don&#x27;t even have to take my word for it; the sources are out there for you to research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself, as most others have mentioned, is fantastic. Dries within seconds and it&#x27;s such a relief not to feel like I can&#x27;t touch anything for several hours! This is the first bottle I&#x27;ve used, but so far it is my HG of top coats. My nails are hard, dry, and don&#x27;t chip with this stuff on. In fact, it&#x27;s somewhat hard to take the polish off when you&#x27;re ready! I cannot find a single thing wrong with this product and will continue to buy it for as long as it&#x27;s made.ers have mentioned, is fantastic.

            <li> The best top coat I have ever used. It drys supper fast and makes your manicure look shiny and bright!</li>
            <li> I change my polish often so I can appreciate a fast drying top coat. This fries within 2 mins and the glossy finish it has is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Good stuff but can buy locally. Don&#x27;t waste money on shipping</li>
            <li> This top coat is really amazing except, it is just a little too thick for me as a top coat.</li>
            <li> Keeps nail polish from chipping longer and provides professional shine that you get at the nail salon.  Excellent product~only top coat I use!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and works great! For years and years now I have always used Out the Door and thought that there was nothing better or faster, until I tried this stuff! This is a bit more expensive but worth it I think. I will buy this from now on,I just wonder if they make bigger bottles of this stuff.</li>
            <li> The polish gives a wonderful finish and very shiny so at first I was so happy with this product only to find out this top coat does not last, if it doesn&#x27;t peel off right away by the next day it will. Was very disappointed</li>
            <li> It is the best. Period. It leaves my nails glossy for weeks.</li>
            <li> well only one word very good top base and protect and dry fast  i would recommend it with no problem</li>
            <li> I always buy this brand.  It&#x27;s the best top coat available.  Very shiny and dries QUICKLY.  Don&#x27;t settle for less!</li>
            <li> This top coat is the best on the market, it gives a nice glossy finish and has superb dry time. My only complaint, which I&#x27;ve actually noticed with a multitude of top coats, is after a couple of months it starts to get goopy and thick.</li>
            <li> Love this Nail Polish, and finally paint it the color drifted, some minor defect is gone, so much the better, rather like.</li>
            <li> I work in New York, and all the professional manicurists say this is the best top coat. If you go in their shops and ask to buy a top coat, this is the only one they will sell you, and the only one they will use. So I tried it. Wow, what a difference! Manicures last much longer. Smooths out brush strokes. Doesn&#x27;t irritate nails or skin. I&#x27;ve done my own nails for 40 years, and this is by far the best top coat I&#x27;ve come across. The pros are right.</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff,it stays on my nails for very long time and looks like gel manicure,gonna buy more,thank you</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is my go to top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s there to say? It&#x27;s quick drying, crystal clear, and it gives you a wonderful glossy finish. It&#x27;s a life saver for those times I paint my nails in a rush before leaving the house, or nights when I have the bright idea of painting my nails right before bed. No more sheet marks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my favorite top coat for protecting nail art, as I find it doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear my designs. And it is great for sealing in unruly glitter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this top coat is that it does suffer some shrinkage, which becomes more apparent the longer you wear it. You&#x27;ll start to see your nail color has begun to pull back from the nail, and it may even curl up. I&#x27;m the kind of girl who paints her nails at least three times a week, so I rarely wear a manicure long enough for this to become an issue. However, I know many view it as a serious product fault so it&#x27;s something to be aware of.</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever, dries very hard and fast. I always regret not bring it with me to the nail salon because their top coats are never as good. I recommend purchasing Seche Restore with it, I even use Restore on normal nail polishes and it makes them better than new.</li>
            <li> This product is just amazing. Dries quickly and its long lasting. It also has the gel finish look. I&#x27;ve been recommending this product to all my friends.</li>
            <li> By far the best invention in nail upkeep ! This thing keeps ur manicures good for 5 days atleast! Super shiny and makes ur life less of a hassle really</li>
            <li> I never do reviews, but had too on this one! This is the best quick dry nail polish I&#x27;ve ever used. Awesome dry time. Fastest ever</li>
            <li> The best top coat ever. I always get asked if I got my nails done.</li>
            <li> No more waiting around for nail polish to dry.  Dries very quick and ready to go in 5 minutes.  Shine is awesome!</li>
            <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve ever used as a top coat for my nails! Nail polish and top coat dry within 5 minutes of application, and nail colors last longer without chipping! Plus, makes nail colors look almost like gel instead of regular polish. Shiny and great!</li>
            <li> OK, can I give this a MILLION stars?  I was very happy with my other quick dry top coats that I was using before I tired Seche Vite.  The reason I tried it, was that all the nail art vloggers  (The ones I like, I mean, on you tube), use Seche Vite, and mention it that it is their favorite topcoat.  Curiosity got the better of me.  I was thinking that it would be $10.00 per bottle or more, but it costs about the same as my other fast dry topcoats. Well, I generally have to do my nails every 3 days, but I have had this manicure for about 5 days, and it is still beautiful.  Almost feels  as if you got your nails laminated, though I don&#x27;t mean it is stiff or anything weird.  It just feels so smooth and nice.  The shine is crazy good.. If anyone out there wants a really good product of this type, you will not be disappointed.  I want to mention the smell.  The smell is a bit different than other topcoats, but that is because you smell something that works.  It does not smell better or worse than the other stuff.</li>
            <li> 1st timed I tried this top coat and I love love it. Definitely going to order again.</li>
            <li> best on the market. Does thicken in the bottle but can be easily restored with &amp;#34;Restore&amp;#34;.Best price @ Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am in love. I ordered from Altima Beauty. I paid a little more for it than the drugstore brand that I hate but use anyway. This literally is the BEST I have ever used. I was able to open mail within like 15 minutes. It is my first bottle and it will not be my last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;SUPER FAST DRYING&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t pick up color&lt;br /&gt;Great for chunky nail decorations like fimo roses and anything really&lt;br /&gt;Very High shine, even over matte polish&lt;br /&gt;Dries hard&lt;br /&gt;Easy cleanup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Strong smell, STRONG smell&lt;br /&gt;Takes longer on wet polish&lt;br /&gt;Almost dries too fast for really long nails&lt;br /&gt;Mine was kinda runny but its new&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Tips:&lt;br /&gt;Use this on dry nails&lt;br /&gt;Apply two coats for a very professional look&lt;br /&gt;Have a toothpick or something to clean any run off asap</li>
            <li> Great top coat! Not damaged upon delivery.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I&#x27;ve been using seche vite for the last 3 years or so, after going to a Miniluxe for a manicure and experiencing it there.  I bought a bottle on the spot but the price is much, much better on Amazon.  I&#x27;m not a great home manicurist and rarely make the effort because I usually mess up the polish minutes (or an hour) later.  This topcoat is amazing.  You do still have to be careful for a bit- it&#x27;s not magic.  But it does dry faster than others and maintains the glossiness for several days longer.  I use it to prolong a manicure or pedicure by adding my own topcoat every other day or so.  It keeps the polish looking fresh and shiny, and keeps the tips from wearing down or chipping.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also brought my own bottle (along with [[ASIN:B000J63372 Essie First Base Coat Nail Treatment]]) to other nail salons because I prefer these products and several have all remarked on what a great topcoat this is.  I&#x27;m not sure why most don&#x27;t use it.  I think it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;(for the other reviewers who mentioned it, it&#x27;s pronounced &#x27;sesh veet&#x27; French for quick dry)</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely life changing.  I bought it after I read about it on a nail blog, and it is so worth every penny it has saved me in time!  I can not only save money by doing my nails at home, but I can have them dry in 60 seconds flat, look like a professional did them, and go on about my business!  Also, the shine on your nails after you apply this stuff is out of this world.  Awesome product all the way around!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I have ever used. It dries fast and leaves the nail looking really shiny.</li>
            <li> friend loved it. great price also</li>
            <li> I swear by Seche Vite, any other top coat is not worth the money. It dries super fast and holds tight, securing your manicure in a matter of a couple minutes. Arrived as just the bottle with no extra packaging, no complains about the product or the shipping.</li>
            <li> Works great!!!! Super fast drying!</li>
            <li> Dries out to fast, but other than that its a great buy!</li>
            <li> it is actually fairly useful.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing manicure product I have ever met in my whole life. It seriously dries in minutes. After 5 minutes, I was able to press down on my freshly painted nail and it did not get messed up AT ALL. If you are on the fence at all, just buy it!! If you don&#x27;t like it, then I will buy if off you. HAHAHA. :)    I found out about this product at [...]. I figured I should give her a shout-out for the awesome recommendation.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. Super shiny, dries super quick,  and lasts! For the price you cant beat this stuff.</li>
            <li> Stop right here and buy this. It is the fastest drying to coat I&#x27;ve found so far! Love this stuff and you will appreciate it too!</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this I was blown away. My nails dried so fast! I was able to do my nails then run out the door with no smearing or smudging. for a little while I thought I found my Holy Grail top coat...and then DUN DUN DUUUUn the chipping began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing my nails a few times I noticed a lot of shrinkage and chipping the very next day after painting them. At first I passed it off thinking maybe I had just been unlucky and my nails ran up against to many things.&lt;br /&gt;After trying out multiple polish brand colors and varying amounts of coats I have concluded its the Seche Vite. I love to paint my nails a striking shade of crimson so they really pop so I have multiple brands and different shades; I have never had any problem with even the cheaper polishes chipping within a day. I painted my nails last night and by noon today they had huge chips in them. Even  tiny little chips looks horrible with red polish so multiple big ones are a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want your nails to dry super fast with no smudges so you can run out the door then seche vite is great but if you want your nails to last over 24 hours then try another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars for doing what it says, it gets two taken away for the crazy chipping.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite dries so quickly it&#x27;s amazing! If you have time to change your color on a daily basis, this is the product for you! Your manicure will last 2 days tops. I&#x27;m a busy woman. I have a desk job, so I&#x27;m constantly typing, and I&#x27;m also a busy mom and wife. All of these can be tough on a manicure, but I&#x27;d still expect more than a days worth of wear. I get more than a day from my Sally Hansen top coat, it just doesn&#x27;t dry as fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of great things about this clear coat from lots of different people so I decided to try it. I bought this and it does dry very fast and very smooth and glossy. After multiple times of trying to make this work, I&#x27;m never buying this top coat again. It peels!!! Let me explain, so I&#x27;ve used various brands of nail polish with this and everytime it did the same thing, and everytime like clockwork within 24-48 hours the clearcoat would start to peel and I have no clue how they got it to do this but it takes the polish completely off with it. Like it takes it off so cleanly that I don&#x27;t need nail polish remover before repainting my nails. It peels off each nail in one clean little sheet of polish and top coat. Ridiculous yet at the same time I can&#x27;t help but be amazed that it does that yet gets soo many people raving about it. I even tried buffing the surface off my nails and using that nail drying stuff manicurists use to help acrylics adhere to your nails and it still peeled my polish off just the same. :/ so disappointed, I&#x27;ve been better off just using polish without a top coat than using Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> This is my go to top coat, dries fast, leaves nails looking amazing.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. My nails are brittle but this helps them a lot. I stopped using it for 1 month and my nails went back to chipping. It is a life saver for nails. keeps your nails from chipping, it helps nail polish dry, and protects your nails-which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> This is the best ever never had a top coat like this ... Am 27 and I wish I known about this all my life .. Im so in love with this I have to buy at least one for each of my aunts and my mom and sister .... I can&#x27;t tell you how fast it dries .. It takes like 2 mins to dry to the touch and days in 10 mins ...al I can say is wow wow wow ...I don&#x27;t know how to explain it you have to buy this ..all nail shops should have this ...wow totally with the money</li>
            <li> I love that this really helps my nails dry super fast and leaves a really nice glossy finish. I also like that it smoothes out imperfections in the polish application. My issue with this is that it can chip easily. It made my zoya polish chip less than 24 hours after application. I&#x27;ll still use it because the amazing drying time makes it easy to retouch my polish as needed.</li>
            <li> Adds a lot of shine to your manicure and dries quickly. I found it to get thick very quickly, though, so I never got to use the entire bottle.</li>
            <li> dries super fast and looks great</li>
            <li> I was recommended this top coat instead of the more expensive one I normally buy.  BIG mistake!!!  I can&#x27;t get over how terrible this is!  Sure, it dries quickly, but so did my other top coat.  I can&#x27;t even get through 24 hours without my nails chipping (i.e. huge chunks) or this completely peeling off.  I don&#x27;t know how they manage it, but Seche Vite managed to make a top coat that doesn&#x27;t bond to nail polish (and no, I don&#x27;t use cheap Wal-Mart nail polish, I only use OPI.)  This is a definite don&#x27;t if you want your manicure to last longer than a day!</li>
            <li> I had low expectations but once I tried it I loved it dries fast and makes a nice shiny coat will be buying again👍👌</li>
            <li> Wow, just used and dries very fast with beautiful shiny coat!</li>
            <li> This is the only fast dry I use!</li>
            <li> I work in beauty retail and let me tell you, this is the only top coat I use and will probably ever use. It dries fast, gives you a glossy finish that lasts for days, and really keeps my nails looking good. I get asked almost every other day if I&#x27;m sporting gels. If you want to make your life easier, get this top coat. Seriously. And for the price? You can&#x27;t top it.</li>
            <li> Very great price. I usually buy this top coat at my nearby Sally&#x27;s whenever they have a BOGO sale on Seche. Packaging left no room for breakage on account of the amount of bubble wrap. I would buy again :)</li>
            <li> I should have returned this. I like Sally top coat way better than this. I can&#x27;t believe this had so many great review. How much can I trust review here is becoming really a question to me.    I have few things to say:    1. Package wasn&#x27;t well delivered.  2. It has a warning, \\&quot; this product containers a chemical known to the states of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.\\&quot; if I knew this, I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it.  3. peeled and came off whole piece in just few hours.</li>
            <li> My favorite top coat by far.</li>
            <li> Great top coat. Best I&#x27;ve used. Always take it with me to the salon to extend my mani pedi. Also use on my own. Big brush and goes on easy with no globs of polish.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this. I&#x27;m so glad I found a top coat like this. It dries my nails fast and makes them feel thicker than they are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many top coats but this is by far the best. Much better than essie quick dry top coat. I&#x27;m so very impressed at the shine and it has yet to chip.  This is going to be the only one I use from now on. I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
            <li> I love this top coat its all I use and not only does it have an addictive smell (no I&#x27;m not a sniffer but this is wonderful)it does not smear anything I put it over including pigments, shadows, glitters, stamping, etc. plus whatever polishes I use it over it makes dry so fast I think some companies sit around and get a kick out of making polishes that never dry but this definitely solves that problem.  Its also super shiny and brings whatever mani-pedi I create to life.</li>
            <li> Fake bottle, fake seche.... This works over nail art and won&#x27;t let it run, this stuff made it bleed beyond belief.  Great for Halloween, otherwise a true fake cheap clear coat</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, can&#x27;t do without. You can actually do your dishes after 10 or 15 mins. depending on how many coats you apply.</li>
            <li> This topcoat is the only reason I can do my own manicures. It dries in mere minutes to a glossy, impenetrable shield. Within 5 minutes it&#x27;s dry to the touch, and in 10 minutes I can do the dishes. It saves so much time and lasts at least 5-7 days. I usually get tired of the color and want to change it before there&#x27;s any noticeable tip wear. Oh, and chips are a thing of the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is when I use it with 5-free polishes like Zoya, it can shrink the polish a little leaving a small crack if I failed to cover the entire polish underneath. It&#x27;s not a big deal to me since it&#x27;s barely noticeable and being a little careful with applying it eliminates the problem entirely. I didn&#x27;t see the need to subtract a star for this though.</li>
            <li> Chips the very next day!!! Not sure if this is the real product or a forgery but I usually use Sally Hansen Diamond Strength Diamond Flash top coat and I don&#x27;t see chips for many days. I only bought this because of the great reviews. This leads me to believe the product is either old or fake. Never buying again.</li>
            <li> Just as described.  A friend warned me that people like to water down Seche Vite and re-sell it. I can guarantee this is NOT the case for this product, it is definitely the real deal.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> This product is not as great as it&#x27;s talked up to be.  Chips and rubs off your nails very soon after applying</li>
            <li> other top coats try to imitate it. Its simply the best!</li>
            <li> This top coat is awesome and works really quickly - just like the name promises.</li>
            <li> This is my perfect top coat. It makes my polish dry in a quarter of the time, makes your polish look like gel (thick and shiny), and keeps my polish from chipping. My nail polish lasts at least twice as long with this top coat.</li>
            <li> By far the best top coat polish!!! Nothing compares. It dries very quickly!!!</li>
            <li> glossy, dries quick, inexpensive.  you really cannot ask for more!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this stuff is. It dries in no time at all and is as glossy as it gets. Very durable wear. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> i really like this top coat except that it smells horrible(but this is not a problem) it gives great shine to your nails</li>
            <li> While it does help the polish dry much quicker, it creates this peeling effect. So instead of the nail polish chipping, it just peels right off...I mean all 3/4 coats of polish.</li>
            <li> Best top coat out there that I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> This the best top coat EVER.  I have tried every kind of top coat around and nothing comes close to the performance of this product.  As soon as I get home from the salon, I put at least one if not more coats of this top coat on my manicure.  Not only does it protect it for up to a week but the this top coat dries in a matter of minutes.  I come from the salon slightly mushy, add the Seche Vite and I don&#x27;t have to worry about ruining my manicure.</li>
            <li> This stuff dries super fast, which I do like alot! I notice though if you apply too many of these top coats it hardens the polish so much that it can break off! Just be careful with that.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best top coat I&#x27;ve found. It makes little imperfections disappear. Lasts a long time and is extremely shiny. A must have for any nail polish fan!</li>
            <li> Shortens significantly life of nail polish. But looks nice for the first few hours..Before it starts coming off..</li>
            <li> Love it! Dries fast to a patent leather, liquid shine. Pretty sturdy, too.</li>
            <li> This is the best TOP COAT!  I have tried multiple top coats and this is always the one I go back to!  Cheapest on Amazon as well! Try it!!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!! :)</li>
            <li> I could never get nail polish to last more than a day until I discovered this top coat! Dries polish fast so I don&#x27;t have to worry about denting or smudging it while being to impatient to hold still while it dries. Keeps polish on securely for days. I&#x27;ve had a few manicures last a whole week with this!</li>
            <li> This is my new HG top coat. I was really just looking for something simple, but tthis is a miracle in a bottle and completely worth a few extra bucks. Amazon offers a good price, as I saw these later at Ulta for $9 or $10. Anyways, the product does everything it promises to: apply, wait ten minutes, and your nails are dry. As a top coat it performs as well as any top coat I&#x27;ve ever used: keeps my nail color perfect for at least a few days before any chipping or wearing. If you don&#x27;t use your nails for everything, like I do, a coat or two of this could probably keep your nails shiny and perfect for a week or more. TRY IT!</li>
            <li> I love this top coat.  It gives an awesomely shiny finish to any brand of nail color.  It looks salon done.  This still chips on me, even using top quality color, but I am a waitress and that is to be expected.  It does take a lot more time to chip than other top coats.  So until I find some miracle formula that never ever chips, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing top coat ever! It&#x27;s crazy how quick it dries! I will definitely buy again. I was skeptical at first but once you try it, you will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Love this top coat.  Fast drying, nice shiny finish.  Finishes your manicure in a wonderful way.  Once I tried this top coat, I knew it was the best, in every way.</li>
            <li> I would always mess up my manicure because it wasn&#x27;t dry…not anymore!! I love this polish!! It&#x27;s shiny and dries quickly!!</li>
            <li> Love love this product!!! Drys super quick and gives you that fresh mani look</li>
            <li> I originally tried this product based solely on its description on another website. The idea that it penetrates all layers of polish to make one, solid covering sounded intriguing. Add to that the \\&quot;self-leveling\\&quot; properties and quick-dry claims and I was sold.    Fast forward to when I finally got around to purchasing it. The first time I topped off my carefully executed manicure with this delectable treat, I knew I would never use another top coat ever again. It brushed on so smoothly, leveling everything off beautifully. As I continued to use this product over the course of dozens of manicures and pedicures, I grew to love it more and more. It would even out creases caused by my carelessness and still leave me with a glass-like finish that dried lickety-split.    Now, one thing I MUST point out is that, over time, this product will begin to thicken due to evaporation. It is IMPERATIVE that you DO NOT attempt to thin it out with acetone or nail polish remover. Seche has been able to pin-point the cause of this thickening and they created [[ASIN:B0017ZDH52 Seche Restore Restoration Thinner .5 fl oz (14 ml)]] to reverse the evaporation. Seche Restore is specifically formulated to replace only those ingredients that have evaporated, restoring the once thick mess back to its former glory.    So, be sure to tightly cap it after every use, and be prepared for it to thicken up. It will happen. It happens to ALL nail polishes and top coats. This one is no different. You&#x27;ll probably just notice it sooner with the Seche Vite because you&#x27;ll be using it ALL THE TIME!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  IT DRIES FAST AND I LOVE THE SHINE.  THE NAIL POLISH SEEMS TO LAST LONGER AND I FEEL IT MAKES MY NAILS FEEL STRONGER.  I WON&#x27;T BUY ANY OTHER DRY FAST TOP COAT.</li>
            <li> great top coat at an amazing price</li>
            <li> If you paint your own fingernails, this is a must have.  It allows the polish to dry quickly and chipping is nearly non existent.  It comes off easy with polish remover, not like the glitter polish.  Makes your nails look salon quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if this top coat is better than the cheaper ones, as this is my first time actually using one. I will say that it seemed to preserve my polish a few days more.</li>
            <li> If you paint your nails in any sort of serious capacity, you&#x27;ve probably heard of SV.  I find that there are some minor flaws with the product, but it works better than any other brand I&#x27;ve used thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful, glossy finish.&lt;br /&gt;Dries very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Can be applied over wet polish.&lt;br /&gt;Protects your manicure to give it some staying power.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re stamping, it won&#x27;t smear your stamps (let it dry just a bit first) and it keeps it looking nice and intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Some polishes are more susceptible to peeling when SV has been applied.  Not chipping or flaking - the edges lift and literally the entire coat of polish will peel clean off.  These are polishes that do not peel otherwise.  It seems to happen most in conjunction with OPI polishes.&lt;br /&gt;You may need to replace it sooner than you think.  After about 6 months and with half a bottle left, my last bottle started drying so quickly that I couldn&#x27;t even get it on the nail.  A fresh bottle resolved this, and it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s terribly pricy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a very good product that will give you very nice results.  If you enjoy painting your nails you really need this in your arsenal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought so many of these that it&#x27;s insane!  This has to be the number 1 top coat out there!  It&#x27;s durable and oh my gosh so shiny!!!  I use it every time I paint my nails, and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results.  Nothing else on the market compares.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else.</li>
            <li> As someone who was previously spoiled by getting gel manicures at the salon, I never had to worry about chipping or drying my nails. Now I have been trying to save money and do my own nails and it&#x27;s been a struggle because I always mess them up while they&#x27;re drying OR I chip them constantly. Someone I know recommended this and I saw excellent reviews so I ordered this and was very excited about this. I will say that Seche Vite dries very quickly, with no bubbles in the polish so that&#x27;s great. It makes your nails look shiny and bright, and it&#x27;s a high quality top coat. However as far as chipping, it&#x27;s no better than any other top coats. My nails chipped hours after they were dry. Maybe I am just too rough with my hands, but I am still frustrated that no top coat actually doesn&#x27;t chip like their claims say. I was pretty disappointed. But I will keep using it since it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does dry very fast.  The problem is that by the very next day, polish is chipping and peeling off.  I even tried using another top coat on top of this one, and had same results.</li>
            <li> I had so many high hopes for this top coat because it had so many reviews and rah rah comments but I just did not find it to be all that it was cracked up to be. For starters, it goes on extremely thick, so you have to make sure that don&#x27;t pick up too much on the brush. The brush brings me to my next gripe, when I opened my particular bottle, the bristles of the brush are stuck together and it sucked trying to get them apart to where they&#x27;d apply the product decently. Be aware of the tons of positive feedback and don&#x27;t get caught up in the hype.</li>
            <li> Dries very quick and lasts long! Great product. Buying more when I run out!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product. Would never switch. My polish lasts atleast 5 days at least with this top coat. I had read a lot of reviews on it before I purchased. I hate painting my nails for them to only chip in 24 hours. You will not be dissapointed if you purchase this product!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t hate this product even if I want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great and THEN some.&lt;br /&gt;SO at first, I didn&#x27;t want to buy it because of the review about the Toluene that was in it. But when I bought it and used it, and saw how PERFECT they made my manicures, I had to study more about toluene. I couldn&#x27;t possibly stop using the nail polish because it was JUST PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle does have a warning on it about how SV \\&quot;contains a chemical that has been known in the state of California to cause Birth defects or possible reproductive problems\\&quot;.  WHEN I read that, I WAS LIKE OH NO!!! The warning didn&#x27;t say whether Toluene was the bad chemical though. Hmmph?&lt;br /&gt; Anyway, I used the nail polish again, and it was dry within seconds, shiny, perfect, no smudge, and just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the nail polish, but the Toluene bothered me.  I later learned that Toluene is taken in the body through inhalation.. so I somehow found a solution. I Use a facial mask when I paint my nails now. This product is all I have been waiting for. I love doing my own nails. it dries in seconds. I can take a shower after 15 minutes of applying, and no smudge or imprints on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use my mask right now, and I will probably stop using this product because my mind is not totally at peace with it yet.. but it really is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I have a problem with the product, I won&#x27;t take away more than one star. Because it actually does what it says (and then some -- like a birth defect maybe?)lol.. Ok I kid.. But u get my point right?</li>
            <li> I ordered Seche Vite on October 25th, and recieved it today October 27th. I couldn&#x27;t imagine how quick it showed up! I Really love this product! It dries so quickly. I hated the days of having to wait forever for my nail polish to dry.</li>
            <li> I read a magazine that this was a great top coat and I completely agree. I love this clear nail polish. Its not sticky or anything. Its just right!</li>
            <li> I had bought the OPI top coat but it turned really thick and I had to throw it out. This one goes on so smooth and leaves a nice thick coat on the nail. I love it.</li>
            <li> I got this top coat after reading all the rave reviews on Amazon.  This top coat works WONDERS.  It dries your nails in just minutes and leaves a wonderful sheen on your nails.I&#x27;ve done my nails right before bed and never had any problems with sheet nails.</li>
            <li> I have tried A LOT of topcoats and have been sorely disappointed...  I read the reviews for this and decided to give it a shot.  Wow!!!  I won&#x27;t use anything else!  This is the BEST topcoat!  Very shiny, very durable, dries FAST, too!  After I ordered the first bottle and tried it, I went back online and ordered three MORE bottles!!!</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best topcoat ever made. I&#x27;m always thrilled with it! A few important tips. First, you MUST apply this gently, while your base color is still wet. The best way is to get a bead of Seche Vite on the end of your brush, and gently smooth it over your nail. You may end up with a tiny bit of shrinkage of the color around your cuticle and edge of your nails, but I personally have not. I&#x27;ve heard some people do. Second, if you&#x27;re planning on painting on art of some kind (polka dots, stripes, whatever your fancy), I do my base color, then Seche Vite, my art, then more Seche Vite. I swear, five minutes after I put 3 or 4 coats of polish and this miracle, I can do laundry without a single smudge or smear! I can finish my nails, then leave right away for work. My ONLY gripe about it, is that about halfway through the bottle, it thickens almost too much to use. Its really nothing that a little polish thinner can&#x27;t fix though. Overall, this always gets me compliments on my nails. It has a shellac finish that lasts until I intentionally remove it with polish remover. The easiest way is to unroll a cotton ball, then tear it in half down the middle. Then tear off 10 pieces from that one cotton ball. Pour some remover into the cap from the bottle, dip one end of each piece into the remover, and place each one on your nails. Let it sit for a minute, and all the polish wipes away in one simple swipe (I always use pure acetone. It may take a minute longer with regular remover)!&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps my fellow polish addicts!</li>
            <li> Love this fast nail coat. It dries very easy and quick. It keeps my nail polish looking nice and bright. I will buy more.</li>
            <li> I really like this top coat but lately I have been double guessing myself. Dries very fast but sometimes clumps on the sides.</li>
            <li> Why is this so expensive at salons and so cheap online?? This stuff is one of my favorite beauty products.  Never smudge your nails again!!</li>
            <li> I usually were OPI fast dry top coat but found that it gets thick very fast, and I have to purchase a new one.  I asked the clerk at my local Beauty First what she recommended and she said most definitely Seche Vite.  I am utterly disappointed.  The top coat I put on my toes has lasted over a week.  That is good.  Second, it does dry fast.  I put it over a french manicure and it lasted 2 days before chipping.  Then I used it as just a base coat until I could get a color on my nails.  It started PEELING, yes, the whole coat peeled right off, the same evening.  I paid $10 for this and expect a much better product.  Very disappointed.  I thought maybe you were only supposed to put one coat on (I did two) but after reading some of the other review I do not think that is the case.  I will be taking it back. Oh yah, and it really has a bad odor too!</li>
            <li> I picked up Seche Vite Dry Fast Top coat while I was in a hurry at Beauty First. I had never heard of it but it was cheap and looked like it would get the job done. I came to find that it is one of the best nail products I have ever used. What a great surprise!!! It lives up to its promise of drying fast and makes my color last forever and look amazing. People are always asking me if I&#x27;ve had a fresh manicure and complimenting my nails. I never review products but this one really deserves a great one. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!! Plus, the price is almost too good to be true!</li>
            <li> So shiny! ... yes, quick drying too!</li>
            <li> It dries really fast...but the nail polish come off like a fake nail....in a matter of hours</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. It dries quickly &amp; makes your nails shiny &amp; hard, smoothing out any mistakes along the way.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth I like it</li>
            <li> There is no comparison.  This is THE top coat you need.  I am amazed by how quickly it dries, and it&#x27;s a great glossy coverage.</li>
            <li> simply the best. the FASTEST drying topcoat i have ever used-- i can now paint my nails and not wait around for them to dry!</li>
            <li> Great quality product, quick drying, nice smooth texture, I do my nails more often with this product as the manicure and pedicure lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Whatever this stuff is I have to have several bottles! My nails look glamorous!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  BEST TOP COAT AVAILABLE!!</li>
            <li> You have to try this stuff!  After trying tons of top coats, this is the one I buy again and again!  It leaves a really nice glossy finish.  It also fills in any imperfections after you have painted your nail.  If there is a smudge on the nail polish or the color is slightly uneven, this covers it right up! Love it!</li>
            <li> Best topcoat I&#x27;ve ever used! Dries my nails almost instantly. Makes my nails harder to break as well. I&#x27;ll never buy another topcoat! This one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> The only reason this gets two stars is because of how fast it dries. It dries quickly and is nice and shiny. However, within a day or two, it&#x27;s peels off! In huge sections! I don&#x27;t understand the ratings for this top coat- it&#x27;s the worst one I&#x27;ve ever used. :(</li>
            <li> best top coat there is</li>
            <li> I used to wear polish every single day -- then I had kids &amp; never had time anymore. 12 years later, I have now started researching polishes &amp; top/base coats. Bought a bottle of Stickey &amp; a bottle of Seche Vite. Used a good polish -- which was also fast dry so I probably wouldn&#x27;t have needed a top coat, except everyone recommended it. Did my nails on Saturday -- base, 2 coats of color, Seche top -- &amp; yes my nails dried fast &amp; were super shiny. But within 24 hours, they were already chipping &amp; peeling. And I didn&#x27;t even do any dishes in that time. Very disappointed -- so my search for a good fast drying top coat continues.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible! It dries super fast, leaving a nice and professional high gloss finish. The problem is it doesn&#x27;t last long!  You really do have to try it to believe it. This quick dry is a life saver for a busy girl and mom. Put the babies to sleep, redo your polish, and go to sleep yourself! In drug stores this runs about $9.99 and it would be worth every penny, but...  Wet n Wild&#x27;s 99cent topcoat actually does a better job preserving a manicure! Just from scratching your head over night in your sleep, you may very well see slightly worn tips in the morning depending. By day 2-3, your nails appear to be over due for a manicure. If you enjoy frequent color changes, this might not be a problem at all! For me it&#x27;s either this or risk waking up with fabric prints in my polish (meaning I&#x27;ll have to redo/remove my polish anyway).  I&#x27;ve tried this over Essie, OPI, and L&#x27;oreal. Each time the problem with wear is the same. I&#x27;m guessing this quick wearing process is due to it drying into one solid coat with the nail polish beneath (according to the description in the packaging). Naturally, the quick wear and frequent mini manicures mean the bottle doesn&#x27;t last very long.   Since I  wasn&#x27;t too keen on changing my polish every two days like clockwork, I decided to try quick dries by a few other companies. Compared to Salley Hansen, Out The Door, and Essie, Seche Vite comes out on top if you really don&#x27;t want to wait. Out the door is the runner up. The Sally Hansen and Essie I returned to the store as they cannot be applied to wet polish without messing up a manicure.   Out the Door preserves a manicure slightly longer than Seche Vite, but there is a problem with drying time. Out the Door may feel dry on top, yet not be totally dry underneath. Because of this, when I used Out the Door 50% of the times I woke up the next day with fabric prints in at least one of my nails. This happened even when I polished my nails an hour or two before bed, and waited a few minutes between coats. Seche Vite was the only one I tried that *completely* dried in minutes.   Unlike Seche Vite, with Out the Door you may end up with bubbles if you apply it too heavily. So, to get the shine of Seche Vite without the bubbles, you may need to apply two thinner coats of Out the Door. With Seche Vite, which goes on heavily, you still have to watch out for bubbles once you&#x27;re 3/4 through the bottle. (I haven&#x27;t tried using a polish thinner to know if it resolved the problem without reducing its effectiveness.)  While I hate that Seche Vite wears on the tips so easily, and it also gets goopy once you&#x27;re halfway through the bottle, I&#x27;ve been spoiled already by the super fast drying time! I&#x27;m now on bottle number 2 and this stuff is a keeper!</li>
            <li> I mix and match different brands, because I&#x27;ve found that within a single brand will always have some polishes that chip easily and some that look good and last. I always use an ORLY Color Blast glitter polish on the top half of my nails before applying Seche Vite top coat. I also wait 12 hours or so after applying the polish before putting on a final Seche Vite top coat, because I found that this somehow makes the polish last significantly longer before chipping/bubbling...    Here are the polishes I&#x27;ve used with this:     - Ciate with Seche Vite lasts 5~10 days  - Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear with Seche Vite lasts 7~12 days.. Basically minimal chipping all the way until my nails have grown out from the base enough that it looks bad and I remove it all.  - OPI (silver polish) lasts 3~5 days. I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the fault of the OPI polish and not this top coat, seeing as the other brands/colors last a long time.    So this top coat is working very well with the routines I have so far. :O I&#x27;m not sure which polish is improving the longevity more, but everything put together is working! So that&#x27;s that!    More random notes:    - dries in under 2 minutes  - smooth, glossy feel... can apply a thick, smooth coat or a thin one. Either works well.  - completely colorless</li>
            <li> Great top coat. Put it on my nails and they are practically perfect, WEEKS later!&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic clear coat that does not yellow.</li>
            <li> Believe the other reviews - this is the real deal. In an incredibly short time, your nails are dry and your hands usable. As a busy mom, this is huge.  Now, for me, it does not seem to increase the duration of my manicure, but it also doesn&#x27;t seem to make it any shorter. I&#x27;m really delighted and just bought a second bottle.</li>
            <li> This has got to be the best top coat I&#x27;ve used.  It makes your nails look so shiny like you&#x27;ve coated them in oil.  It dries quickly, just make sure the color coat is mostly dry so the brush doesn&#x27;t streak the color.  Will continue to use with all my polish.</li>
            <li> I ordered this polish because I needed a good top coat and this one had great reviews. The shipping was very quick, which is always a plus. Once I tried it I saw that they don&#x27;t call it fast-dry for nothing! Within a few minutes I could use my hands freely without smudging my nails. One small problem is that it is very thick, so if you miss a spot while you&#x27;re applying it, the final product varies in thickness and may look slightly blotchy. Other than that though, it&#x27;s a great product! It&#x27;s shiny, dries quickly, and is fairly chip-resistant. Worth more than the small price.</li>
            <li> Great Price.. Cheaper than the store prices.</li>
            <li> Cannot believe how good it is !! My nails dried super fast in 5 minutes and shiny too!</li>
            <li> Keeps nails from chipping for at least a week and smooths out flaws in nail polish</li>
            <li> Best over the counter top coat! Dries fast and hard, stays really glossy.</li>
            <li> Dries super fast. I do my nails at night sometimes i fall asleep before the completely dry... im the morning..Yuk! Great product for me.</li>
            <li> Love how fasts this dries , awesome top coat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about this top coat from an Ulta employee but just thought it would be a waste of money.  Then I came across all of these reviews and figure I would give it a try when I saw at Bed Bath and Beyond.  This stuff drys my polish so quickly and leaves such a nice shiny coat!  I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it dried!  No more waiting until I go to bed to do nails when I woke up with smudges anyway.  Now I can paint anytime of day!!</li>
            <li> Easily the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  Not only does it keep my nails from chipping, but it&#x27;s dries them quickly as well!      I have long, natural nails and never painted them because my polish was chipped or smudged within an hour of a manicure.  I use China Glaze polish, this top coat and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with how my nails turn out.  Dries quickly, and my nails have yet to chip (longest I&#x27;ve went is 4 days with the same color.)  I wash dishes, wash clothes, clean litter boxes, work on PC&#x27;s, shower and work on my car; all with my nails looking great!      The clerk at Sally Beauty Supply gave me a tip; always use a top coat or your polish will peel off in one sheet (as other reviewers have mentioned.)  I use China Glaze base coat, 2 coats of polish and this top coat for perfect nails every time.    I haven&#x27;t had any problem applying the top coat, and the resulting shine is beautiful!</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular; I think I get about an additional day or two wear out of it than I would another top coat.</li>
            <li> This product is so good it doesn&#x27;t make sense.  It dries so fast it&#x27;ll make your head spin, then to make matters inconceivably better, the finish is super hard, shiny and long lasting.  I don&#x27;t see how a top coat can get any better.  Whatever those chemists did, they did it right.  This product transformed my position on painting my nails.  It took me from hating to paint my nails, to loving it.  All that sitting around waiting for drying was really cramping my style, it was like I was sitting there watching my life pass before my eyes waiting for nail polish to dry.  The crazy fast drying speed of this magic potion is a deal maker.  Now I&#x27;ll be doing my nails all the time.  Thank you Seche Vite for the good work in Chemistry you&#x27;ve done here.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews I decided I had to try this top coat for myself. I must say that overall I truly love it. Normally, it takes forever for my nails to dry after a base coat, two nail polish coats and the top coat. However, with Seche Vite Dry Fast, I didn&#x27;t have to worry after a half hour (more like 15 minutes actually). Plus, my nails were shiny and smooth as glass. The one downside is that it has a very strong smell. Much stronger than any top coat I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*update* I have had this for a while now and the one downside is it no longer applies easily. It seems thicker even and is very stringy as I apply. It&#x27;s practically impossible to apply it evenly now. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve had the same bottle for awhile or not but wanted to give a heads up.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this product seems great.  It dries quickly; however, you still have to be delicate with your nails.  I&#x27;ve read that after 5 minutes of applying the product you should be able to resume normal activity.  That&#x27;s DEFINITELY not the case.  I did this to test it and managed to severely smudge the tips of two of my fingers (right pointer and left thumb).  It does dry to a glossy, \\&quot;wet\\&quot; finish.  HOWEVER, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m going to continue to use this product.  I got a VERY annoying humming in my ears while using this product.  It was loud and very uncomfortable.  I looked up symptoms of exposure to toluene and it said ringing in the ears was one of them.  I thought using the product on my nails wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal but this ear problem really bothered me.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying the product for this exact reason.  Find something that is \\&quot;Big 3 Free.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> There were so many positive comments about this product, I felt I just had to give it a try.  On the positive side:  it dries quickly and leaves nails with a nice shine.  I&#x27;ve had no problem putting the product on my nails, as others have indicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side:  Chipping is awful!  And this is not tip \\&quot;wearing\\&quot; chipping...chipping along the bottom of nail, side of nail, bottom of nail.  This occurs the very next day, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was interested in the Sache Vite (or some product) for shine and not necessarily for a quick dry.  But...what&#x27;s the point in shiny nails when they&#x27;re a mess the next day (or at least one or two nails).  The quick dry is a nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high expectations and am disappointed.  So...I won&#x27;t be getting any additional bottles of Sache Vite and will continue to look for a product which leaves nail with a high shine.</li>
            <li> Shiny nails and super fast dry! I recommend it HIGHLY!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat. It dries quickly and leaves a high gloss!</li>
            <li> Goes on good with lots of shine</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this after the first use. I barely need five minutes for my nails to be completely dry. I&#x27;m very fidgety - meaning, of course, that my manicures are infallibly ruined within ten minutes of me finishing them. Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Cost puts an end to all that. No more sheet marks overnight or me ruining my nails accidentally running my hand through my hair. It dries to a glossy, hard coat and is definitely going to be a go-to product for me.</li>
            <li> Love it !!! Best and Fastest to coat I own.</li>
            <li> So my old standby is the Sally Hansen quick dry topcoat in the reddish orangish bottle.  Which I love, but about halfway through the bottle, it gets thick and stringy.  There&#x27;s also definitely a &amp;#34;Shrinkage&amp;#34; issue with the SH topcoat.  Not so with this one from Seche Vite! This takes some getting use to, the application is very different than the SH.  I expect this will get thick halfway through, just like with SH, but I bought the Restore drops, which will bring this back to life.  Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> very good top coat, not the best one, but it does its job for a very decent price.</li>
            <li> This top coat dries really fast, in about 5-10 minutes your nails are up for anything! It leaves a surface that is smooth and super shiny, and it looks fantastic. Holds long. It&#x27;s the best i&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> Singlehandedly the best topcoat polish ever made! It goes on very smooth and easily, even though it is thick. It drys quickly, so there&#x27;s no accidental oopsies while waiting for my nails to dry. Best part is that it is so thick and silky smooth, that when I put it over my bubbling color polish, it smooths all the bubbles out and saves me from having to re-do them all! Seriously, this stuff is magic, I&#x27;ll never use another topcoat polish ever again!</li>
            <li> I use this every time now!  No more worries about bumping into something and messing up the polish.  Remember to put it over WET nail polish.</li>
            <li> Dried polish very quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this Top Coat nail polish several times and will continue to order it.  It helps keep my nail polish from chipping and fading.  It&#x27;s a good product and dries really fast.  I have also used it alone as a clear polish so you get two uses for one product. It&#x27;s the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. The price isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> Found out about this product at a high-end spa in Evanston, IL.  I&#x27;ve used it ever since and just love its protective aspect (doesn&#x27;t chip and lasts about a week).  The very BEST aspect, though, is that it really DOES dry in a minute or so.  So many products SAY they do this but they just don&#x27;t.  My nails have thrived after using Seche-Vite.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazeballs - seriously. I first heard of it from every nailpolish blogger ever (thanks, pinterest - who knew such things existed??)... and they all said they used this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was curious but I&#x27;m also a cheapskate, so I was pleasantly surprised at the price point. I ordered one (but then impatiently bought one the next day at my local CVS drugstore when I saw it!) and was completely giggity over how well this stuff works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the sheen is incredible. Waaay shinier than normal topcoats, which is cool. Think automotive clearcoat - glassy and smooth and awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the wear is unbelievable - just out of curiousity, I left on the first pedicure I coated with this stuff for over three weeks, just to see what it would do; by the time I couldn&#x27;t stand the growth any longer I still had very shiny, barely-scuffed-at-the-tips toes. Crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all is the way this stuff dries - and I do mean DRIES, all the way through - so quickly! None of that thing where it feels dry to the touch, but it&#x27;s still gooey inside so you get sheet marks overnight... DRY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff. Get you some.</li>
            <li> Heard great reviews, hence I bought it. I saw a little to no difference and my nail polish started chipping off 2 days after wearing Seche Vite as a top coat :(. maybe a good quality top coat, but not long lasting effect.</li>
            <li> There is a reason this has so many great reviews. It dries quickly and keeps your nails from chipping for more than a week. And for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I like it!!! This fast top better then i used befor.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this because she said her nails dry in 2-3 minutes and never chip. Using it myself now, I completely agree that it only takes a couple minutes to completely dry. My nails still chip in 2 or so days, but that may just be because I wash my hands constantly. I think the speed at which this top coat dries makes it well worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> This dry fast top coat does wonders.  It only takes 5 minutes to dry so the color isn&#x27;t smudged.  Not only is it quick drying it is also long lasting.  This top coat keeps the color from chipping for up to 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am never painting my nails without this again!  I figured it would help them dry quicker than usual but my nails were completely dry in a min or two! I did not even have to be careful, I took out the garbage ect.  This stuff is great! A must have!</li>
            <li> I love this topcoat! Nothing compares to this. It was a great deal at amazon and delivered very quickly. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> No other top coat I&#x27;ve tried dries as quickly! It doesn&#x27;t smear nail art like most will. No matter how long you wait, that black nail art penning would always streak across the white. Not with Seche Vite. Always perfect and a super glossy finish that keeps my nails from chipping for up to two weeks. Follow the instructions- get that nice bead on your brush. Halfway through the bottle it gets a bit thicker but I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it. I have recommended this product to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Love this top coat! It dries my nails extremely fast. I use it in conjunction with a nail drying spray and my nails are dry within 5 mins.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Ultra glossy and dries so fast I was doing laundry within 20 minutes and no smudging! It&#x27;s hard and I think I&#x27;ve finally found my new top coat!</li>
            <li> I have tried LOTS of nail products and this top coat is the best!  It&#x27;s shiny and dries really fast I have recommended it to everyone I know!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat ever. I&#x27;d been hearing rave reviews for years and never paid much mind. Finally I ran out of the Revlon Colorstay top coat and decided to try this. It&#x27;s amazing. It dries almost instantly. It lasts very well. It creates a glass-like shine.</li>
            <li> Dry super fast!!! I always mess up my nails waiting for it to dry. especially after I top coat cause I usually got very impatient. I used to use OPI but they just dont dry fast enough. This is a life saver.</li>
            <li> Very fast drying top coat</li>
            <li> After looking at all the amazing reviews, I told myself I had to buy this top coat. As always, even when buying products with such high reviews, you may fall under the small percentage of people that don&#x27;t end up liking the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this on right when I got it. I had just painted my nails and this arrived in perfect timing (yay!). Right when I painted my nails, I swear that this top coat really did dry my nails right away. This dry fasy top coat is hands down the best top coat I have ever used!! I literally felt my nail lightly after less than a minute and my nail was dry. I then checked my other nails and they were dry too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I give this a 5/5 for how fast it dries. It however doesn&#x27;t end there I promise. My nails usually have a light shine to them after putting a top coat, but that shine goes away after a few hours. NOT WITH THIS TOP COAT! My nails look like I got them done and continued to have a flawless glossy finish for days. I also love that if your polish smudges at all this top coat fixes that problem right away. Thumbs up to this dry fast top coat. Out of the numerous brands I&#x27;ve tried, I hadn&#x27;t ever seen a difference in the quality. This one is tremendous! If you want an amazing top coat, search no more. Buy this and save yourself money on manicures. Love this product. I even bought my both my best friend and my sister a bottle because of how amazing it is. Everyone should purchase this!</li>
            <li> I know I am in the minority but I do not care for Seche Vite at all. The first thing you will notice when you open the bottle is the odor - it is overwhelming and gives me a headache after only moments. It smells because it contains Toluene - one of the \\&quot;big 3&#x27;s\\&quot; that most polish companies have removed from their lacquers and treatments. Because of the toluene Seche Vite simply does not work with Big 3 Free polishes. You will notice your polish shrinking on the edges as it dries, and that your manicures just don&#x27;t last. As you get down to the second half of the bottle, the product starts to thicken considerably which makes it hard to spread onto your nails. You will notice as this happens that when you apply it onto your wet polish the polish will drag, wrinkle, and look streaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note- You MUST apply Seche Vite to wet polish. Wait no more than a couple minutes before you apply it or your polish will come off in a big sheet. You cannot use it to \\&quot;refresh\\&quot; the shine on a manicure you&#x27;ve been wearing for a couple days as that will make it come off in a sheet as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What kills it for me is the smell. I just can&#x27;t get past it and that is why I will not purchase this product again. If you are looking for a good quick dry top coat that is shiny and gives you the glassy look that Seche Vite does, I recommend Poshe Super Fast Drying Top Coat. It has some of the problems Seche Vite does (must apply to wet polish, starts to thicken as you use up the bottle), but I do believe it is much, much better.</li>
            <li> How did I live 23 years without this? This top coat it is amazing. It dries your nails in like 5 minutes they are hard as rock, it doesnt matter how many layers of polish you have on. I f you order this don&#x27;t forget to order the Seche Vite restore. It is also sold here</li>
            <li> dries nail polish super quick, I&#x27;m never without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably the most impatient person to ever give nail art a try. But lucky for me I found this little gem, and now I only have to wait a few minutes regardless of how many coats are beneath this top coat. The only problem I had was that it sometimes peeled off with some nail polishes, but stayed on great with my lacquers.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t paint my nails without it!!!</li>
            <li> I had been using OPI and Sally Hansen top coat for the past few years now, and ordered a bottle of this just to see what the hype was about. Aaaand oh my goodness this top coat is like no other. It dries (enough to touch without smudging) within a minute, and with a smooth, glossy finish that I didn&#x27;t even know was physically possible for nail polish to have. It does have a kind of strange smell, but for the end result, I absolutely do not mind.</li>
            <li> I have gone through 2 bottles of this product and my third has recently arrived. The reason I originally purchased this top coat was because I have no patience when it comes to waiting for nail polish to dry. Before this, I would always (and i do mean ALWAYS) end up ruining one or two nails of freshly applied polish. OR i would end up with lines from my sheets since I due my nails usually before bed.&lt;br /&gt;The first bottle didn&#x27;t goop up on me, but the second slightly did- I do recall seeing a bottle of the Seche Vite thinner at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply for such an occasion so I may check that out if this occurs with this third bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I usually do two coats of my polish and wait about a minute or more to apply the top coat, after about 2 minutes its not longer tacky to the touch, but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest you start playing with rocks just yet, however, you can go about your day with some caution for the following 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have always heard nail professionals talk about this so I decided to give it a try. So glad I did, it works great! It gives polish a high gloss finish and it&#x27;s very durable. Plus it dries in like 30 seconds. Definitely buy, it&#x27;s a good investment!</li>
            <li> Wow. This top coat is absolutely fantastic!!  It went on thick so i got a little worried, but it dried quickly and created a beautiful, smooth, hard, protective layer over the color of my nail polish. It is really a great product and worth the price when applied correctly and properly maintained.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a sturdy and effective everday top coat nail laquer.</li>
            <li> My manicurist uses this. Since I touch up between fills, this dries it quickly so I can&#x27;t mess it up.</li>
            <li> This top coat was recommended to me by friends who had tried multiple top coats.  It is a great top coat for people who do nail art.  When layering nail polishes the nails tend to get bumpy.  This top coat is great for smoothing it out without ruining the design.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to go through multiple top coats to find this.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS POLISH! this polish dries super freaking fast! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I polish my girls nails every weekend. The dry time makes it easier for them to not mess them up.</li>
            <li> It really works. Tried it right away and my nails took about 2 minutes to dry. I even double coated and used a base coat before using this as the top coat.</li>
            <li> Its fast drying and it paints on very nicely. No complaints from me. I will definitely repurchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Super product.  Does what it is supposed to do!  Would recommend to all.  Plan to purchase this Top Coat again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Seche Vite Top Coat for about 3 months (the same bottle), and I change my nail polish on average about every 4 days. I honestly find the bad reviews of this product unfathomable. It really is the best. It dries fast, like really, really fast. On one of my first uses of it I let it dry for about 15 minutes and then tapped my thumbnail hard with the tip of another nail. No dents, unbelievable. It has a high-shine gloss that wears beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see complaints of shrinkage in a lot of reviews. I have never experienced this. No gaps, no shrinkage. And this is over Essie, China Glaze, OPI, Nicole, and some $2 drugstore brands. I make sure to paint all the way to the tip of the nail and over, and never have any issues. It is really thick though, so if you let your nails grow out (or they grow fast) you might see a ridge from the edge of it at the bottom of your nail. To the reviewer that says it&#x27;s garbage that a top coat can be applied incorrectly: well, no it&#x27;s not. You definitely have to follow the instructions and apply this while your polish is still somewhat tacky. I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it seems to mix with the tacky polish and harden into a shell. It also smooths out the polish as it does this, hiding nail pits, ridges, or mistakes. If you apply it to completely dry polish you will see a noticeable difference in performance. My friend did her nails at my house and told me she didn&#x27;t like the top coat. The next time she came over I told her she had to put in on while her nails were still a bit wet. She did, and raved to me about her glossy nails 5 days later. Pretty much as soon as you finish painting the last nail, open your Seche Vite and start applying. I can get a manicure to last 4-5 days without chipping, which is a miracle to me considering the abuse my hands (and nails) take at my job. It&#x27;s a record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does, however, smell REALLY bad. Use in a well-ventilated area and happy painting.</li>
            <li> When it says dry fast, it isn&#x27;t kidding. Without this, your nails might be &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;, but not really - when you run your fingers over the nail, it&#x27;s dry at a light touch, but then clearly it isn&#x27;t dry underneath. This changes that - it&#x27;s either dry, or not. Of course, I&#x27;d still let it dry as long as possible just to ensure that your  nails are done, but this top coat definitely prevents the accidental smudging. It also gives the nail a nice shiny finish. Definitely Recommend!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff supper happy with it</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing and at a great price. No chips yet after 4 days of dishes, working 10 hours a day typing on a keyboard, and fishing today! And it does dry very fast which is great when you don&#x27;t have a lot of time to sit without using your hands. Most of the top coats I&#x27;ve tried take forever to dry and then chip in 2-3 days, but not this one!</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it will do!  It dried my 4 layers of polish quickly and completely.  It is very shiny and super hard.  No chips at 3 days despite having thin, weak, previously covered in acrylic nails. I type all day long and then do dishes by hand at night...no weakening of this product.  I am also a recovering nail biter and would recommend this to anyone trying to quit.  It keeps the nails looking so good and they feel so different that the urge to bite disappears when my teeth touch my nails. Awesome product!!</li>
            <li> My favorite top coat. Long lasting and shiny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very shiny. Dries very fast. Even dries the polish underneath. Great price. Go ahead, get it. three more words</li>
            <li> This product does dry nails fast, but do not go out and pick cotton or do heavy duty stuff for an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;I like it because it does dry fast, but within the limitations of normal work. You could type or do light work. Just don&#x27;t plan on repelling down a mountain too soon.</li>
            <li> ******REVIEW EDIT BELOW******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been sold on a Sally Hansen Mega Shine top coat but I&#x27;ve been hearing a lot of buzz about Seche Vite.  People all over Youtube were using it so I figured it must be good.  After being thoroughly impressed with what I was reading about this product I finally purchased some.  I wanted to like this but there isn&#x27;t a good thing I can say about it. It dries duller than dishwater.  When it finally does dry, which takes a whole lot longer than advertised, it dries to the consistency of rubber plastic.  You could flake, scratch and peel the whole thing off like melted candy.  Even if you used a halfway decent polish this stuff will corrupt the integrity of the whole look.  Ok, so what if I just got a bad batch of it?  For what these people set as the asking price for this stuff there should be no roulette wheel of chance when buying.  Terrible waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Ok I gave this another shot some time later and it seems to work fine.  I don&#x27;t know why it was such a dud the first time I tried it out of the box but luckily I didn&#x27;t throw it out.  I&#x27;ve been using it on all my complex manicures lately and it&#x27;s pretty good stuff.  It works better than my Sally Hansen Mega Shine when you are painting on layers and layers of polish to make crazy embellishments.  If you&#x27;ve got trendy designs and chunky pieces you want to attach to your nails this stuff will dry everything up pretty quickly.  To my eye though it doesn&#x27;t shine quite as well as SH.  For touch ups I still use SH but Seche Vite is good for finishing complicated nail designs when you don&#x27;t have time to sit around for hours waiting for it to dry.  It is basically clear goo that hardens quickly.</li>
            <li> Amazing, dried my newly painted nails in about 3-5min.  Completely ready to go out of the salon [I always bring my own nail polish].  Awesome.</li>
            <li> Does not dry fast.  Leaves your nails a mess and goopy.  You end up redoing your nails if you use this. And once it does dry, its all cloudy. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Best top coat. Drys very fast. I recommended</li>
            <li> I do my own acrylics at home, but when they dry their matte. I tried using my regular top coat on them but it dries inconsistently leaving the acrylic looking bumpy and messy. So I looked into gel top coats and UV lights. Some of the top coats I looked at where cheaper than this, and stated here was no use for a UV light. I really wanted to try an air dry gel top coat before purchasing a UV lamp. This top coat had the highest rating and the best reviews. It was more expensive than other options, but due to the consistent reviews stating &amp;#34;fast drying,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;glossy gel finish,&amp;#34; I decided to give this one a try. This morning I did my acrylics and then applied this top coat, and I am so extremely happy with the results! No need for a UV lamp, and gives my acrylic nails the shiny gel finish that you&#x27;d get at a salon. Now I truly have salon quality acrylic nails done right in my own home. Take it from someone who is a really hesitant buyer, is extremely cautious with her money, and does a lot of research before buying. This top coat is worth every penny spent. Looks amazing on acrylics, and though I haven&#x27;t used it on regular polish yet, I imagine it will work and look just as great! I will be buying more!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since it arrived and I gotta say I am in LOVE with it.</li>
            <li> The only top coat I will ever use, and the one my manicurist uses. Dries quickly to a brilliant shine, wears well. I find that if I topcoat my polish every 4 days with this, my manicure stays better and longer.</li>
            <li> I used to be a LOYAL out the door top coat user, swore I would never switched until someone on a beauty blog mentioned this stuff and gave it rave reviews, so I bought a bottle. After my first use I immediately threw out my out the door top coat, this stuff makes even the cheapest nail polishes look professional grade it makes my nails shiny and salon perfect. I am someone who paints their nails at least twice a week and do nail art. It dries so fast so which is perfect for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t have time to wait for nail polish to dry. :)</li>
            <li> I use this over my French Manicure and it helps the work last a lot longer than other products. Very happy with it, this is the third time I have bought it.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and added this top coat from base to the very end of the tips while my nails were still a tad wet and my nail color has remained chip-free for over 5 days... longer than any manicure I&#x27;ve ever had (excluding gel and acrylic manicures). It also adds great shine and strengthens without the thick, lumpy, artificial look you often get with acrylics and gel manicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside that I can see is that it smells strong when wet. Also, the way the brush is made makes it&#x27;s easy to get too much product on if you&#x27;re not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone wanting a quick, strong, shiny (wouldn&#x27;t work for a matte finish manicure), affordable and professional looking at home mani/pedi. (for reference I used this over Essie polish without a base coat)</li>
            <li> This top coat gives the most clean, smooth finish and the shines lasts several days to two weeks depending on how rough you are on your hands/toes. This is by far the best topcoat I have come across. I use various base coats, but Seche Vite is the best top coat out there. I like how it can be applied in a thin layer so it is shiny, but leave no layering effect on the color, or in thicker layers for nail art, etc. leaving the same fast-dry shine.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing top coat I have ever used. It completely smoothed out the rough glitter polished, gave my nails a manicure finish and dried very quickly.</li>
            <li> great product, never before able to polish nails at night - doing so would cause sheet/hair wrinkles in polish.  Also home mani lasts almost a week.</li>
            <li> This nail polish does dry fast, but it doesn&#x27;t make my nail polish last any longer. It actually layers off my nail a few days after putting it on. It&#x27;s nice for the 2-3 days that it remains on my nail.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is amazing. It dries immediately and keeps my nails looking great for a week+. It also makes my nails very shiny - people regularly ask if it&#x27;s shellac but I use inexpensive polish from the drug store.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product I love it</li>
            <li> Best ever. Game changer.</li>
            <li> Great top no issues at all and it does dry really fast</li>
            <li> i use this with after doing all of my nail art. It locks it in and dries super fast.</li>
            <li> Simply the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used! I decided to try Seche Vite after so many of my favorite nail blogs mentioned it in passing. I&#x27;m a huge fan of glitters,shimmers,and chunky polishes in general,love the look,hate the rough finishes some bulky polishes can leave your nails feeling like sand paper. With one coat of this it&#x27;s sealed hard,with two coats you get a perfectly smooth,super shiny finish! AND,I&#x27;m horrible about smudges and dents in my polish because I can never wait an hour for things to dry properly,but with this fast dry solution,twenty minutes and I&#x27;m good to go! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I think I have tried EVERY top coat on the market and this is by far the BEST! It dries amazingly quick and is the shiniest I&#x27;ve ever used. Love this product and ALWAYS have it on hand. My daughters love it too. Try it - you&#x27;ll become a fan too!</li>
            <li> This is the first fast dry top nail coat that I have purchased without paying a fortune that is so worth it. I am a new fan and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great top coat! Very shine!</li>
            <li> great fast service. love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great high shine, quick drying too coat. It stays on until I remove it. Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a great topcoat. Dries incredibly fast. It is rather thick, and I do notice the thicker I apply the top coat the more the polish will come off in a large chunk. If I get a nice thin layer it seems to last longer. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff really dries quickly and keep the polish shiny.  This product is also avail at Walgreens but cheaper via Prime</li>
            <li> Some things was ok and others was not.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! It makes every normal manicure super strong and super quick drying!</li>
            <li> Best top coat i ever used! Came sooner than expected as well!</li>
            <li> This is clearly the best top coat that I have ever used. It dry&#x27;s quickly and lasts long</li>
            <li> This product it great.It provides a great shiny top coat which brings alive any nail polish color and helps it to dry super quick...even with dark tones of nail polish which usually take longer. Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> great top coat, very shiny and it looks wonderful. Got here quickly, too! But the smell is awful. Smells like furniture polish gone bad. Gives me an instant headache. Not sure the shine is worth the pain!</li>
            <li> Nails chipped within 24 hours. Nail polish also peeled off.... I do not suggest. I&#x27;ve heard others rave about this product, I&#x27;m inclined to think this site is selling a knock off....</li>
            <li> Best topcoat polish around, actually fast drying(Seriously, I was amazed. No more wearing an adult diaper while doing my nails so I won&#x27;t mess up my manicure trying to go to the bathroom), and expect a 7-10 day manicure with no chipping.</li>
            <li> Used to use OPI but didn&#x27;t dry fast so gave this polish a try and now I won&#x27;t do my nails without this nail polish.</li>
            <li> Great product quick delivery</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is a top coat that I have used for years at the recommendation of my nail salon gal.  As far as I can tell, it is the best that there is.</li>
            <li> Helps nail polish dry much faster and last longer. I painted my nails previously with no top coat and the polish would chip after a day or two, this has helped extend the life of the polish and I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I had tried this product at least 4x and kept having problems with my nail polish peeling off within a day. I decided to finally use this product with a base coat, followed by 2 coats of polish and the Seche Vite on top of the 2 coats of WET polish. It worked! I think the problem I was having before was due to not using a base coat. I wash my hands frequently and type all day long, so my polish takes a beating. As of day 3 using Seche Vite as I&#x27;ve described, I only have minimal wear on my tips. I love the shine this product gives! I also love how quickly it dries your nails. Mine are usually dry in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I used to look at beauty gurus on Youtube who used this product and think, &amp;#34;This product seems overpriced and all it is is a topcoat&amp;#34; however after borrowing it from a friend it is the only one i use!  No other topcoat has really worked for me like this one has.</li>
            <li> It has a funky smell but I love it. Weird thing is it wears off within a couple of days. Probably because of all the handwashing. I just layer it every few days to keep up with my nails. It makes the nails so shiny!!</li>
            <li> My friend told me that her aunt runs for a manicure shop and she thinks this one is the best. I tried. FAST DRY for real! Wish the brush was bigger though.</li>
            <li> This really does dry SUPER FAST!  It isn&#x27;t gummy either.  And bonus...it is really glossy and makes your nails look fabulous!</li>
            <li> Love this product it really makes you nail dry quickly.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE how quickly this dries, but other than that, it&#x27;s a pretty mediocre product. My nails chip after 3 days when I use this as a top coat.</li>
            <li> I bought some OPI Top Coat and Drip Dry to go with it, but I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the results.  With the Drip Dry my nails would dry to the touch in less than a minute, but they didn&#x27;t get really hard for a few hours.  I went to bed a hour after doing my nails and they had marks in the morning.    Someone recommended Seche Vite as an alternative, so I purchased some.  It&#x27;s amazing.  Dry to the touch in a minute or less, and hard enough to resist damage in less than 30 minutes.  It seems to be best if applied when the top color coat is still wet.  Several reviews say they&#x27;ve had chipping problems, but I haven&#x27;t had that problem yet, even over a few days.  I have read that applying it over color coats that are too dry will lead to the chipping and peeling.    I would recommend getting a bottle of Seche Restore to go along with this.  It does tend to get gloopy, and the Seche Restore will fix it right up.  I&#x27;ve read that Seche Restore is fantastic for thinning out all brands of nail polish as well, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.      Even with the gloopy issue, I&#x27;ll continue to purchase Seche Vite.  The fact that I can do a quick manicure and get on with the things I need to do without worrying about my nails getting messed up makes it worth the minor inconvenience of having to keep another product around to thin it out.  This product allows me to do my nails more often, because it makes the whole process FAST!</li>
            <li> This works great if you apply it in really thin coats. If applied too thick it will not protect your nails.</li>
            <li> Best top coat hands down (pun intended).  Dries instantly.  Faster than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Also leaves a high shine and smoothes any nicks, bubbles, or blemishes.</li>
            <li> This was affordable and did work as a topcoat to quick-dry all my layers of polish. However, I noticed on day 2 of wearing the polish that it changes the color of the polish underneath! Very disappointed because I use Essy nail-polish and I hate wasting it. This turned my Tiffany Blue nail-polish GREEN. I was horrified.&lt;br /&gt;Still, I gave it another chance. I used it over french-tipped nails. I still noticed it discolored my white tips- turning them pinkish, but it also gave unnatural brassy color to my bare nails above the white!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m keeping this, but it&#x27;s at the back of my collection and I don&#x27;t foresee using it again unless I intend to have color-changing polish.</li>
            <li> Cuts dry time to around 15 minutes ! Super shiny</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best top nail coat I&#x27;ve ever used. It keeps the shine in days and preserves the nail color pretty well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is GOLD!  It gets me up and  moving so much faster than a plain topcoat!</li>
            <li> Dries fast, hard and shiny. Protects your polish and lasts and lasts.  There is no other.  This is the best.  And it is made in the US.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Bottle is all the way full.</li>
            <li> Shipped really quickly.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I finally bought Seche vite and used it yesterday for my weekly manicure/pedicure. My nails always look unchipped and shiny for an entire week. Not this time. It&#x27;s the next day and my manicure has chipped badly. So, Seche Vite goes into the trash and it&#x27;s back to conventional top coats.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite  is a awesome top coat it also dries very fast. Will continue to order when on sale.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Be careful your polish under it isn&#x27;t TOO wet though.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I&#x27;m a college student and I can&#x27;t afford manis/pedis more than about once per year, but I&#x27;m extremely picky when it comes to DIY nail polish. This top coat (and its accompanying base coat) checked every item off my list for half the price of some of the top/base coats I&#x27;ve seen. I have pretty noticeable ridges in my nails, but the base coat completely eliminated them under polish. This top coat was the icing on the cake. It dried within about 2 minutes over relatively thick polish, and has extreme shine. My nails (which are generally weak and break easily) are honestly as hard as fake nails, but for a tiny fraction of the cost and time. I&#x27;m clumsy, but this nail polish ensures that I won&#x27;t mess up my hard work. There are no nicks or scratches, even though I tend to bump my nails into things shortly after they&#x27;re painted. I&#x27;m extremely impressed and can&#x27;t say enough good things about this polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer mentioned a heavy smell, but it doesn&#x27;t smell any stronger than any other nail polish (and it&#x27;s certainly not as strong as the smell of a nail salon.) Most polishes have the scent for a few hours, but this scent disappears in minutes. Also, every polish thickens and loses its pizzazz over time. Thankfully, this polish is inexpensive enough to always have a fresh bottle for a truly miraculous home-polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The nail color in this photo is Hello Pretty in Sally Hansen&#x27;s Complete Salon Manicure line.)</li>
            <li> Best top coat in the market!</li>
            <li> Love this topcoat and will never use any other kind or seller. I think I need to see if they sell bigger bottles.</li>
            <li> By far the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> The best quality quick dry top coat. This even sets multiple coats of glitter polish in no time. I no longer have to worry about ruining my mani pedi.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite nail products.  It dries the polish to a set very quickly!  Definitely worth trying.  I mean, there is nothing that will truly dry nail polish, but this stuff makes it hard enough that you can live your life relatively normally until the polish does actually dry.</li>
            <li> Beyond 5 Stars! It&#x27;s a top coat nail polish that is super high gloss and super fast drying. My home manicure is now lasting a week+ because of this awesome stuff. I normally don&#x27;t post stuff like this but it&#x27;s miracle polish! You don&#x27;t even need to let your color polish dry first and after a minute or so this stuff is rock hard. I love it!</li>
            <li> a MILLION STARS!!!! THE BEST TOP COAT EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 IT DRIES so fast and its so very shiny!!! i love it so. i will only buy this brand!!!!</li>
            <li> Great top coat! It doesn&#x27;t get better than this.  All the women in my family love this product.  It dries fast and doesn&#x27;t chip in a day.  My manicures last almost 5 days now!</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever. I love Seche Vite. Their base coat is great as well. It does smell a little strong but I just try to not inhale it.  Dries fast with glossy shine.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I ever have. Even better than Sally Hansen. Shiny and dry fast. I worked at the warehouse, the polish didn&#x27;t chip at all and last for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> When I first used Seche Vite I thought it was the best but after using it for a few months I started having some problems. I noticed that I had serious nail shrinkage at the tips and cuticles. The formula is so thick that when you use multiple coats during the week it becomes noticeable on your nails. I had a lot tip wear from the shrinkage and peeling especially near the cuticle. There was very little chipping but the shrinkage, peeling and tip wear were problematic. I have since switched to Out the Door top coat with Essie protein base coat. I am going on day 5 with one tiny chip that is barely noticeable , no shrinkage or tip wear. Seche Vite may work for you as it has for many but I&#x27;ve found Out the Door to work much better.</li>
            <li> What can I say about Seche Vite that hasn&#x27;t been said before? This will change the way you do manicures at home. Makes your nail polish--even multiple layers--dry super quickly and gives a great shine. I started painting my nails so much frequently after getting this product because it cuts down on the amount of time you have to wait for your nails to dry by so much. I love it. I think I am on my third or fourth bottle by now and I&#x27;ll never stop using  this for my home manicures!!</li>
            <li> ....but nothing miraculous. I used it on wet polish and it dried shiny and smooth.  It did not peel off in one sheet as other said.  It lated about as long as an average manicure should.  It is a long standing staple so I stick with it.</li>
            <li> Loving it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks &#x3D;) easy to use and strong fast dry! Best suitable while you doing nail stamping artwork!&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping with good value product! Will return to buy &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This stuff is my favorite fast dry nail top coat - it works so well.  I love the way my nails look when I paint them, but I am so impatient and hate waiting for them to dry.  This really speeds up the amount of time it takes for my nails to dry.  It also extends the life of my nail polish - I have 3 kids, so I am not exactly super gentle on my nails and this keeps my nails from chipping and continues to make them look shiny and just painted...</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said it does dry up really fast. I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going to the nail shop to get my nails done well over 20 years now.  However, in today&#x27;s economy, having two boys makes it difficult for me to continue doing so when college tuition is far more a priority!  Therefore, having a way to purchase top quality products so that I can perform my own home manicures is highly important.  I would DEFINITELY recommend doing business w/ Pro Concepts because my item was shipped fast, arrived quickly, and packaged very nicely so that the contents remained in tact and w/out damage.  The bottle was full, and if it wasn&#x27;t a brand new bottle, it certainly gave the impression to be.  Applies great and gives me that nail shop look which is what I desperately wanted! Thanks Pro Concepts.  Look forward to doing business w/ you in the future.</li>
            <li> Get shiny and beautiful nails every time when you use this top coat. dries fast and my favorite top coat I have ever owned. must buy.</li>
            <li> This top coat dries quickly and lives up to the shine that bloggers write about. I highly recommend this product as a top coat for your nails. You don&#x27;t need much on the brush, just one coat should do for optimal results.</li>
            <li> This is THE go-to top coat for nail professionals. It goes on easily, dries quickly, and is ultra-protective.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat and I am so pleased that I can find it here on Amazon.  This gives me that wet sheen that looks killer on top of any color of polished.</li>
            <li> My nails have never dried so fast! Goes on smooth, dries faster than the speed of light, and NEVER smudges!</li>
            <li> Best top coat dries fast keeps my nail polish for 4+ days with no chipping. Will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat, it dries quickly, and actually keeps nails chip free for days, regardless of if you&#x27;re using expensive nail polish or dollar store polish. The smell is a little strong, but just open the window and you&#x27;ll live. With the top coat lasting much longer than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used I don&#x27;t have to paint my nails every day anymore.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Every time I wear it people ask me if I have shellac on. It also makes your nails dry quick.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Dries so quickly! Love it!</li>
            <li> Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat is the best product I have found yet for finishing my manicures at home. It dries fast and is super shiney! Very wearable and prevents chipping. It has extended time between the need to redo my nails.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and leaves a wonderful shine, a must for all my manis I really love this stuff!  Recommend it</li>
            <li> Dries fast without scuff marks. It also helps my nail polish last longer!</li>
            <li> I think I got a bad batch the first time. I&#x27;ll stick to buying it at Sallys.</li>
            <li> Okay, Seche Vite is cheap. But you get what you pay for. It leaves yucky whiteness around the edges of my polish and completely ruins my manis after a few days. I use OPI and China Glaze polish as well as China Glaze and CND Stickey base coats. I have tried different base coats in an effort to figure out what was making the edges of my polish look horrible. I finally realized it&#x27;s the Seche Vite top coat. The Seche Vite causes my nail polish to shrink at the bottom, the sides, AND the tips, making my carefully applied polish look sloppy and uneven and gross. So after a few days, when I have to reapply the Seche Vite because the first day shine wears off, my polish just starts looking worse and worse.  Someone on here said in their review that \\&quot;when applied correctly\\&quot; Seche Vite works great. That&#x27;s a load of garbage. How do you apply a top coat incorrectly?? You just brush it on. That&#x27;s the extent of \\&quot;application.\\&quot; Seche Vite just plain sucks. I don&#x27;t understand how it got to be so popular, other than the fact that it&#x27;s cheap.  So it dries quickly. Well, it dries the outside of the polish quickly. It&#x27;s dry to the touch after about 15 minutes, as with most other fast drying top coat products. But it still takes between an hour and two hours for the entire polish job to dry completely. I still have to be very careful for an hour or two to not bump my nails into anything. That is just too much time to sit around with wet nails.  I used my Seche Vite for around eight manicures, and then it got all gloopy. Someone in the reviews said to buy some restorer product. I&#x27;m going to spend extra money to make something work like it should? I don&#x27;t think so.  I&#x27;m giving it three stars because it does seem to keep my polish from getting chipped. But I think that&#x27;s mostly because I use quality polish. I used a Sinful Colors under Seche Vite once and it chipped right away. But I&#x27;ll give Seche Vite the benefit of the doubt.  I&#x27;m done with Seche Vite. I&#x27;ll never buy another bottle. I&#x27;mmoving on to other top coats.  And by the way, if you do end up buying this product despite my warnings, then fine. But for the love of Mike, don&#x27;t waste your money on the Seche Vite base coat. Now THAT is an entirely worthless, one star product.</li>
            <li> Great top coat!  It does get goopy towards the end but a little seche restore helps. I usually pour it into a new bottle after I&#x27;ve used it enough to fill. It can shrink too but letting your polish dry a few minutes longer usually helps with that. Great price and fast shipping! Oh and it&#x27;s super shiny!</li>
            <li> Love this Fast Top Nail Coat. It&#x27;s worth every penny spent!!!</li>
            <li> I really would like to give this a better review. I really love the shine and the super speedy drying time. My manicures do not last more then 3 or 4 days. I start to get chips and all of the polish will peel off in a big strip. I have other issues like shrinkage and it also turns my white nail polish, yellow. I have gotten half way through the bottle and it is now too gloppy to use. I have read all of the different reviews and I can&#x27;t understand why some of us have the chipping/ peeling issues and others do not. I would buy another bottle in case this one was defective, but I don&#x27;t want to waste anymore time on doing my nails again after 3/4 days. I will not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love it. Fast drying cheap what else could you ask for?</li>
            <li> This product is great, does exactly what it should - quick dries polish and leaves a beautiful shine.  I am big into nail art and sometimes have to use in between coats.</li>
            <li> I did research on this nail polish before purchasing it. The chemicals it had, good and bad reviews, compared it with other top coats, etc. I decided to purchase it and I was really excited to receive it. It does dry really fast, but it doesn&#x27;t last for many days .. It all depends on why type of nail polish brand u apply beneath it. I find it a bit hard to apply since the brush is a bit stiff and the liquid is not so liquidly. I apply a lot in order to have a smooth look and not a \\&quot;wrinkle\\&quot; look. Probably my disappointment is due to the fact that I expected so much from it. It&#x27;s not THAT bad, but I&#x27;m definitely considering buying another type of top coat</li>
            <li> Everyone I let borrow this top coat they always go out and buy it themselves. Dries fast, has a long shelf life and its crystal clear.</li>
            <li> I really like this nail polish, I use it as a top coat and dries faster that most top coats ( aprox 2 mn to dry) love it! It took a longer that I expectec to receive my package... other than the slow shipping the product its great</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan at all. Chips and peels very easily, whether you wear it alone or on top of a color. Also, I applied a second layer and my entire french manicure completely lifted and basically just fell off. The only upside is that it does dry extremely quick. I&#x27;ll stick with opi.</li>
            <li> Works well and an amazing price</li>
            <li> I purchased this Seche Vite top coat from amazon about two - three months ago.  I wanted to use it for awhile to give the best review possible.    For starters.  I used to have such problems with nail polish.  I could literally paint my nails and sit for 30+ minutes and then THREE-FOUR HOURS later go to bed and wake up with sheet marks/imprints all over the place.  Being a recovering perfectionist, it drove me nuts to spend all that time painting my nails to have it destroyed by smudges and nicks and you name it, even hours later.  Who has that many hours to be careful with your nails?  I constantly was touching something that destroyed my nails.  This product truly fixes that problem.  Within 15 minutes (sometimes less!) of painting my nails, it&#x27;s dry and I can touch it and not worry.  I can even go digging around in my purse.  It looks pretty flawless with this glassy top coat.  I no longer get sheet marks.  I&#x27;ve changed my nail polish about every week and I&#x27;m able to do that because I can get it done in 20-30 minutes total with base coat, color coat, and this top coat without taking such a huge chunk of time.    Now you do have to be realistic with yourself.  If you impale a nail on something hard and metallic after painting it or something it still can leave some imprint, and showering or having your nails in hot water soon after will soften the polish and leave you vulnerable to dents and nicks.  But that aside, you really can do just about anything without worrying too much within 15 minutes and by 20-30 you should be pretty solid for typically manicure destroying tasks (even dishes).  Again be realistic, thin coats will dry better.  If you gob on a ton of nail polish and a ton of the top coat it will take longer to set and you might goof them up and be disappointed.  It holds up pretty well for a good week possibly more.  And let me tell you my nails go through hell.  I work retail and I&#x27;m constantly taking security sensor tags with pointy pins off clothing and grabbing handfuls of plastic sensors at night to put them away into our backstock.  We also have hangers with metal clips (like for pants, skirts, etc) and again I have to go digging around in bins of those and am constantly banging and scratching up my nails.  The top coat may get a little scratched on the surface but I haven&#x27;t had ANY major chips or nicks and it&#x27;s held up really well.  One day I even felt my nails were starting to look scratched up and a customer complimented how great and shiny my nails looked (go figure).  I&#x27;ve also had people ask me if I got one of those gel manicures professionally done!  Nope, all this great little product.  When I have to change it at the end of the week it&#x27;s because of growout or because it&#x27;s pulled away a little from the tips of my nails.   One odd thing is that I have noticed by then end of one week, the nailpolish looks a tiny bit darker than when I first painted them so there might be an issue with discoloration.  I also recommend making sure you get the sides of your nails.  This product is thick and you&#x27;ll have a visible ridge if you didn&#x27;t quite cover the whole nail.  It does set pretty quickly too so there is a little bit of an art to putting on enough so that you can cover the nail before it sets without globbing on so much that it won&#x27;t dry, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly.  There is also a slight chemically smell to the product but I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to smell and it doesn&#x27;t bother me because it fades quickly.  I remember reading reviews about it getting overly thick, and I did purchase the restoring drops from seche vite but so far I haven&#x27;t needed to use them.  So it doesn&#x27;t seem as big of an issue as some reviews would suggest.  Overall the product is amazing and gives you flawless looking nails that and usable within such a short period of time.  I have almost forgotten the days of sheet marks and horrible smudges and I get compliments all the time and I keep recommending it to all my friends.  Ican&#x27;t believe people don&#x27;t know about this top coat, I refuse to paint my nails without it now!  It&#x27;s really fantastic and makes at home manicures very accessible.</li>
            <li> This is amazing, Seche Vite means dry fast, and this is exactly what it does. It dries my nails completely in under a minute, so I can go back to my life and not have to sit around waiting for polish to dry. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will continue to use it until they stop making it!</li>
            <li> When I first used this, I decided to use it on only one hand, and use my inexpensive drug store top coat on the other.  They had equal shine, but the Seche Vite chipped so much worse than the other polish, AND the other polish was on my dominant hand.  I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this through amazon and only wasted half the amount that I would&#x27;ve if I had gotten it at a beauty supply store.  Definitely won&#x27;t waste my money on this again.</li>
            <li> I work in healthcare full time so I wear nitrile gloves for about 9hrs a day, 5 days a week. This topcoat is amazing and I have my nails looking fabulous all week long. It&#x27;s not your ordinary topcoat. It dries amazingly quick. Give it a try. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> BEST TOP COAT EVER! I am able to do my nails and within a few minutes can get back to my daily life. I don&#x27;t find myself having to wait forever for it to be completely dried. It also gives a great glossy coat to the nails....not dull at all! I won&#x27;t ever get a different top coat from now one, this is just like the one you get at the nail salon.</li>
            <li> I received it in just 2 days i ordered it at night on Nov. 5th and received it the afternoon or Nov. 7th. It works great, it dries very fast, hardens over the nail polish leaving it feeling strong and un-chipable. It also leaves a nice glossy shine. Im very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I was on the hunt for the best top coat.  My internet searches revealed that this was a cult favorite--now I see why!  This stuff dries really fast and leaves a nice smooth finish!</li>
            <li> my fiancee says this is the best brand. she&#x27;s been very pleased with the purchase. it speeds up the drying process and protects the paint. the bottle lasted almost a year</li>
            <li> After reading the good reviews on here I decided to try it and I love it! I always paint my nails after work in the evening and even after they seem dry it never fails that when I go to bed I get marks from the sheets/blankets! After using Seche Vite over my wet nail polish they were dry to the touch in about a minute and fully dry and hard at around 5-10 minutes. And the next morning NO marks! Yay!</li>
            <li> This top coat was ok, but I don&#x27;t understand the hype surrounding it. It does dry quickly to a hard finish, but it wasn&#x27;t as shiny as I expected. It also peels horribly. Perhaps it is because I am using it over acrylic coated nails but it peeled off on the second day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I must have got a bad bottle or something, because I tried another bottle and it&#x27;s amazing. It is now the only top coat I use.</li>
            <li> I have purchased MANY top coats from many brands, and this IS THE BEST! Even my mom was wowed. I&#x27;ll never buy from another brand! This stuff stinks but it really does dries within minutes, and I have a heavy hand with nail polish.  I&#x27;ll always come back to amazon to purchase; its a little price in the beauty supply.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It practically instantly dries my nails. For a busy student and full time worker, this is important!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, sometimes the corners of my nails will chip after a couple of days but hey, I can deal with that if I&#x27;m not forced to sit around and wait an hour for my touch up to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product that&#x27;s a decent price. Sally Hansen doesn&#x27;t compare in my opinion.</li>
            <li> i always loved seche vite, but when i got it from my cvs, i must&#x27;ve got my an old gross one. this one is 3 dollars cheaper and works great!</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for quite a while now and was glad I could find it on Amazon at a better price then what I found at my beauty supply store.  It does the job of a shiny finish while drying fast.</li>
            <li> I am a starting out nail enthusiast, my collection is slowly growing, I am trying out new things and finding better brands for certain jobs. I picked up Seche Vite after reading about it on so many nail art blogs, and the great reviews here. Well I have to say I am so glad I picked it up! There is some small smearing, but not NEARLY as bad as big brand top coats, as in the kind in the makeup isle at your local grocery store. Seche Vite fixes my crappiest nail painting jobs, makes the tops smooth as glass. I love how thick the formula is (without being goopy) and it really does dry so much faster than other \\&quot;quick dry\\&quot; large name brand top coats. Love this top coat!!</li>
            <li> In love with this top coat! Super fast in drying!</li>
            <li> This top cost does a great job of drying quickly and making it look like I just got a salon manicure. Only drawback is that it&#x27;s not big 3 free, so I won&#x27;t be using it while pregnant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Seche Vite for almost a year now, it is the only top coat that will keep my nails looking fresh and glossy without chipping for days, and with all the abuse I put them through that says a lot! It makes your nails really hard, gives a beautiful shine, and speeds up drying time- everything you could want in a top coat.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat...i&#x27;ll never buy another! It dries super fast and gives a wonderful glossy finish. Highly recommended :)</li>
            <li> I have tried many differnt top coats and this is the best. The only Con is that it gets goopey half way through the bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t polish my fingernails very often, but I do like to keep my toenails polished. I wondered why it looked so much better and lasted so long when I got a professional pedicure. I decided to try this topcoat to find out if it would help.&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product! It makes toenail polish last for several weeks, and makes it look so much more professional! Adds shine and hardness. Makes polish dry faster too.&lt;br /&gt;It does smell awful, but dries super fast and smell dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy to find a product that makes polish so much prettier and longer lasting!</li>
            <li> It does dry fast and leaves it shiny but it does not last long.</li>
            <li> My friend said this is the best top coat ever.  I am excited to give it a try for myself! Arrived in great shape, when expected.</li>
            <li> I work in a nursing home, so I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands and changing gloves, and this is by far the BEST top coat I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used a TON. In my opinion it works best with a glitter colors, since glitters, for me, are super hard to remove anyway. I use ORLY Binder as my basecoat, then put my color on. I hear a lot of people say to put Seche over wet nails, but for me that doesn&#x27;t work. I give them a minute or two, to where they&#x27;re still tacky but not super wet, then put it on, and seal the free edge. Viola.   I have always had thin, egg-shell nails. They bend and break really easily, and growing them out is a b***h-and-a-half. But with Biotin pills and Seche, I can keep them at a much longer length than usual. I really like that when it dries, you can hold your nail up to your face, sideways, and actually see  how thick the polish is. Reminds me of gels.  Normally polish only lasts a day or two, even before I worked in a nursing home. Now I can get a full week out of my manicure, so long as I make sure to re-wrap the free edge every third day or so. I totally, totally recommend this!  As for the &amp;#34;dangerous chemicals&amp;#34; in it....I figure there&#x27;s 101 ways to get cancer, and unless you&#x27;re practically bathing in this stuff, this small of an exposure really shouldn&#x27;t be a big deal. But that&#x27;s just my 2 cents. :)  My only COMPLAINTS are that it gets goopy really fast. I&#x27;ve never used a polish thinner, so I&#x27;m not sure if it would work with the Seche brand. But I mean, for the price, I just got 2 bottles...I use the goopier one to do my free edge. Seems to be working just as well. Also it&#x27;s kind of hard to get off with polish remover. But again, one afternoon of removing stubborn polish, instant dry-time, and a full week or more of a perfect manicure is SO worth it IMO.</li>
            <li> I love seche vite it is the fastest nail dryer out there. and trust me i have a ton of different kinds! It does tend to shrink a little but Ill take it rather than my polish getting ruined!! Def recommend seche vite!!</li>
            <li> I love Seche Vite. It dries any polish in minutes, and smooths most small nicks. This is the only topcoat I use now.</li>
            <li> Dries so quickly and makes manicures look professional.  Love this stuff.  Won&#x27;t be without it.  I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I tried this because I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about it, and I can definitely see why. It dries super fast and solid! Also, it gives a thick coat, which I like. It does shrink a little if you don&#x27;t cap the tips of your nails though. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it thickening in the bottle and I&#x27;ve had it for months. No bubbling problems either!</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own nails for the past year and I have learned to be very creative and me I spend a lot of money on good products to ensure that I only have to do my nails either once a week once every two weeks. In conjunction with all of my expensive products this may be the cheapest thing that I use on my natural nails and I love it this is the most essential to the shine and quick dryof my nails yes it has formaldehyde in it and I love it I&#x27;m sure to not get it on my skin and if so I remove it I don&#x27;t think I will ever stop using this my nails are never damage my designs always last thanks to this product</li>
            <li> I have used this top coat for years and it just never disappoints! It works incredibly fast and gives my nails an extra layer of strength.  I bring it with me whenever having a mani/pedi because it works better than the salons products.</li>
            <li> what can i say, i LOVE this top coat SERIOUSLY ever since i started using seche vite doing my nails has become FUN, i&#x27;m not exaggerating i don&#x27;t usually say a product is great unless it really is, i LOVE it it just cuts down the drying time to less then half, literally you just need to apply it and wait like a minute and you are good to go :) it&#x27;s the best top coat ever, oh and btw it&#x27;s really shiny it&#x27;s just simply THE BEST !!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I hoped for.  Dries very quickly and truly no marks or smudges on your manicure after.  The price from this distributor was very reasonable too.</li>
            <li> I like thick topcoats a lot because I find that they are longer-lasting and provide superior shine. This stuff smells awful but thankfully the small dissipates once it&#x27;s dry. The one thing I will say is that when you use about half of it it becomes very thick and stringy. A small price to pay for an excellent topper though.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best top coat I&#x27;ve used. It smells awful but luckily it dries fast and the smell isn&#x27;t lingering. The best part about this top coat is that it dries in a way that makes it hard and doesn&#x27;t deny as easily as other top coats. Normally I get a dent or 2 even if I&#x27;ve let my nails dry for about an hour. Not this stuff. It&#x27;s honestly amazing and strengthens your polish so it makes it look better for longer.</li>
            <li> Great thick top coat. Really dries the nail fast and makes it shiny too. Definitely worh purchasing.</li>
            <li> I had never bought a fast drying top coat before. I had searched Amazon for hours looking through all of the different fast drying top coats, but most of the reviews weren&#x27;t very good. This top coat however had a lot of good reviews, so i bought it. It arrived in a decent amount of time, and is AMAZING! My nails are completely dry within 5 mins of using it. This is a lifesaver! The only thing is that it will not prevent your nails from chipping, so after you apply this top coat, i would recommend using a chip-proof top coat over it. Overall a great product. i recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am so in LOVE with seche vite!! The top coat dries FAST and gives your nails a super glossy shine. It&#x27;s amazing how long my  manicures last! I know a few people arent happy with the fact that it shrinks your polish at the tips but if you wrap you nails with seche (paint the tip of the nail and underneath) problem solved.  The only issue I had with Seche is that halfway through the bottle, the consistency changes to a thick, goopy mess that&#x27;s pretty much unusable. But this top coat is so amazing, I ordered another one as a replacement! I will NEVER use any other top coat ever again! Nothing compares to Seche!! :))</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews about this top coat I had to try it.  I&#x27;ve become obsessed with manicures lately and I&#x27;ve purchased numerous shades of polishes and always have the same issue, the polish takes forever to dry.  Not with Seche Vite...OMG!  I painted my nails last night and in 5 minutes they were dry, completely, 100% dry.  Not just dry to the touch, but completely dry, no smudges, no chips, just dry glossy nails.  This stuff is a godsend!</li>
            <li> Best ever in my opinion. Best for nail art. No streaks.</li>
            <li> Love it but the outside of the polish was dirty</li>
            <li> I love Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Nail Coat.This is by far the best deal I have been able to find.</li>
            <li> love love love amazon for having this miracle polish available. one for me and 2 for my family. thank you</li>
            <li> For so long, I would only paint my nails occasionally. The process took me so long, and it ended up getting messed up more often than not, so it just didn&#x27;t seem worth it most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, though, I started reading nail polish blogs and found two tips that have made all the difference for me.  One was how to clean up the polish using a brush, and the other was Seche Vite for a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, Seche Vite works wonders.  Before, I had times where I would finish painting my nails four hours before going to bed, and STILL end up with sheet marks in my polish the next morning.  With the Seche Vite, I&#x27;ve been able to change a diaper or put my toddler in his carseat 5 - 10 minutes after applying it without ruining my polish job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, and this is something I&#x27;ve never experienced with other top coats I&#x27;ve tried... it seems to perfect my polish job.  I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, but I&#x27;ve had goopy, lumpy applications from thickened polish, and after I go over it with the Seche Vite, it looks I applied it perfectly.  It almost seems like it melts the top layer of polish and helps it to level itself out.  I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the best way to describe it... it sounds scary, but it&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read that it co-operates with some polishes better than others.  I&#x27;m wearing Essie right now, and it looks perfect after a day and a half.  Other times I&#x27;ve used it I&#x27;ve gotten some shrinkage (that MIGHT have had to do with me applying it after the polish was dry, I&#x27;m not sure).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps.</li>
            <li> I use this on all of my manicures. It has a strong odor, but that does not affect the quality. It dries within minutes, even if you have 4+ coats of polish on. (Base, 2 thin coats, and this as a topcoat) I&#x27;ve purchased it for friends as gifts also because it enabled me to start painting my nails again after years of not being able to. I have a very busy life and can&#x27;t sit around waiting for polish to dry--this has been a lifesaver! Comes off easily with non-acetone and acetone removers.</li>
            <li> The best I have ever used!  Super shiny, lasts a long time, and most importantly,dries super fast!  I had seen it at Walmart many times but knew nothing about it so didn&#x27;t purchase it.  Then I read about it in Amazon reviews, and ordered it here.  Glad I did!</li>
            <li> Hands down the best top coat i&#x27;ve ever used. Makes mani&#x27;s last longer and dry faster. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands of fast dry top coats for years but it was always a trade-off of durability for convenience. Seche Vite applies easily and smoothly a thick durable layer that dries faster than the other fast dry top coats. But even better than that it has the most amazing glossy shine!&lt;br /&gt;Despite the thick layer it still does a great job of keeping bubbles from forming in your color coats. That has always been a problem for me in the summer heat and humidity and was the reason I started using fast dry top coats. Did I mention how shiny it is? Seriously you won&#x27;t be able to stop looking at your nails!&lt;br /&gt;As far as durability I have absolutely no problems keeping the manicure chip free and looking good for 7-10 days especially if I apply another layer of top coat 2-3 days after the initial manicure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great I love that it only takes like 5 to 10 mins to dry completely where the other top coats I had to wait up to 30 minutes just to dry . Not only that but it doesn&#x27;t smear the nail polish when you applu this . Also it has a much better price than at sally&#x27;s .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the shiniest top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;and quick dry.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I originally gave this only 1 star.  I&#x27;ve done some reading and figured out the secret to this stuff to keep it from peeling and to make your manicure last.    1 - As soon as you&#x27;re done with your last coat of polish on your first hand, apply this top coat before you move on to applying the second coat to your other hand.  This top coat needs to be put on right after your last coat of polish, the polish needs to be good and wet still.  2 - Do not use this as your base coat as well, that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s intended for and it will peel!  3 - I&#x27;ve tried using this with my Sally Hansen base coat and no base coat.  My manicure peels within a day after using a base coat.  I&#x27;ve found this polish works best without a base.  However, there may be other base coats out there such as OPI, etc. that will work OK and not cause your polish to peel using this top coat.  (I&#x27;ve not heard good things about the Seche Vite Base)  This top coat dries super fast, your manicure will be completely dry within 5 minutes.  Just remember to get it on there while your nails are still super wet!</li>
            <li> Great top coat, but my dog was highly allergic to it. Every time I pet him with this top coat on, his skin got red and he got super itchy. After several attempts to determine what it was, I realized it was this top coat. I have since stopped using it. It was the best top coat I have tried, but my dog also needs to be scratched.</li>
            <li> This top coat dries my nail polish fast and gives it a brilliant shine. It looks like I went to a professional manicurist when I did it by myself at home. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have bought many top coats from various manufacturers over the years. This one is seriously terrific as far as fast dry and hardening go. I have used this top coat many times over the past four months and can&#x27;t believe the fact that when I have completed all 10 nails the first one I did is very dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, be careful-- as much as it looks and feels great it is still vulnerable to sheet marks, unintended digs, etc. Give it at least an hour before you go to sleep and even then please do yourself a favor and sleep with your toes and hands sticking out from under the covers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it the sniff test, if there is ANY SMELL AT ALL treat your nails as if they belong to little birds in a tiny endangered nest owned by Royalty from somewhere that counts.:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I agree, that was a bit odd but I wanted to stress a point...bottom line is that it&#x27;s a great product, I just bought three more bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck, hope this helps you in your quest for nail nirvana, this topcoat sure did that for me! Hope this feedback is helpful.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this top coat. I can put it on right after finishing my second coat of color and within 3 minutes, my nails are dry. After 10 minutes, I can cook, do laundry, do just about anything that would normally ruin my nails right after painting them. The average wear I get out of my polish with Seche Vite top coat is between 5 and 8 days before I get a chip. While it&#x27;s not quite as long as a typical gel manicure, the price and quick drying time easily makes up for it. I recommend this to all of my friends and have gotten quite a few hooked on it as well. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Used it before and it worked extremely well.  Bought from another seller and this does nothing but chip and peel off by the next day.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> The best fast dry top coat I&#x27;ve ever used! My nails will be thoroughly dry only a few minutes after I apply it. Amazing!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite top coat I&#x27;ve ever owned because it dries SUPER fast and it&#x27;s salon quality. People always tell me my nails look professionally done when I use this top coat.</li>
            <li> This will change how you think about manicures. Drys so quickly and lasts as a great top coat too.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle of this top coat and I am definitely hooked for life.  It dries to the touch in less than two minutes.  I tend to do my nails later in the evening after my boys have gone to sleep and I hate waiting for my polish to completely dry before going to bed. It can take forever! This is the best when you lack time and want to keep a fresh from the salon look. My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t do much for chipping.  My solution for that is Duri Rejuvacoat.  I use the Seche Vite then follow up with Duri the next day.  Winning combination.</li>
            <li> Works great. Best part is it doesn&#x27;t run if you use more than two colors on the nail</li>
            <li> No chips, holding design really well. and I know what I am talking about: the same polish chipped in a day. It has been four since I put on this top cover, and it works good! I think it will hold it even longer.</li>
            <li> A product that actually does what it says it will do!!  This is the ONLY quick dry product that actually dries my nails within a minute.  No more smudging.  I would go washing dishes right away but you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting ridges from tapping on a tabletop.</li>
            <li> i would have loved to give this 5 stars because it works, its a miracle topcoat. sadly it has toluene. the smell of this gives me headaches unless i do it outside. but it was really the toluene that got me. on the back it has a warning that says \\&quot;this product contains a chemical known to the state of california to cause birth defect or other reproductive harm\\&quot; i dont know about ya&#x27;ll but i would actually like to have kids later on.</li>
            <li> I usually use a product from Duane Reade to make my nails dry fast and i thought nothing could top it. I was wrong! Not only does this give my nails a glossy finish but it dries hard so fast it&#x27;s incredible! Within a few minutes I glided my finger carefully over my nail expecting a little give but they were completely dry! And within about 15 minutes i was able to clack my nails together without any tack. Not only did this protect my regularly painted nails but it protected the nail design (christmas tree w/snow) i made on both my ring fingers. about 5 minutes after application I accidentally rubbed my nail against my rubber phone protector and I got irritated thinking I&#x27;d ruined my nail but the design was perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-EXTREMELY quick drying&lt;br /&gt;-glossy finish&lt;br /&gt;-makes my manicure last&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-smell might possibly be gross to some, although all nail polish has some smell. (reminded me of rubber glue)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all in all i&#x27;d HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who uses nail polish! it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> If I use this over my polish, it lasts about a week, just like a salon manicure. I don&#x27;t use gloves for dishes or anything!</li>
            <li> I had to write because I saw some good reviews!  I was super dissapointed with this product.  Yes, it dries fast, but I agree with the other reviews...you can&#x27;t even have it on for 1 day before it starts chipping and peeling back.  It is honestly a really bad product and I think I paid about $12 for it.  I will seriously throw it away. It just doesn&#x27;t hold up at all.  In fact I think just plain old Sally Hansen is better.      I&#x27;m sticking with OPI for now...    Major dissapointment.  I would advise you not to buy this!</li>
            <li> I had seen a lot of reviews on this top coat, so I decided to try it out. First of all, it&#x27;s great that you can get it on Amazon for half the price in stores.   Amazingly, it actually does dry in less than 5 minutes. I even like to put on up to 3 coats of my colored polish, and still this top coat creates a really nice seal that hardens quickly and is not sticky at all. The best part about this product is that you can paint your nails right before bed, and you won&#x27;t get any lines or sheet marks by the morning! I had tried OPI&#x27;s top coat which takes forever to dry and I always got lines in the morning. The Seche Vite Dry Fast really works and keeps my nails looking great for at least a week!! Goes good over plain colored polish and even glitter polish.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite topcoat!  It is really thick and while putting it on I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be smooth when dry.  After waiting a few minutes it was perfectly smooth and totally dry.  I was using Sally Hansen before and I would have to wait about an hour or more before I could use my hands or my nails would be ruined.  Not with Seche, I just cant believe how fast it dries and my nails look perfect.  I will never go back to any other brand, this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat. It dries on fast like a gel.  My manicure doesn&#x27;t start to chip for days. I almost get a full week, depending on the polish. This buyer was great and I received  the item earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as I was reading the reviews, but decided to give this product a shot and purchased it anyway. OMG, where have you been all my life? This thing is mind-blowing. I hurriedly did my nails and smeared on a whole gob of top coat for each nail, and perhaps 20 minutes later, my nails were done. I was literally packing for a weekend trip without a care in the world. I&#x27;m very, very happy I bought this.</li>
            <li> I never really understood the point of a top coat until I used Seche Vite - the reason being that my previous top coat polishes were worthless!  This goes on so thick, and dries very quickly.  I have been able to paint on the top coat, brush my teeth, then go to bed, without waking up with sheet marks on my nails.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This works!!The best top coat ever! Literally takes less than a minute to dry and makes my polish last for about 9 days!</li>
            <li> Not only is it a terrific drier, it&#x27;s also a very good top coat.</li>
            <li> drys very quickly and adds a nice sheen to nails</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use anything else and the price this time was fabulous!</li>
            <li> Dries very fast, beautiful shine, thanks.</li>
            <li> I have not used it yet but I think it will be what I want for my nails.</li>
            <li> This top coat is awesome. I have had home manicures last over a week with even Wet and Wild nail polish. Will buy forever!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It smoothed out bumpy polish, dries fast, and leaves a nice salon worthy shine. I will forever be using this product.</li>
            <li> This top coat is great!! It dries so fast and does not clump. It makes the nails look super shiny while protecting them. My nail polish rarely chips now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m typing this with freshly painted nails... base, two color, and two glitter layers... plus one application of Seche Vite. I&#x27;ll be confidently making lasagna for my family in half an hour, knowing all those layers are rock solid under this amazing goo. I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it takes that \\&quot;oh crap\\&quot; time (you know... can&#x27;t touch anything or you ding those perfect smooth nails) from hours down to minutes. I can do my nails half an hour before bed now. Magic! Wish I&#x27;d known about it years ago!</li>
            <li> Dries really fast like nothing I have ever seen before, but unfortunately chips off really fast too So at this point not so sure if better than other coat top polish that takes more time to dry :(</li>
            <li> I found Essie&#x27;s 10 day no Chip to be much more effective.</li>
            <li> Great product! Nails dry super fest! Love the high shine clear coat! Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> This top coat sucks!! My polish and this top coat peel right off soon after application. Tried with different polishes, same thing.</li>
            <li> I normally pay the $6 extra after EVERY manicure, but now I can just add this on myself for sooo many applicant&#x27;s, great!</li>
            <li> Love how quickly this top coat dries! Still have chipped edges after a few days but that&#x27;s almost inevitable.</li>
            <li> OMG!!!! This is the BEST top coat. Really fast drying time. When i say really fast i mean really fast. My manicure last about two weeks with this top coat. Definitely worth the price. My iteam came sooner then expected.</li>
            <li> I love Seche Vite and at the price I got these I couldn&#x27;t resist. Best REAL fast dry and protective top coat I have tried to date. Seller had great price and I got the package very quickly.</li>
            <li> Was already goopy and old by the time I got it.</li>
            <li> This product really does what it says - it dries FAST! My first trial run with this top coat was over three coats of OPI. I applied the top coat and waited approx. 5 minutes before touching it and to my surprise it was completely dry. Not only does it dry quickly, the end result is a beautiful shiny finish. If you want something that goes on easily, dries quickly and finishes off your manicure with a nice shine, look no further!</li>
            <li> The best top coating and it lasts for days.  Chipping is little or none after a week.</li>
            <li> See photo for reference&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;*Dries evenly&lt;br /&gt;*Dries glossy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*Drags color underneath from my fresh manicure, making designs nearly impossible&lt;br /&gt;*When you lift the brush from your nail, whatever color it was dragging stays in the brush, then goes onto the next nail or back into the bottle&lt;br /&gt;*The colors that drag then get deposited back into the bottle of clear Seche and end up in your next manicure&lt;br /&gt;*It shrinks on your nail over time</li>
            <li> Was packaged SUPER well and works great! Dries fast and goes on smooth. No complaints here!</li>
            <li> Honesty what did i expect for that money. Cheap for the money but its also cheap quiality. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  Dries fast and when used with OPI nail polish, my nails stay chip free for a good week or so.</li>
            <li> This top coat is my go to ever since i discovered it. it dries the polish under it and helps my manicure last longer and looks better! its amazing and i bet you will fall in love with it to when you get to use it. I hear some people complain about shrinkage with this polish. I never had a problem with that but a tip is to make sure to &#x27;wrap&#x27; your nails, or make sure that you coat the tip or edges of your nail and not just the top of the nail. This seals in the manicure and also helps with chipping too. I suppose alot of problems with this polish could be due with application of it and not the actual product. Seche vite top coat is my favorite and works GREAT for me!</li>
            <li> OMG! Can&#x27;t believe how fast this dried my polish! I&#x27;m sitting here just after applying it TYPING! I will have to order again.&lt;br /&gt;I just used this over a very light blue ( Sinful,Cinderella) so I didn&#x27;t have any of the color pulling like other people stated. I&#x27;ll have to see when it comes to darker colors. I would love to see this have a flat brush instead of the standard.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the big deal is about this product.I don&#x27;t know what the big deal is about this product.well it does keep my polish from chipping the whole coat comes off. It makes my nails super glossy, but my polish comes off faster than it would without a top coat. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This brand was recommended to me by a cosmetologist and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. Love it and it is all I use now.</li>
            <li> I got the Seche Vite top coat so quickly after I ordered it that I was surprised I even had a package.  It is a good top coat and leaves your nails shiny and dries very quickly.  I type all day and can&#x27;t keep nail polish unchipped for more than an eight hour work day but this top coat extended it to two or three days- which for me is saying  a lot!</li>
            <li> Dries super fast and goes on smooth. My only complaint is that it chips in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the hype is but this topcoat is no better than 99 cents Wet and Wild topcoat. I&#x27;m kind of concerned that a cheap replacement was poured in the bottle. As soon as it dries it is no longer shiny. Not impressed at all!</li>
            <li> Hands down best quick dry top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. Really lives up to the hype. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well for me. The thing you need to keep in mind with this that I had to learn is that you really need to apply it to nails that are still wet. If you wait until the polish dries and then apply it, it tends to shrink and pull away from the cuticles which looks weird and then leads to chipping. Apply it while polish is still wet and your poilish will dry pretty fast and it makes a nice protective top coat.</li>
            <li> Makes nail polish dry quickly.</li>
            <li> I really love this top coat.  it dries you nails instantly...It costs a little more at stores like riteaid or cvs...i love it.</li>
            <li> I love this topcoat, it leave my nails super shine and it dry them super fast even when I have a lot of coat&lt;br /&gt;It is very hard to smash after using the top  and I have go to sleep after using it and my nails are perfect (of course with my hands up the pillow)</li>
            <li> I love this top coat!!! It dries super fast and adds amazing shine to polishes :)</li>
            <li> Works really well to prevent chipping.</li>
            <li> This nail polish top coat works even better than expected. A lot of companies advertise this type of result, but so far this is the only brand I&#x27;ve found that actually delivers. I applied two coats of color, let them dry for a few minutes, and then applied a single layer of seche vite. I was still very careful with my fingers for a bit afterwards, but within a couple of minutes my nail were totally dry. The polish stays on longer as a result and chips less in the first day or two. I did touch ups after 4 or 5 days and my nails looked great still afterwards.</li>
            <li> arrived fast and so happy with product!</li>
            <li> This is the best fast dry polish I have ever used. It will keep an at-home paint job for a week and dries completely in about 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> The is the best top coat I have ever used and it is true, it sets and dries quickly and you don&#x27;t have annoying lumps or bubbles.  I also like that it really seems to extend the life of my manicure so I often touch up my nails mid week and boy the manicure lasts!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I read about this product in one of the In Style product reviews years ago and have been a steady convert since then.  Great quick drying top coat the pros use!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this.</li>
            <li> The French name (dry fast) says it all. The only problem is that it dries the surface. You have to be careful for a few hours. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in a pinch and need your manicure to dry super fast then this is the top coat for you. Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat dries super fast to a beautiful shine in a minute.  I don&#x27;t love the super thick consistancy it has but i got over that quickly after I saw how fast it dries.  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Great price, great product, shipping was fast. I have nothing bad to say at all- I love this top coat and I take it with me to the salon when I have my nails done, as well as using it at home when I do them myself.</li>
            <li> I love it . I never had a top coat polish work as fast as this one . I&#x27;m able to paint my nails put the top coat and in 10 mins ready to go ,and having 2 kids and always doing something its works . But the down side is that after jus one daii of painting nails they chip . Guess have to look for something else</li>
            <li> There are endless raves on the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat, and this is just another in the pile. The only thing I will say is that if you are sensitive to the strong scent of nail polish, do NOT order this product. This top coat has the best effect that I have ever seen, but for the cost of a very strong scent. If you are willing to smell that for a short amount of time, you will reap the rewards of having a rock-hard, beautifully covered, and glistening manicure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of quickly dry top coats but what makes this one different is that the brush reaches all the way to the bottom of the bottle so when the bottle gets low, you won&#x27;t waste any. Without a quick dry top coat, I would not be painting my nails.</li>
            <li> I have been searching everywhere for a top coat that prevents nail polish from chipping. And I have wasted a lot of money doing so. I am a package handler so I work with my hands and I have to wear work boots and my polish never last more than a few hours on my fingers and toes so I just completely gave up and stopped painting my nails until I found this product and I absolutely love it. I have already purchased a second bottle. I would recommend re applying to the tips everyday or every other day to make it last for weeks. .</li>
            <li> Ive been looking for a quick way to dry my nails for about a year.  I can&#x27;t tell you the countless number of products I&#x27;ve tried.  This top coat is great, it dries your nails very quickly and makes the polish last for a few extra days.  I highly recommend.  I sent to my sisters and they also love.  Definitely give it a try.</li>
            <li> i love love love this top coat! it dries my polish fast and it leaves my nails super shiny and helps my polish last a long time. overtime it does tend to get thicker but i bought the seche vite thinner and that gets it back to its original form. one thing to take caution of is NOT to use too much of a good thing because it will cause the polish to shrink, peel, or chip faster. this top coat is amazing over chunky glitter and makes it super sparkly and your nails will have a smooth/slick surface.</li>
            <li> This is the only top coat I use when I get a pedicure or manicure...it does dry rock hard in 15 minutes!</li>
            <li> This is now my absolute favorite top coat. It tries in no time at all - when you get done painted your second hand the first is already dry! It&#x27;s a real steal for this price too!</li>
            <li> It definitely dries faster than most other top coats I&#x27;ve tried, but I&#x27;m still having tons of smudging, even after I let my nails dry for a LONG time. I&#x27;m not really impressed, but it&#x27;s good for the price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Seche Vite.  My polish dried quickly and didn&#x27;t give me enough time to do anything to ruin my manicure the way I normally do.  I like to do my nails at home because I&#x27;m lucky enough to have a steady hand and I don&#x27;t like paying someone to do something that I can do myself.  Seche Vite dries fast enough to counteract my clumsiness, and it dries to a really incredible shine.  I get compliments on my nails all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read through some of the comments on here, and here are a few observations I&#x27;ve noticed.  First of all, if your Seche Vite is chipping or gets too thick, buy the Seche Restore.  A few drops will restore your topcoat.  DO NOT use nail polish remover, you need the Restore because it will add back in the chemicals that is used in the topcoat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for Seche Vite not working with three-free polishes, I pretty much exclusively use Zoya nail polish, and I do not have a problem with using Seche Vite as the topcoat.  For those who are encountering problems with shrinkage due to their polish being three-free, it might be a good idea to let the polish dry completely.  The chemicals evaporating out of the actual nail enamel does so at a slower rate than the toulene in Seche Vite, so that could be what is causing the shrinkage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a must have for me.  I&#x27;m completely sold and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever switch to another topcoat.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do my nails (I&#x27;m a guy), so I don&#x27;t really know if they are good for nails or not. But I can tell you that they are excellent for sealing coverslips when mounting samples for microscope slides. Even better, shipping only takes 4 days. which is still a twice as fast (and 10 times as cheap!) than if I ordered this from a laboratory supply catalog through my university.</li>
            <li> I never use polish because it comes off no matter the brand with all the hand washing and craft stuff I do. I love this stuff for toes and finger nails. I still try to give the one or two coats of polish time to dry and I try to give this top coat at least a little time as well. I will say I never get dent marks on my toenails from certain shoes or socks anymore and my fingernails dry faster. The polish last much longer as well. This is highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Best top coat on the market.  Dries  very quickly and has a very nice shine.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I have ever used! It makes your nails dry so quick and leaves them looking like glass and feel like gel! It&#x27;s way better to buy here bc it&#x27;s $10 in stores so this is a great deal. The only downside is that half way through the bottle it tends to get a little goopy but if you buy the restoration and use it it makes it like new again!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I hate to wait until my nail paint dries. That&#x27;s the only reason, I avoid to paint nail. But this dry fast top coat dries my nail paint quickly and gives it a nice shine. Love it and very happy.</li>
            <li> My nail color usually last 4-5 days using OPI nail prep and top coat.  I switched to SV based on the rave reviews and the faster drying time.  However, this stuff stinks.  Literally and figuratively.  Tried a few times but my nails chipped in less than 24 hours and I can&#x27;t get over the strong smell.  Switching back to OPI!</li>
            <li> thick and dries quick!</li>
            <li> Yes ladies, this is the best top coat ever!  It is very thick and it dries very, very fast!  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing at how fast it dries the polish!!! Love it!</li>
            <li> I feel like an idiot for ever using any other &amp;#34;fast dry&amp;#34; top coat. Seriously. Seche Vite is SO shiny and gorgeous, cuts drying time down to 2 mins TOPS, and puts the kabosh on chipping for days. Using this top coat makes removing the nail polish slightly more difficult, but it&#x27;s not a significant enough difference to ding all the positives here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is so excellent, it makes me wish we could just broadcast a quick announcement to the nail polish users of the world and let them know we&#x27;ve all been doing it wrong, and Seche Vite is the last brand of top coat we&#x27;ll ever buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t use it all within a couple of months, you may find it getting too sticky. Just buy the thinner (it&#x27;ll last you forever). No problems.</li>
            <li> Have purchased several times. I always get compliments that my nails look so shiny and a lot of people think it&#x27;s a gel manicure. Dries super quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Some facts from my use: it does tend to get pretty thick as it gets lower. But I usually use it up just in time. Also it may &amp;#34;shrink&amp;#34; depending on type of nail polish. 95% of my nail polish is just fine. Its usually the ones that have less chemicals in it I think. But to me never an issue since I change up my polish so often!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t found a better top coat yet.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this on Amazon, but I felt compelled to join the ranks of women who have and left a review.  This stuff is amazing!!  I just bought it at Target (for $9.99, so buy it here on Amazon, FOR SURE, when I need more, I will buy here no question), and came home to try it out.  There was something annoying going on with my Esspi polish, it was going on chunky and thick and weird, so I was skeptical if it would work over such a thick amount of polish.  Sure enough, it did!  My nails are shiny AND DRY within minutes.  For someone like me, with 3 kids, a legitimate fast dry top coat, is a necessity.  I only wish I had this still all my life!</li>
            <li> This dries so fast!  I have issues with polish peeling or chipping the first day I wear, it but this is an awesome protective quote that dries in record time.</li>
            <li> I have looked up and tried many top coats based on other reviews but this one is hands down the winner! I was a loyal Out The Door top coat user but after trying Seche Vite top coat I don&#x27;t think I will have to continue my search. My nails did not chip easliy and lasted about a week and a half without having to re-apply. The shine lasts long too and it leaves my nails looking as if I had the professional gels done. People dont believe me when I tell them that I do my own nails.</li>
            <li> The best top coat out there, hands down. I have absolutely zero complaints about this top coat. It drys in seconds, gives the glossiest shine and enhances the staying power of your polish. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it, and don&#x27;t try anything else!</li>
            <li> I convinced all my friends to get this top coat, and we all rave about how amazing it is. Before this I had a top coat that literally cracked and chipped my manicures like 2 days after doing them, and then finally I had enough. I did my research, found out about seche vote, and found it on amazon for a STEAL!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I liked this fast drying top coat, because it does exactly what it says it does. Although the shine wasn&#x27;t there, but I was satisfied with the fast drying attribute.</li>
            <li> Actually dries my nails at an incredible speed and keeps them smooth. I&#x27;m washing less dishes too but I really think it&#x27;s the top coat that&#x27;s keeping my polish stay longer.! :)</li>
            <li> All I can say is &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34;!  Not only does this topcoat dry fast and leaves nail polish looking very glossy, it prevents my polish from chipping much longer than other quick-dry topcoats.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a kind of woman who enjoys getting my nails done. That being said, I have been through countless other top coats that claim to never chip and have found myself in the realms of disappointment when they indeed chipped or, worse, peeled. And to make matters worse, most of these so called &amp;#34;top rated top coats&amp;#34; peeled within three days of me applying my nail polish. That doesn&#x27;t make it worth the $8-$15 that I would routinely pay, hoping for a better result than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that, Seche Vite is AMAZING. When I first opened the bottle, a very strong paint smell hit me. It wasn&#x27;t a regular nail polish smell, but rather it was closer to the smell of actual paint. It wasn&#x27;t so pungent that I didn&#x27;t use it though. I noticed while applying it, it had somewhat of a mix between a gel and a liquid consistency. It went on thicker than any top coat I had ever used. It was completely dry within three minutes, and has held up to task all week with no chipping and no peeling whatsoever. The fact that it has lasted better than all of the other top coats that I have invested in already has prompted me to give it five stars. It is durable and strong. I would definitely continue to use and certainly recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price,&lt;br /&gt;and nice product.&lt;br /&gt;It dry very fast as its name.</li>
            <li> Oh my god! I wish I&#x27;d known about this years ago!</li>
            <li> Great deal. Will be buying again. Great price and ships in three days top!</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample and was so amazed by the product that I immediately bought the full size. I applied it when my nails were still wet from the polish and within 30 seconds - bone dry. Within 5 minutes I was able to go about my day - change clothes, wash dishes, rummage through my purse ... with no smudges or marks in my polish! I used to never do my nails and now I do them all the time, thanks to this top coat. Highly, highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item through Amazon on two to three separate occasions using this account or one of my other ones. I have been looking for something that that works visually just as well as gel, minus the UV lamps.  When I received it,  I took abig sigh and hoped that I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make a long story short, I was very pleased with my results.  The shine is amazing and it lasts as long as I need it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****** If you pay attention to nothing else I&#x27;ve stated, pay attention to this******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT LISTEN TO THE NAYSAYERS!  Purchase one bottle and use it for yourself because their experience may not be your experience. Some of the main complaints have been that this polish is too thick or becomes too thick when you get closer to the end of its use, along with what is used to make this polish. That is why they have a nail polish thinner that they sale, or you can do as many of us do and add acetone until it thins out to your liking... And most nail polishes stink so I don&#x27;t understand why that is even a complaint.</li>
            <li> This polish lives up to its promises. It dries to the touch in just a couple of minutes, and leaves my nails with a super smooth, glossy shine. I also love that it fills in any little bumps or ridges that might have formed with the color polish. It dries my nails super fast and gives them a finish like glass. I&#x27;ve tried lots of other sprays, drops, and polishes that claim to be quick-drying, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> makes your polish last so much long. I use nothing else and even take it with me to the salon so they are sure to use mine not any random top coat</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE...this polished turned me into my own manicurist and saves me $60 monthly!</li>
            <li> I love this top coat, however the smell is absolutely terrible and almost unbearable at times. Please use in a well ventilated room unless you want to kill over from the chemical-y smell from this stuff. The stuff does dry very fast and its cheap, which makes up for the vile smell that comes from that tiny bottle.</li>
            <li> The title really says it all. It looks a little thick on the brush, but it goes on very smoothly. Bonus: it dries before I can even close the bottle...Okay, not that quickly, but it does dry fast. If you&#x27;re attentive to detail, you&#x27;ll notice this top coat shrinks around the edges of the nails. It&#x27;s not visible from afar, and you&#x27;d really have to be looking very close to be able to see the shrinkage. It&#x27;s something I can live with for the overall quality.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is a good buy at least it does what it states. It dries nail color quickly, however, it does dry pretty fast when exposed to air. You have to coat your nails pretty quickly so that the product doesn&#x27;t dry itself out.</li>
            <li> pretty neat top coat - and it dries really fast! if you read the directions, it shares that it bonds with the nail polishes below to fuse them together and ensure the nail polish looks great and shiny! so far, the best top coat i&#x27;ve ever used, and the fact that it dries really fast boosts the product. great quality and quick results. i&#x27;ll be sure to buy this again when i run out!</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t believe it. After applying the seche vite top coat, my nails were dry within two minutes! The glossy finish helps to protect my nails and my polish color for up to three weeks. Really happy with my purchase :)</li>
            <li> When you use this polish on your colored polish it seals it in and stays for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Best topcoat ever! I am a former nail tech, and used this product back then some fifteen years ago. That speaks for itself, if this product has been around that long, it must be good. Amazon has a great price too! I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff is in a word, amazing. It makes my nails dry in literally 2 minutes, and after that they don&#x27;t smudge or anything. I used to hate painting my nails but now I am literally doing it 3 times a week because once I apply this topcoat I don&#x27;t have to worry about smudging them or bumping something. The reason I only gave it four stars is because the warning about how it can cause birth defects? Kind of scary but I don&#x27;t plan on becoming pregnant for awhile so I will discontinue use when it comes to that. Also the smell is overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before buying this so I bought it thinking it would be a great product.  I just put it on my toes and we will see how that product holds up.  It does dry fast.  I have concerns however about the \\&quot;fine print\\&quot; on the label that reads \\&quot;This product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm\\&quot;.  This concerns me not so much personally for the birth defects as I am in my mid 40&#x27;s with teenagers and don&#x27;t plan on having more children.  However, the \\&quot;other\\&quot; reproductive harm does concern me and why does it state \\&quot;known the the state of California\\&quot;?  that&#x27;s strange.  Since I already used the product I am assuming I cannot return it.</li>
            <li> When I first used Seche Vite I was amazed by how quickly it chipped. It seemed to make my nail polish chip faster than before. Now that I have been using it for a month (it&#x27;s all I have besides Sally Hansen top coat and at least it doesn&#x27;t shink your polish) it has started coming off my nails in a clear sheet in less then a day sometime in less then an hour.  I do enjoy peeling off my nail polish so it&#x27;s kind of fun to peel off the top coat and still have nail polish on but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what most people want.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing it listed as one of In Style&#x27;s Best Beauty Buys.  It lives up to the hype, drying super fast!</li>
            <li> I am a mommy to a very hyperactive toddler and this top coat is amazing for me. Being a parent means you have very little time to sit around and wait for polish to dry. You could spend 10 minutes on your perfect mani and ruin it the second you stick your hands in the washer to get out your laundry or the second you pick up your kiddo. This dries to an indestructible hardness in about 2 minutes, and will not be ruined 5 minutes later when you have to hand wash dishes for half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say this is more ideal for people who need their top coat to dry quickly, but don&#x27;t mind changing their polish frequently. I change mine about every other day and this top coat holds up well for 2 days and then begins to chip away. One thing I have noticed is that it will last longer if your polish is fewer layers. 1 or 2 layers of polish will hold up really well, but if you layer on 4-5 coats of polish and then put this top coat on (which is very often done because it will even harden those really thick gummy manis very quickly) then it probably will not hold up as well as if you used it on 1-2 polish coats. Also, the odor on this stuff is SOOO strong. I was about 10 feet away from it and the chemical smell was so strong so please do your best to use it outside or in well-ventilated areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with this product. Yes, it does chip fairly easily after a couple of days but imo, if you are changing your polish regularly its really not that big of a deal. I have saved a ton of time thanks to this stuff, and it makes painting my nails a possibility again even when I am short on time.</li>
            <li> This coat is awesome! I don&#x27;t think I will ever use a different top coat again. It dries incredibly fast (I didn&#x27;t even know it was possible for top coats to dry so fast!), and leaves your nails really shiny (which is nice because it helps to camouflage little imperfections). This coat seriously dries within minutes, I really recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bring this top coat with me to the nail salon every time. Protects well and dries quickly. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this topcoat so many times it&#x27;s sad. I buy it every time I see it because you can slop it on so thick and hurriedly and it still turns out perfect that it&#x27;s a must for everyone.</li>
            <li> The best top coat ever. It dries really fast</li>
            <li> I would so buy this again! It is the best top coat I have ever tried! Thanks to this, my nail polish lasts longer:) it&#x27;s just pure perfection!</li>
            <li> It is very good, dry fast and more glossy with the color under it! I like it a lot, and will buy again.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT. IT WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;I put it on while my mani is wet, but have also used days after the fact. Seems to work the same for me. Keeps your mani shiny and like the day it was done for over a week.</li>
            <li> Smooth, glossy, smudge free nails every time. Dries really fast too so that is a definite plus. I love it!</li>
            <li> The best top coat ever!!!! Stock up!</li>
            <li> WOW!!!! I&#x27;ve never tried a top coat that dried this fast. I am totally blown away. This is a manicure saver. I don&#x27;t go to nail salons, rather do my own nails and I&#x27;m a total klutz - I always manage to smudge them before they are dry. Not with this top coat! It dries in a few heartbeats and is totally smudge/budge proof after it cures. Gives your polish that hi-gloss &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look because of how quickly it sets  - I LOVE that! Also very few bubbles (another one of my frequent issues). I think it dries way too quickly for any bubbles to pop. I will say that it smells heinous. Like an industrial chemical, believe it or not, worse than actual nail polish. So, I would be careful breathing it in.</li>
            <li> Are u kiddin me? Everybody loves Seche Vite. For a damn good reason.</li>
            <li> As described. Promptly delivered.</li>
            <li> Best fast drying top coat out there.  Can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t buy this sooner.</li>
            <li> It does what it says. Drys super fast. Stays shiny for DAYS. And it doesn&#x27;t chip. This actually makes some nail polishes look like gel polish. This is a product you can&#x27;t go wrong about. It is $10 in store. So buying it on amazon is the best thing you can do.</li>
            <li> Dries very fast. Great top coat</li>
            <li> I bought this on recommendation of an acquaintance and I am really glad I did.  I used it over a Wet &#x27;n Wild polish that I absolutely love but that only lasts for about two days.  With this as the top coat it lasted for almost a whole week.  If I had applied another coat mid-week an entire week would be no problem.  I&#x27;m going to try the nail prep and base coat next!</li>
            <li> Seche Vite (French for Fast Dry) dries oh too well. I used it once, and now it is a hardened mass that I mournfully had to toss. Yes, it was closed very tightly. I don&#x27;t know what happened.</li>
            <li> By the next day I could see the whites at the tops of my nails, the shrinkage was so extreme. It led not just to the chipping of polish, but to my fingernails breaking, unevenly, along the top. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite top coat ever. It dries super quickly which I absolutely love. I highly recommend this top coat if you enjoy nail art because it doesn&#x27;t smudge your designs.</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever! I have repurchased multiple times and its amazing, i dont use anything else anymore for my nails</li>
            <li> BEST TOP COAT I&#x27;VE EVER USED.</li>
            <li> We all see these reviews..Mine are usually to the point, as the things being REVIEWED.&lt;br /&gt; Works as advertised..quicker dry than the Sally Hanson..which is something.&lt;br /&gt; Very Clear, Glossy Wet Look when dry.&lt;br /&gt; When it looks wet three weeks from application, then you got a wicked product that earns every good will.&lt;br /&gt; When it Drys within 4 min from application, enough to go on with life.....then Im all in.&lt;br /&gt;When it has a Reputation like Seche does to always dry faster than others..believe it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, plain and simple! It goes on thick and dries hard in minutes. It allows me to go several days without chipping, which is unheard of for me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all true -- arrived fast, dries fast, gel-look shine. Nails on fleek. So happyyyyyyy!! Thanks beBeautiful. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> every woman should have this. its simply amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;Paint a coat on and it not only looks like you have had your nails gel painted, but it dries super fast even when you put on a couple coats of a polish under it.  i will never be without this product again!</li>
            <li> I love it,  dry faster and seems like my nails are professional.&lt;br /&gt;100% Quality!</li>
            <li> It works, just saying so more people know :)</li>
            <li> This is the only top coat I will use. The shiny smooth coat it leaves makes people ask me where I got my nails done, no joke!</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;d give this 2 stars instead of 1 is because it does dry polish fast.&lt;br /&gt;But there are too many negatives to make it any good.&lt;br /&gt;The shrinkage is awful.  You can spend all this time painting designs etc, follow through with the seche vite top coat and you&#x27;ll have to touch up the ends because it pulled everything back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But worse is how damaging this stuff was!  I haven&#x27;t used this in 2 months because I had to wait for my nails to grow out again.  Seche Vite destroyed them.  They became peely and thin and I was too afraid to buff them to try to fix some of the flaking because it would further thin them out.  That solid white line where the nail leaves the finger tip was instead all jagged.  It looked like I bent them all backwards or smashed them into things. It wasn&#x27;t pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not buying this again!</li>
            <li> Love how shiny and strong this glaze is. I put 2 coats on because my nails are thin and my nails are so much stronger. Love how it drys so fast. I paint my nails before bed and I never wake up with hair impressions on my nails. Will never use another product!</li>
            <li> There is no doubt that this product is fast drying, in fact it has encouraged me to paint my nails more often now that I don&#x27;t have to wait 20-30mins for my top coat to dry before I can do anything but lay there with my arms in the air! I would say after 2-3 minutes of using the Seche Vite and I&#x27;m good to go on with my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because it definitely does not stop chipping, which is the reason I originally purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all I would say that it is the best top coat I have ever used (OPI was my previous go-to) but unfortunately it is not the miracle product I was looking for that would make my manicure last longer. I have seen chipping as soon as the next day.</li>
            <li> The best. Perfect shine, long lasting topcoat, and the best part is it dries nails ROCK HARD in just a couple minutes. I love this stuff-- I&#x27;ve been buying it loyally for 10 years now. Don&#x27;t bother with other top coats, this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent top dollar on top coats, an gels, and this by far was the best topcoat I have ever received. It dried so fast!! Unbelievable. Very hard, glossy finish. Will definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE this fast-drying, long-lasting topcoat.  The ONLY drawback that I have found is that because of the fast drying nature, air exposure from use causes it to get a little thick pretty quickly.  But any lover of nail polish should have some nail polish thinner on hand (DO NOT USE ACETONE!!!).  If you don&#x27;t, I recommend [[ASIN:B004F82HB8 Beauty Secrets Nail Polish Thinner]] for the great price and big lasts forever bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - BUY THIS TOPCOAT!</li>
            <li> Works really well. My nail polish lasts longer on my nails when I use it and it makes my nails look really shiny.</li>
            <li> Keeps nail polish on longer. Keeps the top hard and protects from scratches and smudges. I love it so much, it is defenitly a must</li>
            <li> I just did my nails last night after receiving the top coat. I usually dont like to paint my nails during the week after work because of how long nail polish takes to dry. So i did my nails at 8:30 and went to bed at 11 and woke up with nails that didn&#x27;t have sheet impressions!!! They dried super quick! Today my nails are super shiny :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As time wears on i am hoping that the polish will stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is the smell... it is very overwhelming. I also woke up in the middle of the night with a headache; not sure if the polish had anything to do with it?</li>
            <li> This top coat is just as fabulous as countless other blogs and reviews have stated, maybe even more!!  I know some people out there hate this top coat due to shrinkage and drying out in the bottle but I am so glad I tried it because I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes all of my imperfections BEAUTIFUL and SUPER GLOSSY.  It dries faster than it takes for you to read this review.  Smooth like GLASS.  AAAHHHH.  Lovely nails I have thanks to Seche!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find shrinkage over Dance Legend nail polishes.  I thought it was my mind playing tricks on me because I have their thermal polishes and I thought it was just changing color differently over the edges, but upon closer inspection it was definitely shrinkage.  Seche just doesn&#x27;t work well with all nail polishes, for which I will solve that problem and try using Poshe instead, as I heard that it does not shrink but is comparable to Seche.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard it dries out in the bottle, even when using thinner, but I have not had that problem.  YMMV.</li>
            <li> I will admit that it dries very quickly and leaves a nice shine, but the shrinkage it causes drives me crazy! I put it on an within minutes I can see the tips of my nails. I will not be buying this again,</li>
            <li> This top coat sets polish for 5-10 days chip free with a great shine. Make sure to wrap the polish onto the underside of the nail to set a manicure for a long stay.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after reading a blog on nail care.  I hate doing my own nails because of the time it takes them to DRY!!!! So i decided to give this stuff a try. I am not joking I polished my nails before work this morning and was able to get in the shower and flat iron my hair. MY nails look PERFECT!!! No smudges no streaks just shiny flawlessness. They were dry within 5 minutes even though i waited 10. I am now a believer I will never use another top coat EVER!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Best top coat I have ever used. Drys so fast and last for about a week for me without chipping. Makes painting my nails fast and easy. Don&#x27;t have to sit around waiting for them to dry.</li>
            <li> saw this on a beauty blog, so i thought i would try it. It works great! It goes on smooth and dries quickly, as promised.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the shine it leaves. This is the best shiny coat Ive ever used And it dries really fast which is awesome!</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this top coat.  It reminds me of the way i felt when i first discovered Magic Erasers.  It really dries so fast it is like magic!  I was using a spray before and I thought that was great, but Seche Vite is 100 times better.  within 10 minutes of painting my nails i can do dishes, unload the washing machine, whatever!  And it is almost half the price on Amazon as it is in the store, so i am more than thrilled.  i will definitely be using this from now on!</li>
            <li> This top coat is perfect for covering, protecting, and drying any other polish you are using. I can polish and go without worrying about getting any smudges. It lasts about a week.</li>
            <li> Ive tried this stuff with 3 different nail polishes. It makes the polish peel right off. Dont buy!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Makes nail color hard and shiny. Nails dry in a just few minutes. Great top coat. I will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. It drys very fast and with children that&#x27;s perfect. It is very shiny doesn&#x27;t leave streaks. In love with this product!</li>
            <li> I use this product regularly. Dries in seconds, helps prevent chipping and has crazy shine like glass. I use it with Gelous (see my Gelous review) to get a gel manicure look, without the UV, time or price.</li>
            <li> i have always seen this in stores but they have been $10-$15 dollars so finding it online for less than $5 was a steal and i has to get it and it works great.</li>
            <li> I did web research to select this product because my nails were peeling like sheets of mica.  I don&#x27;t get salon manicures because polish won&#x27;t last on my fingernails. (I do get salon pedicures.)  Good product to prolong your manicure no matter who does your nails. I&#x27;m a cheapskate, so wish it were cheaper, but this is the most recommended brand by the consumer websites I checked.  I have lots of bottles of cheap top coats that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I love this nail product. I probably could go 6 days with shine and no chipping but I like changing color more often. I reapply every other day to maintain shine. This stuff dries my nails in seconds!!!!!!!!! I use a good quality color so I dont have alot of coats.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years now.  Very happy that I could purchase directly from this merchant.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is incredibly popular on beauty blogs and websites, and rightfully so- sort of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does dry incredibly quickly. That&#x27;s no exaggeration. You apply it when the nail polish is still wet, and then it dries it all. By the time I finish painting the second hand, the first hand is dry. That part is amazing. Will it still smudge? Yes, it&#x27;s dry but not set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does resist sheet marks and pillow lines. That&#x27;s also impressive, you can paint before bed and wake up without linen tire tracks cutting through the shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give a very &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look. It glistens and shines and you end up staring at your hands far more than is socially acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But- as it dries, it pulls in from the edges. Even if you make sure to paint from edge to edge, after a day, you&#x27;ll see a gap between the edge of the top coat and the skin of your finger. Tips start to show too, so it pulls in and shrinks from all directions.&lt;br /&gt;It also peels. it doesn&#x27;t chip, which is great, but when it wants to come off, it comes off all at once in a giant sheet. Some people on blogs and sites say that this happens due to applying Seche Vite either too early- when the polish is still too wet- or too late, when the polish is too dry. I experimented with both and couldn&#x27;t stop it from happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s good- it&#x27;s shiny, it&#x27;s quick, it&#x27;s pretty- but I&#x27;d rather have chips than lose entire nails at once.</li>
            <li> I got this a week ago and I just want to say it makes my cheap nail polish last sooo much longer[week to two week range bro] and makes it shiner as well. Like you feel like Cruella de vil with your shiny nails. Seriously and when the polish does come off it comes off kinda like tape. It&#x27;s very hard to remove without remover. One tip though, apply this to your nail polish when it&#x27;s set or gummy not completely sopping wet or your manicure will look like crap. HAPPY PAINTING! &lt;3</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is my favorite top coat in the world. All you need is one healthy coat to seal in you polish and give a lasting shine. Also dries completely with in 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li> No more smudged polish for me.  With this dry fast top coat i can get to my daily routine without smudged nails.</li>
            <li> Good polish. Helps with intricate designs because it does not smudge them.&lt;br /&gt;On the down side, however, it seems like it makes the polish chip more easily.</li>
            <li> It dries really fast and stays chip free for days.  Follow the instructions though, needs to be put on while polish is still wet to avoid shrinkage.</li>
            <li> Dries fast and with a nice professional shine!  I like to do my own french manicures, and would be lost without this.  Makes even sub-par nail polish look professional!</li>
            <li> I have been using this polish for a while now, and am on my third bottle. I love the fact that it dries in record time, and that the finish is super glossy. It&#x27;s inexpensive and long lasting. I do my nails one a week, and do the nails of all my friends, and pedicures all the time. This makes the polish last much longer and keeps the shiny finish much better than most top-coats I&#x27;ve tried. The biggest thing I like about this topcoat is that it dries extremely fast, safely sealing in your fresh polish.</li>
            <li> I will probably never, ever use another top coat. This has been my favorite for years. I don&#x27;t really want to sit around for 30 minutes waiting for my polish to dry... this gets it done so that I can function within 5 minutes, and really not worry about messing up my nails within 10 minutes, at most. Not only that, but the finish is fabulous! My nails look shiny for up to 2 weeks! If I wasn&#x27;t constantly doing dishes and cleaning, I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t chip as much, but I can usually make it through 5 or 6 days without any chips. I would recommend this to anyone that wants perfect nails, quick!</li>
            <li> I found my go to top coat, looks like gel and protects against chipping</li>
            <li> It took WEEKS to get to my house. Then when I got it, the brush broke off. Then  on top of that, after one day of having the top coat on, my nails started to chip. My nails grow pretty fast but after using this product, my nails tke 10 years (not literally) to grow back! I was so upset with myself for buying this. There is also false advertising! It says FAST DRY but it took half an hour to  dry on my hands and I only put a little bit on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS TOP COAT!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! It is such a great top coat. I put it on a week and a half ago and still no chips nothing!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am soo amazed by the quality of this top coat!</li>
            <li> I does not work....polished my nails at home and by the time I got to work the next morning it was already pealing.</li>
            <li> Love!  Quick shippping</li>
            <li> I have been using this top coat for a while now and I must tell you I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. It is really shiny and I feel that it makes the nail polish last longer. I have been using it only on my toes since I can not wear polish on my fingers. So far it seems to be the best top coat I have tried.  Just one layer is enough for me.</li>
            <li> This is the most incredible product I have ever used. It&#x27;s like magic. I will buy this product again and again and again.  Don&#x27;t listen to the low ratings it is worth every penny. I have always had trouble with fingerprints and smudges but no more. This has completely changed the way I do my nails and nail art.</li>
            <li> This is a nice lasting top coat and it does dry faster than the other brands I&#x27;d used.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t instantaneous, but faster than normal top coat.</li>
            <li> I am angry that it took me so long in my life to find this. It works great. No more messed up home manicures because I didn&#x27;t wait long enough for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon and because I&#x27;m impatient and I couldn&#x27;t want for it to arrive (took a week I believe), I ended up buying a bottle at Target and figured I would gift the Amazon one to a friend. The packaging on the outside is the same but on the inside is different, and I have a feeling that this one might be some kind of ripoff, though I have no way to be sure. Just go to your local Target/Walmart/Sally Beauty Supply and purchase it there so you know for sure that it&#x27;s a real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACTUAL Seche Vite is amazing however. It provides a high gloss finish with extremely fast drying and really seals in your polish with just one coat. For best results, apply Seche Vite in normal brush strokes and then seal it in by horizontally running the brush along the edge and slightly underneath the nail. This will guarantee less chipping!</li>
            <li> Well pack, quick shipping, and excellent product. Just what I expected this is a high shine polish.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I managed at home manicures and pedicures before this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I am admittedly clumsy, after a pedicure I have a bad habit of walking into things and smacking my toes on random stuff. And my manicures? One always smudges, always.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I still smack and bump things but I don&#x27;t have to re-do the polish or put on another layer of top coat if I&#x27;m trying to smooth out a spot.&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first, but after my first pedicure and manicure, I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of top coats in the past, and decided to purchase this one based on previous reviews.  This is hands down the best fast drying top coat that I have ever tried!  You can do pretty thick coats of nail polish, and then apply this, and they are dry within a couple of minutes.  Also, this top coat does not streak or smudge the polish underneath in any way.  I highly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I have ever used. Apply one coat, wait two minutes, and do whatever! No more hair marks or bed sheet smudges ever again.</li>
            <li> This topcoat is amazing! Not only does it dry quickly but it smooths over any polish imperfections and leaves nails looking salon glossy and perfect! I have used OPI, Esse, Butter, you name it...this is the one I will be buying again and again.</li>
            <li> As a quick drying top coat, it did the job. Dries incredibly fast and I don&#x27;t have to worry about smudges. However, it is not so great if you&#x27;re looking for a protective top coat, the color chipped pretty quickly with this.</li>
            <li> I love how this top coat finishes the look on my nails. However, it tends to peel off easily since it dries so quickly and hardens so fast.</li>
            <li> love love love love it. does exactly what it says it will do. it dries very quickly and stays supper shiny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of blog posts touting the amazingness of Seche Vite, but I wasn&#x27;t sure it would be worth the price.  If you&#x27;re someone who, like me, tends to smudge your nail polish or be impatient waiting for it to dry - this is your product.  If you work with your hands and experience chips a lot - this is your product.  I&#x27;ve had my nails done for 4 days and nary a chip in sight!  This is by far the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Heard a lot about this product, so I thought I&#x27;d try it. I must say it drys extremely fast, my nails are almost instantly dry, which is Great!!! The down side: it doesn&#x27;t chip any less than any other top coat I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love this topcoat. It dries extremely fast. No longer do I have to deal with dings or wrinkled polish by doing my nails in the evening. This stuff is amazing. You just apply your final coat of color, let it dry a few minutes, then apply Seche Vite just like any other topcoat. It&#x27;s foolproof and doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and don&#x27;t know what I would do without it!  My favorite thing about it is that it dries sooo fast.  It stays glossy and lasts a while too.  The only problem is that it gets goopy before the bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUT THIS....IT HAS TOLUENE WHICH IS ONE OF THE BAD THREE IN NAIL POLISH OP BUT SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND ALSO WARING!!!!THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS A CHEMICAL KNOWN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CAUSE BIRTH DEFECTS OR OTHER REPRODUCTIVE HARM please do not buy this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of Top Coats over the past year, and this is hands down the best.  Recently I&#x27;ve been struggling with top coats that several hours after I applied them were still developing bubbles or I would wake up the morning after doing my nails the afternoon before and discover sheets marks on my nails.  Not with the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish dries almost instantly, so that within minutes you can get back to your daily life without worrying about messing up your nails.  It drys hard, with a professional high-gloss look.  Even if the rest of your coats of polish are slightly uneven or are drying with bubbles, put this on and everything is cured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other day I made the mistake of using my Esse 3-way gloss top coat, and by the next morning I had bubbles and sheet marks.  I quickly put another coat of this on top of it before I ran out the door, and within a couple moments it had cured all the flaws of my self-manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must have product!</li>
            <li> ...I wish they could remake it with less harmful ingredients:(.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, this top coat changed my nail-polishing life. Before I knew something like this existed, I put off repainting my natural nails for as long as possible because it was quite literally an all-afternoon job for me. And even after all of those hours of waiting, there was no guarantee that when I went to bed that night, I wouldn&#x27;t wake up with sheet ridges (which I almost ALWAYS did). I loved this stuff so much I gave a bottle to my mom before I realized it contained the harmful ingredients. She called me the day after she first used it to complain that it wasn&#x27;t any good because her nail polish peeled off in sheets by morning. I knew she had done something wrong because that NEVER happened to me and I&#x27;d been using it for at least a month before I gave her one. Her mistake: She used it as a BASE COAT, too! The bottle tells you NOT to do that! LOL! Anyway, since she&#x27;s been CORRECTLY using it, she loves it. Still...I&#x27;m looking for alternatives to this as I am now aware of the risks in using this product, but I do plan to continue using it every other manicure until it&#x27;s all gone. WARNING: using this ridiculously fast-drying top coat may cause you to DRAMATICALLY increase your nail polish inventory...let&#x27;s just say that I started out with maybe 20 polishes, but after I found that I&#x27;d actually be able to paint my nails way more often, at any time of day or night, even an hour before going to bed, I now have WELL over 100...sigh...</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on other reviews and I am not disapointed.  I love my nail salon but I feel like they skimp on the drying time/method and my nails are still a bit tacky when leaving.  I brought this in last week and I think it really made a difference.  Within 5 minutes my nails felt dry to the touch, not tacky at all.  My only very minor complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t dry with that awesome glassy look that some top coats have and I like.  It&#x27;s shiny but not quite what I am used to.  Almost a subtle texture to it.  Overall very pleased.  I paired it with CND Sticky base coat and a run of the mill OPI color.</li>
            <li> Bought this to try to see how it compared to my current topcoat of OPI. I really like this topcoat because it dries so fast and it&#x27;s nice when you have an impatient 3 and 5 year old always wanting or needing help with something.</li>
            <li> Magic in a bottle.  My favorite top coat in the whole world.. it will not fail you. Super fast dry.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using the Seche Vite, I thought it was just going to be what I used years ago, I only wear top coats on dark nail polish. I love this stuff!! It&#x27;s not oily, and gives a great top coat, keeps my nails shiny and keeps the polish on my nails looking good for 4 days!! And dries my nails quick, meaning to the point I can do light things, if I were to rub my finger nail hard on my jeans, yes it will mess them up, they dry them enough to where you can do things and not worry about if something touches your nails, and definitely keeps the polish from chipping or fading.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever owned! It does dry incredibly fast, and I&#x27;m not exaggerating, I actually use it on nails that I&#x27;ve only done a few minutes before to set them so I don&#x27;t mess them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What people say is true, it does tend to not last long, so I would say a good way to look at this is fast drying but NOT long wear. I have noticed however that it depends on the nail polish I pair it with. But personally I still gave 5 stars because I don&#x27;t mind the short wear time. I like to change my nails often or just leave them be so they have some time away from nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would say it&#x27;s down to personal preference. I&#x27;ve struggled with messing up nails I spent time getting just right since I was a little girl, so to me, this is a miracle in a bottle. But if you are patient and can wait until another polish sets up that will last you, I say go for it. I&#x27;m looking into a good gel nail kit myself. I figure if I do want long lasting nails that&#x27;s the way to go. Happy Polishing!</li>
            <li> Not as incredible as I&#x27;d hoped but did the job.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite topcoat! It&#x27;s a really shiny, smooth gloss and it definitely helps preserve the polish underneath. My only complaint is that I wish the brush was a little longer. My bottle is now a little over ¼ way full and it&#x27;s almost impossible to use! I love the polish itself, I&#x27;d just like to be able to use it all up!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat ever. It dries fast and the clear coat is not sticky. Very smooth.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price!</li>
            <li> Magic. I have NEVER had a fast dry top coat that actually worked. I put on 3 coats of polish and a top coat then this......7 went to bed 30 minutes later with NO smudges or dents the next morning.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! It dries faster than any top coat I have ever owned. Will continue to buy, because this is just a life saver for people like me who don&#x27;t have time to wait 3 hours till my nails completely dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this top nail coat due to the great reviews, and I must say that it doesn&#x27;t disappoint. I had my last nail polish on with this top coat and it didn&#x27;t chip for nothing until I had it removed. Great product!</li>
            <li> I very love this product because it helps me keeping my polished nail much longer.</li>
            <li> Finally I can do my nails at home.</li>
            <li> The best top coat I have ever used. And I&#x27;ve tried all different kinds of brands. It&#x27;s a must buy!</li>
            <li> Fastest drying top coat ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 8/27/15 My manicure is going strong, 3 days later. No chips, whatsoever.  I use the American Classis Gelous Nail Gel Base Coat along with it.</li>
            <li> I know it has toluene but it works so well! I always apply this in a super ventilated area such as outside my home haha.</li>
            <li> Super fast drying polish.  It leaves a shiny finish and really makes my nails awesome. Super fast drying nil polish.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time dries quickly and makes a glossy finish. Highly recommend for your final step of polished nails......</li>
            <li> this is by far the best top coat in the world. seriously. buy it now. i have since found a local supply store where i purchase this for super cheap, and it is 7.50 at ulta too. best topcoat! glossiest finish! will make any manicure look like gel nails. makes your polish last super super super long. get it! now!</li>
            <li> The one great thing about this top coat is how quickly it dries!  It really does dry in minutes, which I love!  I hate having to wait forever to do any sort of chores, housework, or ANYTHING when I paint my nails.  I feel very comfortable doing whatever after only 2 or 3 minutes with this top coat.  That being said... it&#x27;s otherwise terrible.  It creates a sort of sealing coat on your polish which causes it to peel off in big sheets after only a day (or less).  As if nail polish didn&#x27;t start to peel and chip soon enough, this top coat makes it peel even sooner!  So annoying.  Not worth the effort or money... shouldn&#x27;t a top coat make it last longer?!</li>
            <li> Letting my acrylic nails go and going &amp;#34;au naturale&amp;#34; has been the best decision.. This Seche Vite fast dry top coat is absolutely *AMAZING*  I&#x27;ve been having lots of fun with different polish colors, and combined with the Seche Base Ridge Filling Base Coat, I put 2 coats of OPI and layer this Seche Vite fast dry top coat immediately, and I&#x27;m telling you my nails are DRY to the touch like 2 minutes later.  To make sure they&#x27;re totally dry I usually try not to do too much for like 30 minutes afterward, but after that I can shower, dig in my purse, whatever.  No dings, no smudges, nothing but perfect salon-quality nails.  And savings on MONEY and TIME by not having to go to the salon every 2 weeks!  How nice.  My manicure lasts for about 5 days, and that&#x27;s with being active, doing dishes, etc.  This stuff rocks.  I usually swap my colors out ever couple of days or so, so chipping isn&#x27;t really an issue for me.  But I will just throw this out there... I only use OPI polishes because even with the Seche Vite top coat, if you&#x27;re using an inferior polish, it&#x27;ll still smudge.  Or at least mine did.  I NEVER have this problem when combining OPI and both the Seche Base and Seche Vite top coat.  My only regret is not losing the stupid acrylic nails sooner.</li>
            <li> Great product! A coworker recommended it to me. She said she loved it because it made a so-so DIY manicure look put together and gave a nice lasting gel effect to nails. She was right!</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;m a very impatient person. I haven&#x27;t done my nails in years(finger nails)because every polish takes way to long to dry but this polish works wonderful! I let it dry longer than normal thou. I paint my nails with the color of my choice and let it sit for a few minutes then place the top coat on and wait 20 minutes and they are done! I usually do this before bed and let it dry over night. I love this and can&#x27;t wait to try more products from them!😊</li>
            <li> this is the s*** excuse my french.. dries nails in a about 30 secs.  the words seche vite does it justice.. the words means dry fast.. it should be dry super fast lol</li>
            <li> OMG!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have used oil fast drying drops, I wasn&#x27;t truly happy with it. I came across this and read the reviews. I couldn&#x27;t believe I just finished my last nail and my first one was dry!! They look and feel better than the fast drying drops. Love it!</li>
            <li> Dries fast, as promised. However, whenever I get in the shower, it ends up chipping off very easily. Almost worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I can actually do my nails on my own now without messing it up after 5 minutes. It dries extremely fast. No more sitting in front of the fan for 20 mins. I paint my nails, cover it with seche vite and I am out the door.</li>
            <li> I used this topcoat for a long time years ago and completely forgot about how much I liked it.  It dries quickly and provides lasting shine.  I usually do a topcoat every few days to extend the life of my manicure.  I find that it really does work.  They sell this product in the grocery store and at Walgreens and it usually costs about $8.  I picked up a bottle on Amazon for half that price.  I couldn&#x27;t resist trying it again.  When I bought it years ago, it was only available at the beauty supply (Sally&#x27;s).  Now I guess business is so good they sell it everywhere.  It&#x27;s a good product.  It also doesn&#x27;t yellow like many clear polishes.  I really like everything about it.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This top coat performs much better than my OPI one.  It really helped my color dry faster and did not chip as fast.  I work on a computer all day, so that is very important.</li>
            <li> My fave fast drying top coat... works immediately</li>
            <li> This top coat is like magic! I glides on smoothly without smearing my nail art, smooths everything out, and it dries &amp; sets almost instantly no matter how many layers of polish you&#x27;ve put on to a glassy finish. It is recommended that you buy it with the Seche Restore because it thickens as you use it, but I&#x27;m about half way through the bottle and haven&#x27;t needed to thin it yet. I ordered several more bottles for Christmas gifts and all my friends love it!</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite top coat! I have tried other brands that people have had success with, but nothing, in my opinion, works as well as Seche Vite for me. It does get more viscous about halfway through the bottle, but I just add some Orly Thinner and it works fine. With Orly Bonder, 2-3 coats nail polish and then Seche Vite, my manicure ends up lasting me a week with minimal tipwear.</li>
            <li> Seche is honestly amazing. It dries in about 10 mins flat, meaning that I can paint my nails right before bed and not worry about ruining my nails. It&#x27;s also mega shiny and since it&#x27;s so thick, it can smooth out flakie and glitter polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issues are:&lt;br /&gt;1. that it &#x27;shrinks&#x27;, meaning that it will cause your polish to retract off of the end of your nails...but you can combat this by painting a horizontal swipe of Seche along the tips as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. that it &#x27;gloops&#x27; up pretty quickly (but you can always buy Seche Restore to fix that, which is worth it in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> This stuff dries my polish SERIOUSLY fast, and it so far hasn&#x27;t seemed to matter how many coats of polish are under it. The other night I finished painting my nails and had about 10-15 minutes to go until I needed to go to bed, and with this product that was able to happen. The next morning, there were no smears or smudge marks where the polish had been shifted around due to not being fully dried/cured. As other reviewers have reported, it does have a strong chemical-ly smell, but I kind of like it A) because I am weird like that and B) it reminds me of a wood-working shop. With this top coat i have noticed less smearing of the colors in my nail art, and it provides a nice smooth top of my nail as it seems to help level out any bumps from said nail art. Doesn&#x27;t seem to assist any with preventing nail polish chipping, so i might still need to get a non-chip top coat. Unless a non-chip polish is as rare and mythical as a golden-horned unicorn... :)</li>
            <li> I love this top coat. It dries really fast. I don&#x27;t have wait forever.  I even can take a shower a minute after applying and that don&#x27;t mess up.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! This dries so fast, I am in heaven. I always smudge my nails, but with this, I haven&#x27;t. It&#x27;s also incredibly shiny. I can&#x27;t wait to try more elaborate designs now.</li>
            <li> best top coat ever- can use on wet nails and it dries super fast. Quite durable and I&#x27;m hard on my hands.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Dries my polish in around 30 seconds, so I can get along with my day. The coat is also quite thick, which ensures that my mani doesn&#x27;t get chipped for quite a few days. The smell of this is very strong and quite gross, but it does disappear quickly.</li>
            <li> Totally awesome, I love this top coat and use it for every single time I paint my nails. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Pros:  fantastic shine, dries fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:  thick, gets stringy after awhile, not really long lasting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product OKAY. It does dry fast but at the end of the bottle, it gets really thick and stringy and does not dry as quickly and is susceptible to bumps and scratches, screwing up your (and my) manicure.  It also does not maintain my polish for even a week, but I will say that I do dishes (a normal amount) and wash my hands (like an insane person).  Therefore, if you use gloves and are not a crazy hand washer like me, then this product will probably work better for you.</li>
            <li> Maybe it just doesnt work for me because i use my hands a lot in my crafting + cycling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it chips and peels easily.</li>
            <li> Just love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This top coat is super shiny and actually does dry super fast. It also lasted a really long time. My wife really likes it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been needing a good top coat for the longest and i got around to this one because of the good reviews. I tried it on myself today and it does dry pretty fast. I don&#x27;t appreciate the fact that the seller basically shoved the box in the package, it came open on both ends..but luckily the product itself was fine. I also have to mention this weird smell that came along  with the bottle, I had to wash the exterior of it, it was that bad. But overall good product, not so good receiving it.</li>
            <li> This is a glorious miracle product, sent from Mount Olympus from Aphrodite herself. Because the Goddess of Love wants you to have fabulous nails and a manicure that lasts for a week. Listen to Aphrodite. Buy Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat. I even put it over my professionally done manicure to make it last longer!</li>
            <li> Amazing top coat, you can&#x27;t get any better even if went through every top coat ever sold. Longest lasting manicure I ever had and it dries super fast. Definitely a must have.</li>
            <li> This is the best ever</li>
            <li> This top coat maintains my nail polish for at least a week. I&#x27;m very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> Have been through so many top coats and decided to finally google what was the best. This one came up as #1 on 4 different sites. Went to ulta and target both sell it for $6.99. Yes, it smells but the high gloss and quick dry make up for it.</li>
            <li> It goes on when the polish is still tacky, and it&#x27;s shiny and hard in like a minute.  It is easy to use and is the most amazing product yet!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I&#x27;ve been using Quimica Alemana Nail Hardener 0.47 oz about 2-3 weeks and cannot believe the difference in my nails (I have been getting acrylic nails for 30+ years...so you can imagine how thin and weak they are). Whenever I had tried to grow them out in the past, they would peel and tear (just folding laundry was an issue!). Someone who reviewed the Quimica product also recommended Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Nail Coat, 0.5 Ounce, so I got it. It dries amazingly fast and has a very thick consistency (not watery). Leaves my new nails nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> Love it!  This is my second bottle and I like how glossy and fast drying it is.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Arrived on time pkg was good</li>
            <li> I got this b/c I started using Julep polish and for me that polish was taking to long to dry but having that sticky factor after words.the seche vite really douse dry fast and has long wear before chipping. I really do like this item and would buy it again</li>
            <li> For the price this is well worth it. My wife loves being able to add a topcoat and speed up the drying process.</li>
            <li> Wow...I ordered this is the wee hours of 5/21 and got it today, 5/23!!!!! Super fast delivery I have ever had!!! Thanks so much. I use this top coat faithfully and love it so much!!! Best top coat out in the market IMO.</li>
            <li> I bought Seche Vite after reviews on YouTube. My nails are very fragile. It didn&#x27;t last longer than a couple of days. It started to peel.  Not what I expected. Sorry.</li>
            <li> I had bought this product to keep my polishes from chipping and to have them last long. This product did exactly what I wanted it to do. It also dried faster than normal polishes which was a bonus. The product came in the earliest dilvery estimate date. It came out of the box during the shipping process but i could care less about that. I recommend this product everybody looking for a  perfect quality topcoat.</li>
            <li> I use this often.  Every 3 days or so with every manicure.  After some time you will have some thickening of the polish but I highly recommend for you to buy a bottle of seche restore with this!  It&#x27;s a must, it will make the formula return to it&#x27;s original texture.</li>
            <li> I thought the reviews for this were more BS, and people trying to hype up a product. I was so wrong!  this polish is AMAZING. I have no idea how ive gone this long without it. No exaggeration. Nails are completely dry in minutes! You can shower!</li>
            <li> It does dry very fast but the smell of this top coat is horrible. But the worst part is that it peels off along with the nail color in just a few hours after it dries. Perhaps this is not really Seche Vite?</li>
            <li> I love this fast dry top coat. It allows me to do my nails and run out of the house 10 minutes later. It also allows me to complete nail art following a shorter drying time. It is super glossy and beautiful. Good to note that it is is a thick polish and needs to be spread evenly (you can see drastic differences or if you missed a spot). Also, from my experience, it has increased chipping of some polishes.</li>
            <li> If using this as just a plain clear coat, it is horrible!!  Was peeling off in less than one day and I hadn&#x27;t done anything but sleep.</li>
            <li> I can always have my nails painted now thanks to seche vite. Completely dry in less than a few minutes and when paired with quality nail polish, a manicure can last a week without chipping! Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time!!</li>
            <li> it is a good top coat the only thing that is kind of annoying is that the topcoat get a little gloopy after a while so make sure you have a good nail thinner to go with it</li>
            <li> I like to do my nails, a lot. My problem was that I hated waiting for the nails to dry, and worst of all, you are never sure when they are REALLY dry. This product is just fantastic. It dries up instantly and dries the polish under it as well.</li>
            <li> There is nothing else like this; it is truly the perfect top coat for beautiful, shiny, and FAST drying nails.  It is the BEST top coat.  I have been a nail blogger since 2008 and I have been sent MANY top coats to review.  This is above and beyond the best one there is.</li>
            <li> When I ask my manicurist to use my own top nail coat, she said, &amp;#34;Where did you get this?  It&#x27;s the best there is.&amp;#34;  I have to agree.</li>
            <li> As amazing as everyone says it is.</li>
            <li> I hear this is used in the salons; it&#x27;s AWESOME, dries super quick, is long lasting and is super affordable!</li>
            <li> i love love love this nail polish. dries fast and leaves nails looking great.</li>
            <li> This top coat is amazing! I put it on right after I put several coats of everything before and it instantly dries them and has a great shine! My manicure at home now only takes no more than 15 minutes and it actually looks much better than professional ones I used to pay for.</li>
            <li> Excellent fast drying top coat. Nails shine, and dried super quick. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  I am horrible when it comes to painting my nails.  I have no patience waiting for it to try and even when I try I always end up touching something accidentally and messing it up.  I love this, it def. works and has helped improve my nail polishing skills.</li>
            <li> My third time purchasing this top coat, long lasting and smooth.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle worker!!</li>
            <li> I have ordered 4 more and given them as gift (kept 2)  it is so qyick to paint nails, have a cup and tea and out the door.  No smudge, wrinkles.  PERFECT</li>
            <li> This is by far the best quick drying top coat they have available; it use to be sold to licensed cosmetologists or manicurists in professional distributor stores only, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find this an excellent top coat....</li>
            <li> I love this. It dries so fast and leaves your nails hard, so you can get back to work! Its very shiny and durable. It makes your nails strong while its on. Its very shiny too. A friend recommended it and I will never not use this now, I fell in love.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very smooth top coat.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the hype and it was cheaper online than at my local walmart. Honestly, I&#x27;ve had better top coats. The Sally Hansen quick dry top coat in the red bottle is much better than this one.</li>
            <li> This top coat really DID dry super fast, I was impressed! Dry to the touch within seconds and I went on about my day maybe 15 mins later and no dents or weird indications. The ONLY flaw is that I got chipping the next day, and the day after that two nails completely chipped off. It&#x27;s not just small chips, the polish comes off in one piece... its kinda weird. But since it dried super fast, I really don&#x27;t mind redoing the nail over.</li>
            <li> I received my order today and I used it a minute later and I&#x27;m loving it so far. It&#x27;s great!! Glad I purchased it got tired of all the other crap they claim works</li>
            <li> I always heard great reviews of this topcoat, and I was sorely disappointed when after just a day my polish would peel off very easily. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> It is magnificent, fine as on the Picture, corresponds to the Description, fast Delivery, high Quality of a product, I am completely satisfied with Purchase</li>
            <li> I bought this solely based on all the positive feedback. It sucks. My nail polish barely lasts a day. It last longer when I don&#x27;t use the top coat. It does dry very fast however.</li>
            <li> This is what they use in the nail salons! Smells very strong!!!! Goes on thick but smooth and clean crisp finish.</li>
            <li> this is the best top coat I have ever used. It is super shiny and dries in less than five minutes. I will never waste my time with another top coat. Love.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible but works great....dries in seconds.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I read so many great reviews, but, unfortunately, I was very disappointed. Yes, it does dry super fast, BUT it peels off the next day already! I put this coat as the very last finish on my gel nails just to give some extra shining. And nail polish on gel or acrylic nails always stay really long, just because the nail surface is artificial. But that was an unpleasant surprise with this nail coat. Maybe it works well on real nails only, but didn&#x27;t work on my gel nails.</li>
            <li> This is literally the only top coat I use anymore. I&#x27;m so in love with it! Dries insanely quick and does a really great job of sealing in the polish so it doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS TOP COAT . Keeeps nail polish looking great . I personally believe it is better the  gel doesnt damage nails . I do my nails atleast 2-3 times a week but with this top cost it is not nessiccary I just love to paint my nails lol</li>
            <li> I really like this, my only complaint is once you get close to the end of the bottle it&#x27;s hard to get out- I dont think the brush is quite long enough and it gets kind of thick and gooey at the end of the bottle. The first 1/2 works great and then it&#x27;s not as fabulous the 2nd half of the bottle. I will still use it because it&#x27;s the best top coat I have found, but if I found something better that wasn&#x27;t so thick and gooey at the end then I might try it</li>
            <li> THE best top coat I have ever used, hands down. It helps my polish last far longer and I feel like it makes my nails stronger too.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is the best top coat money can buy. The smell is a bit off putting like paint thinner, but what nail polish product doesn&#x27;t smell bad? I won&#x27;t ever buy another top coat again!</li>
            <li> This topcoat dries really, really quickly! It gives my polish a nice sheen, and it was a great value for how great the product is. Only downside is the strong smell, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> OMG BEST TOP COAT EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously this top coat dries so fast is just amazing and truly makes everything stand out!</li>
            <li> I am a poor college kid so I can&#x27;t afford to go out and get my nails done every 2 weeks, but I like my nails to be painted. I was about to drop $100+ on a gel nail kit when I came across this top coat. I&#x27;m so glad I bought it! A thin coat dries quickly (about 3 minutes) and has such a nice, shiny finish. Impressed!</li>
            <li> I love this top coat.  It dries so fast!  Better than the driers in salons or spray can driers.  I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> You will NOT find a better top coat that dries this fast. It&#x27;s the best. I do my nails, and I&#x27;m good to go 10 minutes later.</li>
            <li> Great product. Evens out every one of your nail art boo boos and dries super fast to a smooth shiny finish.</li>
            <li> Works great! Dries super fast. I will say that while it dries fast, it will take a few minutes to &#x27;cure&#x27; the nail polish if you have many layers on.</li>
            <li> My wife and I fight over this stuff! Before you get the wrong thoughts, she uses it as intended, on her nails. I use it for fly-tying, It&#x27;s superior hardness and clarity is not only perfect on her nails but ideal for my outdoors fishing needs. I&#x27;ve been through many fast drying clear coats and nothing seems to rival Seche Vite (&amp;#34;Say Veet&amp;#34;???). So if your husband/boyfriend/significant other is into fly fishing, hide it or your wont get it back!!! :-)</li>
            <li> Great top coat and super fast drying time</li>
            <li> Def gives good shine but i feel like it makes my nails chip more easily and the scent is just UGH.</li>
            <li> Great topcoat I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands then bought this after I read some reviews. Love it! Dries quickly, dries very shiny,&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smoothly without bubbles and you can use almost the whole&lt;br /&gt;Bottle before it starts to dry out</li>
            <li> I bought my first Seche top coat from my nail salon. I&#x27;m almost out so I went online and found this &amp;#34;deal&amp;#34;. Unfortunately, the quality is much lower. I don&#x27;t know if it is because they changed the composition or if this is a fake.</li>
            <li> This creates an ideal &#x27;pane of glass&#x27; finish on nails. Unfortunately, it also makes my polish peel within hours of doing my nails. It also smells toxic. I will try to find something better.</li>
            <li> This top coat is superb.  It never occurred to me before using it that a top coat was actually helpful in any way, just that sometimes it was suggested.  Now I use this every time I do my nails, no matter what techniques I use.  It applies smoothly and easily, dries super fast and the end result looks great.  I will never be without this product again.</li>
            <li> When I polish my nails, the polish typically lasts 1-2 days :(  Horrible!  I read the reviews on Seche top coat and how it can help with keeping your polish fresh.  Well i decided to try it and i have to say it has been working.  I polished my nails on a Sunday and by Wednesday they still looked nice.  Glad I took a chance!</li>
            <li> I have been using this fast dry nail topcoat for 20 years and it is the best! I have tried several others, only when the store ran out of Seche Vite and no other comes close to the beautiful gloss look you get with Seche Vita! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! It makes your nails so shiny and they will not chip for days. Put it on right after you finish your last coat of polish and then immediately put the second coat on after you finish the first.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little thicker than most polish so get a bead of it on the tip of the brush, dot it by the base of your nail and work it up. It is very easy to use this in 3 sweeps over the nail.&lt;br /&gt;It takes any manicure from diy to looking like you got them done.</li>
            <li> Ok, I know there are some bad reviews of this product because of the smell and the Toulene, but I have used other top coats and nothing compares to this. I have been using this top coat for about 6 months and have been in love with it ever since. I paint my nails a LOT (mainly because I get bored with what is on my nails and have to change it to keep things interesting!) and use only this when I want nice shiny glasslike nails. Some people say that you have to apply to wet nails, but I have always applied it to dry polish (mostly because I stamp my nails and they have to be dry for the stamp to not smudge the nails) and have never had any issues with it peeling or shrinking. I have a nail blog on FB and I recommend this to my followers. They love it as much as I. It dries super fast and the smell does go away. This top coat also helps with strengthening your nails. I recently took my acrylics off and my nails were tissue paper thin and the Seche Vite really helped to make my nails just a little bit stronger. All in all despite the bad smell, This is the only top coat I will ever use (except when I am using a matte top coat!).</li>
            <li> Only top coat I&#x27;ll use. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of others, but I&#x27;ve been using this one for &amp;#62;15 years now.  Best pricing is on Amazon.  And make sure you get the thinner, as this starts to thicken as it gets to the end of the bottle.  The thinner makes it good as new.</li>
            <li> So far so good. This gives me the best sparkle by far and dries super fast. I usually throw a coat on in my car before work and it dries in minutes. Will take advice on keeping a fresh bottle on hand. My nails are shiny, thick and strong. Fast shipping :-)</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders. Only issue is the consistency getting a little thick after being opened for longer than a month. Works like new after adding some nail polish thinner.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! Dries super shiney and super fast. I like to use it as a base coat and top coat. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Great product! Seals in my hard work for up to 2 weeks! Plus dries quickly and gives a high gloss shine! Won&#x27;t use anything else again!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my girlfriend and she could instantly tell it wasn&#x27;t the real stuff.  I never write reviews but if something is sold under the same name and you get a bogus imitation, people should know.</li>
            <li> The most amazing fast dry top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands and nothing has the fast dry time like this does.</li>
            <li> I found this product by googling &amp;#34;best top coat&amp;#34; - thank goodness for google!  I love this!  It makes your nails super shiny and gives them salon strength!  But the best part for me is that it dries your polish within minutes!  My nails take so long to dry and many times I have to redo my polish because they get messed up - this is going to fix that fast!  Polish dries within minutes!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Usually I always mess up my nails while waiting for them to dry. But this top coat is heavenly. It goes on nice, and dries super fast, leaving my nails perfectly smooth and glossy and awesome. My nails looks sooo much better with this top coat.</li>
            <li> The only fast dry top coat I use! Be warned it does have a very potent odor, but for chip free nails it is more than worth it! The formula is thick and it is meant to be that way and within minutes I have bumped my nails thinking they were ruined and nope, perfect. It bonds so well to my polish that when I finally start to nervous-pick at me nails the polish comes off completely in-tact. (I DO NOT recommend peeling off your nail polish) I stock up on Amazon.com so I will never run out!</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and leaves nails shiny.</li>
            <li> Dries much quicker than any other top coat I have ever used. After awhile of letting the layers of polish set, I won&#x27;t even get dents in my nails if I touch something (which always happens with other top coats).</li>
            <li> Dries fast, but peels excessively.</li>
            <li> This ish works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to get gel acrylics because I loved the look and feel, but this stuff makes my nails feel exactly the same! Super easy to use, makes nails look flawless, and totally worth the money. Never will I not use top coat every again!</li>
            <li> This is the Best dryer top coat. I will never change it. My pedicure lasts for more than 2 weeks in perfect shape.</li>
            <li> Why waist the time to paint your nails if you are not using a top coat?  This is the BEST I have found.  I use super cheap nail polish and just top my nails with this.  I can get about a week which is pretty good for finger nails.</li>
            <li> I had to throw the bottle away-it was not the real product. Did not dry fast--was tacky and made my polish bubble.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear nail polish. I do however have some parts of my nails that peel and peel and peel as they grow, and they never get better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put this on the peeling part of your nail and it will hold it in place until it grows out. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff really is amazing and dries my nails so fast! I&#x27;m can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to purchase this stuff. I now use it every time I paint my nails, which is weekly. I used to wait a whole hour for my nails to dry, but now I only wait 20 minutes (my nails are probably dry before that, but I like to play it safe!) I no longer have to worry about dents or marks in my nails, which makes me a happy girl. :)</li>
            <li> Super great product! It dries in just a couple of minutes and you can move on with your day. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Dries nails in 15 min or less. Even with multiple coats. I think the most I&#x27;ve tried was with 5 coats as I did glitter on top of a color base. Can go straight to bed after doing my nail and wake up with no fuzzies or lines. Great product. I use this with CND sticky base coat.</li>
            <li> Great top coat. It keeps my manicure strong longer. I work in food service and have my hands in water a lot. I get an extra week out of my manicures using this product.</li>
            <li> I like this top coat because it dries super fast,probably one of the fastest drying top coats . But it smells really strong and it gets goopy and thick after a while,so you have to buy the &amp;#34;restore“ to thin it out again which is kind of a pain. Overall the polish is good but I think Essie&#x27;s top coat is comparable and doesnt ssmell so much.</li>
            <li> I luv this top coat! I have tried many and this is by far one of the best. The polish provides a great shine and dries quickly. I use regularly.</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely fast. Love this product when there&#x27;s about a quarter remaining it hardens. Anywho I love how the finish is and no matter the nail polish from $1 to 30 it always looks beautiful. This is the holy grail of top coats.</li>
            <li> Works amazing, Smells HORRIBLE, like a diesel in a bottle. Chips more than I thought too but otherwise it dries really fast.</li>
            <li> Its like any other clear nail polish. A little disappointed because I could have went to the regular store to purchase this instead of waiting days to get it. Just got to walmart. Same price anyway and you don&#x27;t have to pay for shipping</li>
            <li> This is it. This is the only top coat you&#x27;ll ever want. This is the top coat you&#x27;ve been looking for, the magical make-it-stay-and-dry-it-fast dream polish people talk about. This. It. It.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I love painting my nails. I have small hands, tiny nails and an obsession with nail art. I also am constantly cooking, washing dishes, cleaning and stress picking at my nails, so I feel like up til now, no home-done manicure lasts more than three days. And if you put two hours into the effort of doing your nails, you kind of want your end results to last more than Monday to Wednesday, if you&#x27;re lucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer to a longer lasting manicure? Seche Vite -- and Gelous polish, but that&#x27;s another review for another time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a very strong, chemical scent. I rather like such smells, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me but if you&#x27;re sensitive use a well ventilated area to do your manicure. I find that once I&#x27;ve applied my colored polish, I can wait about a minute, then apply Seche Vite with an almost instantaneous drying, sealing effect. Cheaper polishes can run a little on the Seche Vite brush, so you may want to wait longer for that polish to set. Also wait a little longer for nail art designs like ombre nails, multilayer colors or additions like striping tape, shaped dough cut outs or stones. Five or so minutes should do it, then gently and quickly apply your Seche Vite. Another really loved effect of this polish is that it creates a solid, almost gel-like topcoat. My nails are nice and firm, very shiny and my manicure now lasts about a week. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a little thickening of the polish, and while I haven&#x27;t tried it yet I think a polish thinner could keep my bottle happy and usable for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely, absolutely buying this product again. And again. And again. Seche Vite -- I love you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-JR-</li>
            <li> This tends to make my nail polish chip/peel much faster than normal. If it&#x27;s not peeling off itself. It adds great shine and does in fact dry very fast, despite being extremely thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> It stands up to the name fast top nail top nail coat. I never sit still after painting nails so I know using this product really works.</li>
            <li> Its extremely toxic though it works. Best dupe is &#x27;out the door&#x27; and &#x27;Julie fast drying top coat&#x27; The julie i found at rite aid in NYC</li>
            <li> LOVE this top coat! dries very quick and is very durable. this wil be the only top coat i use!</li>
            <li> friends recommended this to me. it goes on very thick but does dry quickly. i&#x27;ll never buy another top coat again.</li>
            <li> This top coat does its job as an accelerator, but not nearly as well as Sally Hansen&#x27;s quick drying top coat. It also tends to dry only the top layer, often crumpling the under-layers of polish. The other major problem I have with it is that it tends to pull the underlying polish away from the nail edges, which significantly cheapens the overall look of the manicure. I&#x27;ve used it several times and will not be using it going forward.</li>
            <li> BUY THIS PRODUCT! I&#x27;ve never been so passionate about a top coat in my life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My manicures used to be god awful, after a base coat and two coats of polish it was already too thick. It would start to bubble and take ages to dry, the finished result would look like a 5 year old did my nails :[&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got Seche Vite because it has rave reviews and I thought maybe it would help and WOW DID IT! It creates a beautiful, perfect and shiny top coat, but it also dries the coats underneath super fast! It will dry it in 5 minutes, after that you can bump them without having to start over. It takes a little longer to dry completely, so if you smash them too hard your polish will move, but since the top coat is completely dry you can generally push the polish back/reshape a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t get over this, it&#x27;s amazing. My only complaint is that I tear through bottles TOO fast :]</li>
            <li> Definitely a huge time saver and makes nail polish extra shiny. There is a reason it&#x27;s a cult favorite. Love! Will recommend and repurchase!</li>
            <li> It can get think and you need to use some thinner. One coat does the trick after 2-3 mins I can move on with my life.  just beware of the feet.  If you put on shoes to quickly your entire pedi turns into a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nail polish last for 2 weeks!!! But I also use chima glaze strong adhesion base coat to help nail polish adhere. After a week or every 3 days apply another top coat the keep the polish from chipping and scratches. When I use red colors it does not stain my nails. I do not like the chima glaze top dry (nail dryer) coat. To dry (fast nail dryer) my nails I use Seche Vite . It dries quicker and harder; no lines or sheet marks. Both nail dryers have a tiny bit of shrinkage, Seche Vite has less</li>
            <li> Best topcoat I have ever used. Dries quickly, provides a glossy finish, AND helps polish last longer. I have been able to stretch manicures for almost a week whereas before they would only last for a day or two.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was so disappointed as a few hours later the entire nail just peeled off like a sticker; my base,2x color &amp; the top coat. I was going to just return but decided to give it another try.&lt;br /&gt;I wiped my fingernails after the nail polish color dried with some alcohol. My nails get oily idk why. The alcohol helps take away the oiliness &amp; then I used the top coat again &amp; voila it worked!! Nails &amp; Toes it stayed on for over a week which is unheard of for me!! I&#x27;m also very hard on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;Just did my nails again 3 days ago &amp; still no chips, shiny &amp; looking good :D</li>
            <li> LOVE this top coat! Dries in minutes and adds a gel like shine to your nails. Its really great for the price and a really excellent product. No other top coats will do now that I have had seche vite.</li>
            <li> Only top coat to use!!  Makes polish dry really quickly and very high gloss shine.  Have used others but nothing last as long as this one.</li>
            <li> I have used out the door top coat for years. I wanted to try something new, so this was the first one. I must say, I was impressed. It dries even faster than out the door, and it leaves a pretty hard coating with a lot of shine. I will probably reorder this stuff again.</li>
            <li> I can appreciate a good nail polish and this top coat is really awesome. It dry&#x27;s fairly quickly and I love that it makes any color application I have on lasts for several days.</li>
            <li> 5 coats of polish dried with 2 minutes, no joke! I love love love this stuff! I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Professional grade top coat.  Super fast dry, very shiny.</li>
            <li> I recommend to everybody. I never used to paint my nails because I wash dishes and and use my hands a lot. My manicures would last a day at most. I heard of this top coat from a lot of nail art gurus and figured for the price it sounded reasonable. Well no, it&#x27;s not reasonable because the product is so wonderful that I would pay 3x the amount I paid. It truly is a great buy. :) Now my manicures can even last over a week, dries my manicures fast, intensifies the color, smooths the surface, protects from chipping and shines so radiantly! I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product. I will repurchase in the future. Oh, also you must get the restore polish thinner by seche vite because halfway through the bottle it will get gloopy. That&#x27;s the only downside. But I can live with it because it&#x27;s still a 5 star product and we all know perfection is impossible and seche vite came pretty darn close. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and it&#x27;s the absolute best product for quick drying top coat over polish.  This seller is amazing, as normally it would be $13/bottle, and I get them for less then $3/bottle!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  This is my second bottle.  Keeps polish on nails looking fresh and glowing for a good two weeks or more.  Recomend it to every one that wants carefree nails.</li>
            <li> This actually does make your nail polish dry quickly, through all the layers!  It&#x27;s a really fantastic addition to any lacquerista&#x27;s collection!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to purchase this at first but I was sold on the reviews. Do it! I was a slave to the OPI base and top coats for years. Despite the fact the OPI top coats created little bubbles on my nails. This top coat is incredible! My nails are smooth and shiny with no bubbles. Plus it dries a lot faster than the OPI brand.</li>
            <li> I have bought this over and over because it works so well. It dries quickly and leaves a silky smooth finish over the nail.  Everyone always asks me if I have gel nail polish on because of the look.  Please be advised that this is a top coat, so if you still wear cheap nail polish underneath, it may still chip.  I wear Essie under mine and it lasts for days.</li>
            <li> The coat starts peeling iff on its own after a day or two of application. Not happy</li>
            <li> this is the only top coat I ever get. it&#x27;s the best!  it dries super fast and my nail polish lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Make a bigger bottle and a wider brush and there wouldn&#x27;t be enough stars on amazon for this product! It makes my cheapy polishes last forever. Greatness.</li>
            <li> I bought random topcoats in store whenever I needed them but never bothered to actually look at reviews for things online. Glad I ordered this! It smells really strong but is an amazing top coat. It dries in a minute and is forgiving if you accidentally touch it while it fully hardens. Leaves a shiny wonderful coat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best, hands down. The shine is incredible - almost as good as gel - and speeds up the drying process like nothing else.</li>
            <li> The quality of Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Nail Coat has gone down over the last few years. It chips more and more. I love how quickly it dries, but when you have to redo a nail every day, it kind of loses the value.</li>
            <li> There are a number of times I have used this top coat, with various brands of nail polish. I can&#x27;t say I am super impressed with this top coat. I really wanted to love it, but too often it has peeled or chipped off my nails in just an hour.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to nail art and this top coat is serious business.  It is completely indispensible to the process.  It brings out the colors and designs and it doesn&#x27;t just make my nails shine, it makes them gleam like the top of the Chrysler building, and seals everything.  It also dries really fast.  Absolutely the best top coat on the market.</li>
            <li> Well, I had heard a lot about Seche Vite and was a little skeptical. While it will take several days more before I can comment on Chip resistance, let me just say that this is much shinier than any other fast drying top coat I have tried, and the equal of some high gloss coats. My other fast drying top coats have now been demoted to doing pedicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited two years later: Well, the honeymoon period is over, and I&#x27;ve moved on to other top coats, most notably HK Girl Glisten&amp;Glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seche has a couple of problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thickening - By the time your bottle is half empty, the polish will have thickened to the point where it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly and evenly. To thin it, however, you will need to buy Seche Vite thinner, others may cause the polish to fog up and no longer be opaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shrinking - Shrinking can be a random problem. You&#x27;ll know a polish has shrunk when the edges have a ridge-like appearance instead of blending down smoothly to that thin line of visible nail next to the cuticle. Which leads to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t work well over dry polish - While Seche shrinks randomly over damp polish, it almost ALWAYS shrinks over dry polish. It smears nail art. Pulls decals up. And for those who like to keep their nails fresh by adding a top coat every two days or so, not working over dry polish is a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> As a mom to two little ones, I need polish to cure quickly (actually harden, not just surface dry!!!) or I can do it at all- there&#x27;s just no time! This is the only product that works! The only draw back is that after a few days the polish will peel away from the nails. I just deal with it- there&#x27;s no alternative!</li>
            <li> It gets goopy halfway through and becomes useless. I wish that wasn&#x27;t the case because I really liked it at the beginning!</li>
            <li> Dies really fast and a good shine.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of seeing it used on nail art videos so many times on YouTube, and it lives up to the hype! It goes on thick and somehow seems to seal all of the colors together, making what would have been raised dots and lines on my nails because of varying thicknesses of layers of nail polish, etc., disappear into each other. It adds such gloss and shine, it looks great!</li>
            <li> If you are in a hurry  this is the top coat for you!!!!  It dries to a really glossy coat in no time at all</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product ! This is my 2nd purchase of this bottle &amp; i havent even finished my first bottle yet. It leaves a high gloss shine finish on your manicure and dries super quick ! When i use it with a Sinful Colors or China Glaze polish it dries in like 5 minutes ! This is the best top coat in the game right now and i really dont see myself going back to any other top coat ive used. LOVE this !</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought this top coat after seeing it reviewed elsewhere. I always check out ptoduct on Amazon because customer reviews are always important to me. It got rave reviews so I went ahead and bought it. It arrived the other day and so far so good. I have been using Duri Rejuvacote and my nails are better than they have ever been but I wanted something to increase their shine after a few days and this product is doing a very good job.</li>
            <li> Makes my nails look really nice and has lasted two years.</li>
            <li> This makes home manicures so easy. This really is the best top coat - it goes on nice, dries fast and protects!</li>
            <li> This top coat works wonderfully. It drys fast and helps protect and seal my polish. The only downside I could see is that it has a very strong chemical odor. I would not suggest using it in a closed space ( like your bathroom ) because of the possible fumes, but the smell goes away once dry, and this does dry very fast. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever. Dries fast. Lasts long. Incredible shine. Very thick, so it&#x27;s like a layer of protection for your nails. Ugh I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this top coat a couple weeks ago from my local Sally&#x27;s on sale. I was going to order it but read bad reviews and it made me nervous to pay 8 or 9 dollars for it when I know my OPI regular top coat is a good one. But I found this on sale at Sally&#x27;s for like $4 and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not be any happier with this product. It dries super fast and that is awesome for me because I have very little patience. I always end up putting away all my manicure supplies after waiting about a minute instead of waiting for my nails to dry and ALWAYS end up smearing my nail polish and putting dents in it. But this stuff dries so fast I don&#x27;t have to worry about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not 100% dry in seconds though. You still have to wait before putting away laundry or things that would typically damage partially dry nails. The top is dry but the stuff underneath is not. So its easy to put ripples in your nails from the polish sliding if you run it over something. I typically do my nails about 20 mins or so before going to bed and the top coat is dry enough that it causes no problems and the bottom stuff is dry by morning so my manicure is fully set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also read a lot of complaints about it chipping super easy. I have not noticed chipping any more than with a typical top coat. My nails peel pretty bad though and I still have that issue but I found out recently OPI makes a Nail Envy base coat specifically to fix that so I&#x27;ll probably try that with my Seche Vite and I&#x27;m sure that will help.</li>
            <li> This top coat is amazing! I love how fast it dries and leaves an acrylic nail finish and feel.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I found that is the top coat seems to wear off quicker than I&#x27;d like which makes my nails look dull, but other than that, I highly reccommend this!</li>
            <li> It does the job. It keeps  your polish in place and looking quite good for a lasting amount of time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this top coat!!!! Ive only used this stuff for the past year. I quit getting mani&#x27;s and now do them myself with the help of this awesome find!! it doesn&#x27;t chip for days and it keeps my nails VERY shiny!!</li>
            <li> Maybe I am doing something wrong, but when I use just my polishes (I am a China Glaze fan, but alo have some others), the color lasts longer than when I put this product over them. I thought it was a fluke, but it happens every time. I am definitely open to suggestion because the good reviews led me to purchase this top coat and the SHINE IS FANTASTIC ......but once it hardens the polish will just come off like a nail strip ....which would be cool if I was ready for it to come off ....but in a day? Uh-uh!!</li>
            <li> I am nail polish obsessed and have at least 5 different top coats, this one is without a doubt the best I have ever used. My nails don&#x27;t chip anymore!</li>
            <li> I love this Top Coat. It dries polish almost instantly and adds a gorgeous shine. Its the only one I will use.</li>
            <li> This has cut down my nail painting and drying time from over an hour to about 20 minutes. I used to use one of OPI&#x27;s top coats and this stuff makes OPI&#x27;s seem awful.&lt;br /&gt;It dries very quickly and even works well with 2 or 3  damp color layers beneath it. It sets very firmly. I haven&#x27;t had and dents or smudges since I&#x27;ve started using it.&lt;br /&gt;It also dries with a very good gloss, certainly much more glossy than the OPI top coat I was using previously.&lt;br /&gt;It does get a little bit gloopy with age, but not to the point that it&#x27;s difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> My nails never looked better.  Top coat dried super fast and my nail polish lasted through the crazy New Years holiday weekend.  That is a feat unto itself.  Also gives nail salon shine after applied.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I have ever used!!! This far exceeds my expectations!  Not only does it dry within minutes it remains super shiny. I bought the Poshe brand top coat at the same time as Seche Vite and Seche is by far my favorite out off of the two.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how well it works to dry nail enamel applied. I will make it last. Price excellent</li>
            <li> Makes your nails dry quickly which it was i bought it for.  Not sure if my nail polish lasted any longer</li>
            <li> Very glossy clear coat/top coat! Looks like I just visited the nail salon. Highly recommend! One coat and you are ready to go!</li>
            <li> This stuff is just as fabulous as everyone says it is! I will definitely be purchasing more when this one runs out!</li>
            <li> Miracle in a bottle!!! All this while I was investing $ on nail dryer systems when this was all I needed. I was able to get a price match at a target store so thanks Amazon. This top coat even worked better than all the fake nail dryer systems I purchased. I am never going to waste $ on professional manicures again.</li>
            <li> Its amazing. My nails definitely dry faster with this topcoat.  The smell is a little bit strong though so beware of that, however once it dries it doesn&#x27;t smell. It is a thick topcoat so it does the job of protecting your nails.</li>
            <li> It is sure quick dry top coat. I can&#x27;t believe it. That is the faster dry top coat I even use. Love it. Love it. I will continue buy this for sure. It dry for couple mins.</li>
            <li> This dries literally in seconds, and is great when you&#x27;re in a hurry or just impatient. It doesn&#x27;t smell like nail polish though, the scent is a little strong.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I have ever used and am never going back. It dries quick and makes your nails look professionally done. Big fan</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever! Cuts drying time and leaves nail polish looking great!</li>
            <li> Dries quick and makes me polish last!</li>
            <li> Fastest top coat I have ever tried.  Literally dry one minute after application even with several coats underneath.  My new favorite.</li>
            <li> I bought this top coat because of the outstanding reviews. I bought it to use as a top coat for manicures and pedicures so they would last longer. My manicure lasted half as long as it would have if i hadn&#x27;t used it. It began peeling off in a day or two. I tried it by itself on my finger nails and the tops of my nails were exposed in less then a day. This is one of the worst top coats I&#x27;ve ever used. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Easily the best top coat. Nothing compares. Just make sure to follow directions, it is meant to be put on top of wet polish.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. It is not compatible at all. Not worth of money buying it. I discarded it after 2nd use.</li>
            <li> Terrible product, Revlon topcoat is so much better.  Polish peels off after one day in big pieces.  Buy Revlon instead!</li>
            <li> This really works well....I love it. It&#x27;s my new favorite</li>
            <li> This product works great the one reason I  deducted two stars is when you read the Back of the bottle it warns you that it may cause birth defects; please be advised.</li>
            <li> Best top coat I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> So much cheaper to buy it on amazon and shipping is fast too! This is the best top coat ever! I&#x27;m already on my second bottle and will definitely keep repurchasing this. It&#x27;s almost like gel nails. Your nail polish will last up to a week without chipping at all. It also dries pretty fast. It does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do. Just follow the instruction, one coat of it is enough.</li>
            <li> Whenever I use it, the nail polosh comes off the same day or the next day. I don&#x27;t even to use nail polish remover, I can just peel it off completely without any effort. I thought this was a great product reading the reviews :(</li>
            <li> Great product better than shellac</li>
            <li> So, I decided to try this because a friend said she loved it and then I read good reviews on it. Well, it did go on as I was told it would. It&#x27;s also true that it does well about not chipping. Unfortunately, I keep having an issue with my polish peeling off. Whole sections of my polish just either fall off or peel right off. I tried to follow the directions correctly. I am not sure if I am doing something wrong, but that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening to me. I haven&#x27;t even been able to get my polish to stay on a whole day. Yes, I also prepped my nails correctly. It has seemed very strange. Also, this product has a really strong smell!</li>
            <li> I will never use any other topcoat again! THE BEST EVER. It makes your manicure look professional and super shiny. And it stays super shiny for weeks! I&#x27;m going on two weeks now and my nail Polish is barely chipping. It&#x27;s amazing, seriously the best.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve repurchased this product about 6 times in the past few year and I was very excited to find it online for much cheaper than the usual $10 or so they sell it for in the store. It dries your nail polish SO QUICKLY and it gives it a nice shine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different top coats. I&#x27;ve tried Sally Hansen, Essie, and CND.  The one issue I always have with every top coat is they have some shrinkage.  The first day is fine, but by the third day the polish has seem to shrunk back from the tip.  This one started out fantastic!  No issues, dried fast, shiny, and lasting.  However as I have continued to use it that shrinkage problem has popped up on this brand as well.  This may be from the age of the bottle or the colored polish.  I still think it&#x27;s a great product and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Omg I have found what I&#x27;ve been looking for forever! I have literally around 100 bottles of polish and no sprae time with 3 kids to dry my nails but that ends today since I received this in the mail! It dried within minutes after I applied 2 coats of polish! I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!</li>
            <li> This stuff does what it says--dries nail polish fast.  It has a very strong smell, which I took a star off for, but that&#x27;s to be expected with nail stuff, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat, it&#x27;s been around forever but I love it.  Keeps my mani&#x27;s shiny for 3-4 days, then I apply a new coat and I&#x27;m good with reg. polish for a week.</li>
            <li> This top coat does dry very quickly even when I apply multiple coats in a short time span.  Also, it is super shiny!!</li>
            <li> I have crazy-strong, fast growing nails. I used this twice and the top layer of my nails peeled off! Something that noxious is NOT safe to use.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I have ever used. I&#x27;ve gone threw so many brands looking for something that not only drys quick but last. I don&#x27;t seem to have a shrink problem like most do with this glitter. Lucky me lol.</li>
            <li> I upped my review to 5 stars. Run, don&#x27;t walk, to order this if you&#x27;re in the market for a brilliant fast drying shiny top coat.  I&#x27;ve now tried it while waiting to receive my order.  By the way, I payed twice the price at WalMart.  That&#x27;s right!  And I&#x27;ve tried several Dollar Tree stores.  I \\&quot;heard\\&quot; it could be purchased there.  Apparently not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally wrote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff gets raves on beauty forums.  The down side is you can get it at the Dollar Tree for a buck.  I&#x27;m willing to pay more to try it for the first time.  The stars are for price alone.  I&#x27;ll upgrade and review thoroughly if it indeed works as claimed by several beauty gurus. (:</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple brands ones but can&#x27;t believe this cheaper one on Amazon would make all the difference of doing manicure at home at night!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply a thick layer on top of my nail polish and  it dries so fast!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I never realized how important it was to have a great top coat. Not only is it solid and fast drying, it never yellows. So much cheaper than in the stores too. So glad I purchased this brand!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten more and more into doing my nails at home, and have tried a dozen different top coats. This one is by FAR the best I&#x27;ve used- dries quickly and with a nice shine. If you haven&#x27;t used it before, try it- you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> so convenient, dries nail polish quick. no clumbs or pumps. i&#x27;ll recommend this product to anyone whos interested especially people that do nails.</li>
            <li> I tough the comment could&#x27;t be true, but they are. This nail coat really dries very fast, 5 minutes and I am ready to go, doesn&#x27;t peel. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Fastest drying top coat I&#x27;ve found so far. I was able to do my nails and be up and running about in under five minutes. I wish I&#x27;d found this sooner. It goes on nice and glossy, tacking within a minute of application and drying in the next few minutes afterwards. You do have to work quickly with it, but I found that it wasn&#x27;t too hard to use.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product! (arrived packed in air bubble packing too, so no shipping issues).</li>
            <li> Terrible, corners shrink.</li>
            <li> Great product! A coworker recommended it to me. She said she loved it because it made a so-so DIY manicure look put together and gave a nice lasting gel effect to nails. She was right!</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with its staying power. Did my manicures correctly, and this still managed to peel off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care about the smell (which others have complained about). My nails are dry to the touch within 60 seconds with this polish. I&#x27;ve been asked if I have gel nails and my reply of course is No. This polish gives the appearance of gel nails because it&#x27;s thick and provides the best shine you&#x27;ve ever seen for a top coat. It&#x27;s a must have for all of my manicures.</li>
            <li> I experienced &amp;#34;shrinkage&amp;#34; with this top coat. I&#x27;ll stick to my Essie Good To Go.</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional product!  Over the years I have searched for a product that would make my manicure last longer, and I have found it!  I can go about 2 weeks without redoing my manicure.  Seche Vite makes a coating that helps my polish not chip.  Can&#x27;t ask for better than that!</li>
            <li> Definitely the best top coat I have ever used.  It dries extremely quick allowing me to get on with the functions of my day.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Great top coat, just gets super gloopy after a few months and you have to replace. Plus there&#x27;s the whole controversy about the ingredients possibly causing birth defects...</li>
            <li> This top coat is amazing and I never want to use anything else. I love it.</li>
            <li> Starts to thicken halfway through</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!!!  Adds fantastic shine and truly does dry quickly, never used a polish that really dries the way this does.  I will never use anything else for a top coat!!!!!</li>
            <li> My co-worker recommended this top coat to me and I have to say it lives up to the hype. I type all day at work and usually my nails chip within 2 days of me painting them, but with this product they lasted 4-5 without chipping. Best topcoat I&#x27;ve tried and I have tried a lot!</li>
            <li> works great but label says it has ingredients that are illegal in California which harms reproductive system wtf&amp;#62;?!!</li>
            <li> Works well enough, but it smells so toxic - like turpentine. If that doesn&#x27;t scream hazardous, not sure what else would.</li>
            <li> the smell of it is awful !!</li>
            <li> I use this product every time I change my nail polish.  It works!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard alot of good things about this top coat but unfortunately it did nothing special for me and has a VERY strong smell. It did make my nails shiny but they still chipped within a day and without much activity.</li>
            <li> Peels off after normal wear in one day. Ugh...</li>
            <li> I have been polishing my nails (and actually caring how it looks) for a few months now and I tried a couple other top coats but each time I used it my nails would end up with a smudge or the whole thing would come off. This would be really upsetting especially if you are trying really hard to make it look nice. With Seche Vite my nails dry fast and can stay chip free far longer than the previous two tops coats I have used.</li>
            <li> The best part of a salon manicure/pedicure (aside from the massage) is the hi gloss topcoat. I&#x27;ve tried many topcoats and this one is worthy of its high ratings!</li>
            <li> Always does the job when you need your polish to dry quick. High gloss, great addition to that home and salon mani/pedi.</li>
            <li> Expected much more from this, but it was ok...</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever tried! It dries immeaditly! No bubbles or smudges at all! Price is good and it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not kidding when they say &amp;#34;Fast Dry&amp;#34;. Not only does it dry in no time,it also keeps my mani in great shape for two weeks or more!! Love this product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I was also impressed by how fast my order got to me..3 days!</li>
            <li> How can one rave about a nail polish top coat?  Well if there was one out there that makes any polish dry fast and last a long time, I had been yet to find it.  Until now.  Seche Vite is amazing.  It does what it promises.  I&#x27;ve tried everything in the past.  I was reduced to wearing clear or light polish on my fingernails so those annoying chips and dings would be less noticeable until I had time to do a proper manicure or at least slap some polish on the tips.  And how irritating is it to do your polish and have to wait that long, long time for it to dry and you think it&#x27;s dry and go to grab something and ugh...there&#x27;s the ding.  After one use of Seche Vite I was hooked.  Polish dry in minutes.  Rock hard dry.  And chips?  Not a one in five days.  I did the supreme test.  Essie&#x27;s Velvet Voyeur.  Perfectly perfect after five full days.</li>
            <li> Dr prescribed for splitting nail, works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I am not a nail product expert but I am currently going through a \\&quot;I wanna do my nails\\&quot; phase.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my nails look pretty and they aren&#x27;t kidding when they say it dries fast!&lt;br /&gt;I would rate it 5 stars but it peels now like I said before I am NOT a nail product expert so idk if that is normal.</li>
            <li> This product is great. it try faster then i thought. would buy some more for friends and myself !!!love it.</li>
            <li> I love seche top coat. You can use this with different nail color. I would use the base coat seche. This will go on smooth and no bubbles.  It dries so fast. You won&#x27;t believe it.  It Wii last almost 2weeks. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. I love it. The price is a good price. It costs less then nail color. Try it you will love it. Louise</li>
            <li> This stuff is my go-to top coat it is so shiny! Honestly I have not really seen a difference in my nail polish not chipping when I use this top coat vs other top coats, but I am committed to it because it&#x27;s so shiny!!!</li>
            <li> The one and only dry coat!  Dries quickly and crystal clear.</li>
            <li> Keep bad, one will out</li>
            <li> Seche Vite will change your nail life.</li>
            <li> I have used other top coats for my pedicures but this one is the best. It is very glossy, dries quickly, and lasts and lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li> I usually do my nails at home and bough Seche Vite to make my manicure last longer and all I can say is that it&#x27;s the same quality as any other top coat you can buy at any drugstore. It doesn&#x27;t make my manicure last any longer or make my nails shine any brighter, so it&#x27;s really just an average top coat and I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again, not worth the money for the quality.</li>
            <li> You can actually believe the name of this product, &amp;#34;Dry Fast.&amp;#34;  That, it did...no smudges, which is rare when I paint my own nails!</li>
            <li> BEST top coat ever. I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this. Dries very very fast. I hated doing my nails before this, cause I always messed them up, had no patience for it to dry. This makes multiple coats of polish dry super fast! And gives a brilliant shine. I would also recommend Seche Restore - great for bringing old polishes back to life.</li>
            <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails - which has been for over 20 years - my biggest problem was with top coats.  I usually skipped it because the brush would drag through the still-wet color polish, making it look uneven or it didn&#x27;t dry fast enough so that I&#x27;d wake up with imprints of my bedsheet on them.  I have never been able to get that glossy top coat look until now.  This product is amazing.  Not only does it dry very fast, it dries the polish layers underneath, making my nails ready to go in minutes.  This really does work!  The top coat comes out beautifully shiny and doesn&#x27;t drag through the color underneath.  I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else now.  I also bought the Seche thinner which has breathed life into my older gloppy polishes.</li>
            <li> I like how it gives your nail a super shine but if it peels off after you either wash dishes or do house chores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand before and loved it, but purchasing it from this seller, I don&#x27;t think this is the real product, or I just got a really bad batch. My polish chips off within 24 hours when I use this topcoat. With any other topcoat, my nails will at least last a few days, and my toes will last 3-4 weeks without any chips, but with this topcoat, it is chipped within a day. I would buy this from a different seller if I were you.</li>
            <li> I bought this top coat after seeing that a lot of nail art people on youtube recommend it. I have to say, i&#x27;m extremely glad i bought it! This top coat is amazingggg!!! It leaves my nail super shiny and smooth, it&#x27;s so smooth i cant stop running my fingers over my nails!! It also dries for the most part in like a minute, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about ruining your hard worked nail design. It completely dries in around 2-3 minutes, and after that you&#x27;re good to do whatever you want without having to worry about your nails getting ruined. The top coat also makes my manicures last at LEASTT a week. I used to try out all those cool nail art designs on youtube, taking my time, perfecting every nail, and then finishing it off with a cheap top coat. I honestly didn&#x27;t think that a top coat would make a world of a difference on my nails, but it really does. While a cheap top coat leaves your nails shiny, it doesn&#x27;t last very long, and your nails usually start chipping within two days. This top coat makes my nails last well throughout the week, and only when i cook and clean extensively do the nails chip slightly. The only thing that kept me from giving this top coat a 5 star rating is the fact that no matter how much i try after 3 or so days the top coat seems to have shrunk on my nail, leaving the edges of my nail polish exposed without top coat while the rest of the nail still has top coat. This makes my nails start to chip within a few hours. Other than this small con, i think this top coat is great for anyone looking to extend their manicure life and make their nails look professionally done, even when it wasnt.</li>
            <li> This top coat makes any nail polish on the nails look fabulous! It really makes my nails look like I got it done at a salon. It&#x27;s been 3 days since I painted my nails using this top coat and so far, it has barely chipped. I&#x27;m loving this product so far!</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical but this product is the best top coat I have ever used.  I like to layer my nails to get a shading look from dark to light and this requires about 4 coats of paint.  I put this top coat on and my nails are literally dry in one minute!  I still am amazed each time I use it.  For those that are always on the go and don&#x27;t have time to waste, this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> great top coat, long lasting and great shine. i do it from home and it looks like a salon mani/pedi</li>
            <li> I love this top coat. I&#x27;ve been using Julep&#x27;s top coat and I got their new Oxygen top coat and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m even going to use it. This stuff is AWESOME. I do a lot of nail art and use stamps or just free hand some stuff and I have to wait a while for it to dry completely because if I do it too soon it will smear. I put this top coat on immediately after and it doesn&#x27;t smear! I also used it in between layers of polishes, like when I do a half moon mani and I use a sticker on my nails I have to wait a while for it to dry or else the sticker will peel my polish off. So i put my polish on put this amazing top coat on and I was able to use the sticker to finish the design in like 5min. and I probably didn&#x27;t even need to wait that long but I was paranoid lol plus all the girls who do youtube videos for manicures use this top coat so I figured I needed to at least try it once. So happy I did! I will use this forever! and I bought the Seche Vite restore too because I heard at about half bottle usage it starts to get thick and sticky and you just put the seche restore in it and it&#x27;s brand new again. Hope you guys like it as much as I do :) Get ready for mani Monday!</li>
            <li> Where has this been all my life??  Best buy in a long time.  A manicure must-have for sure!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this top coat now for about 2 months and absolutely LOVE it.  It makes nail polish dry much faster than without it and it gives a nice, long-lasting finish to a manicure.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This top coat is fabulous. Dries quickly with one application, within 15 minutes, I could being doing normal things and not have to be worried about smudging. I went to bed 2 hours later, and NO CREASES from the sheets! I was very pleased. It would have 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the SMELL. It smells like undiluted wood varnish. Beware! Use in a well-ventilated room!!</li>
            <li> I can not believe how fast this dries.  My nails are dry before I finish painting my other hand. It is magic!!</li>
            <li> Love that I can paint my nails. Then use this top coat and be all set to go a few minutes later.</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever!  I normally can&#x27;t go for even a day without my manicure chipping.  Between washing dishes, swimming, typing, etc. it&#x27;s usually a disaster.  With this, my manicures are shiny and chip-free for a week or more.  I will stick with Seche Vite from now on!</li>
            <li> I have literally gone through 10 bottles of this stuff so I figured it was time to write a review. Simply the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. It dries incredibly fast which is great for me because I&#x27;m not always the most patient person when it comes for waiting for nails to dry... But not only that, it&#x27;s soooo shiny! It makes any polish look professional and high gloss. Yes, like others I have noticed that it isn&#x27;t necessarily the strongest top coat. I am hard on my nails so they do chip occasionally, and with this top coat, it does peel off in bigger pieces... But it dries so fast that you could repaint the nail before you would even have a chance to complain! Needless to say, I will continue buying Seche Vite as long as my nail hobby continues.</li>
            <li> This product is great. It makes my nail polish extra shiny and provides a thick coat so it stays on a lot longer. My nails don&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW! I tried the Sally Hansen quick dry top coat before and tried to do things 15 minutes afterwards and my nail polish would smudge, and the nail polish would chip within a day or two. This product, you brush it on after two or three coats of color polish and you are able to go on with your day 5 minutes after without smudging! I use it with the Seche base ridge filler coat and it lasts a week at least!</li>
            <li> I love this. It arrived a week before it was suppose to. The smell isn&#x27;t over whelming either. It dries super fast. I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> No matter how hot and humid it is outside after one application of Seche Vite I only need to sit for one drying cycle at the salon and then I am off on my way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple brands of top coats to try and achieve that glossy, long lasting finish you get with a professional manicure and this is the only one that is comparable.</li>
            <li> THEE best &amp; fastest top coat out there! I absolutely love this top coat &amp; would never use a different one. The price is awesome, too, because it&#x27;s $9.99+ at my area drug stores.</li>
            <li> For me this product shipped very fast, faster than it said it would. I love seche vite and always have, it dries so fast, leaves your nails so shiny and hard, and its amazing. Ive gone through several bottles the only downside is that once you get near the end it gets gloopy and un-useable so i suggest buying seche restore with it.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for painting impatient kids nails:) I find myself saying yes to nail painting more often bc it doesn&#x27;t take forever for them to dry. It also helps tremendously w keeping nail polish on. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This top coat really does dry your nails in almost a minute! It also makes my polish last for a couple weeks with no chips!</li>
            <li> Not only did this top coat dry my nails in under 5 minutes, but it also is the shiniest top coat I&#x27;ve ever used! Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt this is the best ever quick dry top coat I have ever used.  Expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> The best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used! Look no further! Finishes off your polish nicely - shiny and smooth. Perfect over polish containing lots of glitter.</li>
            <li> How does this top coat have so many great reviews? It peels the next day! It&#x27;s literally the worst top coat ever and it smells awful! I will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> This stuff has been around for a looonnggg time. I always loved it and always will. Great stuff for a great price!</li>
            <li> I am one of those absent-minded people who always end up with smudged nails after a manicure, because I just can&#x27;t sit still long enough for my nails to dry. This is an absolute game-changer though! I just got this, and decided to do a bright neon mani for the summer. Anyone who uses neons knows that they can require a few coats to get a uniform color, which is a pain to let dry. With this on top, it was dry in like..five minutes, tops! Seriously, I was off to cook dinner within moments of having finished my nails, and they were still as sleek and smooth as all get out when I set dinner on the table. Even now, I can&#x27;t stop staring at them. I&#x27;ve never created such a great manicure with any other topcoat, in such a short time. I especially recommend using it with the Seche Ridge Filling Base Coat for glass-like smoothness and shine. I am now in love with this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for long time&lt;br /&gt;Very happy and satisfied with this product&lt;br /&gt;Great product highly recommend to everyone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its cheaper to find in a CVS store, but most CVSs dont have it</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle.  I love this top coat!  It lets my polish set and dry so fast and make it last longer.  I get so much compliments for my nails and I know it&#x27;s because of this top coat and makes my nails looked like they were professionally done at the salon.  Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I like that this top coat dries very quickly, but I wish it was stronger to keep polish from chipping better.</li>
            <li> this is the best top coat I have ever tried.  it makes my nails look like salon finish and dries super fast!  I have gotten many compliments on my nails.  The girls at work think I got them profesisonally done!  I will continue to purchase the product.</li>
            <li> This continues to be one of my favorite nail products. The shine that comes from applying to freshly painted nails cannot honestly be matched by other products.</li>
            <li> obsessed with this top coat!!!  It dries quickly and offers a high-shine finish and extends the life of my manicure!  I can paint my nails before bed, wait a few minutes, go to bed, and my manicure is still perfect when I wake up</li>
            <li> The brush is bent and the box that came in it, was opened and ripped. It didn&#x27;t look very pleasant for me to use it. When I tested it out, the  brush was bent and the brush looked like it was cheep. The smell is so bad! Overall, the topcoat did dry fast.</li>
            <li> The product is great. Your nails dry in no time. I can now do my nails before I go to bed and not have to worry about waking up with the bedspread print on my nails. If you buy one product for your nails it should be Seche Vite. Great Stuff!!!</li>
            <li> One of the best top coats out there. Takes less than five minutes for nails to be completely dry and chore ready. Goes on even. Only slight downfall is it has a strong odor until it dries.</li>
            <li> Only used a few times, but this works great.  It does have a strong solvent odor, but it&#x27;s worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breakneck fast drying. Wow. Great for when your last coat hasn&#x27;t dried yet and you need your hands back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells toxic.&lt;br /&gt;Causes nail polish to yellow noticeably.&lt;br /&gt;Shrinks nail polish back from the tips of your nails.&lt;br /&gt;Peels off after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you don&#x27;t need your manicure to last more than 4 days and want your nails to dry fast, this works. Not great for long-lasting finish, though.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat out there! Thick and makes your nails super shiny, I highly recommend everyone buy this top coat!</li>
            <li> really fast but scared when i read the label ...</li>
            <li> quick drying.  Makes the polish look shiny and last days longer</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best thing ever!!!</li>
            <li> Bar none the best top coat on the market. This glides over your polish and actually permeates the polish, hardening and drying the polish from the bottom coat. Nails are glossy and dry in less than 5 minutes. It can cause some shrinkage as it dries, so I recommend painting over your nail tips to help reduce that. The price on Amazon is much cheaper than drugstores, too!</li>
            <li> FAST DRY Amor LOVE this</li>
            <li> My very favorite top-coat!  Not only does it dry extremely quickly (and it dries all the layers of polish underneath, too), but it produces a mirror-like shine.  I will use nothing else.</li>
            <li> This stuff works FANTASTIC.  it&#x27;s definitely worth buying if you like a good quality topcoat that dries your nails quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of buzz about this product. It&#x27;s supposed to stop your nail polish from chipping.  Painted my nails Saturday night and Sunday by bedtime they were chipped.  Meh.  I do like how it makes your  nails dry quicker, though.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this top coat. It dries incredibly fast and most people assume my nails are gel names. Call me conceded, but I love being able to correct people and tell them I got them done myself. One bottle usually lasts me around three months, and I change my nail polish once or twice per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit, it takes a nail or two to learn how to properly apply Seche Vite, but once you&#x27;ve mastered it, it goes along quite well. A lot of people complain about it &#x27;thickening&#x27; after awhile, and I have definitely noticed this, but if you change your nails a lot, you&#x27;ll be ok. It also tends to crust up around the opening a lot, so make sure you clean it off before you apply it to your awesome manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, without question, the best top-coat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Great top coat and dries really fast!  Only drawback and reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that if you apply another coat over the original it peels sometimes.  I asked my manicurist about this and she said she has seen it peel too.  It is better than &amp;#34;out the door&amp;#34; and just about any other clear coat, however.  It stays very shiny for a long time.  I have acrylics over my own nails and I go three weeks in between fills.  It stays shiny the whole time.  My advice, from experience, is to apply two coats about 10 minutes apart after polishing your nails.  By the way, you will pay double or triple in retail stores!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite topcoat! It&#x27;s a little expensive but everything else pales in comparison. It dries enough to carry about your business in literally about a minute. It&#x27;s rather thick and gives dimension similar to a gel manicure. I&#x27;ve gone through probably 10 bottles and I have no plans to switch brands. It&#x27;s normally about $10 in stores, so this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Great top coat. Really brings out the colors in the polish I use. I love using this because it helps to dry my polish VERY quickly!</li>
            <li> The most beautiful top coat in the world. nothing is better! Makes every nail polish color look 10x better!</li>
            <li> Seriously dries fast and is fairly chip-free! I should have bought this as my main top coat a long time ago. I do my nails several times a week. It&#x27;s my hobby! But this dries faster and glossier than ANY top coat I have ever tried in my life. I would recommend this for anyone. Additionally, they are so cheap on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Top quality top coat! Possibly the best I have ever bought. I think all girls should have one in their shelf.&lt;br /&gt;It dries almost immediately and unlike most top coats, it won&#x27;t smear the color of ur nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;A great find!</li>
            <li> With using this top coat I&#x27;ve had many compliments on my nails. The top coat is so shiny that it almost makes them look like they&#x27;re gel. It also dries quickly which I love. I will definitely continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I received this product and was super pumped. I&#x27;ve seen it in nail salons and saw all the rave reviews..but I haven&#x27;t actually used it. When I read the packaging, I was shocked to find that it clearly states it contains chemicals that are toxic and pregnant women should keep away from it. What? Om not pregnant, but I would like to be in the future. I think a lot of products probably contain toxic components, but the fact that this is so strong that it&#x27;s not safe for pregnant women is scary! Not to mention, we touch everything with our hands. We eat, put on eye/face cream...it&#x27;s scary to think we might have that stuff floating in our blood stream. 2 stars bc at least the company has clearly stated warnings on packaging. Shocked that no one else wrote this in their review when I ordered it!</li>
            <li> I love having my nails painted. I don&#x27;t love walking around like Edward scissor hands for hours out of fear of messing them up. And I ALWAYS seem to mess them up. I did the shellac for awhile, but I read something on the Internets about it being bad for your nails. It&#x27;s on the internet so it must be true.&lt;br /&gt;I used this tip cote with the cnd sticky base coat and opi bubble bath. The top coat is thick. I was a little worried about it mucking up the polish but it did not. And the shine. Oh the shine. It&#x27;s beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;It dries in seriously, seriously, 5 minutes top. And dry meaning you can fold laundry if you wanted. I mean no one really wants to fold laundry, but you could if you wanted.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have with it is the peeling. My nails have always seemed to make nail polish peel off. I have tried a few things to remedy this such as wrapping the layers, putting an extra layer around the edge. Nothing really seems to work. I usually get good 24 hours and then I have 1-2 nails peel. Not a huge deal seeing as paining takes 7 minutes.</li>
            <li> My favorite HG top coat. I need to have this in my arsenal at all times. It cuts down drying time, and leaves a glossy finish. Most people even ask me if I got a gel manicure - it&#x27;s that shiny!</li>
            <li> Love it. Dries fast and makes your nails look shiny and professional. Best top coat, makes any brand nail polish look classy.</li>
            <li> Came fast, works great!</li>
            <li> Great top coat!!! By the time I am doing both hands the nails on my first are already dry to the touch. It also dries the other layers of nail polish quickly so you are less likely to damage your freshly painted nails.</li>
            <li> Peels off within a day.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is my absolute favorite fast drying nail top coat EVER! It dries incredibly fast allowing me to paint my nails even with an active toddler running around, without fear that my nails will get messed up. It leaves a beautiful shiny coat on top which I&#x27;m super fond of and it&#x27;s very easy to use. The only con to this is it starts to get thicker the more you use it, and about halfway through the bottle it loses its quality. I usually just buy a new one or a refill at that time, and I would totally recommend Seche Vite to EVERY nail polish fanatic!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time buying this product it has so many good reviews that I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;It performs well and dries quick to a beautiful shine will buy again.</li>
            <li> This topcoat dries quickly and it lasts me up to 5 days with very minimal chipping. Before I bought this, my polish would chip within the first hour or so no matter what I did or the quality of the base color, so I&#x27;m very pleased. I&#x27;ve gone up to 3 whole days with no chips what-so-ever, which is a miracle for me.</li>
            <li> I am giving this product 5 stars because I have fallen in love with it. It does exactly what it is supposed to do, and much more. Here&#x27;s a quote from the product box:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Its formula allows it to penetrate through the nail lacquer to the base coat forming a single solid coating over the nail plate for a  much more durable finish which is guaranteed to not yellow... Your nails will feel silky, be stronger, and will absolutely not chip... Seche Vite flows over the wet nail polish without dragging or streaking the underlying manicure.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This description describes the polish in a nut shell very well. Ever since i started using it, I ALWAYS finish with the Seche Vite top coat. It really does as it is described to do. One example that I can give, is that I painted my moms toe nails (with a butterfly design) and I put this top coat to finish it, and I swear that she still had the designs after about two months. Only the top edges had worn down a little but the polish design had no damage to it. I am really satisfied with this product AND I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND this product to anyone who paints their nails.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is the best clear coat nail polish I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s fast drying and protects the nail color for days.</li>
            <li> I liked the look that it gave to my nails. The only problem was that it kept peeling off. On the second day, it would start peeling.</li>
            <li> When I first got this bottle of top coat, I loved it. However, once it is about half gone, you might as well just throw it out. It is extremely difficult to get out of the bottle and is so thick that it&#x27;s not even usable. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This topcoat is perfect for all manicures and pedicures it leaves your nails looking very shiny and it dries very quickly I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> After reading tons of reviews on what top coat is the best out there, I decided to give this one a go. It works wonders and the insanely fast dry time is no lie. I have 9 month old and sometimes nap time just isn&#x27;t as long as needed for a quick polish. So with a swipe of this after giving my fingers a new look they are safe from bumps and smudges after about 10 minutes. Though the &amp;#34;no chip&amp;#34; claim that all top coats boast, once again proved false. After one day at work (cashier) I had 3 nails show chips after a 9 hr shift. Still a wonderful product and I will never use a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; top coat again.</li>
            <li> Although it goes on as a nice thick protective coat and is shinny, salon quality, it started peeling alot sooner that I thought. And I tried to apply another coat to prevent the peeling but it just made it worse. Pretty disappointed for the price</li>
            <li> I am an avid rock climber and this is the only polish that has kept my nails from chipping after a long day at the crag! This stuff is truly amazing. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used! I could mess up on my colors (layering unevenly etc) but when i pop this top coat on it magically makes it look good! I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Sure it smells like varnish....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but it works so well... my nails are dry so fast and my manicures last over a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments and people ask who does my nails... They used to get smudged and chip quickly with other top coats...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can do loads and loads of dishes and keep my manicure looking great with this.</li>
            <li> This top coat is amazing and dries so quickly. I will not use anything else. I can&#x27;t believe I just found out about it. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> This is the nicest top-coat I have ever tried, and it dries to a beautiful, glossy finish. Best of all, it speeds up the time of my manicure, so I can get out the door faster!</li>
            <li> The polish does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It dries your nails fast. AND it makes them look nice and shiny. HOWEVER, it makes your polish chip too fast.</li>
            <li> It was my 3rd time purchased this top coat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give 5 stars if they stay longer but I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
            <li> I love this polish! Dries almost instantly! I love the shiny gloss it gives my nail polish! I can&#x27;t count how many times where I have painted my nails last minute before going out and it dries instantly!</li>
            <li> Got this as part of my birthday present from my husband last month. This is the best quick dry top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. Has a nice gloss level as well. I will definitely buy this again...  but that won&#x27;t be for a while because you have to use so little of this for complete coverage.  Great product,  great value.</li>
            <li> This product is so great, I&#x27;ve told everyone I know to buy it! I usually paint my nails before I go to bed and would wake up with sheet imprints. This is amazing because it creates some kind of bond that if you nick it, the top coat re-seals itself and becomes smooth again. It&#x27;s also great to go over last minute paint touch-ups on the way out of the door.</li>
            <li> Cheapest place to get this amazing top coat. Got here pretty fast too. Love this product. It&#x27;s the best. Will be buying from here again. Soon!</li>
            <li> I will forever use this. Was skeptical of the claims of others but this is the best top coat ever! It makes polish last longer and dries almost instantly. I LOVE THIS!!!!!</li>
            <li> Hated it, i can peel off so easily after a couple of hours. A much better clear coat is Duri&#x27;s Rejuvinate Coat</li>
            <li> This is the must-have top coat for your manicure. It does get thick after a while so you&#x27;ll have to get a new one every so often, or invest in the seche vite thinner. I&#x27;m a big fan!</li>
            <li> Another quick-dry top coat to add to my usual lineup. I also use Out the Door and Butter London&#x27;s Hardwear but I like variety even with top coats. This has the expected strong polish scent so no surprises there. In my opinion this has a medium sized brush which I prefer since I have long nail beds (I keep my nails short due to this). It&#x27;s a timeless product to add to your top coat collection.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat it works super well on my nails and lasts a long time for a heavy nail and hand user.</li>
            <li> The product itself works well. My only complaint is that the brush is too short and much of the product gets left unused as a result.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Extra shiny and fast drying.  If you use it, be certain the nail polish is dry before applying it.  Otherwise, it will not dry quickly and will soften the polish enough to make it &amp;#34;move&amp;#34; and smudge if you touch or rub up against something.</li>
            <li> It works really well. Drys fast and it&#x27;s great to have if you are always in a rush like my self. Good product.</li>
            <li> Nice top coat but not as great as I anticipated. Goes on really thick and smells very strongly of chemicals. I didn&#x27;t notice that it extended my manicures but it did add quite a bit of shine.</li>
            <li> I only use this brand of nail polish ...cause in my experience of using other brands.. this is the front runner. The absolute best product....hands down. The top coat is super fast drying and leaves your manicure looking glossy and gorgeous and protected. It is an outstanding product and is the best product i have ever used. I recommend  this brand you wont be dissapointed.  I use to just use any brand but realized that the cheaper brands are a waste of money as they just don&#x27;t last and will chip and are highly toxic...this brand is actually healthy for your nails and is one of the best out there.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats Seche Vite... Can&#x27;t imagine my nails without it..  Great buy,, fast shipping,. good packaging..</li>
            <li> goes on smooth and makes my polish last so much longer!&lt;br /&gt;doesnt chip for a while&lt;br /&gt;it does slightly change the color of the polish - but most top coats do that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased so many brands of top coats that came highly recommended to me, but this one is by far the best.  I mean, the others (Essie, OPI, i.e.) provided brilliant shine and all, but the complete game changer for me was how fast the Seche Vite dried.  Like another reviewer stated, literally 10-15 minutes after using, I was doing my hair with not so much as a smudge.  If you&#x27;re a mom like me and just don&#x27;t have that 2-3 hours to allow your nails to dry, this is your gold mine.</li>
            <li> this is the BEST top coat i have ever used. i used to hate painting my nails, because i knew not a day if not an hour later they would be chipped, but with this i dont have to worry about it. its super fast drying and shiny. love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this from another site based off it&#x27;s positive reviews, however I have mixed feelings about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the positive: It is very fast drying. I recently started doing my own white tip manicure and use it to set the tip quickly. I find that this top coat dries in a matter of a few minutes. It also provides a great gloss to the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the negative: I have to constantly redo my nail with the top coat polish. After applying, the next day or two, the polish will completely peel off and shed the whole nail top like a snake sheds it&#x27;s skin. It can be rather annoying to redo the nails every few days. However, for me, it still saves money going to get my nails professionally done and I am happy with the results once I do the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product until I find a longer lasting polish.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Makes my weak, thin nails look great.  Provides a salon like glossy finish to my nails.  Excellent!  Excellent!  Excellent!</li>
            <li> This is the only top coat I use now.  It is so nice and shiny and helps polish dry very quickly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t used to have the patience to do my nails because I smooshed them right away... No longer! This top coat is magical.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve try lots of top coats, from the basic of BEAUTY SECRETS to SALLY HANSEN, and many others. So far, this is my favorite, fast drying top coat for most nail polishes. Although, if you want a top coat, with fast drying step, plus a super shiny coat (especially when you wear jewel tones or bright reds), for a color pop, try PRO FX QUICK DRY HIGH GLOSS TOP COAT.</li>
            <li> I bought Seche Vite after reading about how great it is. I hoped it would be as good as I read and protect my nails from chipping. But it does not, if anything it makes them peel easier. I have had better luck with lower priced Sally Hansen top coats. It also doesnt dry that fast. For long lasting nail color dont spend this kind of money on a unhelpful top coat.</li>
            <li> Before I used this top coat I would just put any clear coat on top of my manicure. And I would wait about 2 hours before i did anything because I didn&#x27;t want to smudge it. Now with this I only wait 30 mins to make sure its really dry but i noticed you can get away with 10 minutes. Its super shiny, dries fast and hard.</li>
            <li> This item has a very strong smell.  Even after it dried and I washed my hands the next day, it still smelled like a strong acrylic chemical smell.  It was giving me a headache.</li>
            <li> This is a great top coat that makes your polish last days longer and gives any nail color an even look.</li>
            <li> This is the best topcoat ever. Period. Nails will be dry in 10 mins.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s counterfeit or just horrible top coat. It peels off in less that 48 hours alone or with a base...and takes the base with it. Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Bought this on a recommendation from a friend and I am so glad I did.  Best top coat I have ever used.  I am very hard on polish and it keeps my polish from chipping for full week.  But best thing is it is totally dry in under 5 minutes.  And by totally dry I mean go do the dishes dry.  Fantastic and only cost $6 on Amazon Prime.  I am hooked!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  It makes the polish shiny and stay much longer than other top coats.</li>
            <li> best top coat i have ever used!! great product</li>
            <li> i put it over on my essie nail polish. it lasted a week</li>
            <li> Finally a polish that does what it says it is going to do! Was amazed that my dry was ACTUALLY fast &#x3D;) Dries fast and my toes are shiny! Have spent $10.00 on one bottle of supposedly instant dry polish, and had no where near instant dry results!!! Or instantly dry with no shine and weird spots.</li>
            <li> Best top coat I&#x27;ve ever bought and nails are dry in only a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It is the fastest drying topcoat. No mess, it dries, i seconds.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  Dries polish quickly and helps color stay on.</li>
            <li> Has completely transformed doing my nails at home. Must have.</li>
            <li> very easy to fade or peel off</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading rave reviews on a few beauty websites. It does dry fast, but it also chips fast. A top coat is supposed to protect the polish, but whenever I use this it chips soon after. I do my nails at night before bed, and every time I use this, my nails are chipped by the time I wake up. And believe me, I am not doing anything while I sleep to cause this to happen.</li>
            <li> It is really shiny and does not interfere with the polish underneath as you apply it (some other top coats streak the nail color that they&#x27;re being applied to). Feels strong. Has a little strong smell, so try not to inhale that. Dries fast, like in 1 minute.</li>
            <li> The best topcoat I have used in awhile. I don&#x27;t really ever do my nails myself because it usually chips and looks so bad but when I recieved this top coat I started loving doing my nails because it last a long time and chip free for 2 weeks and I&#x27;m always hands on</li>
            <li> Love this product, it is my go to top coat. The shipping came a week earlier than it said it would which was amazing. No problems at all!</li>
            <li> Tried this product on the advice of my sister.  Works very well. Dries fast and stays put.  Helps keep nails from chipping.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Keeps my nails protected and lasting long.</li>
            <li> Keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li> Seche vite does exactly what it says--fast drying top coat for nails.  I do my nails and make sure to apply the Seche Vite when they are still wet.  My nails dry smoothly and look wonderful.  Best top coat and very reasonable price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time. It really dries fast.</li>
            <li> Dries really fast. The best top coat I have ever tried!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is popular for a reason! It dries very quickly, usually under 10 minutes. My theory is that it works best with higher-quality nail polishes (like OPI and Essie) I used to paint my nails every few days, but now I can go up to a week with a high quality polish. It doesn&#x27;t seem to totally prevent chipping with other drugstore polishes I&#x27;ve tried (like Revlon or Sallie Hansen long wear) I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Incredibly fast drying and super shiny -- nails always look like I&#x27;ve had a salon manicure when I use this topcoat! It tends to dry out in the bottle a little but I just use a few drops of nail polish thinner and it&#x27;s good as new. (Don&#x27;t use nail polish REMOVER, it ruins nail polish, just pick up a small bottle of thinner at your local beauty store, inexpensive and works great). My only other recommendation would be to use a base coat... this seems to chip faster without one. Still the best top coat around!</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly three years ago, when I received it, which means I could put my jeans on and off after 15 mins after I applied it.  In three years, it has been deteriorated and works worse than expected, but it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s fault - I merely need to order a fresh one! ;)</li>
            <li> Always the best top coat. Dries in 5 minutes. I bring it with me to the nail salon! lol Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it.</li>
            <li> It is a very good top coat that does dry pretty quickly and stays shiny. I just don&#x27;t like that it shrinks your mani and it will get gloopy in the bottle so you have to put seche restore in it or thinner.</li>
            <li> Best topcoat Ive ever put on my nails! Dries very fast and lasts longer than most topcoats. It makes my nails slick and shiny :)</li>
            <li> I really love this polish its AWSOME!! It relly works and it dries really fast I absolutely recommend it..</li>
            <li> This top does what it says it will. It makes your nails shiny and smooth and it dries relatively fast. I did have problems with it streaking the nail polish if the nail polish itself wasn&#x27;t semi dry. It also still doesn&#x27;t compare to the shine that I get when I go to a nail salon but it&#x27;s a cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like furniture varnish - but it stays on and lasts like advertised.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It gives a lot of shine to your nail polish. I&#x60;m not sure about extending the duration of the nail polish though. I didn&#x27;t feel difference in the durability but I still love how it gives a lot of glow.</li>
            <li> This fast dry top coat cane on three days ! Let ke repeat three days !! The order shipped out on Thursday and arrive Saturday  . A great start to something that you purchased online. I have yet to use it but when I do I hope it doesn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> For my money it&#x27;s the best fast dry top coat out there. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Seche Vite! It does the job 100%.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell too good, but what nail polish does? I don&#x27;t really mind the smell. I like it because it dries fast and it makes your nails shiny and look perfect. The only down side is it also makes my nail polishes peel sooooo much fast. Doesn&#x27;t last me a full two days with out some kind of chip or peel. I don&#x27;t use cheap nail polishes either, so i know its not my nail polishes, i use china glaze, orley, essie and OPI</li>
            <li> WORKS WELL BUT RUNS OUT FAST.</li>
            <li> This stinks like hell and makes my husband want to puke, but dries fast and gives nice shine and protection.  I just don&#x27;t do my nails around him.  This is a good strong top coat, don&#x27;t even try to use as a base, will cause it to chip easily since its meant to stick to polish not your nail beds.  Tested trust me.  Would totally suggest this top coat.</li>
            <li> Love it. Will never use anything else. I will repurchase. As far shrinking I have noticed any. Definitely will be my holy grail. Super fast drying.</li>
            <li> Good top coat, but you have to use it fast, or the whole bottle will dry out soon. I like it.</li>
            <li> Dries very fast. Very shiny with no bubbles at all! I am very impressed because this is the only top coat that has given me consistent awesome results.</li>
            <li> This top coat is truly Amazing! It makes my mani last 2x longer and the high gloss look doesn&#x27;t fade or dull over time. DON&#x27;T BUY ANYTHING ELSE!</li>
            <li> Finally a top coat that looks like a gel mani and dries FAST. I can&#x27;t wait to buy more of these products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE used it twice now and both times my nails were chipped the next day. Don&#x27;t get the hype... Disappointed.</li>
            <li> The best top coat I have ever used by far. It can turn the worst nail polish jobs into a professional looking manicure, and dries almost instantly. I bought this product a few years ago when it was recommended to me and it is the only top coat that I have bought since then. I also have oily nails (meaning that my polish tends to peel off very easily) but seche vite stops that. Cannot say a bad thing about this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Yes, it does get thick over time, but you have to buy the Seche Vite thinner to bring it back to life.  The price here was ridiculously good; it&#x27;s normally $10 at Target/Ulta.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d never bought this stuff. Less than 24 hours after painting, and my nails already start chipping and peeling. I&#x27;ve tried it with different base coat and nail polish brands, but always the same results. My family also complains about the smell. I can&#x27;t believe this has so many five-star reviews.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how this polish got such a high star review! I have used it 4 times. First time I applied one coat - it chipped after just two hours. Second and third times I used two coats - chipped next morning. Fourth try was with 3 coats, it just peeled right off next day. This polish is the worst one I have ever used. Tossed it in the trash and bought another at a local grocery store. Save your money!</li>
            <li> The best top coat I&#x27;ve ever came across. I don&#x27;t bother buying any others for the past few years after discovering this one! Dries and hardens any polish so fast!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, I didn&#x27;t realize it had some questionable ingredients like touline in it. Maybe it&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t use a base coat (tried to use it as a base coat) but it seems to easily flake away a day later, even when I apply a PH balance to my nails. Overalls, it&#x27;s basic, not much better than anything else I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I love watching all the fun nail tutorials on youtube and it always seemed like they were putting polish on so quick after the final coat.  Well they actually are.  I wait about 1-2 minutes after my final color coat and apply this and it dries my nails like I&#x27;ve never seen.  I&#x27;ve even gotten into bed right after and no sheet marks!  One time I did smudge my polish a tiny bit, and I applied this and it smoothed out my mistake.  It is strong smelling and says not to be used if you&#x27;re pregnant.  This with the Gelous Nail Base makes for an incredible home manicure!</li>
            <li> When I first got this, I was very happy and surprised how fast it would dry no matter how many color coats I did. However, if you&#x27;re a perfectionist the only thing that bugged me after awhile was the fact that it causes shrinkage. By shrinkage I mean it pulls the sides around your nail polish and overtime it looks as though you &#x27;forgot&#x27; to coat the sides. I researched it and apparently I&#x27;m not the only one, I hope the picture shows what happens after a day or two. Otherwise if I only planned on keeping the color for 2-3 days, it does the job.</li>
            <li> It work! Now I don&#x27;t even esitate to do my nails  pass 10:00pm. Cause when I did it, I have Seche Vite to make it dry quickly. Go for it.</li>
            <li> This top coat works great! It dries so quickly and leaves nails looking shiny and smooth. No more smudged nails!</li>
            <li> A good top coat, but peels off pretty easily still.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get it.  I know that salons love this top coat, so I decided to give it a shot.  Not only did I have major &amp;#34;shrink back&amp;#34; exposing the white of the tips of my nails (in spite of capping the free edge generously), but my polish also started to chip after one day.  I looked online to see if maybe I was applying it wrong.  Nope.  I applied it over wet nail polish (thickly to avoid touching the polish beneath), and capped the free edge.  In addition, it didn&#x27;t have the glossy &amp;#34;wet polish&amp;#34; look that I love from good top coats.  I have no idea what all of the fuss is about.  I&#x27;ll go back to my stand-by top coat that leaves my nails looking salon fresh for 6 days.</li>
            <li> Love it and will buy new one when done</li>
            <li> The only finish I like to use! Comes out shiny and dries quickly!</li>
            <li> excellent extra dry and protect!</li>
            <li> Great product with super fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have used many dry fast items in the past, but this is the only product that has worked 100% for my nails. I&#x27;ve tried others that dried fast, but would dry cloudy on the tips of my nails or turn the polish a different color. Yes there&#x27;s an odor, but it doesn&#x27;t linger. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Great top coat. need to buy more. Just wish it was a tad cheaper.</li>
            <li> Love that it drys fast but smell is horrible.</li>
            <li> I bought this recommended by a friend and this is definitely a great top coat. Hardens quickly and glossy.</li>
            <li> Nail coat works for me very well. It drys nails very fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Seche Vite dry fast topcoat for the past 4 years now. It makes polishing my nails frustration free! I cannot use regular topcoats anymore. Seche dries my polish completely within 5 minutes. Actually, within 2 minutes you are dent free, and don&#x27;t have to worry about bumping your manicure and denting your polish. Seche Vite has saved me many tears, lol. My manicures also last really long when I use it. I can get a good full 7 days with no chips, only tip wear. The only con is halfway through the bottle it will get sticky and goopy. So you should always have a bottle of Seche Restore on hand to revive your bottle of Seche Vite.  What else can I say? I am addicted to this stuff and have to have at least 2 bottles around at all times. :)</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t review stuff, but I just couldn&#x27;t resist! This is THE best top coat ever made! It&#x27;s super shiny and seriously dries so fast! I&#x27;m the person who goes to get their nails done and walks out only to mess them up immediately! Not with this stuff! I was skeptical because of a couple of negative reviews but don&#x27;t listen to those ones! This top coat is worth 4X the amount of money! My nails are so shiny, the still look wet but they&#x27;re not. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> So i was so excited for this product when i received it.  So as i applied a color nail polish on my nails and i let dry i followed with it the top dry coat. Man o man it dried quickly but it peeled off as if i had a sticker on my nails. Soooooo baddd,  :(  Would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and will purchase again when I run out!  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat ever! It adds a nice shine to any color you use. I will be buying this brand for now on.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t love the thickness and chemically smell, but its worth having my nails dry in mere seconds. Best topcoat I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for nothing that this top coat is always marked as &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; everywhere you look. It really does dry faster than any other top coat I&#x27;ve ever tried, has longer hold, goes on smoother, and shines like no other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend this top coat to anyone who is interested in an actual quality mani/pedi.</li>
            <li> This helps regular nail polish dry much faster and helps smooth out the tops. It doesn&#x27;t really help the polish stay on too much longer</li>
            <li> Great top coat! Dont waste your money on other stuff! Also much cheaper on amazon then in store! not sure why it took me so long to buy!</li>
            <li> This top coat dried very fast and helped my manicure last longer. However, it became &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34; after a couple weeks of usage even though I stored it correctly.</li>
            <li> love that i can do my nails and not spend a day being extra careful not to smear it. I use seche vita and go on with my day</li>
            <li> If I could give this rating 10 stars, I definitely would. It makes even the cheapest nail polish look like it was done in a salon. I love the product and I won&#x27;t ever buy another type of top coat again</li>
            <li> This truly is a quick dry, no smudge, top coat. Goes on smooth, no bubbles. great shine! I will be using this for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat you could ever use. Not only does it dry your nails quickly but is also hardens them, I buy a jar a month because I do my own nails 3 times a week. This is also the best price I have found so far:) Happy!!</li>
            <li> Works well. Dries fast. This is an excellent top coat, the best I have ever used. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i put two coats on to see if that would make it shine but it didnt. low semi gloss finish. no yellow i love that. even after using the tanning bed for a few days it was clear.</li>
            <li> goes on smooth, dries quickly, and protects against chips better than any other brand! I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since I worked in a salon in highschool and I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Lives up to its hype. The only complaint is the chemical smell which is strong. I try to leave the vent on when I apply it.</li>
            <li> This is a quick way to get your nails dry if you&#x27;re in a hurry. I like it for the occasional times I actually paint my nails</li>
            <li> This finish makes even an amatuer nail polisher, such as myself, look like an absolute pro.  Delivers regardless of the length of your nails.</li>
            <li> This is like decoupage for your nails. Goes on thick and smooth and dries quickly. Apply every other day for a long lasting manicure.</li>
            <li> I bought this top coat upon recommendation from a friend who works in a nail salon. This top coat works great in the sense that it is dry within minutes (literally just like 5 minutes) where you can go back to work, handle things with your hands and not have to worry about your polish getting ruined. However, I have noticed that my polish chips much more quickly compared to when I use a cheaper top coat. My nails seem to chip within just a few days. I will continue using this top coat seeing as I spent the money on it, but I don&#x27;t think I will be buying it again. This top coat would definitely work well for busy moms who don&#x27;t have the luxury of waiting for their nails to dry.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite top coat dries nail polish in minutes and gives it a stunning glossy look. I refuse to have a manicure without it.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for.  The perfect quick-dry top coat for my nails!  I will be buying this product again and again!!  Shipping was speedy and the price was just right.</li>
            <li> Here is one product among many cosmetics that just cannot be beat. It works everytime, in every season, lasts for months and worth the money spent! I recommend this!</li>
            <li> Works great when the bottle is new, but gets super thick and gunky after a while and isn&#x27;t useable anymore. Any ideas how to fix or prevent this?</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product I did a pedicure for my mom and she loved it. Also the product arrived on time as stated really love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Makes my nails shiny. It peels off the second it is dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nail polish junkie. I have more colors than I have nails. My problem WAS polish never dried on my nails. I tried every tot coat, base coat, one coat and nothing worked it never dried. Then it started to get worse, my polish would start to rub off on baby wipes! So I went and researched and many people had good things to say about this topcoat. And they were absolutely right! I can put on three coats of polish and this top coat and ten minutes later be washing dishes or getting dressed with no worries! At $10 it&#x27;s a great price for as well as it works and at $4 and change it&#x27;s a steal! Buy it buy it!!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I have ever used and I have tried a few. It dries very fast and I super shiny.</li>
            <li> LOVE  this stuff:  makes polish QUICK DRY!</li>
            <li> Horrible this product.  It doesn&#x27;t help nothing and in my opinion helped the polish nail go away easier.</li>
            <li> Dries nails quickly and leaves a professional looking glossy top coat</li>
            <li> Keeps nailpolish on! Beautiful shine</li>
            <li> I use this top coat with the gelous base coat. This fast drying top coat provides wonderful shone and extends the length of my manicure.</li>
            <li> Really like it. It&#x27;s cheap, shiny and quick dry. Make my nail polish looks better and last longer.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will use it every time.</li>
            <li> I started using this product because of a recommendation by my manicurist, but then after reading the back of the bottle, its going straight in the trash!&lt;br /&gt;In tiny black writing it states: Warning! This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.</li>
            <li> My usual product was ORLY&#x27;s sec n&#x27; dry which is actually a few dollars more than this. I was ordering the Duri Rejuvacote so gave this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dries MUCH faster and with a thicker, more non chipping coat. It makes manicures look magnificent!</li>
            <li> I do a lot of cleaning and wash my hands frequently, it really helped my polish last for more than a day. Only thing is that one of the ingredients is said to cause birth defect! Kind of scary.</li>
            <li> This is a great top coat but i felt that it made my white nails turn yellow and made all my polishes chip off</li>
            <li> get this top coat!  it dries fast and lasts long</li>
            <li> My natural nails never dry and my husband swears it&#x27;s my cheap buy cheap nail polishes but with this top coat it doesn&#x27;t matter. My nails dry so fast and polish stays on so much longer</li>
            <li> i used to hate to do my own nails.  i would attempt, but it would always get messed up.  no matter how long i waited.  this stuff is AMAZING.  it dries within minutes.  i have started to do my own nails and i love it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand why this received great reviews. My polish chipped as much or worse than usual. Tried several times and gave up on using it.</li>
            <li> This top coat is amaze. I&#x27;ve used pretty much every drug store top coat, and many nicer ones, and I always come back to Seche. It gets thicker and gloopier over time, and it generally only lasts two or three days without pealing away, but it is SO worth it because of the shine and, really, because it dries practically instantly. If you like to change your polish a lot, as I do, this is perfect, because it looks flawless for a few days and then, when it starts to chip, you&#x27;re naturally ready to change to a new color anyway. It&#x27;s one of the only top coats that truly gives a salon-finish look. Great for pedicures, too (and it lasts for quite a while on toes, longer than it lasts on nails).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only top coat that dries flawlessly and quickly -- I can paint my nails 20 minutes before bed and, by the time I&#x27;m in bed, my nails are set enough that they don&#x27;t crease or get dented/chipped during the night. Love it!</li>
            <li> The best there is in a top coat. Hands down the best. Dont waste your money on the super pricey ones when this is so great</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the only top coats worth using. It is a great product that is not reviewed enough. It is professional quality and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> Great product. I was about to give up on natural nails because nail polish would only last a day or two, but then I found this product. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat, it is the best I have found. Doesn&#x27;t smear designs and stays hard and shiny. Now that I&#x27;ve discovered it on amazon I love it even more since I don&#x27;t have to pay $8 at Sallys anymore!</li>
            <li> I got 2 bottles of this as it was half the price on line that is in the stores for the same sized bottle.  Would definitely buy again from this company.  Very prompt.</li>
            <li> I find this top coat to be extra good.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I think this topcoat is wonderful and it gives great shine but I&#x27;m dumb and I didn&#x27;t notice it had toluene in it- so I didnt read that it can cause birth defect or reproductive harm. I was actually going to give this to my mom and use it on my little tiny sister, so I am glad I found out before. No beauty product is worth risking a life.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this nail polish to be really good but everytime I use it, it peels off within a couple days.</li>
            <li> Works well with the nail growth system.</li>
            <li> I recently began doing my own nails since going to the salon is no longer in my budget.  However, I struggled with not bumping my nails on something as I waited for them to dry.  After some research, I found a blogger that recommended Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Nail Coat.  I am on my 2nd bottle and I can&#x27;t believe I went this long with out ever using it!  I tell everyone I know about it and even sent a bottle to my friend in another state because it&#x27;s just that awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it to my nails after I finish my nail art and they are set with in a matter of minutes!  Usually two days later I will apply a second coat to extend the life of my mani.  I also use Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Nail Coat to apply rhinestones.  They are stuck like cement until I use my fingernail polish remover to take them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say for certain this is the only top coat I will ever use.  I like to pair it with the Seche Vite Base Coat as well.</li>
            <li> Fast Drying, high glossy shine!  Love this stuff!  This is like an instant &amp;#34;freeze dry&amp;#34; for your nails!  Helps polish last longer too!</li>
            <li> This top coat has been one of the best purchases I have ever made. It drys hard (not at all tacky) in a minute. You can literally use your hands immediately after applying and not worry about smudges. The only downside is that I&#x27;ve noticed that my polish cracks sooner than if I had used regular top coat, like after 3 days as opposed to 5 days with regular.</li>
            <li> This product really works! I don&#x27;t use any base coat, then apply two coats of my nail polish, let it dry for just a few minutes then apply a thick layer of this. It dries pretty quickly! For extra protection, I apply a second coat of Seche Vite in the morning. My nail polish really lasts when I wear this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is that after a few months, the polish in the bottle thickens. But for the price, I don&#x27;t mind purchasing a new bottle.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. Not only was the delivery ridiculously fast, but the product is more than I had hoped for. It dries in less than a minute and gives nails a great glossy shine, as well as making them look professionally done. I will be buying this again and again and again!</li>
            <li> I learned about Seche Vite from a nail board/forum &amp; I use it over glitter nailpolish - it smooths out the gritty surface tons better than any other top coat b/c it has a thicker consistency that self-levels absolutely exquisitely. I haven&#x27;t found any other top coat out there yet that self-levels the way Seche Vite does.  This is otherwise a perfect quick-dry top coat except that it invariably shrinks the polish from the edges of my nails. I hate that to no end! No trick I have tried has worked (even layering it over regular topcoat#. It has other faults too - the noxious fumes when I used to use it didn&#x27;t bother me, but now it does - I&#x27;m leary of the hazards of toluene though I haven&#x27;t completely cut it out of my life #just decreased#. Also the consistency thickens into a difficult goop over time. #I bought Seche Restore to deal w/this problem, but IMO the formula is never the same as when the bottle is new &amp; fresh.)  My longtime favorite fastdry topcoat is Jessica Brilliance, which I still use &amp; keep backups of at home at all times. I also always keep Seche Vite around for occasional use when I&#x27;m in the mood for super-killer shine &amp; am willing to tolerate the shrinkage. I have an intense love/hate relationship with this product. It&#x27;s hard to rate it accurately - I think 3 is too low but 4 is too high. I&#x27;d give it 3.5 - stunning finish but too many performance problems.</li>
            <li> This top coat is a miracle your nails get dry within minutes even if you have several coats of polish! I will never do my nails without it again.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t ever buy another top coat, this is awesome! It even creates a super smooth look on top of chipped or smudged layers, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> Best clear coat of nail polish I have ever bought!</li>
            <li> It dries so fast. But my nail polish chips in two days, even the Chanel ones.</li>
            <li> I remember this product being better. Now this top coat is not as shinny and thick as it used to be, and it bubbles up.  I prefer the SALMA HAYEK NUANCE top coat that you find at CVS.  It&#x27;s much better, thicker, shinier, and dries in two minutes!!!</li>
            <li> I love this top coat! It makes your nails look like you just walked out of the salon! And it lasts forever!!! I&#x27;m a little sad that I&#x27;m almost out of mine. But I&#x27;d most defiantly order it again!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 1- star because I&#x27;ve only been able to get one day wear from it before it chips and flakes off in sheets.  Followed recommendations given by customer service but this top coat still doesn&#x27;t work for me. Only positive a can give is that it dries very quick and leaves a shiny finish.</li>
            <li> I love this clear polish it makes it dry fast I bought it several times and make the polish look shiny it looks like gel polish..  I will keep buying this works really good on my natural nails</li>
            <li> I used this product in conjunction with American Classic Gelous Nail Gel Base Coat Nail Polish and it made my nail color last up to seven days with no chipping or peeling. The top coat produces a very high shine that lasts a long time and really seemed to protect the surface of my nail color. And it dried within a minute of applying it. Absolutely loved this product.</li>
            <li> This top coat is wonderful! Dries fast and gives your nails a smooth glossy finish. I have been using Out The Door top coat for a couple of years now and swore by it, but this is just as good... Maybe even better! Definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> It got here in 3 days it dries quick amd makes my nails look like I went to a salon and got them done and it makes layers look like one layer of perfection.</li>
            <li> Best top coat money can buy.  No other top coat gives you the shiny finish as Seche Vite.  It also dries fast too.  I will only use this top coat.  My all time favorite top coat.</li>
            <li> Great top coat! My nails look shiny, even, and best of all dries in a matter of minutes. No more sitting around 20+ mins for my nails to dry!</li>
            <li> This top coat works well against most dings and it certainly works as directed. It makes my sloppy color job look professional and sleek.</li>
            <li> Its fantastic. The bottles came super fast. I highly recommend getting this product directly FROM AMAZON. It&#x27;s much cheaper, for if you go to the stores to buy just one, the cost is about eight dollars, which is ridiculous. The top coat drys to touch in about a minute and it makes your manicure last way longer. I used to use Revlon&#x27;s top coat, which is ok, but nothing compares to this, and at such a cheap price, why not buy this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY! its amazing!</li>
            <li> As of right now, 42 out of 61 reviews give this product 5 stars.  Well, the reviews are right, and this top coat lives up to the hype.  With this top coat, your manicure can easily last a week.  Even cheap, low quality polish can look amazing with this top coat.  I purchased a $1 bottle of polish from a local grocery store on a whim and was amazed to see that Seche Vite kept the polish from chipping or flaking for five days!  I used the same brand of polish a few months before with a different top coat, and it didn&#x27;t even survive past the second day.  And about the thickening, I&#x27;ve been using the same bottle for about six weeks and it still has a perfect consistency.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> Totally in love with the glossy shine, the perfectly smooth coverage, and easy application.  This has been my &#x27;go-to&#x27; top coat varnish for years.</li>
            <li> The Good: Dries extremely fast. Gives a nice gloss finish. Easy to apply. Relatively inexpensive.  The Bad/Ugly: Alters the color of the polish (I use primarily Essie and OPI polishes). Cannot be used as a base coat (it&#x27;s not marketed as one, so I did not take that into consideration when rating). Shrinkage issues (has been mentioned in many of these reviews).  Bottom line: I&#x27;m on the hunt for something better. I just don&#x27;t think this product lives up to its reputation (YMMV). Oddly, my favorite is a discontinued base and top coat by Max Factor (yes, really) -- it was long lasting and effective, didn&#x27;t change my polish colors, and just imparted a slight shine, with a bonus of being dual purpose. Those are the things I&#x27;m ultimately looking for.</li>
            <li> Love love love this top coat!!! I&#x27;ve seen so many people use it and never thought to pick it up, but I see why it&#x27;s so popular. This is my new go to top coat!</li>
            <li> This polish is the best! I used to always mess up my nails due to not waiting long enough for the nails to dry. This polish worked wonderfully. I use it on top of my color polish, and my polish lasts longer then it normally would.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Thank you</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is amazing - What I love the most is that the product is dry and hard within 15 minutes!   I apply the top-coat while my color coat is still wet and make sure to apply and additional swath of product over my tips.  The result is beautiful nails that look like they were professionally done.    A manicure typically lasts me about 4 days before looking haggard, this stuff keeps my nails pristine for about 8 days.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with shrinkage or durability.</li>
            <li> This product really works. You can apply two coats of nail polish then immediately use this and they dry so fast. I love it. Especially great if you paint your nails at night right before bed.</li>
            <li> Love this product, everyone asks me if my nails are gel and they are always shocked when I tell them it&#x27;s regular old nail polish and this top coat. Plus my nails last a lot longer with this on!</li>
            <li> I honestly am amazed at how fast this top coat dries. I usually go to bed and wake up with creases on my nails after an hour of drying with Sally Hansen, OPI, etc., but not this Seche Vite Top Coat. Not only that, but the shine is AMAZING. Some may say that it doesn&#x27;t last, but they’re blowing smoke. Mine last at least a week without chipping, and when I start to see it wear off around the edged I do another quick coat over top. It dries so fast and it CLEAR that I don’t mind taking the extra 30 seconds to throw on coat. MY ONLY COMPLAINT and the reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is... I noticed it turns a purplish tint after 2 days or so. Has anyone else noticed this?</li>
            <li> Great top coat! Dries fast..lasts and lasts! I love this product</li>
            <li> I tried over a dozen different top coats to seal and smoothly coat my favorite large glitter nail polish ([[ASIN:B002SVUV12 Deborah Lippmann Nail Lacquer, Happy Birthday, 0.5 Ounce]]) and nothing worked.  Nothing!  It was so frustrating to spend an hour making my nails look perfect and then having the base, polish, and top coat pop off in one solid chunk.  I ordered Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat based on all of the positive reviews (thank you fellow reviewers!) and it&#x27;s the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  It seems to penetrate the polish more and keeps everything in place.  No chipping, no peeling!  It&#x27;s simply amazing.  If you do your own nails, this is the only way to go.  Do note that it contains toluene if that matters to you.</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever!!!</li>
            <li> brilliant top coat. ultra shiny, lasts for about a week usually. My only qualm is that it can sometimes pull back your nail color from the end of your nail. not enough of a deterrent to not use it!</li>
            <li> This is my fav top coat just for it&#x27;s glossiness. It also dries in around 30seconds so you can go about your day without worrying about your nails. But this polish is also bad because it shrinks away from the nails and peels off in one layer. I&#x27;ve never experienced this with any other polish except seche vite. Every polish starts to chip within one or two days, but the fact that this one starts lifting off the nail in one layer (peeling) makes it more susceptible to chipping. if you need to put on shoes, jeans, or do anything at all with your hands, yes this will come off. Very annoying but the gloss in seche vite just can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Drys my nails super fast! By very potent smell.</li>
            <li> Best top coat I have ever used! It makes my nails nice and smooth and keeps the nails looking shiny. It has a gel like look once it dries, which it dries fast! It is a bit smelly but it&#x27;s worth the results. Also it will not smear nail art like other top coats... It&#x27;s my favorite top coat ever!</li>
            <li> It kind of flaked away from nail polish leaving a weird matte finish behind after a couple of days. Did not love.</li>
            <li> seems like a pretty good top coat. I like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is the top coat or the top coat and base coat combined BUT after years of trying all kinds of products, this has done wonders for my nails.&lt;br /&gt;The top coat dries almost immediately so no dings to fresh polish.  It makes a hard smooth finish that lasts.  Great product.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It makes my polish dry so quickly, avoids nasty smudges, and keeps my manicure looking better longer.  A must have!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best manicure look in a bottle! It makes my nails look professional and amazing, and the best part is that it lasts a long time before chipping. Seche Vite at the store is about double the price, so definitely would buy from Amazon again for a bargain manicure!</li>
            <li> I was sent the base coat and not the top coat like I had ordered.</li>
            <li> Great product. Dries fast, shiny and strong.</li>
            <li> I had never tried this before, and I was pleasantly surprised.  It adds a nice shine to your nails, helps them dry super fast, and helps prevent polish from chipping off.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Really fast shipping!</li>
            <li> My new FAV top coat. Extends the life of my manicures by a week and my pedicures by nearly a month. Plus when it starts to come off, it comes off in huge pieces instead of little chips, which I like, makes it easier to remove with polish later. Has a VERY strong odor but it is professional polish. I won&#x27;t get any other top coat after using this one.</li>
            <li> great topcoat for nails</li>
            <li> After you&#x27;ve had it for a while it gets dry slower, but this is magical stuff! As long as your nail polish isn&#x27;t so old it will never dry, this top coat works wonders!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been buying this top coat for several years now and I am in love. It smells pretty intensely for about a day after applying, but it goes away. I have a lot of trouble with my nails chipping and this lasts longer than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. It goes on pretty thick and dries extremely fast! Once you put it on, wait 2 minutes and you&#x27;re good to go. Not kidding. You can go to bed and won&#x27;t get those lines from the sheets or your hair... seche vite top dry coat always!</li>
            <li> This stuff is so amazing, it takes the current nail color I have on, and makes it so shiny and well protected.</li>
            <li> it really does dry your nails quickly!  I bring it to the salon - I can have dry nails in 1/2 the time!</li>
            <li> I avoid doing my nails because after polishing them to perfection I inevitably wreck them before they can dry.  Even after allowing my nails to dry for a considerable amount of time they still get dents and sheet marks.  Not any more!!!!  I was SHOCKED the first time I used this top coat.  My nails were dry and hard in a matter of minutes!  I put it on over 5 layers of polish and gel finish, and it was almost as if the top coat sinks into all the layers of nail polish and hardens it to perfection.  Strong chemical smell but with these results who cares!  Awesome shine finish as well!  I know what my sisters are getting in their stockings this year!</li>
            <li> Makes your nails so shiny :)  Drys SO fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about this top coat and decided to purchase it. I have not had the same results as the others who swear by this product. I have experienced severe shrinking and even chips!</li>
            <li> I used to like this Top Coat that I purchased 3 bottles. Its very shiny &amp; dries fast. But it hardens quickly in the bottle half way full. I&#x27;ve never seen it in any nail polish before. What a waste, I even added nail polish thinner but it was hard like cement. Won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever. I did my nails last night shortly before going to bed, and they look salon-quality this morning. Very shiny and no scratches or dents from the sheets. This stuff is a must-have for doing mani/pedis at home.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing top coat I have ever used.  It dries insanely fast and gives a shiny, glossy finish like no other.  Other than a bit of tip wear and nail growth, your manicure will last for what seems like forever.  I&#x27;ve had mine last up to three weeks and I am not easy on my nails.  I am constantly on the computer and this stuff survives it all and even helped my nails grow longer.  Within the first couple of weeks after I puchased it, I already had a few of my friends place their own orders because they couldn&#x27;t believe how great my nails looked.  This stuff works.</li>
            <li> This is a really fantastic top coat. When used with Essie polish, my fingers stay chip-free for a week!</li>
            <li> Really does dry very fast - great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this stuff a couple different times but it doesnt stay on my nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a fake bottle or what, but this polish starts chipping within 1-2 days. Usually when I do my nails, I use OPI chip skip, then a base coat, 2 color coats and then this. Like other reviewers suggested, I put Seche Vite on while my nails were still wet, and I also tried putting it on when they dried a little. After 5+ attempts with this top coat, I have had no luck. And I always use OPI or Essie nail polish with this top coat, my nail polish last longer without this! It peels off so quickly! It does dry SUPER fast and has a great shine, so I give it 2 stars. I am bummed because I really wanted this to work for me!</li>
            <li> This works great for fast drying nail polish. I&#x27;d never NOT messed up a nail polish paint job done at home before buying this stuff. I do feel like it makes the paint chip faster, but it makes for a beautiful manicure before that happens! Well worth it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love this top coat!!! As soon as you put it on....ur nail polish is dry..I stock up like 3 of them so I wont run out!!! But try it, it is the best!!!</li>
            <li> My friend told me that this is the best and sure it is.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t as great as I thought it would be. My nails still chip soon after I use it, and it doesn&#x27;t make them as shiny as I would like.</li>
            <li> I notice a difference when I don&#x27;t use this - even when I get my nails professionally done! It dries SO much more quickly. A must-have.</li>
            <li> Just as described.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone around me if they ever ask me about how great my nails look. This keeps my nail polish long lasting and chip-free for a week or so!</li>
            <li> I really like this top coat with all my O.P.I polishes, and I have tried many, It prevents any chipping!!</li>
            <li> This top coat dries super fast, and leaves my nails smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the perfect finish for every polish I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Clear polish outstanding?  Oh yes.  Great as a base, or top coat or alone.  Dries fast &amp; so smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> This an ok product! I am very glad that I got it for a great deal here on Amazon, because even at Walmart, this retails for $ 10.00!!!! Crazy! Like I said in my last rating of the CND sticky base coat, I have other, way less expensive fast dry top coats, that work just as well, and without the nasty smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed the skin around my nail bed is drying and peeling after use. Here&#x27;s what I found online after looking up the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Health Hazards: Butyl acetate vapors may cause dizziness or drowsiness. Continued use of a product containing butyl acetate may cause skin to crack and become dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s warning label on the box:&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: \\&quot;This product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Online:&lt;br /&gt;Butyl Acetate (main ingredient)  can also be narcotic in high concentrations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next ingredient is Toluene.  Here&#x27;s what I found online:&lt;br /&gt;Symptoms of toluene exposure include: irritation of the eyes and nose; weakness, exhaustion, confusion, euphoria, dizziness, headache; dilated pupils, lacrimation (discharge of tears); anxiety, muscle fatigue, insomnia; numbness or tingling of the skin; dermatitis. Toluene exposure may cause liver and kidney damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toluene affects the central nervous system, eyes, skin, respiratory system, liver, kidneys. Breathing high levels of toluene during pregnancy has been shown to result in children with birth defects and to retard mental abilities and growth. There is evidence that exposure to toluene at work is associated with spontaneous abortion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High concentrations of toluene, usually from use in a confined space or unventilated area, can cause loss of consciousness, respiratory depression and death. Long term and repeated workplace exposure to toluene affect the central nervous system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, most of these things occur only with acute exposure, so &#x27;they&#x27; say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the stuff works, that&#x27;s no lie.  But really, this may have put me over my beauty carcinogenic limit for the month.</li>
            <li> Excellent dry fast plus it adds a varnish to a Matt Colour!  Highly recommend this one. And it&#x27;s definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Best topcoat ever.  Dries super fast and shiny.  My only complaint is that it becomes really thick when about half the product is used so I have to continue to buy more before empty.</li>
            <li> As indicated, dries very quickly. I Have used this multiple times over the years and cant complain. Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Yep, this dry fast nail coat really works. I am happy with the product and was glad that it wasn&#x27;t false advertising.</li>
            <li> This is a good top coat if you are looking for a good protective shine, but it smells really bad.....like house paint.</li>
            <li> Definitely a game changer when you&#x27;re in a time crunch or are impatient with a normal dry time. It gives a great shiny finish, though this doesn&#x27;t last for more than a day, maybe two. I noticed this doesn&#x27;t do much in terms of top coat strength unfortunately. Most of the times I&#x27;ve used this have resulted in chipped manicures on the 2nd or 3rd day.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried seche vite, I think it&#x27;s a pretty good product overall. I like the texture of the polish, it&#x27;s not goopey or thick like most clear coats, it&#x27;s not too thin either. I used it over wet and dry polish, I prefer using over dry because if you apply it over wet polish (which is the correct way to use it I think) the brush picks up a bit of the colored polish and can tint the entire bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to dry fast and leaves a glassy, high shine layer. I needed two coats on slightly shimmery polish, because the shimmer particles were a bit bumpy I guess. That&#x27;s not too bad though considering I usually use 3 or 4 costs with other polishes, which ends up looking much too thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price this is a great top coat. The only drawback for me is the smell, this is some stinky polish. It has a strong chemical smell, which is to be expected considering the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend, shipping was good as well. Thought I&#x27;d add that since some cheaper products come from China and we amazon buyers don&#x27;t know until the estimated delivery date. So, it&#x27;s average shipping speed in the U.S.</li>
            <li> Definitely a very glossy top coat. It seems to come off quite easily and will peel the rest of itself off. Not my favorite, and it has that gross glitter polish smell too.</li>
            <li> I heard so many good things about this polish, but it always peels my polish off in one big chunk. The seller was fast and got the product to me very quickly; I just really didn&#x27;t like the product.</li>
            <li> The best topcoat ever!</li>
            <li> This top coat is great! 2 minutes and it&#x27;s dry! No smudges or anything...</li>
            <li> Have been using this for many years.  Definitely my favorite nail product.  It&#x27;s an absolute must when I do my own and often bring it with me to a salon when they don&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> My favorite topcoat. I have purchased over 20 of these and amazon has the best price with fast shipping. I paint my nails weekly and this top coat seals my nailpolish instantly! No more hair marks or dings on your freshly painted nails. My nails have also gotten stronger since using this topcoat!</li>
            <li> Will never use anything but this top coat.</li>
            <li> This would be a 5 star review if Seche Vite was Toulene free, unfortunately its not and it&#x27;s harmful when inhailed.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd bottle, best top coat ever!</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, but last for only a couple to a few days.  It peels nail polish probable faster than just applying the nail polish itself.  I&#x27;ve tried it on different polishes - same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear seems smaller, but the best for long wear so far.</li>
            <li> Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Great price fast service!&lt;br /&gt;This is the best top coat in all the land!</li>
            <li> This top coat is a dream.  Literally makes polish dry to the touch in seconds!!!!  You still have to be careful not to bump your nails hard and cause a dent in the polish for a few minutes, but this absolutely stops the smearing and dries instantly!  Added bonus is it is like a shiny laquer finish.  Makes my polish last so much longer.  Apply thickI I will buy it everytime I run out!</li>
            <li> smells weird, not sure if I should put it on my nails</li>
            <li> Works better than expected !!!!</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong but it leaves such a great shine and a nice thick protective coat! I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this polish on Amazon. it really does dry super fast and gives a nice shine to your polish. It is hard for me to find in the store and especially at this price. It is the only top coat I will use now.</li>
            <li> This top coat stinks to high heaven (gives my boyfriend a headache), but it does its job. It does &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; super fast, in about a minute, but it remains soft for at least an hour. So while you don&#x27;t have to be immobile as with wet nail polish, it&#x27;s still easy to mess them up if you&#x27;re not careful.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the smell, this is the best topcoat I&#x27;ve used. It definitely keeps my polish looking better for longer with minimal chipping. If a nail does chip, the whole fingernail of color will often come off, since the topcoat holds it together so well. This isn&#x27;t often an issue though. I definitely recommend seche vite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking around for a good top coat because my nails always seem to chip within a day or two after painting them. I figured I&#x27;d try this one because it had great reviews and was only $4. I&#x27;m so happy I bought this! It&#x27;s absolutely perfect. Not only do my nails not chip, but they dry in 4-5 minutes instead of 10-20. I don&#x27;t think I will ever buy another type of Top Coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sally Hansen faithfully for years and wanted to give this a try for a change. I will never go back. It dries so fast and gives a beautiful shine to whatever nail polish you&#x27;re wearing.</li>
            <li> This is the bomb.com no more having to wait for ages for my nails to dry, this does the job in seconds</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this because I need quick dry so I can paint my nails at night, however since I have used this, my nails will chip the next day, shrink at the edges and chip progressively all week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many other people on other Web sites have complained of the same problems.  I have used all different types of polish, tried changing my base coat, and nothing helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could return it - it is only good if you need it for a mani that day or the next day.</li>
            <li> Love this top coat, dries fast</li>
            <li> A cult fave for good reason. Long lasting, supremely shiny, durable and dries in a flash.</li>
            <li> Dries fast is nice and shinny, recieved it within days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews but after using this product, I remembered how many bad reviews I had read prior to purchasing this item.  I&#x27;m a mom of 2 I work full time (clerical lots of typing) and at home I cook, clean, wash dishes all without using gloves... needless to say my hands go through a lot and in the past whenever I&#x27;ve worn polish the most it lasts is maybe up to 2 days, then the chipping and peeling begins.  I would find it pointless to paint my nails cause the polish wouldn&#x27;t last.  So I asked a few friends for suggestions and a friend recommended that I used Seche Vite as my top coat.  So I purchased it and this week was the trial run.  I did my nails on Sunday April 29th, today is May 4th and my nails still look beautiful.  I used a base, 2 coats of Essie&#x27;s &#x60;Nice is Nice&#x27; and then I finished it off with my Seche Vite top coat :)  I definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I posted a picture of the weeks trial for you guys to see</li>
            <li> If you have never tried a fast drying top coat, be ready to be amazed. This will dry your manicure in 5 minutes. Not only that, but it will give your nails a thick, glossy finish. I absolutly love it. It does tend to get thick when you are about halfway through the bottle, but a couple of drops of nail polish thinner do the trick, and it works like new! If you have no tried it, then YOU HAVE GOT TO TRY IT TO BELIEVE IT.</li>
            <li> Dries exceptionally quick.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb dot com.  Makes wet nails dry in seconds.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m pretty rough on my hands throughout the day (especially because I&#x27;m a musician), and my nails endure a lot of wear. I&#x27;ve been trying to find a top coat that can make my nails last more than a couple days without chipping... and after trying several complete failures, I&#x27;ve finally found it. This shiz is the bomb! Seche Vite, while completely unpronounceable, forms this amazing hard shell over your nails and dries super fast. It has a smooth and glossy finish, and I can actually use my nails to unbutton my jeans to pee within ten minutes of applying it (you always seem to have to go at the worst possible moments). I am in love with this stuff, and unlike most men, it will never let me down.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> product came way earlier than expected &amp; this is definitely the best top coat i&#x27;ve ever purchased. dries so much faster than any other i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It makes my nails look great. It gives it a nice shine, and looks like i came put of a salon. It does dry very quickly. But I won&#x27;t be using for long since it contains toulene. It smells like death. And it even has a warning label that says it has a chemical that causes birth defects.</li>
            <li> Great shine and durability but it lifts. There is a trick to reducing that problem but most of us just want to polish and not worry about bowing down to a product.</li>
            <li> Drys nails quickly and adds unparalleled shine.</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish - dries all layers so quick!</li>
            <li> Really does shorten drying time, and is very glossy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually fairly stringent with my praise of nail products, but this is without a doubt the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have a huge problem with my nail polish chipping off (usually within a day of putting it on!) and this product is the most chip-resistant polish I&#x27;ve tried.  It also leaves a freshly-manicured shine.  With this and an angled brush to clean up your edges, your manicures will look just as good as the ones from a salon!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  My nails look professionally done (combined with OPI nail polish).  This dries incredibly fast, and protects the color underneath.</li>
            <li> Horrible stuff!  Looks great initially, but starts to crack within a couple of days.  A waste of money!</li>
            <li> Most amazing top coat EVER! Gives a fabulous gel like shine and dries hard SUPER FAST!! I just bought 2 more bottles!</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Dries my nails with a nice hard coat and a shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy anything else as a top coat</li>
            <li> just OK , nothing spectacular, need 2 coats to be shiny</li>
            <li> World&#x27;s best top coat! I am a master of impatience, but this top coat beats me to my boredom by drying my nail polish so I can get back to my pressing life!&lt;br /&gt;I remember seeing this in the salons and thinking, wow, I should pick this up. But, honestly, I&#x27;m sorry I waited SO LONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t wait, get you some Seche Vite today!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and safely.  Love it thanks!</li>
            <li> Dries fast (but chips by day 2). Like really fast. I would rather paint more often and skip drying time....I mean skip smudging them on my comforter. You can fold laundry 5 min later - no joke.</li>
            <li> I use it every time I polish my nails.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble keeping polish on my nails. Not even 24 hours would go by and I would have chips galore!! This was increasingly frustrating when I got into nail art. I would put in a lot of time and effort and have beautiful designs only for it to chip in less than a day. So I picked up a bottle of seche vite and figured what do I have to loose?? Holy Hannah people! My manicure lasted for 6 days before I had any noticeable chipping. A very huge improvement to my 12-16 hours! I love it! It is a nail art fanatic&#x27;s best friend!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  I had tried a Sally Hansen top coat before this one-- and it was pretty good-- but this one is even better.  I applied this to my nails approximately 2 min after painting my second coat of nail polish and waited.  It goes on nicely-- but thick, so be judicious or else you&#x27;ll have a big blob to deal with on your nail and it&#x27;ll run off-- ya know how it is. Anyway, I was pretty amazed at how fast it really did dry and create a protective barrier with a nice, shiny sheen.  And then I started testing it by sticking my hand in a bag of almonds...with encouraging results! Also important, I did not wake up the next day with sheet and pillowcase imprints in my nails-- nice! Overall, this product will really give you a nice, professional-looking manicure at home.  It does deliver.  I have already recommended it to others looking for a product such as this. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> this seche vite top coat is AMAZING! i was currently using sally hansen which, in my opinion works great but a lot of people use this top coat so i thought i would give it a try and i wasn&#x27;t dissapointed!</li>
            <li> Yes, it dries your polish crazy fast. The smell is awful and it makes my nail so brittle and weak it peels like crazy after. Spare your lungs and nails and pass.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use this you should.</li>
            <li> Save your money. This stuff caused every manicure I used it on to peel right off in one big piece within a day or two, almost like plasti dip for cars. It also caused whatever color I was using to shrink away from the edges of my nails. I&#x27;ve read that the peeling problem is due to letting the base color dry for too long, and yet the shrinkage is supposedly cause by putting the top coat on a color that is still too wet. So, when are you supposed to use this then? The real kicker is, about a month or so after I bought this stuff, it became so thick and gooey that I had to throw it out.</li>
            <li> It does dry your nails fast. However, it is not a good top coat. Your nails chip easily with this stuff.</li>
            <li> It gives the nails a good shine, but does not stop paint from chipping or long lasting wear!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m horrible at waiting until my nails dry and it&#x27;s one of the reasons that I don&#x27;t do my nails often! After using this product for the first time, I&#x27;m hooked and currently searching nail polish colors online! Superrrrr fasttttt dryinggggg!!!!! Made my nail feel hard and sturdy too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bye bye smudges!</li>
            <li> You know those little crease marks that you get on your nail polish if you touched something before your polish completely dried? Yeah, well those marks become a thing of the past when you use this top coat. When they say fast dry - they mean fast dry. Within 2-3 minutes, my nail polish is completely dry and I am able to do something as touch sensitive as moving clothes from the washer to the dryer. Not even joking becuase this is what I do every Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this top coat with OPI, China Glaze, Sally Hansen, Julep, Revlon, and Ulta brand nail polishes and have had no problems. I usually wait to apply this once whatever polish I have is either dry or a bit tacky. Just one coat and your nails will be set! For me, usually two coats of polish without a top coat last about a day. With this top coat, I can leave my manicure for 3-5 days without reapplying any more polish. I definitely recommendd you get this polish if you are an avid nail painter!</li>
            <li> Very quick at drying. I had hoped it would help with chipping but it doesn&#x27;t. Oh well.</li>
            <li> Best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. It dries up fast and looks amazing/shiny on my nails. My nails usually last for about 2 weeks by using this top coat!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why people don&#x27;t just love this stuff! Maybe they are not using it correctly. I love this stuff.  I bought the thinner as well since the bottom half of the bottle does get clumpy. Just 2-3 drops of the thinner and it&#x27;s good as new.  Makes my nails look \\&quot;wet\\&quot; all the time. I&#x27;m not Girly by any means. My nails are the only \\&quot;Girly\\&quot; thing I do. This product is amazing plain and simple. I get 10-14 days out of a mani. I only ever HAVE to redo because of nail growth. I&#x27;m a cashier at a gas station, constantly washing my hands, handling money in the \\&quot;till\\&quot; (very hard on nails) and scrubbing stuff with scrubby pads, and other than the typical tip wear, I have no complaints.  I garden, go camping, shooting, cook clean and do dishes. The one small issue is it does contain big 3. If used with non big 3 polish, you will see some shrinkage. It&#x27;s not bad. I get compliments daily on my nails, people ask about the products I use, I always recommend this polish.  If you wait until your polish is dry (longer than 5 mins) you are not using it correctly and it will cause the entire nail to peel up in a solid sheet, or chip insanely.  That is operator error, not product fault.</li>
            <li> Amazing top coat. My manicure has lasted me for 8 days now and it&#x27;s barely starting to chip at the edges! :-O&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells terrible and the odor is very very strong. I recommend applying it outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label says something about causing child bearing problems. I&#x27;ll need to research that one... :(</li>
            <li> For the frequent flyer I am this is the miracle that makes my mani/pedi look great in 5mn flat! Apply it as the final top coat, wait a few minutes and you can actually go to bed and wake up with no marks or smudges on our nails! I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to try it out and it really works. Within 3 minutes my nails are completely dry and after 5 minutes I could bang my nails on anything and it wouldn&#x27;t leave any dent or scratch on my polish. I love this product. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this topcoat! I have a big problem with painting my nails, applying topcoat, and very soon after, for lack of a better word, smushing them. I always get mushy marks and fingerprints in my nails because even though they seem dry, they never quite harden. They stay soft underneath. But not with Seche Vite! After reading the reviews, I figured I&#x27;d have to try it for this price. By the time I got done applying the topcoat to my second hand, my first hand was absolutely and completely dry. As in, I could have done pretty much anything without messing them up. And it also made my polish so smooth, I love how it feels on top. Now, I can&#x27;t speak for how it helps with chipping, because even salon manicures don&#x27;t last longer than a week on my nails. But for drying time, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I use this product with my konad nail art and I have been very pleased with the durability and it doesn&#x27;t smudge during drying process. I use this in combination with a quick dry spray for the best and fastest results.</li>
            <li> This product goes above and beyond any other top coat I&#x27;ve used.  Dries in minutes and \\&quot;sets\\&quot; the color / under layers of nail polish.  No chipping, great, long lasting shine.  You will not be disappointed...... try it !</li>
            <li> Before I bought this product, I looked for reviews of fast dry clear coats.  Previously I had used Sally Hansen&#x27;s hard as nails line, which when dry, is very nice and helps with growing longer nails, but takes longer to dry than I am patient.  Invariably I&#x27;d do something once I thought the polish was dry, and end up smudging it.  So frustrating!  I was tired of smudges with every single color change or touch up, but then I read good stuff about this product.  Boy oh boy, it was all true, and then some!  It comes off the brush looking thick, but it glides onto the nail perfectly.  It DOES dry fast; very quickly your nails are dry to the touch.  I only had a tiny bit of trouble when I tried to put this product over really wet nail polish (don&#x27;t do that.)  Since it&#x27;s thick, it tends to drag on very wet polish.  If your polish has dried even a little, then it works fine.  Once in place, it does. not. smudge. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t prepared for what a gorgeous finish it puts on your nails:  high gloss, a thick but not too thick clear layer, smooth smooth smooth, and it even evened out some knubbly areas where my polish had clumped as it dried.  I think some people call those bubbles.  The Seche Vite top coat had the effect of softening any mistakes in the polish and letting the colored polish underneath flow into a more perfectly smooth layer.  A couple chips I had touched up with a complementary color, creating an ombre effect, and adding this top coat let the color edges soften into each other even better.  It looks fantastic -- like a salon effect.  I had one smudge that I pushed back into place, but without the topcoat it was blatently obvious I&#x27;d had an accident with half-wet half-dry polish.  Later in the day after putting this topcoat over it, you&#x27;d only know there had been a smudge if I pointed it out to you.  I love that.  Wow, who invented this stuff?  Give them an award!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d want to use a topcoat all the time, but when something makes your manicure look amazing, and makes doing it easier,  I&#x27;m sold.  Sold, sold, sold!  I&#x27;ll be a Seche Vite Dry Fast top coat user forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely worth the five bucks I spent.  Maybe worth more.  I am so glad I tried it.  Highly recommended.g makes your manicure look amazing, and makes doing it easier,  I&#x27;m sold.  Sold, sold, sold!

            <li> This stuff is AWESOME!  I used a base coat, two coats of polish and then promptly applied the product.  Had no issues with it wrinkling up as some users have mentioned.  Perhaps it&#x27;s the polish they were using?  All I can say is my polish was dry in no time flat - I did my nails not too long before I went to bed.  I was pleasantly surprised to awake with ZERO sheet lines on my nails.  They looked as fabulous as they did right after I painted them. Product leaves a wonderful shine - what an amazing deal for the price - this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I was in need of something fast drying because I just don&#x27;t have the patience to let my nails dry completely. Then all my hard work was in vain because I would completely destroy my polish. So when there was a little gift set of this top coat and a China Glaze color at my local Sally Beauty Supply... I immediately grabbed it. I had heard SO many rave reviews about it on YouTube. So now, let&#x27;s get to my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was debating whether or not I wanted to give it 3 or 4 stars. In the end I picked 4 because this stuff is magical in the sense that it dries in less than 2 minutes. The problem I had with it EVERY TIME I used it was that it would peel off. And not in a peel off all the polish kind of way.. The top coat peeled off the top layer of polish. My nails looked dull and disgusting. In less than 12 hours (this was over night) I went from perfect, shiny, colorful nails to dull, chipped nails. I do not understand why it does this. I never touch my cuticle or the side of my nails while painting so it shouldn&#x27;t have lifted off of my nail bed like it did. I have more luck with using just a clear glitter polish as a top coat. The last time I used Seche Vite.. my manicure lasted for 9 hours before several nails were missing polish. The polish I have on now has been on for 4 days, with just a China Glaze glitter polish on top, and there isn&#x27;t any chipping yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while I love the fast drying aspect of Seche Vite.... I&#x27;m so incredibly disappointed in the rest.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is the top dog of topcoats. There&#x27;s just nothing better. It&#x27;s the shiniest and helps my polish last the longest.</li>
            <li> It works just like it says it does which is exactly what every girl needs. It dries fast and let&#x27;s you go on with your day quickly. Once you have it, you won&#x27;t want to paint your nails without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and I bought it for 1/2 the amount they sell it at my local salon</li>
            <li> My favorite fast try top coat</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing top coat I have used in 50 years. I have washed dishes and did other chores without gloves and it&#x27;s here to stay. I bought 3 bottles. Love it. It does everything it claims to do.</li>
            <li> If I could give this more stars I definitely would! I do not put any other top coat on my nails anymore. This has been the greatest find for people who like to do their own nails. It leaves your nail polish looking extra shiny and it helps it dry super quick no matter how thick your nail polish is. Even after getting a professional manicure done I put this on top of it when I get home to make it look even better. Absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I had been hearing about this product for months, friends raved about how I \\&quot;needed\\&quot; to own this top coat. As someone who takes the time to sit down and do beautiful nails (stamps, art, jewels, tape) I really need an amazing top coat that seals everything in and keeps chips off. This is not that polish. Yes, it dries fast, but it is so thick and goopy that if you bang a nail at the wrong angle the whole nail of polish literally rips off. I am not a fan of this polish and I will keep looking for the perfect top coat.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite dries super fast, with a smooth glassy finish.  Before using this product, if i painted my nails 2 hours before bed, I would wake up with sheet marks on my nails.  Seche Vite helps to dry your nails to the base, and you won&#x27;t wake up with sheet marks.  I have recommended this product to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Great Product! I was skeptical at first, but if you do it right - as instructed then you can&#x27;t beat it. Don&#x27;t be stingy with it or you will have to re paint the nails from scratch. But if you do it right, and don&#x27;t drag it across the nail polish too much with too little, it&#x27;ll work like a charm. Totally worth the 5 bucks.</li>
            <li> This top coat isn&#x27;t 100% perfect, but it does what it claims. It dries CRAZY fast (hence e name...) and leaves my nails looking glossy and fresh for days. My girlfriends have all been asking me where I get my nails done and they&#x27;re surprised that I DIY it! Ive recommended it to all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint is that sometimes one of my nails will chip off in one big chunk, leaving me with a naked nail. I guess that happens because the top coat bonds so much to the polish? Also, be careful not to put your color on too thick or Seche Vite will dry in weird waves. Two to three regular coats are good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To minimize chipping I brush on a coat every couple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast this stuff dries my nails. You can literally fish around in your bag a couple minutes later. Buy with confidence!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a nail tech for three years. I&#x27;ve gone through many polish bottles and fast drying products. I have to say that this dry fast top coat is superb. As a top coat, I love it. The shine never dies and it prevents the color from chipping very well. A problem I&#x27;ve had with other top coats is that when my nails are bent, the nail polish will loosen and chip. This product does not give me that problem. I cannot get over how shiny this makes my nails look. The drying time for my nails is usually between five to eight minutes. I absolutely recommend this bottle to anyone.</li>
            <li> I used to mess up my home manicures before they dried. I love this top coat. It dries so fast that my manicures aren&#x27;t ruined minutes after I finish them. I also like the nice glossy finish. My manicures never last long because I use my hands a lot. I don&#x27;t think that this top coat has noticeably extended the life of my manicure beyond the initial application but I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li> Perfect top coat! Dries SO fast!</li>
            <li> Shiny and quick drying two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I went to a salon and they used this I loved it so I bought my own, still love it. I don&#x27;t care for the super strong smell but it does its job!</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite top coat ever. No matter what other brands or kinds I try, I always go back to this one. It gives the best gel-like high-shine finish that I love. It also dries fast, which is a big bonus! Definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it can start to thicken once you&#x27;re like halfway done, so you really do need to thin it out with the Seche Restore.  Also it occasionally, though rarely for me, causes your polish &amp;#34;peel off&amp;#34; - I only experienced this once, ever since I started using it a year or so ago. But I still love it regardless, I&#x27;m already on my 2nd bottle since.</li>
            <li> What took me so long to find you, Seche Vite?!?!?  This is a thick clear coat that makes my home-manis and pedis last 1 week as opposed to 2 days (even for a week on the beach!)  Forget the gel manicure, get the same look without the cost!</li>
            <li> I like this a lot ..dries very quickly only con is it does not leave nails super shiny. That is what&#x27;s missing!</li>
            <li> Product came very thick.  There is no way it will last through a few applications without being so thick it will not even brush on.</li>
            <li> Works great but polish becomes too thick after just a few uses</li>
            <li> This is the best topcoat I&#x27;ve ever used. It has a gorgeous glass-like finish, and dries to the touch in just a few minutes. The only problem is that it gets goopy, but any nail polish thinner (I use Beauty Secrets) should restore it to its original consistency.</li>
            <li> Came within a couple days of ordering. I love this nail polish and will never use another top coat. Dries quickly and lasts longer than any other top coat I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Best product ever...!!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says....dries fast. It is thick and has a strong odor, but I am sure that odor comes from the chemical that allows it to dry so quickly. Well worth it. but honestly if you want a extremely FAST drying top coat and it is not thick try NYC fast drying top coat from Walmart. the best I&#x27;ve used thus far</li>
            <li> Love this top coat, it makes nails shine!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect product</li>
            <li> MUST TRY!  I can&#x27;t believe that I am just discovering this product.  It serves as a top coat AND dries your nails instantly.  I ordered a few more bottles just to have on hand.  BEST EVER!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and adds shine and protection but not for to long. If you do housework ie dishes laundry and other things it slowly wears away. For the most part it&#x27;s a good product but the tips don&#x27;t last as long as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shine it adds is worth it if you make sure to get your housework done in advance. Buying online saves you a little and the free quite shipping was a plus.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is a necessity! Doesn&#x27;t matter how cheap, thin, or thick, your nail polish is, it will go on smoothly and dry within 5 minutes. And sometimes I just use it on my natural nails because it makes them smooth and protected. I&#x27;ve tried other top coats and this one works wonders, staying on for days and fighting to protect your nails from the world. Buy buy buy!</li>
            <li> I really like this top coat. It dries fast, and is by far the best on I&#x27;ve used. It does have an obnoxious smell, kind of like liquid rubber. However, on the back of the bottle there&#x27;s a warning that it contains a chemical known to cause birth defects, so I&#x27;m still not sure if it&#x27;s worth it...</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this but i can&#x27;t,my nail polish doesn&#x27;t last  one day :(  The Sally Hensen last longer for me,I just bought this one to try something different but it was a bad move.</li>
            <li> Awesome topcoat. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> This product may seem pricy, but is well worth its weight in gold, it completly dries your polish, and gives a great shine, also prolongs a mani.</li>
            <li> first a confession... I am a nailpolish junkie.  I love collecting polishes, change colors often and love doing home manicures.  I also enjoy salon manis.  I ordered this product after reading other reviews..... BUT before receiving it, I noticed my favorite salon that gives me bionic manis that last 1 full week are using THIS topcoat. I was very excited bc my polishes really last from that salon.  Then, I have used this at home for the past 2 self- manis.  This topcoat really works!!  It feels like a glossy superglue is coating my nails.  Make sure you smooth and buff rough edges of your nails, this topcoat wont save you if you are jagged!  Its not a miracle worker....but if you are smooth it will really do wonders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost may have a problem, bc I love changing colors and it will be hard to justify taking the polish off if its not chipped.  Also, I had a weak polish remover w me in a hotel, and it wouldnt take this off!!  I had to go buy another remover from the store...this stuff is so bionic it will stand up to a generic watered down remover!!  I plan to buy this forever.  End Story!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over how quickly these dry my nails! I actually paint my nails more. The only thing is that my nails will chip after a day or two so I haven&#x27;t quite mastered how to change that. But besides that, the win for me is being able to do whatever with my hands after waiting a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> This is seriously a must have. Throw a coat of this on? It dries SO QUICK!!! No more waiting 30 minutes before functioning in life again, worried you&#x27;ll ruin your nails, this here is the answer to all your nail prayers!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders on my dull looking polish!  I have salon nails without going to the salon!</li>
            <li> I read reviews and thought this would be a superior product. It does look very shiny and helps dry nails fast. Unfortunately it chipped very easily and by the next day it was chipping/peeling on on my nails.</li>
            <li> I just tried this product and am astounded at how well it works. I let my 2 coats of Butter London polish dry for about 2 minutes and then put on this top coat. I have never seen anything dry so fast! In under a minute, the top coat was completely dry--and with very little smell, either. It also dries the nail polish layers underneath. I am  not expecting to have any chipping with this manicure with a top coat of this quality.  I am SOLD!</li>
            <li> this has easily become a must have for my nails.  my sis told me about this product and it is the fastest drying top coat ever. it also leaves nail color looking bright and shiny.  great buy! love love love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried it ALL!  Nothing, has worked like this.  I&#x27;ve been looking for better no chip top coat from my current Sally Hansen Mega Shine. Mega shine is glossy but chips easily on my busy hands.  I ordered this and applied over deep green Essie polish and no kidding....six days later...not a chip!  I am a mom to boys and a small dog with hands that are constantly cleaning, sweeping, wiping etc...and no polish came off.  I even got a small snag in a nail and was able to file it down and the polish did not chip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding!</li>
            <li> I have probably used these 2-3 times since I bought it and it is already completely dried up.  Even when I add nail polish remover to try to thin it out, it is completely solid so nothing happens.  I have bought Seche Vite at a salon before and this has never happened.  I am very disappointed.  There is no way this is the real product.</li>
            <li> Works and does the job of speeding up the nail drying process.  It dries quickly and leaves a nice shine.  If you are in hurry and need a quick nail spruce up, Seche Vite is the way to go.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!!! One bottle lasted for almost a year. I just bought my 2nd bottle. Make your nails look like gel nails.</li>
            <li> Dries nails quickly and leaves an amazing shine.&lt;br /&gt;Peals and chips sometimes.</li>
            <li> The only reason this product gets two stars instead of one is because it left a beautiful shine to my nail with no nicks/scratches underneath the polish. Otherwise, it only deserves one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the package comes with a warning that the ingredients may cause birth defects and reproductive harm. NO shiny nail polish in the world is worth that risk! Second, the smell....Good Lord, it gave me a migraine! The main problem with this polish though is that is does no better than any cheap-y, generic top coat polish. Less than 24 hours after applying it, my nails were chipping like crazy. Within 2 - 3 days, the polish came off my nails in sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the type, not worth your money.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I purchased this item.  I am so disappointed that it started peeling off the second day.  Not sure if I have &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; nails or what the problem is, but I did clean nails well before applying polish.  Did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy to admit it, but I&#x27;m a nail polish junkie. We all have our vices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I have two nail polish racks full to the brim with 100 different shades of the same few pinks, grays, whites, and blacks. And topcoats galore. If any major brands make a topcoat, I have it. The UV gels, the shellac, the quick-dry, the long lasting. The no-UV gel, the &amp;#34;looks like gel&amp;#34;, I mean it. I havge them all. And Most tend to disappoint. Either the shine doesn&#x27;t last past one hand-washing or the chips start immediately, or it takes ten years to dry. Some are lumpy, some glittery....but this....this is my main squeeze. No matter how many times my ADD leads me astray, I always come back to Seche Vite, and so far I haven&#x27;t found anything else that consistently delivers mani after mani.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drying time is unreal, super fast, and super slick. Shine lasts for at least three days, and this is with a job that forces me to wash my hands twice as much as is normal. It&#x27;s rare I get a chip ort a chink in the armor unless I blatantly do something to cause it. To my fellow polish connoisseurs, this is the real deal. The low-key look of it might throw you off, we&#x27;re a glamour-loving bunch, but don&#x27;t judge this book by it&#x27;s cover. Seche Vite is king of topcoats.</li>
            <li> Great product. Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This is very good, but honestly you can find something similar (and maybe better) in Ulta beauty, in a brand called Essence &amp;#34;gel top coat&amp;#34; for $1.99!!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fast this stuff dries, I love it!!! No more waiting for your nail polish to dry, put a coat of this on and out the door you go!!!</li>
            <li> i love this stuff, i will never go back to not using a base and top coat. i use gelous base coat and this top coat with every manicure. i was used to painting my nails every other day, mostly because they start chipping, but this preserves it for much longer. sometimes cheaper nail polish will still chip faster, but this definitely extends the life of it. it also makes them very shiny. with some polishes the whole coat of polish will come off in one large piece! if it lasts about a week i sometimes do another coat on top to make it shinier again. there is a little shrinkage, so make sure you coat the whole nail. also it seems to yellow very fast with light colors like white and light pink, and also alters the color of my nude polish after a day or so. my nails have grown longer and stronger because this is thick and adds strength to my thin, peely nails. it gets thick as it gets old, i tried to thin it out with polish thinner but it didn&#x27;t work so i got a new one when i had about 1/4 left in my old bottle. this saves so much time, too, because u can put all your coats on that you need that might take hours literally to dry and it will definitely be dry in less than 20 minutes. every time. i even have put it on after a manicure polish at a salon because you can&#x27;t touch a thing after leaving there with out messing it up. good stuff :)</li>
            <li> I love it! Usually my manicure lasted about 4-5 days... after applying this product my mails didn&#x27;t chip at all ...</li>
            <li> Excellent top coat. Provides excellent coverage and protection for polish. Holds up well so polish lasts longer. I have purchased this product many times and it is the only top coat I have used in years.</li>
            <li> Best top coat out there! Dries quickly and provides just enough shine.</li>
            <li> I purchased Seche Vite because I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about it and it&#x27;s basically the go-to top coat for any nail enthusiast. However I&#x27;m not completely won over. While it&#x27;s fast drying ability is outstanding, I can&#x27;t get over  the shrinkage effect. It makes your coat of nail polish shrink to create a visible white space with no polish on the tip of the nail. I have heard that this is a side effect of using fast drying top coat over very thickly applied polish but I&#x27;ve tested this by using the Seche Vite over a very thin layer of polish and it still did it. So if you&#x27;re in a hurry and aren&#x27;t a perfectionist then this is definitely a really great top coat to use. But I just can&#x27;t stand the shrinkage!</li>
            <li> I like seche vite for the thickness &amp; it really helps strengthen my nails.  However, it pulls back &amp; shrinks after it dries completely.  It makes the polish near the nail bed look cracked when it shrinks &amp; the tips end up looking worn.  I bought Out the Door to replace this.</li>
            <li> this is the best top coat i have found. not only does it dry super fast but it is really shiny!</li>
            <li> I usually get my nails done. in the past, if i did them myself, i would always mess them up before they got a chance to dry. i bought this figuring i&#x27;d try and see how fast it dries and maybe save some money on manicures. it was GREAT! i did my nails just 15 min before leaving the house to go on a date and by the time i got to my destination, they were completely dry and super shiny! alot of times you think your nails are dry on top but underneath they are still soft and u get a dent or a sheet imprint. not with this stuff! highly recommend seche vite!</li>
            <li> I came across Seche Vite in a nail art blog. The author highly recommended it, so I searched the Net and learned that many nail artists recommend this product. So, I ran out and bought a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is ok. It dries polish almost immediately and has a lovely high-shine finish. However, it doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of protecting from chips and peels. On the first day, I did my nails in the morning and by nighttime, after my nightly hot shower, my polish had already begun to peel.&lt;br /&gt;My major issue is with the packaging. The neck of the bottle is super thin. I made the mistake of leaving my bottle on the coffee table and my 2-year-old knocked it over when she was playing. The neck snapped off completely, leaving a miserable mess on our coffee table and a crappy chemical odor that wouldn&#x27;t go away. We ended up throwing away the coffee table.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this was just a fluke. Perhaps not all bottles of SV are this flimsy, but I&#x27;m not sure I want to find out.</li>
            <li> I puchased this after a friend told me about how well it works and I love it. My nail polish lasts so much longer now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a lot of nail tutorials that people made on Youtube that uses and talk about how amazing&lt;br /&gt;this topcoat is. So I went here to go buy it so I can try it out myself. While it was shipping I&lt;br /&gt;ended up buying a couple different top coats brands to experiment but they we&#x27;re too great.&lt;br /&gt;I was definitely impressed with the outcome of this fast dry top coat and is worth it for this price!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product.I would use it again,hopefully my nails will improve......hands looking good,yippeee!!!can show off fingers with my rings.....Happy.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I have EVER used. It completely dries my nails in 10 minuntes. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of a recommendation from a friend after I had complained about how long my nail polish took to dry. Seche Vite dries incredible fast! I would say within about 5 minutes. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as the Sally Hansen top coat that I was using before, however it&#x27;s still pretty durable.</li>
            <li> While the product did dry quickly, it peeled off my nails next day! I am so disappointed by my purchase.</li>
            <li> Was shipped super fast; arrived a couple days before the estimated arrival date! Love this top coat, would buy again in a heart beat. :)</li>
            <li> Seriously it dries super fast and leaves a long lasting shine too! If my nails ever start to chip  I just put another coat on and im good for a few more days too :) I searched for so long for a good top coat and this is truly one of the best. I recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best top coat I have ever used. I&#x27;m not big into using topcoats, but after using this one, I&#x27;ll use it all of the time. It&#x27;s a good quality and it prevents my nail polish from chipping. Putting this on my OPI nail polishes definitely helps prevent my nails from chipping for about 4 extra days. :)</li>
            <li> I continue to buy t his awesome product. I can do my nails and literally go to bed and not wake up with bed nails.</li>
            <li> I bought this clear coat nail polish because I am learning how to do acrylic nails, it came in pretty quick, within a week. The reason I only give it 3 starts is it peels off REALLY BAD. :/ sucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a top coat that dried this fast and the polish looks so shiny.  The smell is pretty strong and my manicure did chip after a few days.  That&#x27;s the only down side.  I would buy it again though.</li>
            <li> I kept hearing about this top coat as a &amp;#34;HG&amp;#34; (holy grail) product, but never bothered to pick it up because I felt obligated to finish up the previous bottle (Sally Hansen Dries Instantly 30 Second Top Coat). I finally added this to my cart to get free shipping, and it is AMAZING. The old bottle is still 2/3 full but it&#x27;s going straight into the trash, because the Seche Vite actually does the job in the promised time, and leaves my nails feeling like they were professionally done! It dries so, so quickly and leaves a smooth, even finish.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat.  It is thick, like a gel, and really protects my nails.  Manicure lasts at least 10 days.</li>
            <li> Makes my polish stay on longer &amp; looks nice and shiney, I will be purchasing another bottle, as soon as this one, run out.</li>
            <li> I am loving this top coat; it really does wonders to the hardest drying nail polish. I am never going back to a regular top coat.</li>
            <li> I often shy away from doing extensive designs on my nails because the length of time it would take afterwards drying them.  I have to wait a minimum of an hour and even then it will streak or smudge depending on the activity I am doing.  I heard about this product and saw the reviews on it.  I decided to buy it and see if its as good as it says.  It&#x27;s better!!!  It leaves my manicures super shiny and it dries so fast that by the time I am finished applying the coat to all my fingers I can touch my nails without messing up the manicure.  I am in love.  I will have to stock up.  A must have for anyone who paints their nails!!</li>
            <li> I really like the top coat. The only problem is the fumes.. When you&#x27;re putting it on I would recommend doing so by a window or outside.</li>
            <li> I love painting my nails almost to the point of obsession. I keep my nails to just a bit longer than my fingertips, and I&#x27;m pretty rough on them so I typically get a lot of tip wear and then the dreaded chip-n-peel. Then again, I typically spend less than $5 per nail polish but I&#x27;ve noticed that even salon brands chip pretty quickly on me. I hate going to salons because their manicures actually chip faster than the ones I do myself. While my polish is drying, I&#x27;ll often look online at other nail polishes to try to plan my next mani. I&#x27;ve read so much about Seche Vite on various nail blogs and I knew I had to try it. When it first arrived, I was so excited I put a coat over the pinky nail of a day&#x27;s old manicure (Wet n wild quick dry black, topped with Sally Hansen HD Byte, LCD, DVD, and some generic clear. It looked awesome and I regret not taking a picture). I did not notice any chipping, peeling, shrinking, or anything other than quick-drying CRAZYSHINE on the pinky nail, while my other nails continued degrading as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I decided to do a fresh mani with Brucci Gianna&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Blue. I put 2 coats of the color over some generic dollar store clear coat, and I got distracted for a few minutes so I did not apply the Seche Vite to fresh, wet nails. They were sort of tacky I guess by the time I put the top coat on so they weren&#x27;t exactly wet or dry. I put two coats of the Seche on and my nails seemed instantly dry, I thought it was too good to be true, but after five or ten minutes I was able to rummage through my purse, pick eye goops out of my dog&#x27;s eyes, and then wash my hands (because eww, eye goops). Then my friends wanted to go out for late night munchies and I was able to function without screwing up my nails. No nicks, no bumps, no smudges, no bubbles. Totally awesome. I woke up this morning and there weren&#x27;t any sheet marks either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t been 24hrs yet so I can&#x27;t say anything about the longevity of this top coat but it certainly looks nice. I can&#x27;t wait to try it over a glittery nail polish!</li>
            <li> I was recommended to use this by my fellow nail obsessed friends. Not going to lie, I don&#x27;t love it but I don&#x27;t hate it either. I think I&#x27;ll just stick to my regular O.P.I or ORLY top coat. It does harden the nail but I don&#x27;t like the whole I have to wrap the end of my nails or how it pushes the color away from the cuticle. But if that stuff doesn&#x27;t matter to you, then yes it definitely does it&#x27;s job of keeping the color on for a like time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great - it does what it says it does, which is dry your nails FAST! It truly is amazing how fast my nails are mess-proof, it probably takes less than a minute and I am good to go... I can wash dishes if I want to and I don&#x27;t have to worry! I love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat ever!  It is worth every penny.  Dries fast and has a gel-like finish and shine.  Will never use anything else!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite top coat. Fast drying, clear. I have used it for years and can&#x27;t find anything I like better than this!</li>
            <li> The only reason this doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t stay super shiny for longer than a day or 2.  I bought this because I wanted the shellac look at home with easier removal, and it definitely looks like a shellac manicure.  I have gotten compliments on my nails with this top coat.  I think the negative reviews comes from the nail color brand differing, I have not had a chipping issue or a whole nail peeling off.  Using this top coat has made my color stay on for over a week with no chips or peels.  I use Essie brand nail polish exclusively and it works really well with the Seche top coat.  It also dries and hardens in much less than time than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note that this is a really thick top coat, so you have to make sure you cover the entire nail or else the part you miss will show obviously and only that part chips off quickly.  It also has a strong odor, so it&#x27;s good to use it in a well ventilated space.</li>
            <li> FAST drying! Love this!</li>
            <li> Seche Vite top coat does go on smooth and dries very fast, but it does chip after a few days, but overall it is a better top coat than a few others that I have used in the past. Will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different top coats - and this is the best! Nails are super shiny, and dry in 30 seconds. A truly superior product.</li>
            <li> I am hard on my nails and not patient enough to wait for them to dry completely before going on with my day, so this product is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t read the directions and I didn&#x27;t use enough, but my nails still dried in record time, but they chipped after a day or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the directions (always important) and letting the drop form at the end of the brush before brushing it on, my nails have lasted days, even though the nail color I used is one that is notoriously flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like having one of those expensive gel manicures without the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true. This is the best top coat out there. It makes my nails hard, shiny and close to flawless for the bulk of a week. Even then, it&#x27;s only one or two nails that need to be redone. It&#x27;s truly a &#x27;miracle&#x27; for at home nail doers.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Painted it on my wet nails and it dried them perfectly without nicks or smudges. So happy with this purchase! Can I give it 6 stars!?!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat! You will NEVER want to use anything but this product. It gives a glass finish and a shine that won&#x27;t quit. Feels great too!</li>
            <li> Perfect for doing nails when in a hurry. Leaves them thick and super shiny, I have received lots of compliments when using this!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by an nail polish diva. Sorry I wanted to like it but my polish just kept peeling off in chunks. This never happened with my old topcoat.</li>
            <li> drys my nails in 5-10 minutes when usually it would take hours, literally.</li>
            <li> This is a great top that dries fast. I don&#x27;t know if it extends the life of my polish (even with a base coat) and wish it dried shinier, but do like it, have used it for a few years, and will continue to use it (unless I found one that dries much shinier).  I&#x27;ve seen magazines give it good reviews.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite Dry Fast totally rocks.  It makes my polish dry fast so I can get on with my busy life.  I was really impressed with the reviews before I bought it and I can see why.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat. It dries superbly fast and will even dry your old nail polish! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super hard, so far the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;m reordering it now for myself and friends. This is an awesome gift.</li>
            <li> It peels off as soon as you put it on.</li>
            <li> It dries fast and works great!</li>
            <li> Shipping was on time and packaged good, nail polish just wasn&#x27;t what I expected though. It chips very easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. Didn&#x27;t fall in love. My nails actually chip faster with this.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is by far THE BEST top coat I’ve ever used. I manicure my nails at home and use the Seche Vite top coat and Seche Clear base coat with a variety of nail polish brands like Essie, OPI, Orly and even Sally Hansen - all with fabulous, long-lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to dedicate about 3 hours every 3 days to maintain my OPI base and top coat manicure, and more time with other brands. I was so frustrated that I bought a UV lamp and started doing gel color to get a longer-lasting manicure. The process destroyed my nails after a few weeks and it was super expensive. Now, I only spend about an hour once a week (give or take a few days) and they always look great! And, it adds a layer of strength to my nails that I’ve only ever gotten from a gel manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Seche Vite top coat is made to work with the Seche Clear base coat - they create a bond with the color in between. I apply a thin coat of the base, wait a few minutes so it is still a bit tacky, then put on 1-2 coats of color. After the color has set, but not dried completely, I apply Seche Vite. The top coat firms up almost immediately so I don’t have to worry about messing it up with light activity, and after 20-30 minutes, I continue with my normal activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve tried the top coat without the base coat and though it still looks great, I’m convinced the base+top coat combo is the key. My manicures last around 7-10 days, and even come out unscathed after scrubbing a bathroom or digging in the dirt. And, if the color starts to look dull, I apply another top coat to shine it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a strong odor because it does contain toluene, so make sure you aren’t using these in a tiny, enclosed space. The good thing is, the smell doesn’t linger. Also, as you get down to the lower half of the bottle, it becomes thicker - it’s still usable and I get the same results, but I have purchased the refill size to top it off and maintain the consistency for easier application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve also included a photo of my nails after day 8. You can see a little flaking on the side of my middle and index fingers, and the color (Essie Mojito Madness) is a little dull, but still looks good!r /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve also included a photo of my nails after day 8. You can see a little flaking on the side of my middle and index fingers, and the color (Essie Mojito Madness) is a little dull, but still looks good!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this top coat! My new favorite. When i&#x27;m in a rush but need to paint my nails, this helps them to dry very fast to where I can grab things without my nails smudging. If you are looking for a top coat that prevents your polish from chipping or peeling off than this isn&#x27;t for you because I find that my nail polish does still chip and peel, but hey, the price is good.</li>
            <li> Love love love this top coat! Dries super fast. The only negative is that it will smear your matte polishes .</li>
            <li> found it to be okay , it doesn&#x27;t shine like I would like but it does dry my nails fast and that is most important to me</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says . Quick drying. I use alone at times not only as a topcoat.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shine that I have yet to find in any other top coat. Dries ridiculous fast. Only gripe is that the polish itself gets thick fast and it needs Seche Restore to thin it back to the appropriate thickness. But I&#x27;ll still buy this over and over and over.</li>
            <li> Best topcoat I have ever used.Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Best top coat in the world!!!  I HIGHLY recommend this polish, has amazing shine and dries super fast!</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is in a class by itself, as most polish fans already know. Thick, clear, and incredibly fast-drying, it&#x27;s worth the price. Period.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally listen to reviews on products of any kind to make a decision but based on the fact that there are a million and one different quick dry top coats I thought it wise to do a little research before shelling out however much money my chosen TC would be and Seche Vite always seemed to be the top runner in top coats. So after some time I finally got a bottle of it and I absolutely loved it at first, the shine is gorgeous and the drying time is fantastic especially when you are painting your nails while your 15 month old takes a nap. But after several destroyed manicures later I am fed up and I decided I hate Seche Vite. It has some good qualities yes but My nails ALWAYS chip the same day heck I have had them chip a couple hours after painting them and its not like I am re-grouting my bathroom to get chips like that on a fresh manicure and I always get major shrinkage. This product may work for some, but I am starting to see so many unsatisfied people. I say forgo the Seche Vite and invest in some good old Sally Hansen quick dry topcoat or the Diamond shine topcoat it works really well too it may not dry as fast but its pretty dang quick. Plus both of those choices will make much less of a dent in your wallet.</li>
            <li> Excellent top coat to give your nails that professional look and keep them looking good.</li>
            <li> After I found this top coat, I will never buy another top coat again. This top coat is AMAZING. Even so, I broke it down into a pros and cons list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS -&lt;br /&gt;-Extremely fast drying, fastest I&#x27;ve ever seen, left hand would be dry by the time I&#x27;m done with right hand.&lt;br /&gt;-Extremely shiny/polished look, won&#x27;t ever be dull&lt;br /&gt;-Can use for a really long time (especially if you combine it with Seche Restore)&lt;br /&gt;-Long lasting, won&#x27;t chip especially if you use in combination with high quality nail polishes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS -&lt;br /&gt;-Sometimes a thick coat, but it&#x27;s not too big of a deal since when it dries you can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s thick at all&lt;br /&gt;-Dries up quickly if you keep the cap off for too long, hence becoming thick, and leaving a thick coat (again not a problem if you use Seche Restore)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend to buy!! It&#x27;s definitely worth it for the price. Besides, a whole bottle lasts me for 9-12 months, and I change my polishes a LOT!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see what all the hype is about. My nails chipped in less than a day, and i&#x27;m not hard on my nails. Dried fast but so does my polish. Not very glossy, it looked old within a day. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the fastest drying top coat I have ever purchased! No more smeared nails... It is very shiny also.</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever! i paint my nails often.. have tried many top coats and none compare to this one. leaves your nails feeling strong and thick. dries super fast. even when applying alot of product. will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Best top coat out there. Better than gel.</li>
            <li> Normally when I put on a top coat it takes forever to dry and I wake up with indents in my nails that chip the next day, Seche vite prevents this and dries extremely fast! LOVE IT! Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Nothing dries faster than this top coat.  Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I watch way too many YouTube videos and I see a lot of beauty guru&#x27;s raving about this top coat so I bought it. My initial thought was &amp;#34;How can this be any different than any other top coat?&amp;#34; I WAS WRONG. It is very thick which works great to make your nails shine and your designs looks professional. It dries in less than 10 minutes which is great! I was using Sephora&#x27;s Top coat which took like 20 minutes to dry. No matter how thick the dots are or how thick your polish is for a design in dries in 10-15 minutes, which is a plus. This is my new go to top coat, I won&#x27;t be using anything other than this.</li>
            <li> It is expensive. But wow. I cannot imagine not having it on hand. I don&#x27;t feel there is a point to painting my nails or attempting any nail art or embellishments without this. It truly is fast drying and it lasts a good long while and takes a beating. Have not had anything that has worked as well so I will spend the money.</li>
            <li> I do not know what all the hype is about this stuff. It works great at first, dries fast &amp; is shiny, but, it shrinks on your nails, pulling the polish away from the edges of your nail. Then once you get to half a bottle, it gets so thick it is unusable, Not even restore will fix it. I had to throw away half of a bottle. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I must tell this, i am 66 and have had long nails since i was 10. I do my own nails had a mani once and took it off and redid. This topcoat is so smooth and shiney. The best in over 50yrs. Now to see how it wears. I know nails this is my new topcoat! HAPPY!</li>
            <li> I do my own nails, along with friends, and this polish makes my manicures last much longer than I was used to. It glides on so smoothly and adds a beautiful shine, I would recommend this to anybody who paints their nails regularly.</li>
            <li> A wise woman once said, &amp;#34;A woman is only helpless while she waits for her nail polish to dry.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, between you and me, I don&#x27;t like to be helpless...EVER. It&#x27;s because of this that I decided to look into a top coat that could dry my nails in less than 5 minutes. That&#x27;s when I came across Seche Vite. I researched this top coat extensively before I decided to go ahead and purchase it. I was so excited when it arrived, but unfortunately, I was quite disappointed in the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seche Vite leaves a beautiful, mirror-like gloss on top of your nails, which is absolutely fabulous, and it DOES dry your nails within 5 minutes or less. HOWEVER, the product states that it will &amp;#34;absolutely not chip.&amp;#34; Okay, so, to be technical, they weren&#x27;t lying. Seche Vite will NOT chip, but it will PEEL like a friggin&#x27; banana. While I love the way that it makes my nails look, it&#x27;s useless when the top coat peels off (along with the nail polish underneath) over the course of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend this product unless you&#x27;re only looking for a beautiful, glossy look for an hour---and even then, there are no guarantees.</li>
            <li> Best, fastest drying top coat ever!!</li>
            <li> This is the best top-coat. I kept seeing folks recommend it but it wasn&#x27;t until I tried that I realized how great it is. Always lasts a couple of days, if not more.</li>
            <li> This topcoat is my current obsession! By the time I&#x27;m done applying over my freshly painted nails... they are completely dry! It also helps to prolong my at-home manicures... No chipping for at least a week! Two times, different manicurists asked if I had gotten gel manicures!! I have recommended it to all my friends, too.</li>
            <li> People ask me all the time where I have my nails done. I tell them I do them myself and the secret is Seche Vite. Three coats of polish, and two coats of Seche Vite an hour before bedtime, after everything is done for the night. Smooth, perfect nails every time.</li>
            <li> My nails have never been the same!!!!!!!!!!! I love the shine from this polish and fast shipping too!!! This polish is a must have for anyone that likes to design their nails.</li>
            <li> As far as top coats go on a regular manicure this is great.  It isn&#x27;t shellac...but if you are just doing regular polish, this will definitely help.  Just be sure to apply polish around tips to seal in color.  My color will last three or four days versus one day and chipped without it. Also speeds up drying time.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail polish top coat of all time. Drys just as fast as it says it will. worth it.</li>
            <li> The glass of  top nail coat  was  totally broken when I receive the product. There is nothing left in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I think this chips easier than my opi top coat but it doesnit take FOREVER to dry, so I use it for quick manis and to reseal the top coat every couple of days.  Great product.</li>
            <li> It dries fast, make the nails shiny and easy to remove.&lt;br /&gt;Only con is that you must seal it well after every use - or the liquid becomes to thick to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle of SV now, and it is definitely the fastest drying topcoat out there. Within seconds, your nails are okay to touch lightly and within an hour they&#x27;re solid. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve never been able to finish a bottle of SV - a quarter of the way into the bottle, the polish begins turning gummy, and by the half bottle mark, it&#x27;s more like spreading gluey paste onto my nails than painting with polish. I always end up throwing half the bottle away. Plus the smell is AWFUL and there is definitely a shrinkage issue with this polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to love this for the fast dry time, but ultimately I don&#x27;t think it outweighs the cons. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to buy another bottle of this.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappionted!</li>
            <li> Looks shiny and dried fast. But it literally peels off in one big sheet after maybe 1 day of wear. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this top coat! It dries superfast!</li>
            <li> My daughters and I have been using this for years.  It really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many different top coats and I always come back to SV. It self-levels into a glassy, shiny, perfectly smooth layer every time. It can smooth out textured glitter, nail art and rhinestones. It dries to the touch in one minute and it completely hard in less than 10 minutes. I&#x27;ve never found a top coat that dries faster than that. I can paint my nails before bed, add a coat of SV, and my nails are dry before I drift off to sleep and I don&#x27;t wake up with sheet marks or smudges!! The only downside is that it sometimes reacts weird with certain polishes resulting in what is known as &amp;#34;shrinkage.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve never had much problem with shrinkage but many people have. The only time I&#x27;ve noticed it is with chunky glitter polishes. The other problem with it is that if you shower in hot water, it sometimes reacts weird to it and the polish peels off in whole sheets. You just have to be careful not to pick at your nails in the shower or right after. It goes back to its normal hardness after about 20 minutes of being out of the shower. I&#x27;ve just gotten used to it so it doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore. Its even convenient that you can just peel your polish off in the shower if you were planning on removing your polish anyway. Also if you&#x27;re a &amp;#34;picker&amp;#34; like me and enjoying peeling it off.  But the first time it happens, it can be frustrating. But it only effects certain polishes. The smell takes some getting used to. I&#x27;ve found some people can&#x27;t stand it and some people don&#x27;t mind it. Its a very strong chemical smell. I don&#x27;t mind it but my roommate in college hated the smell. I&#x27;m sure the chemicals in it will probably effect me in the long run since I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years, but I don&#x27;t really care. I&#x27;ve bought so many bottles of this stuff I&#x27;ve lost track. This is THE only top coat in my opinion. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> For once, my reading comments has paid off. This is the best top coat I have ever used! It provides a brilliant shine and literally protects your nail polish. My polished nails last about 5-7 days with this top coat. When I used Orly Won&#x27;t Chip I would get about 2-4 days of wear, if I was lucky. This also dries your nails in about 3 minutes if you use a UV lamp. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I can actually get stuff done righ after doing my nails! I don&#x27;t have to weight minutes for my nail polish to dry, this top coat dries fast and leaves a beautiful shine. The smell is the only thing that bothers me, is a bit too strong.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s super shiny and dries incredibly fast.  I used to use the Essie Quick Dry. This is far less expensive and works just as well.  I will continue to order this.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with using this top coat. Really smooths out my polish and leaves a great shine. Totally recommend.</li>
            <li> Best top coat...EVER!  My polish dries super, super fast, if I use this top coat over it.  It shines and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews about Seche Vite before I ordered and used it, so I was well-prepared for shrinkage, peeling, and strong odor. I applied the Seche Vite while my nail polish was still wet and found it absolutely EASY to apply. It seems thick going on but dries flawlessly smooth and brilliantly shiny. It dries my manicure so quickly that I am able to get back to work immediately -- yes, immediately. I run a small farm with organic garden and free-range chickens, so I don&#x27;t have time to sit around waiting for polish to dry. In fact, you&#x27;d think that nail polish would be a frivolous luxury for someone in my line of work. Indeed, it would be but for SECHE VITE! I can have great-looking nails and still spend entire days outdoors with my hands in the dirt. Thank you Seche Vite, you have changed my life. P.S. Not one bit of excess shrinkage or peeling, but yes, the odor is strong and does linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want also to comment on some of the \\&quot;cons\\&quot; several reviewers mentioned. PEELING: it doesn&#x27;t peel at all. If someone is having a problem with peeling, they&#x27;re doing something wrong. EXCESSIVE SHRINKING: it does shrink a little, so you have to take precautions. That said, a little shrinking can be anticipated and planned for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE GREAT HINT: Use China Glaze Strong Adhesion Base Coat as your first coat on clean nails. Follow with your color polish. Then paint on ANOTHER coat of China Glaze Strong Adhesion Base Coat followed immediately by the Seche Vite. You will get the greatest, most long-lasting manicure EVER!</li>
            <li> I had this top coat a long time ago but only used it a couple of times before my sister took it. So I decided to give it another try recently. I usually don&#x27;t use top coats that often so I&#x27;m not sure if this is a phenomenon of all top coats, or if it&#x27;s reacting with the nail polish that I use. While it dries quickly, it leaves some &amp;#34;bubbly&amp;#34; patches on my nails, which are rather unsightly. Also, after a day or so, I noticed that some of the edges of the top coat was lifting off of the nail polish. All in all, I&#x27;m still on the hunt for the perfect top coat. This suffices in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Works fast just like it says.  I even ordered one for a friend.  It is the best quick dry I have ever used and cheaper on amazon then stores.</li>
            <li> Like my title suggests, I love how fast it dries my nail polish. However after I did more research on it I found out that it contains Toluene :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it&#x27;s not as glossy as I want a top coat to be, after finishing this bottle I might go back to Essie good-to-go</li>
            <li> I buy this a lot as it is affordable and works.  Unlike other quick dry top coats I&#x27;ve tried, you use this while polish is still wet and it dries fairly quickly.  It occasionally gets thick on me, but like I do with my polishes, I simply use a few drops of polish thinner until it&#x27;s the right consistency again, no problem.  I polish my nails rather frequently so usually need to buy this once a month or so.  I have used other brands that didn&#x27;t dry as fast as i needed it to and smudged.  So has this but this usually happens if my polish or this is getting too thick so I try to keep both from getting too thick before using.  Great seller too, buy the way.  Received quickly and in good, new condition.  Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for when you are in a rush. Even when my color is not dry yet I can use this top coat and my nails are dry in seconds.I mean less than 15. It is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I will never use another topcoat!! I&#x27;ve never had a top coat as wonderful as this..I&#x27;m almost due for a new bottle!!</li>
            <li> Dries to the touch super fast, it&#x27;s a perfect thickness so it protects against chipping wonderfully. It takes about half an hour to an hour to dry completely (if you bump a nail, you make mess it up, but if it&#x27;s a light bump, it evens itself out pretty well! If you add an extra coat on top if you mess up a nail, it makes it like it never happened--as long as you didn&#x27;t seriously screw it up!)&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this stuff, showed it to my friend who is going to the Paul Mitchell school, and she said it was amazing! I recommend it to EVERYONE! and getting it for $5? HECK YES!&lt;br /&gt;Shipped a day early too!</li>
            <li> Why is this the top selling nail polish?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry quickly at all. It smudged and chipped immediately, and has no shine. I wish I never bought this crap.</li>
            <li> Very nice stain finish. Drys insanely fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator brush is also very nice. Look no further than Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever if you like shine. Protects nails and polish. Very glossy. Have used this for years and would use nothing else.</li>
            <li> I use to always use the OPI top coat, but this one is so much better. It&#x27;s cheaper and protects my nails better. When I accidentally touch my nails on cloth, it doesn&#x27;t get imprinted with the material&#x27;s texture like usual. Love this! Definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> dries fast and leaves a great shine for days. I use this over all of my nail polishes and am always satisfied.</li>
            <li> I do my manicures at home and I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at it. Mix this with a good polish and you&#x27;re good to go. I usually paint my nails dry them in front of my fan. And then when they&#x27;re mostly dry Ill do 2 coats of this. I counted the days and one time I went up to 2 weeks with minimal chips. Planning on getting the seche vite nail polish restorer to bring back some old polishes to life and maybe a base coat if they have one. Only downside is that it has a strong smell but, worth it. Buy This!</li>
            <li> Read a few reviews on the product, was really excited about ordering the product esp for the price amazon was selling it for. the first use of the product i found i was applying the polish incorrectly, the polish is to be applied while the color polish is wet. The next day the polish began to chip....so dissapointed :(</li>
            <li> I like the top coat nail dry &amp; use it when I get a mani or pedi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes- I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite top coats!  I use it for almost ALL my nail designs.  It finishes your nails off with a shiny &amp; smooth coat.  A lot of salons use this &amp; I would really recommend this!</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and provides a lasting glossy shine. Even through daily washing of dishes and light yard work. Will definitely be a staple in my manicures from now on.</li>
            <li> I had read excellent things about this top coat online, and am so glad I decided to purchase it! In this case, you get what you pay for which is an amazing product! I always have had problems with my nail polish getting dings in it just minutes after painting, but with Seche Vite, my nail polish is completely hard in 4 minutes, just like the bottle promises! I was able to go and wash my hands 5 minutes after applying the Seche Vite and my nails still looked absolutely perfect! The glazed look you get on the top of your nails will make almost any manicure look fabulous and feel smooth! Again, this is a must have for any nail polish user!</li>
            <li> I did some research and found that this top coat has some of the highest reviews, and I can see why! It dries super fast and leaves a very shiny/glossy finish (if you don&#x27;t like super shiny, don&#x27;t get this). It saves a lot of time that I would be wasting sitting around waiting for my nail polish to dry. The only downside that I&#x27;ve found is that although it dries extremely quickly, if you have multiple layers of polish underneath, those layers do not dry. Seche vite just puts a protective coating above it all, but it still takes time for the bottom layers to solidify (so if you were to push down on your nail after you put on Seche Vite, not polish would come off, but there would be a dent). I still gave this top coat 5 stars since I don&#x27;t believe it promises drying the bottom layers, just the top, and it does a great job of that.</li>
            <li> This is the only top coat I have used for the last two years. It adds a great shine and helps keep the polish on much longer than most other top coats that I have used.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product. It dries very quickly, and is a durable top coat. I will definitely purchase this again in the future. :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of all the Rave reviews from the regular bloggers i follow. I do like it because it dries quickly, but i dont see anything particularly amazing about the product. Nails still chip after 2 or 3 days, and the high gloss finish isnt as glossy as the company would like you to believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NONE of which is at the fault of the seller. Great price, reasonable shipping time, packaged and delivered safely. Definitely a great buy if this is something you would want to try. Will buy from seller again!</li>
            <li> This item is great and is one of the best top coats I have found. I&#x27;ve used it a few times and its wonderful.</li>
            <li> This top coat dries super quick and its super shiny. I only use one coat of it so it doesnt last as long as i thought it would, maybe with a second coat it would make your nail polish last longer, but i love it regardless.</li>
            <li> Every time I paint my nails I end up smudging at least one because I am not patient enough to sit still long enough for them to dry completely. Every. Single. Time. I heard about this top coat on a YouTube channel and figured I would give it a try. It literally dries my nails in seconds and leaves them shiny and strong! Depending on the nail polish you use under it the manicure can last 5-7 days without chipping. I am floored by this stuff! The smell kind of smells like spray paint almost, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming and won&#x27;t stink up your house and dissipates once it&#x27;s dry. I will definitely repurchase this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seche vite guys. Excellent, super fast, super shiny topcoat!</li>
            <li> Smells strong but it dries quickly</li>
            <li> I will never use another Top Coat... this stuff dries insanely fast, and makes your nails so shiny! I&#x27;ve always had problems with my nail polish peeling &amp; chipping within one day of application, but when I add this top coat, the paint lasts a good 3-4 days. It&#x27;s great stuff! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Good topcoat and definitely lives up to its claim of fast drying. Even over thick layers of nail polish color, this dries in minutes and I can be completely functional and go about my business in about 15-20 minutes. You can even go to sleep without worrying about sheet marks. Works great on pedicures during the winter too, you can slip your feet into shoes without worrying about smudging your toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shine and finish is excellent, glossy and beautiful. My only gripe is the lasting power, it seems to shrink the polish a bit and I usually get chips at the tips around day 2 or 3. But that&#x27;s a characteristic that most fast dry top coats have, so I&#x27;m not complaining too much. A must have for those who like to change nail polish often.</li>
            <li> Seche is a cult classic in the nail world, so I was excited to try it.  I generally use higher end polishes like Butter London, OPI, China Glaze, Zoya, and others, but have a busy schedule that makes doing my nails a trial without quickdry topcoat.  As a result, I&#x27;ve tried many on the market.  I&#x27;d place Seche Vite in the upper middle end compared to others I have used.  For me, the cons outweigh its pros, so it is not my go-to topcoat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Dries very quickly - its definitely faster than other topcoats on the market.  I however do think that this is a double edged sword and is likely a contributor to the drawbacks I experienced.&lt;br /&gt;- Has a high glass shine.  This shine lasts as long as the topcoat does, which is definitely a plus.&lt;br /&gt;- Can be found for a reasonable price if you know where to look - online and small shops tend to be much more realistic than major retailers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The shrinkage is awful.  The topcoat&#x27;s underwear seems to matter very little in the outcome here.  Nothing feels worse than topping a flawless application and having it look cracked and sloppy because of the topcoat.&lt;br /&gt;- Cracks often are visible in a couple of days.  While this is unnoticable on dark colours, it can really detract from a light or bright colour.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve had only a couple of instances where use of this topcoat has not resulted in significant peeling.  This frequent peeling makes subsequent chips large and very difficult to repair.  By a couple of days in, I&#x27;ve had half of a nail peeling off, usually more than one.  This is much worse on my flatter nails.&lt;br /&gt;- This is an extremely smelly topcoat.&lt;br /&gt;- Personally, I think that when I purchase a product that I should be able to get full use of it without the requirement of purchasing an additional product.  Before reaching even halfway into the bottle, you are likely to encounter a goopy, stringy mess that you can barely get on to the brush.  The fact that one must purchase Seche&#x27;s proprietary thinner to be able to get anywhere close to finishing a bottle is a bit deceptive and frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;- Application can be difficult to master, but is definitely possible.  Throw your ideas about thin coats out the window with this one, and you&#x27;re okay.  Because of how fast it dries, you really have to get it right - do-overs or fix-ups are very difficult.&lt;br /&gt;- I found that Seche has a higher tendency to lift polish than others I have tried, even with proper application.  This was surely unnoticable to anyone but myself, but I did find that it sometimes resulted in streaking as well.&lt;br /&gt;- I have noticed a difference in the general condition of my nails using this product over other quick-dry topcoats, even with all other practices remaining the same.  They seem to get dry and peel more easily when I use this regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I see why people like it.  If I were to only plan on wearing a manicure for one day, such as for a special occasion, this polish&#x27;s drawbacks would be more of a non-issue.  However, I do want to see longer wear with better presentation.  As much as I can appreciate a topcoat that dries as quickly and glossy as Seche, I would rather wait a bit longer or even use two coats of a formula that works better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that is clear is that one&#x27;s nail structure and products used with Seche can play a big role in how well it will work for you - it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!e&#x27;s proprietary thinner to be able to get anywhere close to finishing a bottle is a bit deceptive and frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;- Application can be difficult to master, but is definitely possible.

            <li> Dries my nails very fast which is nice and convenient because I hate waiting for my nails to dry. However, I start to notice my nails chipping after about 5 days. My nails are also starting to chip more often too and I usually have pretty strong nails...Hope it&#x27;s not because of this top coat because I would hate to have to stop using this. Price was very reasonable also.</li>
            <li> Actually obsessed. Best top coat ever! Works as positive reviewers claim.</li>
            <li> This top coat is the best ever! I even bring it with me when I get my nails done at the Salon. It dries fast without altering the shine or finish of the polish. ONly thing is the containers break VERY easily. Both of mine broke during some travels -- I had other polishes with me both times but only this one broke both times.</li>
            <li> I am very frustrated that i spent about $10.00 on this product because they said it was the best. It peels off in one day, well not even one day. I painted my nails last night and after my shower this morning three nails peeled 1/2 way. Uggg. will not EVER buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Very strong smell but great topcoat nails look professionally done</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff. It makes my nail polish last a solid week. I&#x27;d definitely buy again! :)</li>
            <li> Best top coat I have used! Really hardens the polish.</li>
            <li> Super fast drying top coat. It leaves nails really shiny BUT I do notice it chips at two days after doing my nails.</li>
            <li> great price! works very well.</li>
            <li> My favorte top coat of all times.  Makes nails super glossy and dries the polish faster.  I use 2 coats of polish and put the Seche Vite on immediatly, no need to wait for polish to dry a little.</li>
            <li> literally you put in on and it dries very quickly with an amazing shine!! I paint my nails at night and I wake up with no blanket marks or wrinkles. this is my favorite top coat that I will definitely repurchase time and time again.</li>
            <li> This is by far a superior top coat...Dries in flash...shines to perfection and NEVER yellows over time. The only downfall is after a while it gets a little thick...i think they make a thinner you can purchase but i havent done so. Still this will always be my first choice.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Shipped fast and was nicely secured so it wasn&#x27;t broken or damaged the least bit. There is a lot of the nail polish in the container also. I used it and it worked great. Would definitely recommend and buy again!</li>
            <li> I just picked this up yesterday from Sally Beauty.  I was kind of on the fence about it, but figured I&#x27;d give it a try since everyone raves about it.  I&#x27;m insanely glad I did!! It&#x27;s the absolute best top coat I have ever used.  I wanted a quick dry top coat that wouldn&#x27;t smudge my nail art.  This one fits that bill perfectly!! I even put it to the test by putting on two coats of China Glaze polish and a thick coat of the Seche Vite last night about 40 mins before bed and woke up this morning without sheet marks! Then, on top of that this morning, I stamped a design on top of the Seche Vite with White On by Sally Hansen then put on another coat of the Seche Vite. They are absolutely glass-like!! I&#x27;m extremely impressed with this top coat and will be recommending it to everyone I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: While everything I wrote above remains true, I&#x27;ve encountered a problem.  MAJOR shrinkage.  For some reason, as this topcoat dries, it shrinks my nail polish. It causes it to crack along the edges, which leads to chips within two days.  Such a disappointment!!</li>
            <li> I will never, never be found without this amazing product again! It makes painting your nails a breeze. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this. Just be careful to use it in a well ventilated area!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. it smells horrible but really does work. i can paint my nails before bed and in a minute they are dry - not tacky but dry - no more sheet marks on my nails.</li>
            <li> I never really saw a point in topcoats until I tried my sister&#x27;s Seche Vite. It is honestly amazing. It makes my nails shiny and hard. The price is unbeatable- it is sold in stores for $10. This was a great deal. Very happy!</li>
            <li> This stuff is like magic.  Dries your manicure in just minutes; no evil smell. Reasonably chip resistant, but I usually put on a gel top coat an hour or two after the Seche Vite for more durability.</li>
            <li> When I received this it was already very thick! ! Had to purchase the trmnt for it as well that is suppose to return it to proper consistency!? When I received it, packaging read, Will NOT Thin polish! !&lt;br /&gt;  I Know this IS a Gr8 product, my shipment was eather old or maybe got too hot during shipping?!? It&#x27;s expensive, so I Must Say, I&#x27;m Disappointed! !</li>
            <li> This top coat is amazing . It is a thick quick dry top coat you can apply as soon as you are done painting your nails. You want to apply  thin coats with as few as possible swipes of the brush as possible.  It dries to the touch in a few minutes and will help you polish last it also makes your nails harder when it is on.</li>
            <li> One of the best nail polishes but it has it cons. It&#x27;s really hard to take off but it lasts longer than a regular top coat. Fast shipping I got it in 3/4 days and I will defiantly order more ..plus it was free because of swag bucks</li>
            <li> This is the only fast drying top coat I will ever buy! It dries under a minute and protects my polish for a longer wear time. It actually enhances my polish colors! I used to purchase this at Sally&#x27;s but it&#x27;s far cheaper here.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Best top coat ever created!! Will never use another top coat again! This product gives you super fast speed drying and a crystal hard and shiny finish! Great great product !</li>
            <li> Best fast dry top coat!</li>
            <li> On top of this seller shipping very fast, this is one of the best top coats out there.</li>
            <li> Has made my manicures so much better - thanks mainly to the fact this top coat dries before I have a chance to wreck what I have painted.  Would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> I love wearing this under very light polish. It&#x27;s so glossy and dries fast. I&#x27;ll get this again and again.</li>
            <li> 100%buy again this top nail</li>
            <li> Keeps my nail polish on for a very long time. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with chipping. But it also counts on the nail polish you use as well I always use OPI.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail top coat for the first time after seeing the rave views about it on amazon and other sites. After using this product, I now understand the hype about this product! It dries really quickly and makes my nails really glossy. I am very satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, it can also be used to paint over fake rings to prevent them from fading and tarnishing!</li>
            <li> I love this top coat! It really does dry really fast and leaves my nail looking very shiny! However the smell is really strong.</li>
            <li> Love ! Keeps your nails looking great healthy gives it a shine that lasts definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different top coats. This is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. I read a tip online somewhere that it is best to apply this when the nail polish is wet; don&#x27;t wait until the polish is dry. Also this top coat is very thick. It is best to take a small bead and spread it over the entire nail. The best thing about this topcoat is that it DRIES SO FAST!! I painted my nails before I went to bed, they dried instantly and did not smudge. The finished look is almost as shiny as gel polish.</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast.  Great product.  I was able to smooth onto nails while still wet, less than 1 minute after application.  Dried to touch in about 30 seconds, super hard after about 2 minutes.  GREAT shine.  I feel like this is a much more solid coat than other top coats I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have given it to all my friends and enemies alike :-). I love doing my nails again. I can literally put on my nails 10 minutes before I walk out the door. Would highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this. It works very fast. I no longer need to set aside hours to change or update my nails. I love it!</li>
            <li> It dries really fast!  Works really well if you are doing nail art!  But please wait at least one minute for your nail polish to dry before you put on this top coat!</li>
            <li> This will give you a really solid, glossy look with amazing speed. If you are also using a quality base coat, this will give you really strong nails that won&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li> Wow.. This top coat is amazing. It makes your polish dry to the touch quickly and is better than any other one that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Base coat with Top Nail make my manicure last longer. The toap coat is perfect for my nails. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product dries faster than any nail product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  However, 5 days later it literally peels right off the nail, along with the nail polish underneath it!  I spend a lot of time doing a nice french manicure on myself.  Usually, with a few touchups of topcoat along the way, I can get it to last 10 days.  But with this product, it doesn&#x27;t even last 5 whole days before it peels off.  Extremely annoying!</li>
            <li> I have only ever used this product over &#x27;cured&#x27; polish- generally I topcoat the day after I polish or after a pedi and I have never had anything but the MOST AWESOME results from this.  My pedi&#x27;s last for weeks with NO chipping, even if I put on shoes and socks and walk for miles, on the beach...you name it...this stuff keeps your color on and looking great.  If you have an issue with the chemicals just do what i do- put it on outside.  I take off the polish out in the garage so I don&#x27;t have the smell of the acetone inside as well.  I would never consider any other top coat after using this.  I even use it to re-top coat a professional pedi just to be sure it lasts longer.  It stays put until I remove it, sometimes 5 or 6 weeks later.  I do not understand how anyone could not seriously love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I LOVE how this topcoat looks on my nails - so glossy it&#x27;s been mistaken for gel nails a few times!  It lasts pretty well on my nails and usually doesnt chip.  The only thing that&#x27;s weird about it is that sometimes my entire nail of polish peels off in one big piece, but that&#x27;s after a few days of wear and usually worse when I pick at them.</li>
            <li> Love how it drys super fast and don&#x27;t have to wait for my nails that long to dry.</li>
            <li> This was not effective for me at all. it chipped the same day, it literally lasted as long as the cheap $1 clear top coat. I dnt have my hands in water alot but I should be able to wash my hand with out my polish chipping! I&#x27;m disappointed because the reviews said it was so great. The best one I&#x27;ve tried so far is the Revlon brand no chip top coat plus it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat in the world! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Got this at CVS but it is much cheaper on amazon.com so I will be buying it here from now on. I love this top coat. I have tried everything under the sun: Nail Envy, OPI, Sally Hensen, Gel Top Coats, Out The Door, etc. and this one is by far the best. Yes it smells more than the average nail polish but the drying time is amazing. I am in healthcare and wash my hands non-stop and with this polish and a great base coat, my nails can last for more than 1 week. The shiny nature makes your polish look like a gel manicure everytime. You will love it!</li>
            <li> Dried my nails in just under two minutes i had two coats of nail polish and a design with a sparkle top coat.  This is a great quick dry.  Everyone should have it on their nails.  Smooth finish also.</li>
            <li> The only problem that I experienced with this product was when I opened the bottle. When I opened it, the bad smell came from the bottle. BEWARE! The smell might give you headaches. The good side of the polish is that it dries fast. But the bad part is that it dries TOO fast. Also, the brush in the bottle might mess up the shininess of your nail because the brush can&#x27;t perfectly polish your nail because it makes your nail bumpy. Anyways, to sum up my opinion the polish is OK, but I would recommend fixing the smell of the polish.</li>
            <li> This is amazing it holds up the polish so well and it dries really fast love it got my whole family using it now</li>
            <li> Pros: very shiny, professional looking finish. smoothes the surface of your nail (minor bumps go away), and it dries fast!  Cons: smells like paint, peels off, darkens</li>
            <li> Perfect top coat! Performed much better for me than my much pricier OPI rapid dry top coat. Perfect finish without ruining my designs.</li>
            <li> I love this, but I am switching to non-toxic nail products. Wish they made this toulene and pthalate free.</li>
            <li> Best topcoat I&#x27;ve ever used.  The highlight is that it dries VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> Best fast drying top coat in the market.</li>
            <li> The chemical smell is so bad that I couldn&#x27;t even use this. One of the first ingredients is TOLUENE, a known carcinogen. I tossed the bottle after opening it.</li>
            <li> The best quick dry top coat I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> Best dry fast top coat!!!! I use it over and over again.</li>
            <li> Easy dry and nail polish stays on for at least a week. No chipping or flaking either.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first about this product, but I would definitely buy it again! Dries to the touch in under 5 minutes, complete dry between 1-2 hours depending on the amount of polish I&#x27;ve used. Keeps my polish looking shiny and chip free. Tested it against Sally Hansen&#x27;s Dry Kwik and will use Seche Vite over that any day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay- I don&#x27;t like how it makes me nail polish chip/peel faster. It feels really heavy on my fingers, too.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I love to try new products. I was skeptical but this stuff is AMAZING! I don&#x27;t know why or how it works but it does.  It also works as a great top-coat.  I take this with me to the salon now to save time.&lt;br /&gt;After I put this on, it works almost instantly.  After a few minutes, my manicure is completely dry and I can do anything without fear of ruining my nails.</li>
            <li> (+) Dries nails VERY fast, leaves a beautiful sheen, makes nail color very vibrant!  (-) Smells strong, doesn&#x27;t prevent chipping, thickens up and requires additional nail polish thinner  So far, this is the best topcoat I&#x27;ve found. Wish it helped with chipping, though.</li>
            <li> Me personally I&#x27;m not impressed by Seche Vite. It&#x27;s way to expensive and there are other fast drying top coats out there that work just as well if not better. I have my favorite (Out The Door) and I&#x27;m sticking with it. And it&#x27;s a lot cheaper and I get way more.</li>
            <li> After waking up with sheet marks numerous times, even when I would do my nails at 4:30 in the afternoon, I decided it was time to start looking for a new top coat. The overwhelming amount of positive reviews led me to Seche Vite&#x27;s Dry Fast Top Nail Coat, and I&#x27;m pleased to say this product lived up to its many praises. The formula is thin enough to be applied easily, but thick enough to protect against chips. I&#x27;ve never had a \\&quot;quick dry\\&quot; top coat dry almost instantly after application, leave my nails with a glossy sheen, and best of all...no sheet marks! I typically use Essie or OPI underneath and the polish lasts at least 5-7 days without chips or scratches, which is pretty amazing. It&#x27;s safe to say I&#x27;ll be using Seche Vite as my top coat of choice for years to come.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect!! Love this product! Only downside is if you soak your hands under water for extended amount of time (washing dishes), it&#x27;ll chip a lot quicker, so keep them hands dry!</li>
            <li> This top coat is the fastest drying, thickest, most glossy polish I&#x27;ve ever found!  It kicks all other top coats to the curb. Within ten to fifteen minutes at the most I&#x27;m able to go about my day without worrying about ruining my nails because they are dry. Not just &amp;#34;safe to go about my day carefully&amp;#34; dry, but really dry. I am so in love! I&#x27;m pretty sure if they ever stop making it I&#x27;ll die and then never do my nails again. I&#x27;m spoiled.</li>
            <li> Love this! Bought two bottles while they were on sale. Love the smell, too! Lol-it&#x27;s like the top coats from the salon!</li>
            <li> I was a tad intimidated by the bad reviews here on Amazon, but I&#x27;m happy I went ahead and purchased SV anyway! As most people have said, the consistency of Seche Vite is very thick and goopy, and takes a handful of applications to get used to the texture. It does dry quickly, as promised, and leaves the polish smooth and gorgeous for days. I definitely consider this a new staple in my nail polish collection!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stay on. OPI much better  Very disappointed  Will not buy again. Don&#x27;t waste your money  Very poor quality don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> This top coat works really well to make your nails dry faster. It comes on really easily and smooth. It has a thin consistency so you don&#x27;t need to put much on.</li>
            <li> The price is Way too much for this...and the coating peels off before the end of the day...am afraid to use on intricate nail work...Won&#x27;t buy another...</li>
            <li> This is the best by far top coat you can buy in my opinion. Seals in your nail designs &amp; dries super fast. Makes my polish last almost 2 weeks &amp; my hands are in a lot of water!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this Top Coat! I painted my nails before I went to bed just to see how fast it would dry my polish.&lt;br /&gt;My nails were dry in about 5 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;This will be my top coat from now on!</li>
            <li> While I do like the fact that this dries almost instantly... I do NOT enjoy the smell. It is overwhelming and I find myself washing my hands 8-10 times before the smell starts to fade. I&#x27;m also not impressed with it&#x27;s stay time. I find that my non-smelling top coats last as long if not longer than this one. The only real benefit it has is the quick dry time, but I feel as though that quickness could be achieved with another fast drying top coat. I will continue to use until it dries up (which I have heard that about half way through you must buy Seche Vite Restore in order to thin out and continue with use). I most likely will not be making another purchase though.</li>
            <li> Works well and fast, but has a strong lasting odor and if you get your fingers near your mouth they taste very, very bitter. Only concerning as it says on the back it is known to the state of California to cause reproductive harm. So...it works...but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s very safe.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today, but I already love it. It dries super quickly (I&#x27;m not sure exactly how quickly because I didn&#x27;t want to mess up my nails, but it was definitely less than 5 minutes, probably 3-ish?) instead of staying soft for an hour (or more) like my last top coat. Not only that, but my nails look really shiny and glossy. It&#x27;s the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. It applies easily, though since I&#x27;ve just gotten it today, I can&#x27;t really say how it holds up over time.</li>
            <li> This polish is absolutely incredible! I will repurchase again and again...</li>
            <li> Updated review: I have used this stuff religiously, and LOVE IT!! I don&#x27;t have an issue with &amp;#34;shrinkage&amp;#34; at all. It&#x27;s the BEST topcoat for nail stamping!! It does not smear my designs! Still hate the smell, but LOVE this stuff!   This product does dry fast like others have said. It also has a really good shine. I wouldn&#x27;t mind the smell as much if it smelled like regular nail polish...but it does have a pretty strong smell.. Definitely have a window open! I haven&#x27;t put it to the test yet though.. I work with my hands all day and I can usually ruin a mani within a couple days.. So I&#x27;ll definitely post any negative results out of the ordinary!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Seche Vite for a long time, but I always resist buying ANOTHER bottle when I start getting low, because this stuff makes my polish chip like nothing I&#x27;ve ever seen. It&#x27;s really pretty before the shine dulls (3-4 days), and it DOES dry my nails super-fast, but I&#x27;d prefer my nail polish not chip between manis (every week). The reason it makes your polish chip is that something weird in the formula makes every layer of polish on your nail kind of &#x27;melt&#x27; together into just one layer. If you ding your nailtip, a single layer will chip off much easier than layer over layer over layer. I might give away the bottle I have right now because it irritates me so much. This product would be perfect if it didn&#x27;t also contribute to polish-chipping.</li>
            <li> I recently started getting fancy with my nails.  I purchased a nail stamping kit, stamping plates, dotting tools, rhinestones, nail glue, 500 fake nails, and a BUNCH of new nail polish.  Some of the nail polish didn&#x27;t dry very nicely, looking matte instead of shiny.  Nearly all of the nail polish I purchased was less than $1.50 a bottle, so it was by no means high quality.  However, I am just not willing to spend more than a couple dollars for a bottle of nail polish, especially when you buy so many different colors.  It adds up!  At first, I was reluctant to purchase Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat because I really didn&#x27;t want to spend $5 for one bottle.  I was previously using Sally Hansen, and I am not even sure if it was a top coat or a clear nail polish.  Either way, it did not look good.  Maybe it was old, but the color of the liquid actually looked a little yellowed.  It also would make my nail polish bleed; I would see my nail polish color on the brush no matter how long I let the polish dry before applying the top coat. I am so glad I found this on Amazon and gave in and bought it.  It is absolutely worth it..  Seche Vite dries extremely quickly, and SO shiny; I actually thought my nails were still wet because of the shine, and was shocked that it had dried THAT shiny.  Seche Vite makes your nails look beautifully glassy, and helps to hide any imperfections.  I also applied a couple of coats of Seche Vite under my nail polish, where my nail had torn about 1/4 way across.  The tear was quite far down, and would have been painful to remove.  This helped keep my nail from ripping the rest of the way off until I could find my nail glue.  I also used Seche Vite to stick and seal on rhinestones, using one coat to stick the rhinestone on, and a second coat over the nail and rhinestone to keep it on.  It worked great, since it made it stick without clouding the rhinestone, or leave any residue like glue could have.  I really love this top coat and wonder how I ever did my nails without it!  People who do nail art should definitely invest in this item so your art can last longer and look professional without the cost!d my nails without it!  People who do nail art should definitely invest in this item so your art can last longer and look professional without the cost!</li>
            <li> Dries extremely fast and lasts for days. I use to have to reapply every other day after cleaning and washing dishes but with this top coat I am going on 2 weeks and my nail polish has barely chipped, keep in mind I am very busy at home and had nail polish chip on me day 2. The scent is pretty strong but not a big deal, highly recommend the product!!</li>
            <li> it really helps the dry polish to dry fast. however my nail polish doesn&#x27;t last longer than normal, instead of chipping off it started to peel off entirely.</li>
            <li> Paints on easy, dries fast, but shrinks as it dries. Because of the shrinkage, my polish will peel off in one solid piece in just a couple days. Does not increase the wear time of polish.</li>
            <li> Dries fast with a shiny finish. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Starting chipping and peeling right away :/</li>
            <li> My favorite quick dry top coat on the market.</li>
            <li> Not as quick as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li> By far it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve used! I love it!!</li>
            <li> It is fair enough. Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> As always,I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE of all time top coat. It dries fat and doesn&#x27;t smuge I love it :)</li>
            <li> This is the BEST fast dry top coat that I&#x27;ve ever used. Great price and great shipping.</li>
            <li> I usually have to keep my hands where I can see them until my nails completely dry (a long time), until this. When I think they&#x27;r dry and start to forget about them, I look down only to find ugly ridges, dents, scratches, you name it! Well let me tell you... I have 2 babies, shortly after I painted my nails the last time, I realized how screwed I was since my boys woke up too early from their naps. But little did I know how good this stuff is. 2 diaper changes and a couple tantrums later (literally 5 minutes after I painted my nails), my nails were still smooth and fresh and as dry as a 3 day old manicure. I was skeptical but figured it was worth a try. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite top coat!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Actually I dont buy it for my nails but for my immitation jwellery and mobile case.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, i buy this for top coating stones of jwellery and mobile case to prevent them from falling.&lt;br /&gt;So i was searching for good clear nail polish which doesnt react with plastic or glass stones and make them dull.&lt;br /&gt;I come through the answer given by Sarah to one inquiry and find that she has studied very much so I keep trust on her words and buy it, till now it is doing its job.</li>
            <li> This top coat is THE BEST!! Love the price I get on Amazon with this top coat..</li>
            <li> Dries polish the within 2 minutes or less. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I was introduced the Seche Vite Top Coat by my nail tech, and this is by far the best top coat I have ever used! I used to use the OPI top coat, but this is so much better. It&#x27;s not too thick and dries my nails fast. Only con - is the strong smell, but what nail polish doesn&#x27;t smell strong?? Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This clear top coat is perfect. It smooths out the color polish and dries very quickly. I will definitely buy it again when I run out of it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just wonderful!  It goes on so easy, dries amazingly fast, and provides a glossy, high shine finish.  Very inexpensive for the quality.</li>
            <li> I recieved my item right on time and I was so excited! :) Normally when I paint my nails and do my own thing at night my nails smudge and get all ruined even after I painted my nails like 2 hours before. Then I used this last night, and 20 mins later I did my stuff and my nails are still perfect &lt;3 Don&#x27;t even feel like I could peel it off by accident.</li>
            <li> I really liked the Seche Vite fast dry polish....It looked nice with just that on my nails. Quick fix maybe...I recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I got this product after reading a lot about how wonderful &amp; fast drying it is. I ALWAYS got air bubbles in my nail polish after putting on the top coat so a fast drying polish was needed very much. As soon as I got this in the mail, I painted my nails &amp; tried it on. It dried SO FAST! I was shocked! My nails were smooth as butter too, NO AIR BUBBLES! I am sold on this 4ever!</li>
            <li> Seche Vite&#x27;s Dry Fast Top Coat is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. It drys fast, which I happen to find phenomenal because I am so impatient when it comes to waiting for my nails to dry. Not only is it quick drying, but it leaves such a beautiful finish on your nails. Shiny, smooth, beautiful! It almost makes it look like you have a gel manicure! The only downside to this is that it doesn&#x27;t smell so pleasant. Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> If your like me you mess up your nails five mins after you finish painting them lol.. No more fuss I can&#x27;t tell the last time I smudged my nails!!! And I got it in less than two days!!!</li>
            <li> Received my order on time and well packaged! The top coat works perfectly and dries fast! Definitely my FAVORITE top coat ever! :) by the way, this is Jim&#x27;s daughter writing the review since the product was for me! :)</li>
            <li> I was on the hunt for a great topcoat that would help my polish stay on my nails as my polish tends to chip off the same day I apply it. I have never had polish last for longer than a day and a half on my nails even with a good base coat and roughing them up and all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased both Seche Vite (SV) and Deborah Lippman Addicted To Speed (DL ATS) topcoat. DL ATS cost $20 for a bottle, SV cost $5. I used the same amount of coats of a China Glaze polish on both hands and I put SV on one and DL ATS on the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hand with Seche Vite had a blindingly bright shine, dried very fast and lasted for 3 days before chipping/peeling off my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hand with DL ATS topcoat had a nice subtle shine, dried just as quickly and the polish lasted 2 1/2 days before chipping lightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the very expensive topcoat lasted slightly less but didn&#x27;t chip nearly as much, but both were great products. I was a bit surprised that the Seche Vite nails peeled like they did. The way it peeled up, I just tugged and watched my polish come off in one whole piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I was very pleasantly surprised with Seche Vite. For $5 a bottle, it lasted longer the high end stuff, the shine was gorgeous and the application wasn&#x27;t as difficult as some said it would be. I didn&#x27;t think the high end stuff was good enough to spend $15 more a bottle. I&#x27;ll be sticking with Seche Vite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat: If you are the type of person who likes to fill in the chips and reapply the topcoat, this one is not a winner. I found the topcoat sort of -resistant- to repairs. Since I don&#x27;t tend to repair my polish because I&#x27;m fickle and get bored with color quickly, this wasn&#x27;t a problem for me.</li>
            <li> as it says on the bottle, it dries very fast. but it peels!!! I work very hard on my nail art and the very next day it will completely peel off.</li>
            <li> I can never find polish that dries good and smooth on my nails, well I have now, this stuff is awesome.  I love it</li>
            <li> This stuff has a VERY strong odor so beware if you are sensitive.  However, it works like a charm!  I use it as a top coat over my nail polish and my nails dry super fast.</li>
            <li> PROS:   -dries very fast, it is &amp;#34;seche vite&amp;#34;! - very shiny - cruelty-free - good price  CONS: - peeled off same day. less than 12 hours - also chipped in addition to peeling off in one piece    idk how people here have got it to last, what is the secret? was it cuz i took a hot shower w/in 24 hours of putting it on? i saw pieces of the nail polish stuck to my shower curtain.....i wanted to like it but i wont buy again</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Just be sure to push your cuticles back before applying it, because it can peel easily if it dries against cuticles or skin. If applied correctly it&#x27;ll last for weeks. Slight chemical smell but nothing too offensive, and it dries almost instantaneously. I&#x27;ll never use another topcoat!</li>
            <li> This top coat has some big pros, and some big cons for me. The pros: it is pretty glossy (although not really any glossier than any other top coat I have used). The biggest pro is that it dries SOOOOOO fast! This has literally cut the time it takes to do my nails at least in half, because almost as soon as you put it on it is completely dry! That would make it my favorite top coat if not for one thing: it chips my nails super fast! I&#x27;m lucky if my nail polish lasts 24 hours without chipping to be completely honest. I will then fix the chip, add a second top coat of it, and by 48 hours, the majority of my nails have chipped pretty bad, and I have to completely redo them. So I would recommend this if you need to make your nails dry very quickly, AND you like re-polishing your nails quite frequently.</li>
            <li> Love this clear quick dry top coat. It dries your nail enamel very quick; within seconds. I love how it leaves a shiny gloss. This by far is the best quick dry I have ever tried and I&#x27;ve tried lots of them. I have so many quick dry nail polishes but this one beats them all by far. Do not read the negative comments and make a drastic decision not to purchase because I almost did. I&#x27;m so super glad I bought this and the price is way better than any other online site. Buy from Amazon. This stuff is the absolute BOMB!!</li>
            <li> This is the best topcoat I have ever used!  It dries extremely quickly and leaves a wonderful protecting shine.  I will not use any other brand of topcoat ever again!</li>
            <li> It dries both your base and top coat INSANELY quick, but there is a price to pay. It peels the whole polish in a matter of days, if not less. There is also shrinkage and paint thinner smell.</li>
            <li> On my second bottle of it.  It works way better for me than the OPI or Essie I had tried before the Seche Vite.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to bleed color off the polish under it, and stays clear in the bottle unlike a lot of topcoats I have tried, quick drying and otherwise. Yes there IS a brush in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I like that it dries fast ; which allows me to do my nails at night and go straight to bed.  It would be an added bonus it made my polish last longer.</li>
            <li> It smells really weird and it smells like it is very inflammable. However, make your nail really shinny and overall rating is okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this top coat for years now and will never use anything else. Drys super fast and makes my polishes last longer.</li>
            <li> Drys in seconds. I noticed my nails chipping a lot lately but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because of the polish or not. But I&#x27;m impatient so it works great for a quick dry and a glossy finish!</li>
            <li> The best top-coat I&#x27;ve EVER used. It lasts so much longer than any other that I&#x27;ve tried. It only starts chipping a week or more in, and then only a little bit. By the time I need to take it off I&#x27;m more than ready for a new color anyway. This stuff is a miracle.</li>
            <li> My first couple of tries with Seche Vite...I wasn&#x27;t lovin&#x27; it. With other top coats, I usually wait a few minutes after the 2nd coat of color to apply (cos I don&#x27;t like when the color&#x27;s still wet and taints the top coat in the bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my first time using SV top coat, I waited about 10 minutes before applying it. My polish began chipping off within 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;My 2nd attempt, I applied the base coat and 2 coats of color to all 10 nails, and then immediately applied the SV. Polish came off in chunks yet again.&lt;br /&gt;Third attempt, I applied the base coat and one coating of color too all 10 nails, then 2nd coating of color, only to my left hand, and immediately followed that with SV. I then applied the 2nd coating of color on my right hand and quickly followed with SV. Muuuuuuch better results! Seems the wetter the polish, the better this stuff works. So, yeah, I&#x27;m a fan now. OH! And, don&#x27;t get me started on the drying time! This is the fastest drying top coat I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure of using. Amazing! Within two minutes, you can run your fingers over your nails with no damage to your manicure. In about 10-15 minutes (heck, maybe even less), your manicure is completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve deducted one star because I can&#x27;t use it with my crackle polish or Konad Stamping Nail Art kit. The crackle needs a couple of minutes to, well, crack up &amp; your polish has to dry before you can use the Konad stamp thingie. Therefore, you can&#x27;t immediately follow with a top coat. I&#x27;ll continue to use my Jordana Quick Shine top coat for that.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to receive the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat in the mail and esp since I paid less than $11 for two. I immediately used the top with Zoya nail polish. And yes, my nails dried very fast. No smudging, no marks. A day later, I noticed peeling on a couple of nails. Then slight chipping on others. I was told I may have an old polish. Which sucks. I ordered one for me and one for a friend and she said her polish chipped fast also. I gave two stars because my nails did dry fast.</li>
            <li> This gives such an awesome shine to my nails and they dry so fast with an awesome finish. I&#x27;ve heard that this dries out rather quickly but so far I&#x27;m good. Really happy I purchased this.</li>
            <li> I have been using Seche Vite for several years, and within those years I have tried other top coats, you know, to see if I can find a top coat a little cheaper, and like they say, you get what you paid for. Now I haven&#x27;t tried any OPI top coats, heard they do well, but they are even more expensive, so I didn&#x27;t try it yet. Seche Vite is the best top coat, it&#x27;s fast, it leaves an incredible shine and it last long through all hand washing, showers, dish washing you name it. It makes the nails look like you put in a lot of work, when it maybe takes five good minutes, just to make sure it&#x27;s completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have painted my nails before with another top coat, went to sleep thinking it was dry, wake up, and the polish is smudged and indented with the sheet print, very frustrating. With Seche Vite, I could paint, go into my purse, go to bed, take a shower shortly after, and the polish is solidly in place. Also, Sally&#x27; Beauty usually has a deal, so check it out, it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> Chips and peels within 24 hours. Sometimes within 2 hours. Yes, it does make the nails glossy. Yes, it does dry fast. Yes, you will go through that bottle faster than you thought.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of preventing my nail polish from chipping.  Gives the nail polish a great shine.</li>
            <li> dries quickly and it has worked very well at keeping my nail polish on</li>
            <li> Best topcoat Ever! Great with nail art projects! Dries fast, smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the positive reviews and a product has to perform very badly for me to leave this kind of review but I have to share my experience with this product because it differs, apparently, with a thousand of others.  I put this top coat on when I did my nails yesterday and it did dry fast.  I went to sleep, woke up, and was surprised to see that two of my nails were missing nail polish.  As the day wore on, two more nails had the polish completely peel off and one peeled off halfway.  I tried to remove the rest with nail polish remover and it would not come off so I just peeled the rest off (in sheets!).  I would not recommend this product and will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent top coat! Your nails dry in seconds.</li>
            <li> Just like the title, it dries VERY fast! Good for someone like me who always tends to do my nails last minute</li>
            <li> Best top coat I have ever used. No chips, no bubbles, fast drying! Perfect!</li>
            <li> Only the best! Brand lives up to its name. Fast drying and shiny, what else can you expect?</li>
            <li> Great nail polish! Drys so fast!</li>
            <li> Dries my nails pretty fast and leaves it with a nice shiny finish. Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t dry as fast if I put more than 2 coats and it smudges.</li>
            <li> This product dries amazing fast. I did my nails and was getting dressed to leave not even ten minutes later with no chipping. The next day however did have some peeling just replaced top coat and no more problems. Great product.</li>
            <li> It flakes off quicker than I expected and doesn&#x27;t stay on my nails as I would have hoped!</li>
            <li> It peels of within two days as a base coat. Pink Armor is much better.</li>
            <li> Great top coat. Bought this again.</li>
            <li> This is horrible! Do not buy. It almost feels like a fake product. The nail coat dries fast but PEELS OFF even faster! Don&#x27;t even think about using it on your fingernails. I only use it on toe nails since my feet are mostly left alone and have next to zero interaction with any scratch-able item. But within one hour of using it on fingernails, the coat started peeling off and looked disgusting. Wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> The Gold Standard of top coats. I&#x27;ll never use anything else. I can paint my nails and be typing on my laptop 5 minutes later. The smell is strong, and I&#x27;m sure the chemicals are not the healthiest, but this stuff WORKS. If you paint your nails as often as I do, you need to get Seche Vite. I can&#x27;t help you pronounce it, though!</li>
            <li> This is the best working fast dry top coat around, drying thickly applied wet polish in a matter of second, and leaving a beautiful glossy finish. Unfortunately, this formula contains toluene, which is why I didn&#x27;t give it five stars. I use this one in a pinch, and Dior fast drying topcoat when I have more time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot about Seche and finally decided to try it...I totally get it! It dries quickly, as advertised, and after 4 days wear, it&#x27;s still just as shiny as when I applied it. I did remove a star because I noticed a little &amp;#34;shrinkage&amp;#34;, i.e. the nail color pulling away from my edges and cuticles as the top coat dries. While I&#x27;ll continue to use this over my regular manicures, since I change polish so often, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use this over any of my more intricate manicures or any that I&#x27;d like to last more than 3-4 days. Edited 3/4/15 to add the following: The price for three bottles is a great deal. I have a love/hate with Seche Vite. The shine and the quickness with which it dries are amazing...the shrinkage still annoys me. I advise investing in a bottle of Seche Restore to thin it when it thickens...and it WILL thicken. The Restore will last a very long time, as it only takes a drop or two to do the trick.</li>
            <li> It got here faster than i expected. And it works wonders. Dried my nails in just a few mins. Love this</li>
            <li> Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat does it&#x27;s job. It is a nice top coat and it dries very fast.</li>
            <li> I am new to the world of nail art stamping, and anyone that makes rounds on youtube will tell you that this topcoat is all the rage. I made no hesitations in purchasing it, and I am so pleased with it&#x27;s results! Not only does it work for a simple color mani, but it works beautifully for all types of nail art. No smudging of the design, glossy, long lasting finish, and truly quick-drying! I was impressed how it helps to dry the other layers of polish underneath it, really - no other topcoat like it! It does have a very potent smell, but if you are prepared for that, it shouldn&#x27;t be too bothersome. Will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really excited about this top coat. Before this, I had to wait for an hour or longer to get my nails done and I felt so vulnerable because I had to make sure that I was careful about what I was doing so that my nail polish wouldn&#x27;t be messed up. Well, that wasted time is over! This top coat dries within a minute - and not only that, you can apply it on top of wet nails and it will suck the moisture of the layers of nail polish below it so all of your nails dries within that time :O Revolutionary, right? This top coat also gives the most beautiful glossy look, and it makes any nail polish look even more polished and, even more, your nails will not chip at all. My manicure last sooo so so much longer thanks to this top coat: your nail&#x27;s best friend. I&#x27;ve used this on my sisters and my friends and they absolutely love it too!</li>
            <li> I love this top coat because it dries so quickly and it&#x27;s so shiny. I keep trying other topcoats but this is my favorite. It does have a strong odor, however.</li>
            <li> Seche vite is the beat top coat, its all I use! I need to buy the large refill bottle next time.</li>
            <li> Oh, how wrong I was!  A girlfriend recommended this to me and since it wasn&#x27;t too terribly expensive, I thought I would give it a try.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d have even better results if I used a high quality nail polish underneath, but it still did a great job.&lt;br /&gt;My nails feel like they&#x27;ve got a gel polish on them and this dries very quickly. It even seemed to even out a small imperfection in my nail polish application.&lt;br /&gt;I have found my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; top coat from now and and I have already disposed of all other top coats in my house.  They are no longer necessary.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in the name and it&#x27;s definitely true. It gives a great shine that makes the polish last for days longer. Great price, I&#x27;ll recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> It came on time, but i dont like that it litrally peels (not chip off) off my nail the next day.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been waiting for a good top coat and Seche Vite does not disappoint. get this and the base coat.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, I can use the brush full and not worry that it&#x27;ll run off. Dries super fast leaving a glossy finish. Do I notice longer wear time without a chip? No.</li>
            <li> I love this brand!! I had read an article about it and it definitely lived up to its expectations. It is also a great price as well.</li>
            <li> If you use anything else, you&#x27;re missing out! This stuff is incredible. Not only a quick dry, but super shine and thick without bubbling so it resembles gel.</li>
            <li> Gives a beautiful, shiny like glass appearance to nails. I used drying drops on these, so I cannot say how quickly it would dry without that. With my fast dry drops, it truly is dry in 5 minutes though, and gives a shinier appearance than any other top coat  have used. Happy I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> This really locks in your nail polish - you feel it hardening almost instantly!</li>
            <li> I read an article about how this was banned in California for causing birth defects in children. Apparently you should not use if you are pregnant or want to have kids. Yikes. Who knows if its real or not - but read some articles and decide for yourself. I will say this stuff works ridiculously well, almost too good to be true, so I am giving 5 stars for performance and removing 2 for the health concerns.</li>
            <li> Well I mean it does dry fast but I don&#x27;t feel it helped keep my nail polish on any longer than a cheap brand top coat.  Haven&#x27;t found that miracle nail polish yet.</li>
            <li> Great top coat, a bit pricey but worth it.  I can do my nails and have them completely dry in minutes!</li>
            <li> I can not say how much I love this top coat.  It does exactly what it is suppose to, dries you nails fast!  No matter how many coats of nail polish you put on before it.  And it really cuts down on the chipping.  I can use cheaper nail polish :)</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Dries quicker than any other top coat I&#x27;ve ever tried. Never streaky. Always goes on smooth and even. And the shine is GORGEOUS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Try not to keep the top off the bottle for too long or even just place a finger over the bottle opening while the top is off. It&#x27;s so quick drying that, if you&#x27;re not careful, it can start drying right in the bottle and become thick and harder to work with.</li>
            <li> Good top coat, lasted about one week. Doesn&#x27;t stay as &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; as I would prefer.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great product!</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff! Dries almost instantly and prevents chips for days!! It arrived quickly and in tact!  No complaints whatsoever!</li>
            <li> I dunno where this thing has been all my life - how does not everyone know about this. This stuff is amazing, i don&#x27;t have to wait very long anymore. It dries within 10 minutes. And the shine, omg it&#x27;s so pretty.&lt;br /&gt;This prevents a lot of chipping, the only parts of my nail that looks bad is the part growing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I listened to previous reviews about applying it while previous layers aren&#x27;t completely dry. It works and doesn&#x27;t get the color onto the brush (i used with OPI hot pink and nude).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought more to give to my mom and friends immediately.</li>
            <li> Dries out too quick. Have to use up the polish fast</li>
            <li> I will never use another top coat again.  Nothing has ever made my nails look as nice as Seche Vite. I recommend it to anyone who will listen to me.  Even if my color application is messy this top coat makes it shine and look professional.  My nails also last 2-3 times longer than they do with any other top coat. I get a lot of compliments on my nails thanks to this product.  I will say that while it is a &amp;#34;fast dry&amp;#34;. You still want to avoid doing anything with your hands for a good half hour because the nail polish underneath will still smudge and wrinkle.  It also has a very strong scent, so avoid inhaling it. Overall, I would say this is a miracle product.</li>
            <li> Dries very fast but has a some what stronger smell.</li>
            <li> The most shiny finish and dries in a flash. Great for a manicure that needs to dry super quick,  however your nails chip within 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was the super clear coat. It goes on nice and shiny but it wears off easily. I really really wanted to love this but it&#x27;s not all that the hype has made it out to be. I&#x27;ll try reapplying it every other day.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I will use this forever! My nails last over a week with no chipping when I use this top coat! Makes them feel so smooth and strong too.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product. I literally was rubbing my nails after the first time I used it. Like I couldnt believe that the nails were actually DRY. That fast! It definitely adds that extra gloss. It also corrects for any bubbles or bumps left by the nail polish. I had some chipping on the edges of my nails however.</li>
            <li> I bought this top coat because of many recommendations from friends. However I was very unhappy with the results. I used it on three separate occasions and my nail polish started chipping and peeling within a day or two every time. So I used a control and painted some nails with this polish and some nails with the $1 Wet n&#x27; Wild I already had and every nail that peeled was one with Seche Vite. Because so many friends recommended it, I&#x27;m prone to think that I got a bad bottle of the polish. I wouldn&#x27;t trust this seller again.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s thick and glossy and dries quicker than any other top coat I&#x27;ve tried. I use nail stamps, and after stamping my nails Seche Vite is the only top coat that won&#x27;t blur and smudge the pattern. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Nails are dry super fast. To the touch in a just a few minutes, completely after less than an hour. You can wash dishes. I did notice that after a day the luster fades but I just reapply another coat. Does get tacky if not used fast enough.</li>
            <li> This top coat is amazing! It can dry your wet nails completely in 30 seconds flat. No matter what type of polish I use under this top coat (whether it&#x27;s cheap or expensive) this top coat makes my manicure look like a million bucks. I always get compliments on my nails and people ask me where I get my nails done. It makes my manicures last for a significant amount of time longer than other tops coats. Always goes on smooth and evenly. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This top coat makes your nail polish dry in less than 5 minutes. I like that it works, but it has a very unusual smell to it. The fact that there is a warning label for the possibility of birth defects makes me worried though.. There are other top coats out there that can do the same things but may be safer.</li>
            <li> Fantastic top coat. And you can apply while the color is still a little wet and it&#x27;ll make it all dry faster.</li>
            <li> I love to do my own nails:love nail art in particular and this is the best top coat I &#x27;ve ever tried: it dries super fast. Literally in 2 minutes your nails are good to go: no smages or annoing inprints! Plus it does not smear my nail art, which is a must have for me in my top coat. And it lasts without chips for at least 5-6 days!!! I have tried top coat which a similar in quality but the price is so much higher!!! This is a great find!!!! I difinitely recommend weather you are a pro or just an nail art intusiast!</li>
            <li> I LUV THIS.. USE IT EVERY SINGLE TIME I DO MY NAILS.. FAMILY/FRIENDS NAILS... IT&#x27;S JUST A FANTASTIC MUST HAVE... IF I&#x27;M IN A HURRY... &amp; MY NAILS ARE STILL WET.. I USE THIS... AND GET TO WHEREVER I GOTTA GO... W/O SMEARING... I LOVE THIS ITEM... BEST INVENTION BEST BEST BEST....</li>
            <li> No matter how many layers of nailpolish you put on, this stuff will dry it REALLY fast. I definitely recommend it for those of us who don&#x27;t have the patience to let our nails dry.</li>
            <li> Buy with a bottle of Seche Restore because it gets gloppy in the bottle very quickly.</li>
            <li> Drys really fast! Just brush over polish and within seconds you are dry! Highly recommend trying this top coat polish.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product, I&#x27;ve always have to do my nails at night..so that I can leave my nails to dry while sleeping. Now with this fast drying top nail coat, I never have to do that again. This top coat truly dries within a minute or so (if i blow on them especially). In addition, the shine and elegant finishing makes it even that much better. I have no complaints and will be purchasing this continually.</li>
            <li> This product is something that I have been using for a long while and now I enjoy the better price from Amazon!!!&lt;br /&gt;Mahalo!</li>
            <li> My nails are weak and peel, nail polish is always chipped within the hour.  I tried this and my nail polish lasted 5 days without a chip.  I know that may not be long for most people, but it is huge for me.  Very fast drying.</li>
            <li> Came in a lot quicker than expected so that&#x27;s great. Best top coat ever dries super quick and leaves nails glossy and shiny</li>
            <li> Best top coat I&#x27;ve used thus far.  Dries really quick and keeps the shine for several days. Love love love!!!</li>
            <li> I truly love this top coat. My nails dry so fast, are super shiny, and I never get that bubbling effect that I&#x27;ve seen with other polishes and top coats. It&#x27;s basically fool proof. You have to try it to believe it.</li>
            <li> This truly does dry in five minutes flat.  I painted my nails with two coats of polish, waited about a minute, no more than that for sure and then applied Seche Vite.  Five minutes later, my nails were dry and I did laundry.  I love it, I&#x27;ll never use another top coat!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a long lasting, strong Top coat, then this is the one for you. It goes on smooth, dries fast, and holds up to some pretty decent wear and tear. A lot of the other top coats I have tried would smudge my nail art/designs but this one didn&#x27;t budge! Highly recommend!!!! :D</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, if you are reading reviews of top coats / fast drying products, don&#x27;t waste another second. This is, by far, the best!!! It&#x27;s a miracle! It dries SUPER SUPER FAST, very hard (I mean it will LAST until you TAKE IT OFF, believe me!) and  it has secret, hidden powers! I can&#x27;t afford to get my nails filled as often as I should. So this last time, I had that unattractive space between my last fill..and my cuticle bed. Well, I put a coat of Seche VIte on and VOILA! It FILLED IN EVERYWHERE I had no acrylic from the salon! I am not kidding you. When I then applied a coat of polish for color, then another coat of Seche Vite..it looked EXACTLY like I had just had my nails filled! This stuff is amazing! My nails were filled in, flat, just perfect! I can&#x27;t recommend this enough. Whether you are looking for quick dry (it sure does dry fast!) or protection (um, check! It&#x27;s gonna keep your nails perfectly painted) or gloss (like GLASS, super shiny) this is the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons/negatives are that the bottle will break if you drop it. So don&#x27;t drop it. My son knocked it off a shelf and it shattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommended, a perfect product you won&#x27;t ever regret buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sheri Gill - Author, Mom, Mage!</li>
            <li> I love this topcoat!!! I decided to take the risk buying this product as I&#x27;ve never tried it before. The shipping was fast, the price was great, and the product is by far the best fast drying topcoat I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and I&#x27;ve tried just about everyone on the market (Poshé, Out the Door, etc)!  I will be purchasing from this seller from now on.</li>
            <li> Best top coat out there. Dries fast,!</li>
            <li> I love this top coat. It goes on very smooth and it dries in seconds. It makes your nails look like you&#x27;ve used gel polish, salon/professional quality. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and have recomended it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I got.the wrong item I ordered dry top coat seche vite instead i got the ridge filling base coat i contact.the seller and the wanted to exchange my item.but i dont have time.for.that...i dont think.i ll ever.use the ridge filling base coat but its worth it not bothering in.returning.it.ahipping was fast ...</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this to me. Now my whole family is hooked on this stuff. The top coat leaves a high gloss look and keeps my nail polish from chipping for a long time. Price is really good and ships fast.</li>
            <li> I love my Seche Vite! I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase! I use it all the time; it works perfectly! Thank you so much!;)</li>
            <li> Not bad. My nails started chipping at the tops slightly after a couple of days, but I like this top coat regardless.</li>
            <li> I am a late night manicurest. You know the kind. Leave the nails to the last.... the kind that goes around with blanket smudges on every last nail. Well, no more. I did a french manicure with a pastel base - so it was a base coat of very thick polish, two coats of pastel and two coats of a white, then I put on the Seche Vite. I went to bed an hour later. Not only did I not have a single blanket smudge, but I didn&#x27;t get a single bit of wear after a very computer heavy day of work. That never happens. I generally reapply top coat every day and still get wear (I have acrylic nails, so no chipping, just wear) This is my new top coat.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good top coat - probably one of the better ones I&#x27;ve tried.  Good for the price.</li>
            <li> The best top coat ever. It decreases the drying process and keeps nail polish from chipping longer. It also provides professional shine that you get at the nail salon.</li>
            <li> It dries my nail fast and now I don&#x27;t have to wait hours for my nail to dry.  However, I can&#x27;t give it a 5 star because of one of the ingredients which when used in excess may be harmful.</li>
            <li> This polish is amazing. It dries so quickly and leaves a beautiful shine. However, if you&#x27;re the type that doesn&#x27;t like strong smells, then this polish wouldn&#x27;t be good for you. The smell reminds me of e6000 glue, but I actually don&#x27;t mind it at all. I definitely recommend this!!</li>
            <li> This clear coat is very nice. It dries really fast and its such a smooth finish. I like how it really seals the nail color/design that you have on your nail.</li>
            <li> I love how this dries super quick!  The solution does stink and it will stink for hours afterwards.  Kinda sucks because I can&#x27;t eat finger foods without the aweful smell.  But it&#x27;s better than waiting for nail polish to dry.</li>
            <li> oh my goodness, it dries super quick! i can never do regular manicure and always go for the color gel because i do not have the patience for it to dry completely. Being clumsy, i always get dents on the polish because it is not dry completely. but this top coat made my polish dry so quick i do not mind doing the regular manicure!!! i definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is perfect! Now, for those of you girly gals that don&#x27;t dig chemicals I believe Seche Vite (regular fast dry top coat) has Formaldehyde in it and for those ladies who don&#x27;t care (like myself) just make sure not to inhale the fumes before the top coat is dry and do not ingest (that means no nail biting, or teeth picking, or anything of that nature with this top coat on) this top coat because it contains the Formaldehyde. Aside from that advice enjoy the LONG lasting shine and colour you&#x27;ll obtain with this top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to add I have used this top coat while working with children and doing jobs where I&#x27;ve had to pry open drawers, and cash registers, and use harsh chemicals, and yet my nail polish has stayed on and shiny through all of this. So ENJOY!</li>
            <li> Fast drying and the strongest one you&#x27;ll find on the market, no doubt. This is a must have for anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this top coat for over 15 years and I find it to be the best. It dries your nails fast and gives them a wet look (high gloss shine). You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I will never ever use another top coat again. This works so amazingly fast I am back to my life in no time!!! Doesn&#x27;t bubble and last a long time. You will not be disappointed as I wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;-dry fast&lt;br /&gt;- erases bubbles , imperfections&lt;br /&gt;- really shiny&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;-chips 2 or 3 days later&lt;br /&gt;- has a weird , illegal, dangerous ingredient that produces birth defects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what i do when i apply it, is hold my breath lolz i dont even know if that helps but its something :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rather torn about this product. I love how fast it dries (literally rock solid in 2 minutes and you can use your hands to do whatever) and I love how glossy the finish is. In my experience I&#x27;ve found that it shrinks my polish a bit from the edges, which is pretty annoying. However, many people do not experience this problem. I&#x27;m not sure if it has to do with the polishes I used underneath or it&#x27;s the top coat itself. I will continue to experiment and see. Overall I really like it and will continue to use it, but just fyi about the shrinking polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE* I&#x27;ve painted my nails today using Butter London nail polish and I haven&#x27;t observed any polish shrinkage so far with the top coat. Good sign!</li>
            <li> Simply put, I love this top coat. It dries my nails SUPER fast and helps me to avoid smudges. I will admit that it does tend to &amp;#34;scratch&amp;#34; after a few days, so it stops being perfectly shiny. However, that&#x27;s really only something I can tell so I don&#x27;t mind. My only other caveat is that it can chip pretty easily if you put it on too thick. To combat this, I just got the Seche Restore, which helped me to thin it out and it goes on much better now. Overall, though, I love it.</li>
            <li> My wife is crazy about this stuff, and is constantly recommending it to others. She says &amp;#34;It gives nails a hard, glossy finish!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be a bit challenging to find in stores, so I was excited to find it on Amazon, and at about half the price we pay in the local stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried every kind of quick dry top coat in the market and nothing seems to work quite like sech vite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do my nails at home regularly and have a bad habit  of trying to chores right after I do my nails. I used to just end up messing up my manicure and having to start over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t just dry the top coat of you polish like most other products, it seeps into the bottom and dries all the polish in just a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gift this to all my girl friends. I can&#x27;t rave about it enough, you just have to try it!</li>
            <li> I have recommended the Seche Vite topcoat to all my friends. People always make comments about no4 gelieving that my nails are not done professionally. Since my nails are completely dry within 5 mins of applying the Seche Vite topcoat, I change my nail polish choices about every other day if not daily.  I love having that kind of freedom of time also.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used!  It is definitely on my must-have list.  My nails weren&#x27;t chipping after 1 day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is super shiney, and stays on for a long time! I will be buying this again. When I bought it the box to the polish was crushed, only a bummer because it was a stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> Awesome top coat, no bleeding when doing designs like galaxy or thin art work, but the smell is awful, like paint thinner!!</li>
            <li> This was great as people always say for allowing a manicure to last, but it didn&#x27;t dry as fast as I thought it would. My nail polish still smudged after about three minutes of waiting. But I will mention that the smudging occurred only on two nails that I had a lot of layers of polish on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to a normal top coat. This has made my manicures go from average to professional. I never go to salons anymore and I want to paint my nails every day just to use this. It makes colors pop and shine and it also allows for glitter polishes to be taken off easily. It settles on the nail and smooths out, so for people who have shaky hands or something, it will smooth out and give a slick and even top coat.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Helps speed up dry time and leaves a nice shine! I highly recommend! Worth taking time to research and find this online!</li>
            <li> Not only did this polish dry in about 30 seconds! It had a gloss to it for about 2 weeks straight! Amazing top coat! The service was fast and the quality was amazing for its price thank you! :)</li>
            <li> I love this top coat!!! Dries extremely fast, and if you nail polish is still a little sticky the top coat will still dry fast! I totally recommend this to anyone who loves to paint their nails!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my go to top coat for regular polish. Drys so fast with a almost glass finish its awesome and makes any polish look brighter!</li>
            <li> This is the best fast drying top coat I have ever used!  I will never use anything else.  I am so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> Came Quickly! Great so far! Loving the product! I cant wait to use it more often with other clients !</li>
            <li> but i hate how quickly it gets too thick.  it&#x27;s a scam to me that you have to buy the thinner to fix it after only a few months of use.  seems that they should supply for free if their product is going to act that way.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST top coat on the market. After reading some of the top rated reviews I HAD to buy this. I love that it&#x27;s cheaper here on Amazon as opposed to buying it in stores. $5 versus $9, I was in love from there on. Dries almost instantly after applying, doesn&#x27;t smudge polish or designs AND it&#x27;s super shiny like it&#x27;s not even there! I would recommend this top coat to anyone who loves doing their own nails and hates waiting around for them to dry. Give it a try, you&#x27;ll love it! :D</li>
            <li> My nails dry fast and the top coat is strong and glossy. Nails are not quick to chip. With such ease I can change my nail color often with out a hassle.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the great reviews. What a disappointment! No matter whether I use it alone or with another polish under it, it just peels off. I threw it in the trash. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I had heard really great things about this top coat by pretty much anyone who knows anything about nails so I looked or it on here.  First of all the price was really good which surprised me. I expected it to be some really expensive stuff.  So I was really happy about that.  It got here super fast I mean prolly the fastest delivery from anything I bought off here esp for it being a free delivery.  The product is awesome I absolutely love it.  Its def lived up to everything Ive heard about it.  The formula penetrates all the layers of ur polish and dries it super fast that way not to mention the shine it leaves is beautiful.  U normally can only get a shine like that from a UV gel polish.  I def recommend this to everyone.  Ill be buying more for sure.  I even looked up the sheche restore from this seller which was really cheap too and it restores all your old polishes and your seche vite top coat is it starts to get thick.  And it works really good too. It has saved all my old polishes that I was going to have to throw away or I was going to have to add polish remover to them which thins them out really bad.  I def recommend any of their products and this seller too.  With the super fast delivery and really good prices... This has prolly been the best experience Ive had buying something on amazon and thats saying a lot bc I buy crap on here all the time! lol</li>
            <li> Every manicure looks beautiful with this topcoat on. I do a decent job doing my nails, but nothing shocking. With the Seche Vite dry fast top nail coat (which you can get on sale at Sally&#x27;s sometimes), my nails always look like I had a salon-manicure. There is a beautiful sheen and your regular nail polish looks like a gel mani! Amazing. It also doesn&#x27;t hurt that it does dry super fast. I mean, within a few minutes i could use my hands again and it doesn&#x27;t smudge! Time and time again, for the last two months, this bottle has been a life saver since I couldn&#x27;t really afford to go to the salon anymore - and no one will ever be the wiser :) I will never buy another type of top coat ever again.</li>
            <li> Fast drying, VERY shiny. It turns any regular nail polish into a beautiful manicure. Make sure you combine with a good base coat and good nail polish so it stays on well. I&#x27;ve tried this with a few sinful colors nail polishes with base coasts and they peeled right off. Actually, not even peeled, just came off my fingers. With my China Glaze, they lasted for nearly two weeks without chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this top coat.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of top coats that chip after a day, and nails that seemed to take forever to dry. After searching for a different product, I stumbled upon this. It works great, just as all the reviews I read said it did! My nails dry much quicker, the shine looks great and the drying time is significantly reduced. And no &#x27;sheet marks&#x27; the next morning. My nails still looked great after one week. Smells a little bad, but all nail products do don&#x27;t they? Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! If you love polish. This is a MUST buy. I was skeptical but it&#x27;s amazing and sets polish in seconds</li>
            <li> Awesome top coat. This top coat extends my manicure and pedicure for almost 2 weeks which is quite nice. It also has a nice high gloss that does not dull. Unbeleivable price for such good quality.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite topcoat. It works very well and drys fast. Keeps my nails looking great for at least a week and I am constantly washing my hands. I have a toddler and I also do not have a dishwasher so my hands are in water quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I always have problems with painting my nails then 5 minutes later i dent one or smudge another one. So one of my favorite bloggers was raving about this product and i had to try it! I&#x27;ve been using it every time i paint my nails now and they&#x27;re dry in a minute or so. Now you don&#x27;t have to sit waiting around for your nails, you can run your fingers through your hair, and just go on with life. I&#x27;m a little rougher on my nails though so it doesn&#x27;t last as long for me as some people have said it does for theirs but i still like it. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Amazing top coat i love it .. :).With 3 coats looks  like gel manicure.. It shine so brautiful i love it :D</li>
            <li> It gives me and amazing gloss, but doesnt last on nails so really doesnt work.&lt;br /&gt;So if you want only gloss is gonna be perfect</li>
            <li> This is the best fast-dry top coat I&#x27;ve used, though it&#x27;s not quite perfect. You should still allow 15-20 minutes before trying to do anything that may smudge/chip your nails after you apply it. Also, the bottle I received did NOT have a brush inside of it.. it was just a bottle of the product. I ended up buying another one and am going to use that brush on the bottle I got on Amazon, but look out for that.</li>
            <li> Best top coat - EVER! Dries fast, looks shiny...what more do you want?</li>
            <li> This is the stuff they use in the salons.&lt;br /&gt;I do my own acrylics and have been using a top coat from sally&#x27;s beauty supply that i just now regret using.&lt;br /&gt;please buy this... amazing, Dry&#x27;s very fast and smells like the nail salon.!! LOL&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping by seller.</li>
            <li> This has TRANSFORMED my self-done manicures from what was amateur to professional. Nail polishes, whether expensive OPI or cheap Sally Hansen, would begin to chip after one to two days. To give you an idea of what my nails go through, I attend school and have a retail job that heavily requires the use of my hands and the washing of my hands. When I started using an OPI base coat, 2 coats of quality OPI or China Glaze nail polish, and a coat of Seche Vite on top, my manicure would last roughly 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT is great and also covers up any minor flaws that might have happened in the process. It&#x27;s like a sheet of glass on top of any polish I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ONLY GRIPE is that I sometimes get bubbles in the top coat when I apply it and I haven&#x27;t yet figured out how to prevent this from happening or fix it. I&#x27;ll take any advice on this, but it isn&#x27;t worth knocking any stars.</li>
            <li> I heard so many good this about this so I had to try it. But now I&#x27;m very disappointed. The shrinks your polish like crazy! And after a few uses the polish becomes pretty thick. Has a nice shine to it though.</li>
            <li> Simply the best top coat</li>
            <li> great product, great coat and dries super fast</li>
            <li> this is the best product on the market for drying nails right after a manicure</li>
            <li> THis is the best fast dry top coat I have ever used. Will definately inform all my girl friends about it.</li>
            <li> The topcoat is fine,but i must say..After all the&amp;#34;hype&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve heard about this particular Seche product,I expected more.As for shine,there really isn&#x27;t much.The BEST feature is its fast dry formula.Also,I have a problem with polish shrinkage(which i&#x27;d never even heard of til seche) Overall,it&#x27;s a fine topcoat that i got for like half price.I prob won&#x27;t purchase again tho.Sorry Seche:(</li>
            <li> This is and has always been a great product!  It goes on easy and dries my nails quickly to a hard shine.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! It dries so fast and my manicure seems to last longer with it than without it. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on my nails and ever since I started using this top coat people ask me who did them and ask me what I think about gel (they&#x27;re assuming I&#x27;ve got the UV gel nail polish on). I have to tell them I painted them myself and nope, it&#x27;s not UV gel, it&#x27;s Seche Vite. I actually went to get my nails done yesterday a mani and pedi and the two nail techs asked me why I wanted my nails done when I had just gotten them done. I said \\&quot;Oh, no. I painted these 4 days ago myself. I just wanted to have someone else do them for a change.\\&quot; they actually talked me out of spending money on a mani and just cleaned up my cuticles (I asked them to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I only gave 4 stars is because I bought this top coat just a few months ago and already the brush is funky like it&#x27;s not spreading as nicely. I have to put a glop of this on my nail pretty much to make sure it&#x27;ll spread without streaks. Aside from that, this polish speeds up your drying time and makes your polish look spectacular.</li>
            <li> You will not find a better top coat than Seche Vite!!! Belive me I have tried many...&amp; have found nothing as good as this!</li>
            <li> I started using this about a year ago and I loved the fact that it gives such a nice shiny finish and it dries fast too. Unfortunately I started to notice that it starts to flake very fast. After three days everything starts to come off and thats even without you washing your hands too much. Over rated product</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  It really does make a difference on the shine.  I have been using the quick dry Sally H product and thought it was sufficient but after using this I will NEVER go back.  It gives my mani a professional look.  The shine is incredible.  This will be my go to top coat from now on.</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever. Super shiny and prevents chipping, would buy again and again.</li>
            <li> This really does dry very fast!  It leaves a nice glossy top coat that wears well.  Highly recommended.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> For the price I just wasn&#x27;t sure but I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. I am so happy that I did! I&#x27;ve never had a top coat that stayed so shiny and dried so quickly. I will forever buy this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This has become my go-to top coat because it dries quickly and does not create any air bubbles, which is a big trouble with other top coats.  It&#x27;s pretty glossy, although not as glossy as some others I&#x27;ve used.  I won&#x27;t give it five stars because I&#x27;ve noticed that my polish chips, and sometimes peels off entirely, much faster than with my old top coat.  On balance, it&#x27;s still worth it because my nails still look nice and air bubble free for at least a few days.  But I definitely got longer wear from my old top coat.</li>
            <li> With certain polishes and glitters it causes shrinkage. Also. Once you get about 1/ way through with the bottle it gets really goopy and stringy</li>
            <li> This is the best fast dry top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. Fully dry in 7 minutes. And on to my next customer.</li>
            <li> This is really different and wonderful. You can paint it on while your nails are only partway dry. They then get completely dry quickly, which otherwise takes hours, for those of us who have woken up with blanket weave marks in our nail polish. It&#x27;s also shiny. Five stars.</li>
            <li> what i like about this dry fast top is it doesnt decrease the number of days the polish stays on like some other ones i noticed do. also very shiny coat. big fan.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the BEST top coat I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve tried ones from Sally Hansen to OPI and this is by the BEST one. It dries super fast. In 5 mins I&#x27;m on the go! And it also leaves a super glossy touch to it. I&#x27;m on day 5 right now and my nails still look freshly done!!!</li>
            <li> I tried so many topcoats over the years and never found one I loved until this product.  It dries quickly and forms very few (if any) bubbles.  It forms a very smooth, shiny coat over my polish.  I absolutely love it!  I have started using the Seche basecoat as well.  I was so glad to find that it was available on Amazon (for about the same as what I&#x27;d pay in the store).</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law told me about this product and she was right!  I apply it over my nails after I have them done and it helps the polish job last for one week or more.  I also love the shine.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This top coat works great.  I goes on smooth and really keeps a good finish to prevent chipping.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Nice, solid top-coat.  Some shrinkage, but that&#x27;s typical of a quick-dry. It&#x27;s durable and shiny.</li>
            <li> Best quick dry top coat I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best top coat for the price. I&#x27;ve used expensive ones and they chip after a few days. This product makes my nails look professionally done and prevent my polish from chipping for a couple of weeks at least and since I work a lot with my hands that&#x27;s saying something. I sometimes reapply after a week to get that shiny, newly manicured look. Not to mention it dries super fast!</li>
            <li> Came fast, works just as expected. I don&#x27;t really mind the smell, so its all good things for me :)</li>
            <li> Wow this is very smelly!!!  It does dry fast and the top coat doesn&#x27;t discolor the base coats.</li>
            <li> It dries really fast but it peels and wears off after only a few days. Still looking for a top coat that doesn&#x27;t peel.</li>
            <li> yes, it stinks, it has toulene,ugh, made me sick, did not stay on.yuck.WHO are these people who write loving reviews of crappy products ?like China glazes?same people who love this product,and advertised\\&quot;Sally Hansen Diamond Strength no chip nail\\&quot;(named \\&quot;diamonds\\&quot;to confuse you with \\&quot;diamond strength\\&quot;) and shown as a transparent-cover-for-your-polish-to-protect it,in photos,and never stated it was A NAIL COLOR!Deceptive tiny photo,of clear glaze as \\&quot;diamond hard\\&quot;CLEAR,like a \\&quot;diamond hard strengthener,no chip.\\&quot;,with TINY COLOR NAME IN NON-ENGLISH ON TINY BOTTLE!get a magnifying glass,to examine labels, when you buy online.\\&quot;Let the buyer beware\\&quot;.Go to a 3-D store.Get a good look.</li>
            <li> Best top coat I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> This is probably the best nail polish top coat that I have ever owned. It dries almost instantaneously and lasts for a long time. I can paint my nails and not have them chip for two weeks. If I get a manicure/pedicure I put this on over it as soon as I get home and can make it last for about 3 and a half weeks. I would recommend this to just about anyone. It&#x27;s inexpensive and probably the best top coat out there.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on the recommendation of a self-confessed &amp;#34;nail junkie&amp;#34;.  It absolutely does the best job of drying your nails very quickly.  I&#x27;ve since learned that it&#x27;s often used in nail salons.  Love it!</li>
            <li> NO, didn&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the Holy Grail of all top coats. This was not it, however good it was. The reason it only has 3 stars is because of all of the cons. For one, while it dried to the touch in mere moments, it was still extremely easy to smudge it and push the polish around. The brush picked up color and deposited it into the bottle, and it discolored my manicures, especially my white ones. It also lead to a crazy amount of peeling. To be fair, I&#x27;ve always had a peeling problem with my polish, never having had a manicure last less than a day. The coat itself was hard to apply at the correct time due to the requirement of it being applied on semi-wet polish. It smeared my nail art like crazy if I applied too early, and picked up even more polish when applied to lat. For all of its faults though, this top coat had a lot going for it. It made my manicures dry to the touch in minutes, and added a crazy amount of shine. I had very high hopes for this though, even being exceptionally cautious and thorough, but it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype. All the same, this is the best top coat I&#x27;ve found to date.</li>
            <li> Best top coat I&#x27;ve tried. The issue is the one I received was clearly used.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t check whether or not this polish was three free (no toluene, dibutyl phthalate, and formaldehyde) or not when i purchased it; i was simply going by the reviews of my peers, who said that this was their very favorite topcoat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i was a bit disappointed to find it&#x27;s got toluene in it - a product that is used typically as a solvent and can dissolve things like paint, paint thinners, rubber, printing ink, etc. and is water-insoluble. nail polish&#x27;s stereotypical paint thinner smell is due partially to this chemical, which is why three free polishes don&#x27;t smell as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so, friendly tip: try not to get any on your skin or breathe too much of the stench. not good for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but it is A VERY GOOD TOPCOAT nonetheless. just took polish remover to the polish i applied the day it arrived, which was a week and a half ago. the polish had JUST started chipping. probably has to do with toluene&#x27;s water-resistant properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: very good polish, not very good for you.</li>
            <li> Great product- highly recommend</li>
            <li> I was recommended this as something that will keep nail polish on my nails not only help with drying faster. It didn&#x27;t improve or make worse the situation. The nail polish fell off the next day as usual. It does dry fast however. But the real reason for the low rating: it also stinks like no other top coat I have used recently. It&#x27;s very strong (and no I am not pregnant or overly sensitive to smells). I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Great top coat, makes nails look professionally done, even if you&#x27;ve messed up the color a little, this nail polish will smooth out the look! Don&#x27;t judge my painting skills...</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product overall.  It saved me from re-doing my home manicure many times.  It&#x27;s like &amp;#34;Murphy&#x27;s Law&amp;#34; that as soon as you do your nails; the phone rings; your ear itches or the dog needs to go out.  By the time you look down at your fingertips; you have to start from square one... again.  No longer!  This Top Coat does what it says: Dry Fast.  I will soon be ordering this again.  Some places do not carry this and since I&#x27;m online shopping anyhow; why not add this to the check out?</li>
            <li> BUY IT! DO IT! It will change your life! Best top coat ever! Drys fast and hard. I can do my nails then chase my toddler five minutes later!</li>
            <li> I was living in the dark ages before buying this! Instead of 20 mins of oh no I can&#x27;t ____ or _____ or ____ so an so can you please... pour me a drink my nails are wet? I love this! I have another that gives a jelly top which I do not like but this I have no complaints about. Will probably run out and need more!</li>
            <li> I have tried SO may different top coats because I love to have shiny, clean looking nails, and have finally found the best one! LOVE Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat! Will purchase more soon!!!</li>
            <li> best top coat - and I use it to attach some bling stones and refresh the shine of polish time to time - this is tops</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t pronounce the name but who cares? It&#x27;s the best top coat around as it protects your nail color &amp; doesn&#x27;t discolor like some others do. Perfectly smooth finish.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite top coat. Helps your nails dry faster and has a nice glossy finish. I read a beauty blog recently where this item was rated a &amp;#34;must-have&amp;#34; by a beauty expert and made it onto another beauty expert&#x27;s &amp;#34;top ten best products&amp;#34; list. I would encourage anyone to purchase this top coat.</li>
            <li> I went by the reviews and everyone said this thing was just phenomenal. At least in my case, not so.  My nailpolish peeled.  It may be the user, rather than the product (i.e., I may have made the layers too thick, causing the whole thing to fail), but for now I would not recommend it.  I may update this review later on, if it proves me wrong.</li>
            <li> This is probably the Cadillac of top coats, but I probably would not have bought it if I knew that it &amp;#34;contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause birth defects and other reproductive harm.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m not looking to have a baby, but I will look for a less toxic formula for my next top coat purchase.</li>
            <li> never had a top coat like this. good stuff drys super fast. love it will buy again. try it youll like.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. First got introduced to this product by my neighborhood nail salon. I just began to notice that my manicure actually were lasting 7-9 days without a chip, while at other salons my manicures would barely make it a week. I decided to buy this product for my own, and give my nails a refresher coat  of top coat at day 4 or 5, and now my manicure can last a whole two weeks. Really love the shine and the protection it gives my nails from breaking and polish longevity.</li>
            <li> Amazingly fast shipping! And best fast drying to coat I&#x27;ve ever used. Used a 3 dimensional glitter polish with 2 coats and it dried it immediately without any smudges or chips.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Believe the hype, your nails will dry FAST.&lt;br /&gt;- Glossy, glassy shine&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t smear/smudge nail art&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Believe the hype, this stuff STINKS.&lt;br /&gt;- Toluene, booooooooo!&lt;br /&gt;- Causes shrinkage with some polish, can also crack&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, I&#x27;m still looking for a toluene free, less stinky alternative that dries my nails fast (I&#x27;m a late night polisher).  But until I find that, this stuff is my go-to topcoat.</li>
            <li> This top coat is shiny and dries fast, BUT... it makes nailpolish peel and chip. You can just peel it off in giant chunks, no matter what base coat you use. So, when I stopped using this top coat, my manicure lasted twice as long. :/</li>
            <li> This is my holy grail top coat. Like a layer of glass over your polish or nail art. Super shiny and super fast dying!!... which helps me not smudge! It gets a but thick towards the end of the bottle which is a bummer but it&#x27;s so good I couldn&#x27;t dream of giving it less than 5 stars!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed with this top coat is the ridiculously overwhelming smell of what I can best describe as paint thinner.  It actually makes my eyes water when using it and I had to use a fan to make sure I am not taking in huge breaths of it because it gave me a terrible headache.  This will be my last time purchasing this just because of how sensitive I am to the smell.  This polish does dry super quick.  For me, it is much thicker than some typical drug store top coats I typically buy.  I have noticed that over time it begins to get hard to spread over my nails because of how thick it is and how quick it dries.  And I am generally pretty quick when painting my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, as I stated before I will not be repurchasing this because of the smell and thickness of the top coat.  However, if you are able to handle that type of smell and are use to thicker top coats then this product would be great for you.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I keep neglecting to use the entire bottle in time, because at about the one year mark is gets pretty goopy and difficult to use.  A great product otherwise and deserving of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Quick dry time&lt;br /&gt;-Ultra glossy finish&lt;br /&gt;-Kind of balances out texture imperfections in your manicure</li>
            <li> The perfect top coat!</li>
            <li> Seche Vite Dry Fast Topcoat is the best topcoat on the market. It will help your polish last 3 times longer than any other product&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Literally the fastest drying top coat I have ever used. I will definitely purchase this product again when I run out!</li>
            <li> No seriously this stuff is amazing. I don&#x27;t have to wait forever to use my fingers any more. However, there is some shrinkage when you use this.. the clear coat seems to pull up the polish. Still, a small price to pay for gel-like nails which lasts over a week.</li>
            <li> Pretty good pretty good!&lt;br /&gt;This is old school drying top coat. It&#x27;s a success above the rest of the new age dry fasts.</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this nail polish</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product since it&#x27;s the most top-rated top coat on Amazon. It was amazing for the first six months. It dried pretty quickly and my manicures lasted a bit longer than usual. But I just tried to use it again and it&#x27;s super thick and stringy and impossible to use. SOOO disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awesome finish to the nails! To me it does make them stay longer. If I don&#x27;t use it my nails start to chip</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing! Puts a top coat on like getting a shellac manicure and dries so quickly! Lasts two weeks, makes your nails look like they were professionally done!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating this only 2 starts because I am disappointed in this top coat. At first it was great and I loved it. Halfway through the bottle I am starting to notice that is gotten a lot thicker and does not go on evenly and as smooth as it used to. I had heard such great things about this too....so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Always leaves a beautiful shine</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I have ever purchased!!  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Best fast dry top coat ever!</li>
            <li> Best price and best product.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great topcoat. It doesn&#x27;t pull the polish back as it dries and that is amazing! Anyone who polishes their own nails a lot knows how frustrating it is to take the time to do their nails and then have it mess up because the topcoat is bad. I am only giving it 4 stars for one reason - it smells like gasoline. I would not recommend using this polish in your bathroom or any close quarter, at least without a fan. Still an amazing top coat and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Sets polish quickly so it cuts down on smuggling. I like it, but think many other brands work as well and protect my polish against chipping better.</li>
            <li> still use this and it was cheaper than sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This top coat does dry fast but it chips like crazy. I need a better product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have found nothing better. Makes my nails look like I got a professional manicure and dries very fast.</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes my nails so shiny and there are no smudges because they dry so fast</li>
            <li> Amazing! Bought this product after seeing it on Pinterest and I am in love!! It is the most shiny top coat I&#x27;ve seen and it dries so quickly! Unlike other fast drying top coats though it does not chip. Definitely replacing my opi top coat!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a great top coat that also helps dry your nails fast. I&#x27;ve done many tricks to get my nails to dry faster; from using a hair dryer to soaking nails in ice cold water. Nothing has been as good as the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Nail Coat. It makes your nails super shiny and within minutes they are dry. I have been able to do my nails a lot more than usual because I don&#x27;t have wait forever for them dry. Love this product and just bought my second bottle.</li>
            <li> LOVE this top coat and recommend it to anyone! It applies smoothly, dries SUPER quick, and will make your nails look amazingly shiny for days and days! It really protects my manicures/pedicures and makes them look freshly painted way longer than any other top coat. Buy this top coat and you&#x27;ll never switch again!</li>
            <li> The best top coat. I do know that the tend to get thick but that hasn&#x27;t happened yet. If you want a top coat that never gets thick use Revlon. had it for 8 yrs now.</li>
            <li> Love this top coat. I love to paint my nails but hate waiting to dry, or thinking I waited long enough to find out not quite long enough. I now polish my nails 2-3 times a week in attempt to build up my swatch library for the ton of polishes I purchase ever year.</li>
            <li> Cannot say enough good things!!!!!!!!!!!! I&#x27;ll never buy another topcoat.</li>
            <li> Best top nail coat I ever had. Dry super fast. I love it and I bought it again.</li>
            <li> makes any polish you use last for at least a week, won&#x27;t used anything but this now as top coat</li>
            <li> I have naturally long nails, which makes my life so much easier.  No trips to the salon for expensive fake nails.  I do my own manicures and love products that reduce the amount of time I have to spend on my nails to keep them looking fabulous.  I read the other reviews and thought I had found a new top coat.  Alas, I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the product does dry my nails super fast and make them shiny, I would have to touch them up repeatedly starting on the second or third day to keep them looking good.  I did my nails on Friday, which was 3 days ago.  The polish on the tips of all of my nails is now gone.  Since I took a trip out of town for the weekend and did none of my usual chores around the house, I figure I was lucky to get 3 days out of them.  Now, I either need to touch them up (which I hate the way it looks) or I have to redo them completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;ve reordered my favorite top coat, OPI Rapidry top coat, to replace this.  While it doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as this top coat, my manicure will last much longer.  Since I work at a computer all day and I hand wash my dishes every night, my nails usually take a beating.  But with OPI, I usually end up redoing my nails simply because they have grown out and left a naked strip of nail next to my cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I will have to spend the extra 15 minutes of drying time with my OPI to think about the hours I have saved by doing my nails only twice a month instead of doing them 6 or 7 times a month.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else I was VERY excited to try this product.  I love that it dries fast and thick.  But....it shrinks my polish every single time.  I have tried putting the Seche Vite on the tips of my nails and I have tried putting it on the underside.  Nothing works.  It still shrinks up and leaves the tips of my nails exposed.  Also, after a day or so of normal wear I have had the entire nail-full of polish pop off as if it were one of those cheap glue on nails.  I mean I could have literally glued it back to my nail.  Weirdest thing I have ever seen!!  It has actually happened a couple of times.  But truth be told, I really wanted this to work.  &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> My nails are dry in just 2 minutes tops after applying this fabulous top coat.... Thanx Jen fabulous for the suggestion</li>
            <li> Dried very quickly, used over nail polish and put a real shine on my nails.  5 days no chipping yet.</li>
            <li> This is such a great top coat -- the best I have ever used. I painted my finger nails more than a week ago and no chips! It provides a super shiny coat and lasts for days and is inexpensive, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Put it on and walk out the door...polish is SET!!!  No smudges, no worries!  It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this!</li>
            <li> The reviews on this were crazy! It seems that there&#x27;s a cult for this top coat. I do like it, and it does what it says it will - it dries quickly and protects the base color. However, it&#x27;s not magical. In terms of shine, it&#x27;s not as glossy as I would like; instead of enhancing my color, it only makes it look the same. And sometimes, if my color could use some shine, Seche Vite doesn&#x27;t really help too much. But for the price, it&#x27;s really a good buy. One bottle has a lot of product, too, and the brush is really nice at spreading (though sometimes too much polish gets on there). Overall, pretty good, just not life-changing.</li>
            <li> When I originally bought this I was trying to get a good deal. Apparently you get what you pay for. This was watered down and doesn&#x27;t have near the same consistency as a REAL seche vite. I advise anyone To just go to a local ulta and pick it up, this one was fake. I don&#x27;t know if this person added a bunch of acetone to it or what but I now need to rebuy and its not going to be online.</li>
            <li> Have horribly chipped nails, that&#x27;s what! Seriously, this topcoat makes any manicure look like you just came out of the nail salon. I&#x27;m sticking with this one.</li>
            <li> This is by far my HG top coat. Dries fast, covers mistakes, stays shiny, keeps manicure looking good for longer than any other I&#x27;ve tried. It does have a strong odor during application that I don&#x27;t notice when dry.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It dries nail polish almost immediately. Gives a nice shine. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It came earlier than expected and it is a phenomenal product. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this.</li>
            <li> Love this top coat! Reminds me of the ones they use at the nail salons. I wasn&#x27;t too sure on getting it because of the price, but I&#x27;m so glad I did! It is long lasting so helps keep me from having to constantly repaint my nails! My original order got lost in the mail, contacted the company and they sent another right away! Got that one in fast! Thank you seche!</li>
            <li> This really dries the nail polish fast, I saw this product being advertised on YouTube, and she was right! Good customer service!</li>
            <li> This is easily the BEST topcoat I have ever used. I absolutely love it. It is super shiny and dries really fast. I love painting my nails but I  HATE waiting for them to dry. This solved that problem for me!</li>
            <li> Dry times at least 60% faster than regular top coat polish. No more nicks, dings, or waiting forever for polish to dry. Plus the shine is professional quality.</li>
            <li> This came on time and works very well. Although (I can tolerate this), there is a really strong smell once I used it. I also found that this stuff runs out pretty quickly--make sure to apply a thin coat! Otherwise, it lasts a good couple of months (for people like me who do their nails almost every week) before it starts to get thick (but even when it&#x27;s thick, the drying rate is still very fast). I found that these do not chip (if you&#x27;re using a brand new bottle) but will eventually after a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> Buy it. Get it. Order it. Use it. Tell your friends to do the same. You won&#x27;t go back. Thank you, Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> It smells like laquer used to paint cars.  Works very well, but if you are sensitive to smells at all, skip it.  Essie&#x27;s &amp;#34;Good to Go&amp;#34; top coat works just as well, and has a very mild scent.</li>
            <li> The greatest top coat! This glides on smooth, it doesn&#x27;t pick up the color of the nail polish underneath and dried quickly!</li>
            <li> Works perfect as a dryer. Not so good protecting the nail polish so I would combine it with another to  top coat</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is my only Top Coat Polish I will put on my nails.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This dries very fast but my nail polish bubbled and peeled or chipped the next day. I&#x27;m not getting the same results as most users.  I guess I got a bad bottle.</li>
            <li> This top coat dries super fast and is super shiny. It is really the best top coat I have tried.</li>
            <li> + Results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a nail polish expert, but on the recommendation this worked as a gift. Just stay clear of this when women apply it as it smells strong and I can do with out the cancer risk.</li>
            <li> Does dry fast but gets very gooey and thick in bottle after a couple months. Very hard to use after that.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is a great top coat to put on nails that you need to dry quickly, but I do not recommend putting it on your bare nails as it smells like spraypaint when you&#x27;re actually putting it on and I can&#x27;t even imagine what chemicals could be in it &amp;#62;.&amp;#62; It also warns about possible birth defects on the bottle :o</li>
            <li> I have been reading about this brand of topcoat for so long now. I do not know why I never bought it until recently. I think maybe the price had something to do with it. After all I thought it was just clear nail polish and I can get that at the dollar store.&lt;br /&gt; Am I glad that I finally took the plunge and bought a bottle.&lt;br /&gt; I am not what they call someone who spends a lot of time on &amp;#34;cuticle care&amp;#34; (Pitch Perfect reference *high5*) I keep my nail shorts because they tend to chip &amp; break easily if I do not. I love nail polish colors, God knows I have plenty of them.&lt;br /&gt; Just recently I got my first &amp;#34;gel mani&amp;#34;, boy, was I ever impressed. It was awesome. The color I chose was a beautiful green color that resembled something you&#x27;d see on a tropical island, it was so shiny and strong. I went swimming, playing in the sand, playing in the ocean, doing all kinds of outdoorsy stuff on my vacation, and not one chip was to be seen.&lt;br /&gt; In fact it was not until the 12th or 13th day that I noticed the color was coming off from the bottom up, noticed the top down. Which is what I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to SECHE VITE DRY FAST TOP COAT: when I am not doing a gel manicure (which is always) I like my normal polish manicure (with a little bit of nail art on ring fingers to make me feel pretty) to last as long as humanly possible.&lt;br /&gt; Not only does this topcoat make my polish last days longer, it also makes my nails incredibly shiny, and it is helping them to grow stronger and longer.&lt;br /&gt; I am using a vitamin filled base coat to help my nails grow strong (Orly), I use a coat of this on top of the base coat, then I put my color , then I use this as my topcoat/quick dry, and I let it dry for about 20 minutes before I do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have found that quick dry topcoats, quick dry sprays and drops, etc. Are not really quick dry at all. In fact when you try to use your nails too quickly after applying the quick dry topcoat, you will find smudges/ridges, and your nails become messy. I believe it helps the polish to dry a couple of minutes faster, but not immediately. The quick dry labeling lulls you into a false sense of security. I am sure many of us out there have used a quick dry product only to end up having to redo our nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; To wrap it up I think that this product is outstanding. I can see what all of the hype is about, and I&#x27;m still not sure whether it is worth the price, but I believe it is money well spent, for me anyways.&lt;br /&gt; I found that this product has done what it says it will do. Except for the quick dry thing. I believe it dries nails quicker, but not the quickest. Or completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I like using this polish on top of my base coat. There are times when I want to go polish free, but I like to use the vitamin enriched base coat to strengthen and lengthen my brittle nails. This topcoat not only enhances the vitamin base coat it also adds a beautiful shine.s, and your nails become messy.

            <li> I had some of this already but it was getting old.  So, I needed a new one. It was in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> If I could buy it in bulk I would. This leaves a super shiny coat on top. It does a wonderful job at protecting nail art from chips as well. It protects my polish and can last up to two weeks. Dries super fast!</li>
            <li> Makes your nail polish last much longer and makes it very shiny and pretty!!!  I love this I have two bottles and if it gets too thick I add restore nail polish by the same company !!!!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with Seche base nearly a decade ago. I refuse to use any other base coat and even bring it with me when I get pedicures. My friend told me about this top coat, so I purchased it. WOW. It&#x27;s not only fast drying, but it&#x27;s very long lasting. I will never use another top coat again. Now I&#x27;ll be bringing both base and top coats with me to get pedicures.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done everytime! It gives a very nice top coat to your nail polish and it dries off very fast. It is also great to keep your nail polish on longer. The best of it&#x27;s kind!</li>
            <li> I like this top coat because it dries fast. It keeps me from messing up my nail color because I just paint my nails and put this over it and then they are dry within a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> The only thing i dont like is the smell but other than that i like it because it give my Esse colors a gely look and feel :)</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason every nail salon worth its salt uses this top coat. It dries fast, minimizes bubbles, and creates a strong, shiny finish. Don&#x27;t let the cost scare you away, it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this top coat is how fast it dries and therefore dries my whole manicure.  Also gives a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Great top coat. It is definetly fast dying. I used to have other top coats but this one is perfect for me</li>
            <li> This is what they charge you for, and it works wonders! It really does dries your nails quicker than any other top coat polish out there. My friends parents own a nail salon, and this is all they use. Purchased on Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find it in a regular drug store, so I don&#x27;t know if it would be cheaper in a store, but this is a great product. Bring with you to the salon, or use on your nails at home.</li>
            <li> nice polish dries super fast, and nice glow..only think it can peel off easily sometimes..must polish on corners or sometimes more than one after a day for better results</li>
            <li> This top coat is fricken amazing!!!! it makes my nails last AT LEAST a week without chipping!!! I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> love love love this polish!!</li>
            <li> Have tried many, and no polish can outlast that of one with this topcoat. I would this recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I am have a hard time not smudging when I do my own nails and this helps the polish to dry fast. I would order again.</li>
            <li> The best topcoat. Period. Dries sooo fast and perfectly. AND ITS SO MUCH CHEAPER HERE</li>
            <li> heard about this stuff on Pinterest and WOW!! this is awesome top coat. probably the best i have ever used honestly. i think they might sell it at Sally Beauty Supply but its about $2 cheaper on here. can i say again i LOVE THIS TOP COAT</li>
            <li> I was in need of a clear polish to apply to my nails, and this polish chips and peels after a day or two. It&#x27;s not worth buying.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and while it may be a tad bit pricey for a top coat, you definitely get your monies worth.  It extends the wear of your polish by at least a week.  In the 2+ weeks that my polish usually lasts, I use only3 coats.  You can do dishes and use your hands for scrubbing and whatnot and know that your polish is protected and chip-free.  I will say that it does act somewhat like a lacquer so at the end of your wear, it creates a thick enough layer that you can pretty much peel your polish off.  I know, not good for your nails but I do it all of the time and have no issues with roughness or thickness as a result.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, but never ordered it from this company. The product was very thick when I received it and caused serious shrinking on my nails. That isn&#x27;t usual for an older bottle of Seche Vite, but I have never had that happen with a new bottle. I am not sure if this was a bad bottle from Seche Vite or if something happened on the way.... I was not pleased. It is fixable with the polish refresher (another $10), but I don&#x27;t feel like I should have to do that with a brand new bottle.</li>
            <li> It is what it is...nail polish...I like it and I use it but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be any different from any other clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> Pro/Con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seche Vite does exactly what it states. Quick dry-with a High sheen. However it has a HEAVY chemical smell. And it is very thick so after a few uses the bottle is too thick to use anymore. I still choose this one over all others. I buy a bottle a month</li>
            <li> Dries exceptionally fast. It emits quite a toxic smell so make sure to use it in a well ventilated area.</li>
            <li> Love how quickly my nails dry with this top coat! Second time I&#x27;ve purchased and will definitely keep reordering.</li>
            <li> It tends to peel off in mass chunks, which is a bummer. It also contains toluene. But otherwise, it was a great deal and came very quickly. Just not my favorite topcoat.</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff really dries quickly and it seems to dry the underlying coats of nail polish when used as a top coat.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product and plan to purchase it again in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of this top coat.  It dries extremely quickly, provides great shine, and minimizes the appearance of any imperfections in the underlying polish.  I was pleased with the packaging used, I ordered two bottles and both arrived intact.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve used for quick drying without worry of getting ruined. Polish still peels right off, i guess my nails are damaged.</li>
            <li> Love this top coat! It works soo well. The only downside is that it gets really thick, so be prepared to thin it out 1/2 way through.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this by a friend and it&#x27;s awesome.  It definitely holds up.  Through previous habits (having only bought the base/top combo forever before), I applied this as a base coat... and it sheds the entire nail polish job right off.  Don&#x27;t be an airhead like myself... apply as top coat only and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Dries super quickly and leaves a beautiful finished shine on the nails. The smell is kind of strong though, and there are warning labels due to chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> the best top coat ever. Goes on smoothly and doesnt bubble. Dries so fast! It leaves my nails so shiny and pretty!!!!</li>
            <li> This top coat dries fast and hard and won&#x27;t chip. If you use it right, your polish will last as long as shellac. Make sure to buy the &amp;#34;restore&amp;#34; as well because it gets goopy pretty fast. It is totally worth it though, Seche Restore, will thin any of your other polishes as well.</li>
            <li> I have read before that this is the best top coat on the market, but it was not in any stores near me.  Browsing through Kindle daily deals and saw it and bought it.  Really lives up to reputation in my opinion.  Makes my home manicures last longer than any other top coat I have ever used before!</li>
            <li> UPDATE: Thanks to another reviewer, I found out that this must be applied to wet nails.  I have it used it numerous times since finding that out and it works great. Based on that, I bumped up my rating to 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This top coat definitely dries fast!  And, it is super shiny too!  I loved it and was ready to rate it 5 stars.  I was an immediate fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, just a few days later, it started to peel/flake off.  And, because it is so shiny, it is super noticeable - because the polish coat underneath is dull by comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this once.  I&#x27;ll give it another shot when I repaint my nails.  If I notice a difference, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
            <li> One of the best top coats I have tried. I buy it all the time on line.....$5 cheaper. It dries very quickly and gives the perfect shine to my nails! However if you are a person who picks/peels at things...Ex. Picking/peeling at the nail polish off your nails, this top coat peels off easily...ONLY IF YOU PICK AT IT though...</li>
            <li> This top coat was a complete waste of money. I put two coats of this stuff on my new tiffany blue nail polish, after two hours, I already had chips! Not pleased at all.</li>
            <li> I can be extremely clumsy and tend to always ruin my nail polish, usually I can&#x27;t use regular top coats because they take forever to dry! This top coat saves you fifteen minutes worth of dry time and only takes 30 seconds to a minute. Not even revelon can compete especially at amazons low price of 5 dollars!!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite buys so far!</li>
            <li> Absolutely a MUST have for every nail polish addict:)100% love it!</li>
            <li> Wow does this polish dry amazingly fast and shiny!! My nails look awesome with just this and some strengthener on--no color or anything. Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I wish it dried a little faster, but that could be partly because I&#x27;m very impatient. haha Really the only bad thing I have to say is that if you miss a spot with this top coat (i.e. you don&#x27;t cover your ENTIRE nail) then it&#x27;s VERY noticeable. Also, I used a $1 nail polish under this, and it chipped within a couple days. When I used it with Revlon, it was a week before it showed ANY type of wear. So maybe save your polish and go with a different top coat when you&#x27;re wearing a cheap nail polish underneath it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best top coat I have EVER used. I am an avid do-er of nail art and lover of polish and follow many nail blogs, and have listened to others rave about this product, so I finally had to try it. I was so excited when it arrived and promptly used it, and put it to the test putting it over a polish that takes FOREVER to dry, and I kid you not, within one minutes of putting Seche Vite on, my nails were COMPLETELY dry, and my jaw hit the floor. Amazing, recommended x10!</li>
            <li> Love it and thank you for the best price...&lt;br /&gt;I received all 3 bottles of Vite very soon after order...I will buy from you in the future as well.  Thank you again!!&lt;br /&gt;  Licia</li>
            <li> I saw the reviews for this product and had to try it myself; it does everything it says it will. It goes on smooth and dries so quickly  I don&#x27;t have a chance to mess up my nails! LOL I&#x27;ve now discarded all my other bottles of top coat--I&#x27;m sticking with the best!</li>
            <li> When I first used this, my manicure lasted over a week without chips. But over time it has gotten thick and lost it&#x27;s effectiveness. Now it&#x27;s like any regular old top coat. I can go a day without chips but my nails get crappy after. For a while I thought it was the polish I was using but when I tried it with the polish I initially used this with, same story. One day no chipping, then they start chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on the fence. I don&#x27;t fing it makes my manicure long lasting. If some of this top coat lifts off the nail plate and you try to peel it off, all your polish goes off with it.</li>
            <li> Best top coat I&#x27;ve tried. Fast-drying, very glossy, and doesn&#x27;t drag nail art.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on this top coat. It was so good, I immediately bought four more.</li>
            <li> And believe me, I have tried many. This dries your nails FAST and LASTS. I can easily wear my polish for a week before they chip, and that&#x27;s WITHOUT babying them and still doing dishes/etc. Love this! And it&#x27;s SO much cheaper on Amazon than it is in stores, even w/ a beauty license discount.</li>
            <li> Heard this was a really good top coat, but It isn&#x27;t anything special in my opinion. I&#x27;ve found faster drying top coats than this like the color club top coat. Won&#x27;t repurchase, but not a bad product.</li>
            <li> This top coat is one of the strongest I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t dry super fast, it takes about 15 minutes to dry enough so my nails don&#x27;t stick when I press them together, but after 30 minutes to an hour, it dries to a very solid layer over my nails. The formula and brush make it very easy to apply and it definitely helps make my polish last longer. It&#x27;s not too expensive when purchased online, so overall I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect top coat. It definitely lives up to the hype of being top coat of the year. Dries fast, no smudges, makes your manicure last, and does not blur your design, love it!!</li>
            <li> This is the best fast drying top coat available!  And it really protects the polish from chipping.  Also, if you need to refresh your polish, just apply another thin coat of Seche and it looks like you just did your nails!  And I love that I could purchase it as such a bargain price!!</li>
            <li> I buy A LOT of nail polish and this is by far the best top coat ever. Dries in no time at all! I no longer have to wait hours for my nails to dry which is amazing. Would buy over and over again!</li>
            <li> Best quick-dry product I&#x27;ve used. Drys quickly and seems to last better than many others. Does not seperate away from polish like some topcoats do.</li>
            <li> I could not wait to try this product based on the reviews.  As soon as it arrived I opened it and put a coat on my polish and it dried fast and was super shiny. I am so excited that I can use my polishes I have been collecting. I always mean to do my nails but it is so time consuming with the dry time. This is a great product that I am so happy with. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great top coat!  Put it on, and it dries almost immediately.  The other reviewers weren&#x27;t kidding!  I can&#x27;t wait until their color polishes are available.  I emailed the company in August, and they said to check back this month to see who their vendors will be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of quick dry top coats and this is the best hands down!! My nails were dry to the touch in just 2 minutes! Amazing. Just to make sure they were fully dry, I wait at least an hour before I resume &#x27;normal&#x27; activity. I will never again use another quick dry top coat again! Don&#x27;t hesitate to try this product! You will not be sorry!</li>
            <li> Love this top coat. It&#x27;s super shiny and dries ridiculously fast.</li>
            <li> Perfect top coat, dries very fast and is smooth! Came in weird packaging but wasn&#x27;t damaged or anything, and came very fast!</li>
            <li> I will never use another top coat again.  Seche Vite is amazing!  It dries so fast and keeps my nails looking great for at least a week.  I&#x27;ve always had trouble with my polish drying in a reasonable amount of time.  No longer!  After about five minutes, I can do anything with my fresh manicure.  I absolutely love this stuff!  And buying it online is definitely the best option.  I think I saw it in Ulta the other day for upwards of $10. The only annoying thing about it is that it gets gloopy and harder to apply after you use about 3/4 of the bottle.  However, it is so great that I didn&#x27;t feel like it would be accurate to deduct a star for that.  I just have to reorder it fairly regularly because I am addicted to doing my nails.  Seriously, buy this product.  You&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
            <li> I have read about this in some magazines and was anxious to try it, so naturally I was a bit apprehensive to buy, but now that I have I don&#x27;t know how I lived before without it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a nail expert, and don&#x27;t get manicures regularly.  I sometimes get pedicures or do my own pedicures.  But, from the products I&#x27;ve used before (which are limited), I find this to be amazing.  I&#x27;m always doing my nails in a rush or before bed, thinking I&#x27;m giving myself enough time to let it dry... yet somehow I always end up with bedsheet wrinkles, sock texture imprints, or stubbed tips/edges.  This top coat really really worked and is FAST.  It also gives it a nice, thick gloss and I feel makes the color brighter.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It form such a hard shiny coat on your nails. Way different from the standard clear polishes out there</li>
            <li> I love this top coat! It dries so fast and keeps your polish from chipping so quickly. Not sure how I did without it before!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Put it on over wet polish and it dries almost instantly.  No more waiting</li>
            <li> This is amazing!  I love it.  Drys very fast...  Great stuff.  Hope to get more soon.  It really leaves a great shine to the nail.  Thanks guys...  Cathi</li>
            <li> favorite top coat.  it really dries fast and leaves a super shiny coat.</li>
            <li> So far after a few months of useage, this is by far the best top coat I have ever bought. I no longer spend top dollars on nail polish. I get any nail polish as I know my top coat will give it the perfect finish. I recommended it to my whole family and thats all we use now!</li>
            <li> I used to love painting my nails but always hated waiting for them to dry. This is the best top coat because my nails are completely dry in minutes instead of hours. I would highly advise using this product if you paint your own nails because it works!! The only thing is I don&#x27;t know how sturdy the top coat is because I&#x27;ve found my nails chipping with in the first week. Its well worth the money though!!</li>
            <li> It does help dry nails quickly. Worth the price to save a new manicure from the disaster that is sheets touching your at night nails and ruining your manicure.</li>
            <li> I have the crappiest nails I have ever seen; they split, peel, and break. This is the only top coat that at least somehow prevents my nail polish from chipping the first day, and the only one that goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> it peeled I was very disappointed</li>
            <li> Bought it as a top coat based on Amazon reviews. Works great. Dries quickly</li>
            <li> Dries fast and super shiny. This is definitely the best topcoat out there- way better than Essie. It&#x27;s available in beauty stores for slightly more.</li>
            <li> Hands down, THE best top coat. I love this product!</li>
            <li> This really dries my nail polish fast!!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is so go. It dries up with seconds.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for over 20 years.  It dries so fast and makes any polish look better.</li>
            <li> Perfect finishing coat, love it!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a topcoat that will make my manicure last, and this did not work at all. Still chipped the next day and other customers claims were false.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product because I have heard so many great reviews . I was sadly disappointed . It didn&#x27;t keep my polish from chipping . My polish chipped off In less than 2 days .</li>
            <li> Makes my polish stay for weeks!!</li>
            <li> Has a weird smell but works great</li>
            <li> Love this top coat! Dries really fast... enjoying it alot.. I live in Hawaii and it came thru fast. Definitely will be buying again when I run out:)</li>
            <li> Excellent! It&#x27;s my fourth one already&lt;br /&gt;The only thing... I wish it didn&#x27;t dry out half way</li>
            <li> Pretty much the cure to sheet marks and other evidence of improper drying.  Definitely recommended without reservation.</li>
            <li> The best top coat EVER!! and the cheapest here also!!</li>
            <li> Easily to peel off. But dries fast and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good top coat for a while. I get so frustrated (as I&#x27;m sure all of you do) when I spend all this time to do my nails, then it instantly gets chipped, or the shine doesn&#x27;t last, or I go to sleep and wake up with my nails all messed up! Well I purchased Seche Vite top coat, and it really lived up to the hype! I&#x27;m on day 3 of my manicure, so far no chips and it&#x27;s just as shiny and pretty. It dried really fast, and it looks like a professional manicure. Love! I couldn&#x27;t recommend this high enough. Not really that much more expensive than drugstore brands, so no excuse not to buy this! Oh and the smell isn&#x27;t that bad, it&#x27;s the usual nail polish smell.</li>
            <li> I swear by this top coat!! You may use any polish under it and it makes even the cheapest clearance bottle of color look like a professional manicure. You apply it over your color while it is still wet, and it seeps through all layers and hardens within minutes. It&#x27;s very glossy and thick, so any imperfections in on your color coat are smoothed out and hidden. I am asked all the time where I got my gel manicure done. Lasts a lot longer than any other top coat I&#x27;ve tried and if it does come off before I remove it with polish remover, it comes off the nail all in one peice, which I appreciate because I HATE partially chipped off polish!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite top coat to use for nail polish. It dries to a gel-like clear, polished, protective finish very rapidly. If I reapply every other day, my manicures can last a week or more with minimal tip wear. I have also found that it conceals minor flaws in the colored polishes it is applied over, and I have worn it over various brands of nail polish (OPI, china glaze, revlon, etc.) and it has worked great for all of them. At the price of $5 and free shipping, this completely beats any other seller I have found, including target and walmart. This is the second time I have ordered this polish from this seller, and each bottle came well wrapped in bubble wrap in its box in a mailer envelope in rapid shipping time. I do recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that it will dry out after a few months and become thicker and harder to use, though it will still dry perfectly even when it&#x27;s started to thicken up. I make sure to screw the cap on tightly as a result, this seems to help.</li>
            <li> I received this in a timely manner, and the product was in perfect condition.  It seems to make my polish stay on longer as well!</li>
            <li> Clear coat, not bubbles. This product makes the nails shiny and look healthy on top of the growth system coats.</li>
            <li> After using Miracle Shine for a year, this polish has a faster drying period, high gloss, and longevity.  My manicures last beyond the growth factor.  I normally take this off before it begins to wear!</li>
            <li> Nails dry quickly, have a shiny finish, and last longer.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed. Yes, it dries pretty fast, but it starts peeling by the second maybe third day. I personally don&#x27;t see what all the hype is with this product. Definitely not worth the price. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again. However, it did arrive on time if not sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> For the most part it keeps my nails super shiny and it drys pretty fast for a polish. An overall good purchase. Love the price on here!</li>
            <li> The very best top coat EVER.  Will not live with out.  I like to do my own nails but sometimes I go to the salon.  One time I left the nail salon and literally 30 minutes later I ruined my nails getting out of my car and carrying my purse inside my house.  Ever since then I take this with me to the salon.  It takes about 60 seconds and you are good to go.  As long as you are deliberately trying you will NOT mess up your fresh nails.  They also stay shinier longer than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used.  Comes off just like any other polish.  It&#x27;s a must have for me.</li>
            <li> The back of the box says: &amp;#34;This product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.&amp;#34; I wish this warning label was posted in the description, as I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it. A shiny topcoat is not THAT important to me.  Note- I did not even try this product.</li>
            <li> Dries quick, but &#x27;causes a lot of shrinkage and cracking of the polish, and didn&#x27;t wear any longer on my nails.</li>
            <li> This is awful, I tried this on my manicure and it would peel off in sheets, I have since then put on acrylics, I figured I would try this again, I figured anything can stick to the acrylics, it came off in sheets once again! I don&#x27;t get the rave reviews on how wonderful it is. I am a cashier and work in food service with powdered disposable gloves and this stuff comes off with the gloves. So...I thought one more try because I really wanted to like it and applied it in thin coats. The same thing happened, I&#x27;m done, tried everything with no results. Avon UV top coat holds up well as well as OPI top coat, not this seche vite</li>
            <li> i recommend this top coat. not expensive and it works really great. it makes your nails dry faster last longer and look super shiny</li>
            <li> This product does exactly as it says it will, it dries fast.  I notice a big difference when I do my nails it cuts the amount of time needed to dry down to minimal!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this Seche Vite fast dry topcoat with polishes from a variety of manufacturers, some higher end and some less so (including, but not limited to Sheswai, Zoya, OPI, Seche Vite, and Revlon).  My average time prior to chipping is about 2 days; Zoya polish lasted a bit longer.  However, chips are pretty minor and I am very hard on my hands throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any problems with any of the above-listed brands in combination with this top coat.  Some of those brands are &amp;#34;3 free&amp;#34; (3 referring to dibutyl phthalate, toluene, and formaldehyde) and some aren&#x27;t.  Seche Vite topcoat does contain toluene, by the way.  The topcoat does have an odor and I know the odor is from toluene (I worked with toluene sometimes while in the lab in grad school).  However, I find that the odor dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not get any peeling or shrinkage with this topcoat and it dries quickly and with a nice shine.  I also think it helps to dry the polish under the topcoat; the Revlon polish I used recently was kind of thick and took a long time to dry between coats.  I got impatient and put the Seche Vite topcoat on it while it was still a little wet.  This seemed to make the polish underneath dry faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in the end, I find that this dries quickly, looks nice, and works with a variety of polishes (both those that are &amp;#34;3 free&amp;#34; and those that are not).  This product page contains reviews written over a period of several years so I will also mention that I bought this in late 2013 and have been using it (same bottle) a couple of times a week for the last two months or so.  The performance has been consistent over that period of time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than OPI top coat, but I prefer the former. Seche Vite worked fine, but it was a thicker formula. I think the OPI top coat is slightly easier to work with. It&#x27;s a matter of preference, I guess. The OPI top coat also lasts longer for me. With the SV, my polish began chipping sooner.</li>
            <li> I went to the nail salon and fell in love with this nail polish. lT dry within minutes and leave a nice gloss. My package came on top and wrap securely.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other top coat since the time I bought this, it&#x27;s my best friend now! I really love the way my nail polish is dry immediately after the top coat with out using a gel polish!</li>
            <li> I understand that this item is not returnable as it is considered a hazardous material, but I am very disappointed in this product. I had high expectations due to outstanding reviews and a great reputation, only to be severely disappointed. I used the top coat and in less than 24 hours it began to flake off all of my nails. It made a huge mess and was embarrassing. I am frustrated that I cannot return this product as it was definitely not worth the money. A bottle of top coat from the 99 cent store does a better job.</li>
            <li> I wanna start out by saying this is by far the best topcoat I have ever set my sights on! It is SOOOO SHINY and dries at lightning speed! Now the reason I gave this 4 stars is because it does contain toulene (google it) which is linked to numerous health problems. Also when approaching the half bottle mark it begins to get VERY clumpy. When you pull the brush out of the bottle it brings with it little strings of the polish! That being said the problem can easily be fixed by adding a few drops of seche restore! If you are going to buy the topcoat, seche restore is a MUST HAVE. So overall this is a great topcoat! Try to limit use (because of the toulene), and also buy seche restore!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. dry very fast&lt;br /&gt;2. makes nail polish/nail art stay much more longer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;: It&#x27;s because it dry fast, I won&#x27;t be able to finish the bottle. by the time use half of the bottle, notice the liquid is got harder that so hard to use it.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST top coat in town! Dries really fast so you don&#x27;t have to wait hours for your nails to dry. Also, will make your nail polish last longer!</li>
            <li> This top coat is great. My nails have barely chipped in over a week and after i applied it my nails were noticeably dryer than they had been with other top coats. the package got her in excellent time as well</li>
            <li> I heard so many things about how bad it smelled but that it worked perfectly so I gave it a shot anyway. The smell wasn&#x27;t as bad as I was expecting but it worked exactly as I needed it to. Dried fast, went on smoothly and looked great.</li>
            <li> This top coat is amazing. It is really clear, shiny, and dries quickly. It is perfect for people who do designs on their nails because it makes the design look even better.</li>
            <li> This top coat dries very fast and I use to make my manicures last longer---sometimes as long as 2 weeks---way better than even using nail gels.  My only wish is for it to come with a wider brush --- then I get to save a couple of seconds putting it on.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smudge nail stamps. It looks glossy and professional when it dries. I would recommend this over anything they sell in your local drug store.</li>
            <li> very hard to get rid of the nail polish once on your nails! It is a great product. My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Best topcoat there is! Dries SO fast and chip free for a few days.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat. Usually my nails will start chipping the same day I apply polish but with this top coat, they last about a week. I use this top coat with the gelous base coat and its great. Just like gel nails without the expensive salon price tag.</li>
            <li> Best top coat around!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat nail polish ever! It dries quickly and leaves a lasting shine that looks like you stepped out of a nail salon. It also helps prevent chipping. I do my own nails with regular nail polish and this top coat and my manicure lasts for up to two weeks before signs of chipping begin to show. Believe me,I have tried them all, and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I love this fast drying top coat been using it for years. The only thing I have a problem with is the smell It&#x27;s pretty strong</li>
            <li> It takes about 5-10 minutes to dry to touch. Quite shiny. Dries much faster than the OPI top coat (don&#x27;t even bother with OPI top coat). Seems to resist scratches better than the Sally Henson top coats.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness. This stuff is fantastic. I&#x27;ve had issues with bubbling on my nails once I apply the top coat, and Seche Vite has saved the life of my manicures!  It does stink a tiny bit, but it works so well!  My nails have never been so bulletproof, and they look so beautifully shiny, too!  I&#x27;ll definitely be using this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve gone through about a dozen top coats, all promising amazing shine, quick dry, no chip, blah blah, and never have any of them lasted me more than a couple days. Usually, the first place my nail polish will wear is on my thumbs, and this is the first top coat I&#x27;ve had that has stopped that completely. It&#x27;s super shiny, actually does dry fast, and lasts a long time. Before getting this, the longest my nail polish would last me without chipping would probably be 5 days. With this, I&#x27;ve gone for over 2 weeks without a chip, where I only take it off because my nails have grown out. I&#x27;ve never had it shrink on me, which seems to be a major complaint, but I keep my nails very short, so that might have something to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;However, the rumors about it completely peeling off an entire nail are true. It&#x27;s the only reason why I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars. But if you&#x27;re careful and don&#x27;t get the edges of your nails caught on anything it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> dries fast and  makes my nail polish last way longer ! ive seen this in stores for up to $11 . Glad i saved a few bucks on amazon</li>
            <li> Dude, you can buy all the cheap, bright colors and this top coat will make them brighter and shinier! You can also use it alone and have your nails shiney and protected. Where the heck has this top coat been all of my life?!</li>
            <li> Hands down, the BEST top coat I have EVER tried! (and I&#x27;ve been through plenty) Fast drying, leaves shiny coat, and really protects color. Only complaint is the smell but still totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Best. Top Coat. Ever.  This top coat is amazing!  I can paint my nails, use Seche Vite to seal it &amp; fall asleep within minutes without the worry of sheet marks on my nails!  It leaves a perfect shiny finish.  I have family members using it now &amp; they are impressed as well!</li>
            <li> Best Top Coat out there.</li>
            <li> I received a bad batch because after 20 minutes my nails Was still wet.  I have used and loved this product for a very long time so I must have received a bad batch .would have sent it back but shipping would have cost more then the product is worth.</li>
            <li> Makes polish dry super fast! Will buy again. Bought for gift and will buy again and again! My fave by far!</li>
            <li> This is my go to topcoat. Go on smoothly, dries to a beautiful glossy finish. Dries in seconds. This will even make ok polishes pop.</li>
            <li> this is a must for any nail polish.  i love it and will continue to use it.  i highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I thought my friend was lying when she said that a top coat that dries nail polish in 10 minutes flat exists. I love how I can layer on colors and have them dry quickly with this top coat. It does get goopy after awhile, but nothing that thinner can&#x27;t fix! I also love how it leaves a glossy glass look. I&#x27;ve had random people stop and ask me where I got my nails done, and they were shocked when I told them I do them myself!</li>
            <li> Swear by this stuff! Loved the price as well!</li>
            <li> I only buy this top coat because it dries quickly, and protects beautifully. My nailpolish no longer chips as much as other top coats. It is best to reapply after 4 days to provide the same type of protection. \&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I see is that the top coat no longer shines like the first day application around my fourth day of wearing it.</li>
            <li> This gives your nails such and amazing shine and idea make your manicure last longer.</li>
            <li> It does dry really fast but does NOT go on really well.  The strokes can be seen once it&#x27;s dry and that&#x27;s because the brush is way too small.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I read so many reviews about how it stays on forever and no chipping . Well I did my nails yesterday around noon and they were ALL chipped and peeling before 8pm. I am pretty hard on my nails , but I&#x27;ve had cheap clear polish hold better than that. Other than that, it&#x27;s super shiny and kind of gives your nails a &amp;#34;gel nail&amp;#34; look. I love the stuff . Maybe I need to try a different brand of polish.</li>
            <li> Great service!  Would purchase again.  Love this fast-dry polish!</li>
            <li> Purchased Seche Vite after having done some online research for a really good top coat. It does what it says and all of the reviews were spot on. Shines wonderfully, is fast drying, smoothes out imperfections and helps my manicures last twice as long.  I am not a professional and don&#x27;t have much to compare this to but I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Love this clear polish, it really does dry incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> Fastest drying top coat! I love this stuff and I couldn&#x27;t live without it! My nails dry in five minutes flat.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this top coat since it&#x27;s a cult favorite but didn&#x27;t want to pay salon price in case I didn&#x27;t like it. I&#x27;ve ended up with too many full bottles of top coats I no longer use and they can be very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love Seche Top Coat, it dries faster than any OPI top coat I&#x27;ve used or any other brand top coat for that matter, and over the years I&#x27;ve tried quite a few. I normally have to reapply the top coat in the middle of the weak to keep my polish looking fresh, but I only have to use this top once and it keeps my nails glossy and chip free for at least a week. I don&#x27;t really use my hands for work other than constant typing, so my polishes tend to last longer than the average persons anyway, but this top coat definitely extends the life of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have the shrinking issues others users reported, maybe they are putting it on too thin? One big glop in the middle will spread across the nail and usually create an even coat, I don&#x27;t go back for a second swipe unless it&#x27;s on my thumb nails or large toe. I also didn&#x27;t receive a fake bottle, though I&#x27;ve never used this polish before I&#x27;m fairly certain this is the brand name since it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will definitely be the only top coat I ever use again It makes my nails look like glass and hides any imperfections on the polish. I&#x27;m so glad I found it for a cheaper price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> best top coat in the world.</li>
            <li> I was impressed at how quick this nail coat works! Literally, 2 minutes and my nails are dry an ready. Only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the strong smell. It does go away soon after drying.</li>
            <li> Omg! I am in love with this stuff!! My nails always chip, within hours of a manicure. I&#x27;m currently 4 days into this manicure and NO CHIPS! None!!! Consider me addicted!</li>
            <li> I get a mani and pedi every other week and was unhappy with their brand of quick dry, top coat.  My coworker mentioned Seche Vite and I have been using it every since!  I highly recommend this item.  You should place a coating when you get your fresh mani and pedi and then the start of the second week.  You will be extremely happy!  I will ALWAYS use Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Nail Coat!!!</li>
            <li> This is definitely the BEST topcoat I have ever purchased. It certainly leaves a gel coat look. Loved it. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Most awesome fast dry top coat ever. Have been using this for years and I still love it.</li>
            <li> This fast dry nail coat is the best I&#x27;ve ever used! It dries the polish very quickly and often makes the polish last twice as long as with a normal top coat, and with almost no chipping! I noticed the difference the first time I used it. My polish usually would last for about a week, and with this top coat it usually lasts for two weeks! I will say that it smells more than other polish, but it&#x27;s worth it.  I love this stuff, and if you like to do your own nails (why pay?) then you&#x27;ll love this stuff too!</li>
            <li> This top coat does not prolong nail color. I apply it as a top coat and it actually shrinks my nail polish and it ends up chipping off. Darn it.. If anyone knows of a top coat that actually seals in your polish and extends it&#x27;s wear, let me know! lol because this one defiantly doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> Great top coat! The best I have tried thus far.</li>
            <li> My husband use all of my stuff on his motorcycle!!! And then he told me its good!!! So I guess it must be good. Maybe need buy some more later.</li>
            <li> Why do they not sell this product in drugstores? I do my nails all the time. Although I like the look of shellac; I don&#x27;t like how it damages my nails, and how time consuming it is to change the color and reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a couple of top coats, from revlon to essie to sally hansen to OPI. The most important thing to me in a top coat is how quickly it dries; followed by shine factor. This stuff is magic. Not only does it dry quickly, its leaves you with shiny, polished nails that look like shellac!</li>
            <li> This stuff dries so quickly it&#x27;s amazing really. I usually dread doing my nails because I hate not being able to use my hands for at least an hour afterwards. I also have a tendency to mess my nails up within the first 5 minutes but with this stuff my nails are dry in about 10 minutes. It does chip sometimes within a day or two but most topcoats seem to. That con is worth it to me. I also find peeling the nail polish off  in one giant piece oddly satisfying..</li>
            <li> I really like this top coat. It dries really quickly and leaves a lovely shine. It also makes my polish last a really long time.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan for a few years not. This high gloss top coat turns at home nail color into &#x27;wow&#x27;. I order from Amazon to pay half the price of my local Duane Reade. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The product is good, but the price is a little more than I what I wanted to pay for it.</li>
            <li> The morning after applying this admittedly fast drying top coat, I watched bits of my nail polish start chipping off while just sitting in a meeting.  I wasn&#x27;t doing anything: not washing dishes, waxing my car, nothing.  Just sitting.  And watching my fresh, bright red nail polish fall off in bits all over the table. SO FRUSTRATED!!!!!  I can&#x27;t return the product because you can&#x27;t return flammable merchandise.  So I&#x27;m stuck with a lousy product.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!!!!!!!!!! I&#x27;ve gone through multiple bottles and their service to their customers is great. Never changing my top coat ever!</li>
            <li> Never ever am I going to do my nails without this! Abso- freakin- lutely amazing!</li>
            <li> The best top coat ever, hands down.  My nails dry SO FAST with this, goes on beautifully, and makes my polish last much longer than with any other top coat product I have tried.  This has truly changed my manicure-ing life!  It used to be a two-hour affair to do my nails, now it&#x27;s 15-20 minutes and DONE.  Try this, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I was so fed up with my nails breaking ALL the time. I did some research and realized it was due to me using neither top or base coats. After a lot of research I finally decided on this product. It&#x27;s clear and goes on really smooth. However there are some issues with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I like to do nail art and paint cute designs. When I put this top coat on it flattened out my work- this can be a good thing and a bad thing. It makes my scraggly lines look straighter but also thicker so I have to put on a very thin amount. It&#x27;s AMAZING for little rhinestones you definitely don&#x27;t need glue with this top coat! The finish this gives makes it look like I&#x27;m wearing acrylic nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside to this is that if you get it even a little your skin on the edge of your nail and it dries on your skin- when your nail starts to grow out the nail polish on your skin will move with the nail polish on your nail and cause it to peel very easily. So it&#x27;s not very flexible. If one part of the nail polish peels off it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;break off&amp;#34;  so you can fake having nail polish on for some time before it peels off completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing is that it bonds with all the other nail polish you have on- so if it comes off so does the rest of your nail work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had some issues with the nail polish chipping at the tip- I think it has something to do with it bond to the rest of the nail polish and maybe &#x27;shrinking&#x27; when it&#x27;s dry. I&#x27;ve sort of found a solution to this by applying it not only on the nail but under it and making sure it&#x27;s on the edge on the nail too. I use about 2 coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it says and seems it&#x27;s fast drying. Only the surface is the rest of the nail polish is still very much wet so don&#x27;t do anything for at least 30 -40 minutes unless you want wrinkles in your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I love the finish it gives but wish it would stay on longer. Before this my nail polish would stay on for weeks, now it&#x27;s down toonly 5 days or so. It may also be my new base coat- either way I&#x27;m okay with it because it&#x27;s definitely made my nails a million times stronger without nail polish because of this nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note it protects- I am a very busy girl and a very creative one at that. Before any scrapes or paint or even showering/washing dishes would cause my nail polish to come off even with dish washing gloves on. With this nail polish it happens no more which is the most important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend it if your Nail Artist because it won&#x27;t last and its prone to messing up your work. If you wear FAKE nails I don&#x27;t recommend it either. But if you want that acrylic look without messing up your nails with glue and your really active or even just an everyday girl who doesn&#x27;t mind giving herself a mani every week or so it&#x27;s a must have!</li>
            <li> I recently discovered this product and it is truly amazing. It dries extremely fast and leaves a beautiful glossy shine on the nails. I&#x27;ve used it on top of the cheapest to the most expensive nail polish brands and the effect is the same - simply brilliant. It takes about 5 minutes to dry fully on two thick layers of nail polish.</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years, love it!  Makes my manicure last several days longer than other top coats.</li>
            <li> Helps to color nails fast!</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST fast drying top coat that I have ever used.  It applies smoothly and literally dries your nails to the touch in a matter of 5 minutes.  I can apply this top coat over two coats of polish and 5 minutes later be in bed for the night and wake up without any imprints or sheet marks.  If you use it on a pedicure you can literally be back in your shoes in just minutes.  The only con is that about half way through the bottle it will start to thicken up on you, but you can use a thinning agent and get the same results from a brand new bottle.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this top coat!</li>
            <li> Love this top coat.  It makes my home painted nails look better than a professional manacure.  Drys super fast as well.</li>
            <li> I had to try Seche Vite myself before I could believe the hype... and for the most part, it has lived up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, not only CAN you apply it directly onto wet nail polish immediately after application, but I&#x27;ve heard that you SHOULD do so to avoid weird cracking and chipping. Cuts down manicure time by a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, \\&quot;Dry Fast\\&quot; is no exaggeration. After 3 or 4 minutes my nails are dry enough to do pretty normal things around the house, and after 5 or 6 minutes they&#x27;re completely dry. Saves EVEN MORE time when you&#x27;re doing your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be lying if I said I never noticed the odor. It&#x27;s very strong and if that gives you trouble, then you may have a hard time using Seche Vite. But if you can get past that, it&#x27;s a really great top coat.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on all the great reviews.  I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars for &amp;#34;Dry Fast&amp;#34; ONLY.  I would give it 1 star for making my nail polish last only 1 day without chipping.  It dries super fast and has a great shiny finish but after the 1 day, the nail polish started chipping even faster than without the top coat.  I will not buy thing again and will be looking for another top coat.</li>
            <li> I have never had a top coat that dried within the 5 minutes that I applied it.  It is so shiny too! I could not be more pleased with this product.  I used to have to wait at least 1 hour for my polish to dry.  This is amazing!</li>
            <li> Did not dry nails as expected. Solution became quite thick and unusable. I had high hopes but waste of purchase for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if this is user error or what, but his crap causes my polish to peel within hours of application and complete drying time!!! My nails are very difficult to maintain polish anyway so I thought I&#x27;d invest in a better top coat.... Disappointment!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I knew I wanted to try it even though there were polar opposite mixed reviews. My polish didn&#x27;t shrink and I have a total hard dry. I painted my nails about 30 minutes ago and am not even worried about getting wretched sheet marks. I am so excited. One bit of advise; go with a bottle that&#x27;s not from a third party. If it&#x27;s from Amazon you&#x27;re safe. Otherwise, CVS has it for $8.99, Walmart.com for $8.48, Sally&#x27;s $7.99. If you see 2 bottles for $4-5 it&#x27;s probably too good to be true. Splurge because it&#x27;s truly worth it. Don&#x27;t waste money on a counterfeit. It is out there. I learned that the hard way with some CND Air Dry. Learn from my mistake!! Happy painting:)</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a friend as I was frustrated with chipped nail polish! I bought this at Sally Beauty supply for $5.99, not on Amazon, but I still wanted to review it. As others have said - this top coat dries SUPER fast (within a minute or 2) no matter how many layers of nail polish you have on. No need to sit still for an hour or worry about messing up your polish. I did not experience any &amp;#34;polish shrinkage&amp;#34; or thickening of the top coat as others have stated. When my nails are shorter this top coat seems to last longer. My polish usually lasts about 5 days without any chipping...and that is a pretty long time to me as I have used other top coats and experienced chipping within a day. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> It is MY opinion, this is the best top coat I have ever tried.  The shine is amazing. And it lasts</li>
            <li> just okay. i think this chips a decent amount. I thought i used this product before with better results—maybe it wasn&#x27;t the fast dry. I think this works just as good (if not better) then the Deborah Lippmann Addicted to Speed top coat.</li>
            <li> This top coat is unbelievable. Dries super quickly. At-home manis last for over a week without chipping and pedis for 2-3+ weeks!</li>
            <li> Ladies, this is the champion of all top coats!  I am very pleasantly surprised.  After 25  years of painting my nails, the search is over!</li>
            <li> I ordered this by recommendation, and I&#x27;m not that impressed. This didn&#x27;t really hold up like I expected. Maybe I am a bit more rough on my nails (I have 2 kids, that&#x27;s a lot of dishes and laundry!), but it chipped pretty quickly. When it&#x27;s just for myself or my 3 &amp; 5 year old, it&#x27;s a bit pricey for a top coat.</li>
            <li> This arrived SO fast! I was super excited when I got it. I&#x27;m pretty amateur when it comes to painting nails. However this top coat is literally a godsend and will make your nails look like you went to a salon. I did struggle with it a little at first however. Definitely put on the top coat when your polish is wet-I learned this the hard way, otherwise it will pull your polish and make your nails look less than. Also when painting your nails with this top coat make sure to not be a messy, ie getting polish all over, that&#x27;ll mess up your manicure as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This top coat even smells like you&#x27;re at the salon! Others may not like the smell but I don&#x27;t mind it. Overall a good buy! I didn&#x27;t wake up with waffle nails which was my struggle with all my other top coats!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on being a forever customer!</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously amazing.  I wish I&#x27;d found out about it years ago.  Never again will I go to bed thinking my nails were dry, only to wake up with the tell tale signs of bedsheet smudge!  I can paint my nails, throw on a coat of Seche Vite, and pick my kids up 10 minutes later and not worry about any smudging or knicks in the polish.  I painted my nails 6 days ago, and I only have  2 nails that have chipped polish (probably because I was peeling oranges).&lt;br /&gt;The only con is it is very smelly.  I&#x27;d keep a window open while using it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Before this, I had that Sally Hansen insta dry stuff and all it did was smudge my polish after it was applied. I got this the other day because I needed a new top coat. It dries so quickly. I&#x27;m very pleased with it. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have tried many top coat fast drying polishes and none of them compare to this. My nails are fully dry in as little as 4-5 minutes...not just the top, but the entire nail. It also gives my polish a fantastic shine. No need to look for another top coat.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite top coat. I use no other. I love that it dries so quickly. It stays shiny for a week or more. It&#x27;s the best and it&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>
            <li> I like this top coat.  It just seems to work better than all the other ones, and a lot of salons use it.</li>
            <li> This polish dries very quickly and leaves a beautiful shine on your manicure. However the next day, your nails already begin chipping. Horribly. More importantly, this top coat contains Toluene which rates a 10 (the worst possible score) on the Environmental Working Groups rating of harmful cosmetic ingredients. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is A-MAZING! I will never use another top coat. Dries in no time - literally less than 5 minutes - and the shine is off the charts.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the worst part of painting your nails? Waiting for them to dry, obviously. This product cuts that time (at the very least) in half. It makes it dry to the touch in minutes and then fully dry so much faster than the polish would ever dry without it. Just spend the $5 and I promise it will be worth it!</li>
            <li> Best top coat I have ever used. Fast drying. Shelac type shiny finish. Makes your home manicure look like it was done at a salon.</li>
            <li> I really like this top coat. I can use my hands within a minute of application! I used to have to wait 20 minutes after polish ing to do anything.the only one downside is the shrinkage around the edges.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading all the fantastic reviews to use over my OPI nail colors.&lt;br /&gt;This top coat peels off like scales of a snake in a few days and smells awfully strong :(&lt;br /&gt;I am not a professional manicurist so, maybe there are special ways of using this product?&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, will not buy again.. I will just stick with my Loreal top coat..</li>
            <li> I love this top coat as it dries super fast and leaves a great shine on your nails! love and will continue to repurchase!</li>
            <li> This product is incredible.  I have never been able to do my nails without messing up at least a couple of them due to slow drying until I used this, it really is unbelievable how fast it dries &amp; I mean DRY.  I have tried quick dry products (put on after manicure, top coat etc) from OPI, Revlon, Sally Hanson, the spray on types you name it. I let them set from 15 min to 1/2 hour and still if I touch anything the polish is ruined. With this I put the top coat on &amp; my nails are completely dry in 2-3 minutes. I could not believe it! Great product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how this top coat goes on. It dries really fast and leaves my nails very glossy! I usually do gel polish, but I like to use regular now and again. When I use this top coat, it feels nice and thick on my nails like gel. It smooths out any imperfections you may have from the color polish. I&#x27;ve recently learned they make a UV one too. I&#x27;m going to try that next.</li>
            <li> My nails and toe nails come out nice with this but sometime I wonder if this causes the shrinkage in the nail polish on day two but the quality is nice ... I would buy again!!</li>
            <li> I love this top coat and every friend I lend it to raves about it. I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; a few of them to friends who love it after trying it from me. I will simply not use any other top coat.</li>
            <li> The best top coat you will ever use. I always buy a few at a time so I&#x27;ll never run out.</li>
            <li> You can get stuff just as good for 80% less at the drug store.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. You can polish your nails, put this on top and run your fingers thru your hair 5 to 10 minutes later. Dries fast!</li>
            <li> This is a high quality gloss with a superb shine. I fell in love the first time i used Seche Vite as my top coat and I have been using it every since. I love the way it is designed to dry fast it dries in about a minute or sooner.</li>
            <li> i always saw this polish on blogs and at nail salons, and i finallygot it because itwas a great price. this polish is amazing</li>
            <li> Was a great price and came as expected.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Will absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li> It is really dry fast!</li>
            <li> amazing top coat. also make the manicure last longer than if i hadn&#x27;t used the seche vite top coat</li>
            <li> I have also used this product for some time.  It seals the polish and gives a long lasting shine to my manicure.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted! Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I really like this top coat - it does what it says it&#x27;ll do - it dries fast and leaves a shiny and smooth top coat. However, the smell is very strong - almost like a polyurethane smell. That&#x27;s the only disadvantage.</li>
            <li> Works great, but it fed sticky after few weeks.</li>
            <li> the quickest drying nail polish i have ever owned (and my husband can attest to my vast collection of polish). a great buy, for sure!</li>
            <li> This top coat is great!!! Fast drying and easy to apply, two coats and one every day for three days and you should be set for a week!!  Protect them with gloves while doing dishes though!!!</li>
            <li> Love this top coat so much!!!!! It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!!!!!</li>
            <li> As someone who always mess up a perfectly good polish job by bumping into something or touching it before it completely dries (no matter how long I waited), the Seche Vite Fast Dry Top Coat is a miracle in a bottle! It took about 15 minutes for the top coat to dry and harden (I still tried to keep my hands free for another 15-30 minutes just in case, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like I NEED to!). My nails has never looked so shiny and scratch free. I am very impressed with this topcoat and recommend it for everyone!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!  Love my new top coat, Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> This top coat  definitely makes your manicure look like you had it done in a salon, gives it that shine. I found that it makes a manicure last about 3-4 days depending on the brand of polish (and probably your base coat too) you put on under it. I also applied an extra coat the next day, and may be even one then day after that too (this stuff dries lightening fast so it&#x27;s not a big deal to me to have to reapply to make the manicure last longer). I have three little kids and do my nails in the evening before bed. I can use this top coat, go to bed shortly after finishing my manicure and I have no sheet marks on my nails in the morning. The extra coats I use revive the manicure so it looks fresh again. I would like to try this with a better base coat than what I am currently using and that may make the manicure last even longer. I do a lot of hand washing during the day too. You can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon either, it&#x27;s twice the price at stores in my area.</li>
            <li> This made my nail polish peel off within hours.</li>
            <li> Works great!  My daughter and I love it.</li>
            <li> Best top coat for any nail polish</li>
            <li> not that good as ads...</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!!! BEST &amp; fastest drying top coat on the market!!!</li>
            <li> When I received this, it was broken open. The bag it came in was soaked in the polish. Im sure the product is fine, but I bought basically nothing.</li>
            <li> Best top coat. Dries really fast, always goes on smooth and shiny, doesn&#x27;t chip for a long time. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail dry product ever.  I take this to the salon whenever I get a mani pedi just to make sure my nails are dry when I leave - it is that good!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that I can ever do with out this Vite Dry Top Nail Coat, I love it and it dries your nail polish really fast, I would recommend it every time for sure</li>
            <li> Makes my mani dry time a snap!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!!!!....Your nail dries real fast with a nice shine coat...LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> excellent product.  i love the shine it gives my nails -- just like a professional manicure.</li>
            <li> There are reviews on here that ask how this top coat has gotten good reviews, but I don&#x27;t understand how it got any bad reviews.  Maybe those people aren&#x27;t using it correctly, as the directions say to apply while polish is still wet.  I am an OPI addict, it is the only polish I use, with the exception of Seche Vite top coat.  The part I like most is you apply it after the final coat of polish and your nails are dry in minutes, with a high gloss finish.  There&#x27;s no waiting for an hour for color to dry just so you can apply a top coat.  My nailcolor lasts until I get bored &amp; change it, with little to no chipping at all (and I do dishes by hand, open cans, etc.).  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have oily nails (or so many a manicurist has told me at my disappointment at the short wear of my nail polish), and this stuff extends my manicure by days to a week.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Amazing top coat drys very fast . Definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> If you have trouble with:&lt;br /&gt;Dents&lt;br /&gt;Fingerprints&lt;br /&gt;Bubbles&lt;br /&gt;Sheet marks&lt;br /&gt;Being impatient and screwing over your manicure right after doing it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...then Seche Vite will be a godsend to you. I cycled through so many brands of polish and top coats, always ending up with the same frustrating dents and marks. And yes, I followed all the rules I could find about thin coats, waiting forever between coats, even refrigerating my polishes to reduce bubbling. Even other \\&quot;quick dry\\&quot; top coats would sometimes seal in the still-wet polish underneath and never allow it to fully dry (ending up squishy, kind of like a waterbed. Or like painting acrylic over oil.) No exaggeration here when I say I would sometimes do my nails FIVE HOURS before bed and still end up with sheet marks. I&#x27;m not saying I wasn&#x27;t doing anything wrong, but I sure as hell wasn&#x27;t able to figure out what it was, try as I might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally got Seche Vite. Dry to the touch almost instantly, and fully hardened within minutes. Let me put this is capital letters so that people skimming the reviews will tune in: USE IT OVER TACKY/WET POLISH. There, I said it. Now there&#x27;s no excuse for you to go home and slop it on over day-old dry polish, or straight on a dry nail bed. If you use it over dry polish, it&#x27;s much more likely to peel up. Unlike other quick-dry polishes, it won&#x27;t seal in wet polish in a bad way, not allowing it to fully dry. It will instead penetrate the layers of your wet polish and actually harden them. It&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for it&#x27;s durability, I have had varying results depending on what polish I have under it. Right now my nails are about 6 days old, and I have a few noticeable chips at the tips of 3 or 4 fingers. Which is not unreasonable. It certainly doesn&#x27;t chip any more than the other top coats I&#x27;ve tried, so I have no complaints there.</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever.  Makes my manicure looks like I just came back from the salon</li>
            <li> I only use this top coat for the last 4 years! Love it!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter how soon or late I apply this. it makes the polish chip off in sheets. Try Deborah Lippmann&#x27;s quick dry top coat.</li>
            <li> BEST top coat of all time!!! I used to be strictly Esse or OPI but my friend introduced me to Seche Vite and I&#x27;ve never looked back! It smooths out any unevenness and dries super glossy and almost makes it look like you&#x27;ve used a gel.</li>
            <li> best quick dry top coat i have ever used. will never use another brand.</li>
            <li> I used to use China Glaze&#x27;s top coat, but Seche Vite surpasses CG in a way I never could have imagined. Get this top coat if you want for your nails to look shiny and your polish to last for days without chipping.</li>
            <li> The product works great! I&#x27;ve never used a fast drying top coat, but when I started getting more into nail art, I wanted to buy a good one. After doing my reasearch I decided to try out Seche  Vite. As soon as it goes on it starts drying the underneath coat(s) and your whole nail is dry in less then 10 minutes ( depends on how dry your coats where before you applied the top coat) All in all, I love the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the picture provided are the ones I bought. The one on the right is the one I first ordered. It&#x27;s almost empty because I love it and used almost all of it!!! The seller was Red Carpet Distributer. This one came with a neat brush. The one on the left (second one I ordered) a, however, was from the seller bebeautiful. As you can kindve tell, the brush is messy, with hairs sticking out. I tried using it but the brush made it hard. My solution is to just finish using my first bottle and when it gone, trade the caps. I gave 5 stars because the product works well, however, you should do some research on the seller.</li>
            <li> Its the only top coat I will use.</li>
            <li> I will keep trying with this product, but so far it has only made my manicures a big mess. I must be using too much or something, because this peels right off within a day or so after use every time.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff. I&#x27;m never going back to another top coat. It dries my nails super fast and is super smooth!</li>
            <li> this top coat goes on smoothly, dries almost instantly, and prevents chips.  great for  your mani-pedi.  provides long lasting protection in a big way.  highly recommend.</li>
            <li> A must-have for any do-it-yourself nail polishing.  I&#x27;ve bought the product locally for years and found it on Amazon cheaper than I can buy it locally.  Put it on and within 10 minutes, you are good to go.  Works extremely well at fast drying as well as protecting the polish.  My nails look like I came from a salon and it lasts for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I heard so many wonderful things about this top coat and i got all excited. However I did not find it that amazing. Not sure whether i applied it wrongly or what but i feel the texture is too thick and sticky. I prefer revlon colorstay topcoat though both did not help fasten the drying time that much</li>
            <li> I used to always use China Glaze&#x27;s Fast Forward top coat.  This Seche Vite Top Coat is WAY better!  The formula is perfect, and holds it&#x27;s shine a lot longer than the other brand I used.  My manicures typically last about 5-6 days with this top coat (of course a good quality polish helps!)  Completely in love with this product!</li>
            <li> Makes any nail polish last a long time, even drugstore brand. A must-have for those who paint their own nails.</li>
            <li> I love having polish on my nails, it&#x27;s like an accessory to me. But I am very impatient and I always end up with smudged polish because I can&#x27;t wait for it to dry. With this my nails are glossy and dry within 20 minutes. I can&#x27;t live without it now that I&#x27;ve tried it!</li>
            <li> I heard of this top coat from many beauty bloggers and thought I would give it a try when I ran out of my last top coat. It does dry to the touch pretty fast, but is still soft for 30 min or so. Makes a beautiful hard, shiny shell on top of your nail color, but can be brittle  and chips if you accidentally slam your fingernail on a surface. Can cause some shrinkage of the nail polish, especially if you don&#x27;t wrap the tip. I like it, but not sure if I would re-purchase again, since there are so many other great top-coats out there! Great price on amazon though, can&#x27;t go wrong there.</li>
            <li> I liked that this was a fast drying top coat. I used it about 3 times now and each time I use it it chips off the very next day(in big flakes). I bought it to go over Konad nail polish while stamping, because it is a thicker clear coat and wouldn&#x27;t smudge the design. True that it doesn&#x27;t smudge the design, but what good is it if the polish comes off the next day and the design is ruined.</li>
            <li> This is a HG product.  I have used many different top coats.  This IS the best!!  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Favorite fast drying top coat. It&#x27;s the only one I use. I also use &amp;#34;Stickey&amp;#34; base coat. Together, using both, my manicures at home last 5 days and look really nice.</li>
            <li> I am paring this with the cnd stickey basecoat and its unbelievable how long my polish lasts now! Fast drying and super shine!!!!</li>
            <li> This is THE. BEST. EVER. ...I hate myself for waiting so long to try this topcoat. It looks beautiful, lasts long, it&#x27;s super glossy and dries fast. Seriously fast. I will never use anything else. Nothing compares.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on long enough, wears out. :( Dries fast though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of the apparently few that this didn&#x27;t work for. Even though this dried fast, it didn&#x27;t work. Not matter what nail polish I&#x27;ve put this over (Opi, Sally Hansen, Essie, Zoya, China Glaze) it peels off within a day.  I&#x27;ve even seen an entire nail&#x27;s polish pop off like a fake nail. This was a waste of money for me.  Will keep looking for a good top coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several top coats and realized how stupid I was for never knowing about Seche Vite in the first place! It dries in around 10 minutes and around an hour to really harden. The best part is if you didn&#x27;t perfectly paint your color, the top coat just smooths it out!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no denying that this top coat is quick-drying, but the odor is very strong. I use it in rotation with my extra-life Revlon top coat, only when I don&#x27;t have time to wait around. Otherwise, with the odor, I&#x27;d rather not use it. It works, so just decide how sensitive you are to chemical smells :)</li>
            <li> Seriously this is the most amazing top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  I discovered it upon a friend&#x27;s recommendation 10+ years ago and will never use anything else.  I&#x27;ve tried others but nothing compares... it lasts longer, dries faster, and stays shinier.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is BULLET PROOF! It dries incredibly fast, (and I have yet to see it clump on me, it&#x27;s not one of those products where before you can get a full layer of top coat on, it&#x27;s clumpy and you have to redo your entire nail) I love how I can layer this over a not yet dry second coat of nail polish! And it&#x27;s durable! My nail polish before wouldn&#x27;t go two days without chipping, now I get board of the polish on my fingers before I have any chipping!&lt;br /&gt;If there&#x27;s something bad I can say about it, it&#x27;s the smelll (What good nail polish product doesn&#x27;t smell?) It smells like transmission fluid or something!  The smell doesn&#x27;t stay though, and once it&#x27;s dry you&#x27;d never know it was there.</li>
            <li> Dry nails in a minute or so! Super shiny and elongates the life of any nail polish regardless the brand. It would usually last 4 days and no chip.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  Dry&#x27;s quickly &amp; durable. As my others run out, this will replace all my other clear top coats.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of dry fast top coat brands, and SECHE VITE is THE BEST by far! My nails dry so fast and it works for a long time. Also your nails looks so shine!!!!</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is my go to. I also like color clubs speed dry, but this is an old standard and anyone knows what a great performer this top coat is when its a new bottle. The only down side is the tip shrinkage if the coat is to thick.. but that&#x27;s livable.!</li>
            <li> work wonders , worth all the hype , drys in 1 minute , adds beautiful glassy shine for days , love it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this online but I bought it at Sallys Beauty Supply.  It&#x27;s a bit \\&quot;pricy\\&quot; and a 100% WORTH IT!&lt;br /&gt;I was in dire need to find a top and base that could help my polish from chipping, Seche Vite (top) and Salon Sciences (base) work wonders for me!&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, EVERY NAIL SPA I get my mani/pedi at I bring along my own Base &amp; Top coat because this way regardless of the quality of the polish&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m good for AT LEAST 2 and a half weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;excellent product... specially when paired up with Salon Sciences artificial base?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos!!</li>
            <li> I did use it once, it dried quickly but didn&#x27;t make my nails very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, there is a warning label on the bottle saying that &amp;#34;this product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.&#x27;&amp;#34; :/....</li>
            <li> The smell is the same as paint!!!extremely pungent!!! I put it on my nails once and it felt like burning even after I removed them at once. Don&#x27;t buy it, it will hurt your nails.</li>
            <li> Perfect product.&lt;br /&gt;It dries my nail polish so fast...</li>
            <li> It dries very fast and sets hard as nails. It makes my manicure last much longer.</li>
            <li> does have a strong odor, as most polishes.  Nice coverage and there is something about the brush that is better than most</li>
            <li> WHAT A FIND---LIKE IT A LOT</li>
            <li> What a great product! I&#x27;m usually pretty bad about applying a top coat, but this brand definitely makes it easy to use. I read another reviewer saying it&#x27;s best to apply while your actual nail polish color is still wet, and I&#x27;d have to completely agree with that! Not to mention it helped dry everything super quick which is a must for me. Regarding the smell, I feel like every top coat polish I use has the exact same smell, so this really didn&#x27;t bother me too much. Nail polish and awful smells just go hand-in-hand lol!</li>
            <li> Gotta use this quickly. Gets thick after 5 months.</li>
            <li> My favorite nail top coat. removes bubbles and smudges in my experience.</li>
            <li> When I have purchased this product before in a store, I LOVED it: it dries relatively quickly, gives a deep glossy finish, and protects even the cheapest nail polish, making it last 2+ weeks on my toes.  When I ordered from this seller, it arrived quickly, but turned thick, gooey, and unusable within 3 months. Will order from elsewhere next time.</li>
            <li> This is the best Top Coat you will ever use. Its looks like gel polish and will keep your color or natural nail super clean and shiny for two weeks.</li>
            <li> best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used hands down it does dry right away you can wipe your finger on the nail and no smudge marks are left behind but that doesn&#x27;t mean go bang your nail on a sharp corner lol</li>
            <li> I love this topcoat!  It helps the polish dry fast, shiny, and strong.&lt;br /&gt;I can usually get a week or more out of a manicure with this polish- I&#x27;m hard on my hands and my nail polish never holds up well.&lt;br /&gt;I have seen this at Target, but Amazon&#x27;s prices are always better.</li>
            <li> I cannot explain why this top coat does not work for me when for hundreds of others does, but it&#x27;s simply a fact. It dries quickly, however, starts chipping either the very same day when applied or the day after. I have tried it three times so far and always the same story. I have used it with approved polishes that last five days with Sally Hansen Double Duty base/top coat. Even the cheapest and noname topcoats I ever bought in a local drug store worked better...</li>
            <li> The dry fast top coat truly dries fast on your nails. You can return to doing whatever after less than 10 minutes. As for protecting the nail polish and keeping the color on, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be more durable than other top coats, at least for my nails.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year. You put it on your nails when they are still wet, it dries in a couple minutes to rock hard.&lt;br /&gt;You need to buy the restorer, this gets sticky about half-way through the polish. I am guessing because it dries so quick that when it is open it evaporates quickly.The restorer is well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t bought the base coat yet, it will be on my next order.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best top coat! Love how fast it dries and the glossy professional finish it provides. I won&#x27;t paint my nails without this. It&#x27;s a MUST HAVE for me</li>
            <li> This is the ABSOLUTE best top coat!!!  You can polish your nails, put on the Seche Vite, and in 1 minute you are ready to go.  No smearing, smudging, or chipping!  If you reapply a top coat everyday your polish will last up to a week or more.  I am a Mom of 2 and I have my hands in water all day long and my manicure will last when I use the Seche Vite top coat.</li>
            <li> I hate polishing my nails because by the time I get done I&#x27;ve messed them up already.  A friend recommended this product stating it &amp;#34;dries instantly, even thick polish&amp;#34;.  I was skeptical.  Not anymore!  This is a phenomenal product and literally dries all layers instantly.</li>
            <li> OMG! BEST.PRODUCT.EVER.  I spent a lot of time researching good top coats &amp; came across Seche Vite. I read the hype but was still skeptical about trying it myself. The reviews all said positive things &amp; it seemed just to good to be true. It was only $4.40 with free shipping so I figured what the heck, I&#x27;ll give it a go. I CANT IMAGINE LIFE WITHOUT IT. It is the absolute best top coat I&#x27;ve tried. It dries fast. Super fast. And gives a gel-like shine. Exactly what I was looking for. No more smudges &amp; mess ups while waiting for your nails to dry! You can find it at local drug stores (walgreens has it for $10.99) but I&#x27;d rather pay less &amp; I only had to wait 4-5 days to use it when I received it. It&#x27;s great for regular manicures &amp; nail art/nail stamping as well as glitter polishes. I paint my 2 coats of color, wait for about a minute after second coat &amp; apply a thick bead of Seche Vite. (It&#x27;s best used when polish is wet/still tacky) If you apply too much to the nail, no worries. As it dries it will even itself out giving you a smooth finish. I also found that any imperfections I made with my color coat, Seche Vite smooths &amp; evens out for a flawless manicure every time. It does have a powerful odor so I advise using it in a well ventilated area. Some people complain about the odor but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. If you can go to a nail salon &amp; handle the smell, you&#x27;ll have no problem with this because it&#x27;s not even half as bad. Some people have also mentioned that it thickens when you get halfway through the bottle so I&#x27;d recommend using Seche Restore which provides the ingredients that have evaporated from the bottle over time to get it back to its original consistency. When I run out I&#x27;m buying the larger refill size that is also sold on Amazon. I&#x27;m obsessed with it &amp; telling everyone I know about this product! Ladies, it&#x27;s a must have. This will be the last top coat you ever try!! Buy it now &amp; don&#x27;t waste time like I did... You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> The finish is great. This is super fast drying allowing for a great finish on any nail. Clear and will not dull color. Great price.</li>
            <li> No other top coat better than it! I swear by this stuff!</li>
            <li> Dries really fast &amp; makes your nails look great, salon style!</li>
            <li> I had this on my Amazon wishlist and my husband saw it and ordered it for me as a Christmas stocking stuffer gift. I did not realize how much I needed it!! I love painting my nails but they never last more than a day or so without becoming chipped or something. This stuff is AMAZING! My nials look amazing for days. Shiny too! And it drys in no time. I even painted my nails 30 minutes before bed and no sheet marks or anything the next day. If you don&#x27;t have this, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing. I love this stuff!! I wish I would have discoverd this stuff years ago! I&#x27;ll be coming back for more, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li> It worked well for a few months. I´ve tried to used last week and it was heavy and I have to throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was only half bottle used</li>
            <li> Be careful - this product is not compatible with every nail polish and may result in shrinkage or warping. However, it works with almost all the nail polishes in my stash and it really is the fastest drying top coat, resulting in a fabulous high gloss shine. Also, I did not find the smell of the product to be overwhelming at all. Use in a well-vented area and the smell is barely discernible.</li>
            <li> This is THE best topcoat I have come across thus far and I&#x27;ve used a few. I personally don&#x27;t mind the smell of it. However, I do make sure to seal the tips of my nails to make the manicure last longer. :)</li>
            <li> This product literally is fast drying. It&#x27;s not like the products that say fast and take forever to dry. It does what it says here. I&#x27;m not sure if the drying time varies depending on the polish under it but I have experienced a 2 min. dry time and I have painted my nails using this as the top coat and went to sleep under the covers without any marks in the morning. That was like a miracle.</li>
            <li> I bought this because there were soo many good reviews on it. I love how fast it dries and it is really shiny!! BUT i noticed that it chips literally within a day. I&#x27;ve tried so many times, but it seems to always chip either in the shower, or at school/ work, when I&#x27;m just typing etc. Not all my nails chip on the first day its usually just like 2 or 3 but by 3 or 4 days all my nails are chipped. :(  I love how fast and shiny, but  don&#x27;t like that it does not last very long.</li>
            <li> It is a fast drying top coat. Heard so much about this brand, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay almost $10 for a bottle in the stores. It works well and serves its purpose. However, this has such a strong smell. I know all nail polish has a strong smell but this one was much stronger. I&#x27;ve only used it once because of this.</li>
            <li> Before Seche Vite, I hated painting my nails. I had a box of polishes going to waste because I dreaded the drying time and the inevitable dents and dings in my half-dry manicure. Now everything has changed!! Seche Vite dries your nails rock-hard in a matter of minutes. It leaves a glassy shine and can even smooth out imperfections in your polish application, making a homemade manicure look professional. Try it over chunky glitter polish, or nail art, or Konad stamps to smooth out the nail surface. If I apply several heavy coats of Seche Vite it seems to &amp;#34;protect&amp;#34; my polish and keep it from chipping. You can basically glob it on and it still dries quickly. Even though it smells really bad, I don&#x27;t mind because it works wonders for my nails.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  Will definitely order again and again!</li>
            <li> I buy this for all of my friends and women in the family. Everyone is amazed that this quick dry really works! I&#x27;m a busy mom and this is the only way I can do my nails! It really dries completely within 3 minutes. I&#x27;m on my 5th bottle now. Amazon had the lowest price I had screen</li>
            <li> This is the best. My nails are very thin and this top coat keeps my nails from breaking and it&#x27;s very shiny.</li>
            <li> Loved!!!!! it really dry fast</li>
            <li> It smells a little weird at first but then you get use to it. :-) I love how it helps with the chiping though.</li>
            <li> this top coat is awsome it makes the nail polish last longer and it looks like you just had your nals done.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! Has my nails dry in less than 10 minutes! I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> While I have noticed some shrinkage on certain polishes (mainly glitters) when I wear Seche Vite, I love the fact that this makes my nails completely dry and rock hard within just a few minutes. It seriously cuts DIY manicure time in half!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product and seller.&lt;br /&gt;Price was right and got it quickly.&lt;br /&gt;You can polish your nails and put this top coat on and in 5 minutes do anything you want.</li>
            <li> This dries so quickly and doesn&#x27;t chip!  Manicure usually lasts about a week!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this stuff and won&#x27;t paint my nails without it! My nail salon also started using it, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Definitely something I&#x27;ll re-order and keep on hand (literally!) all the time.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat! It&#x27;s fast drying and anti-chipping. I do  a lot of typing at work and nail polish chips off easily, but it&#x27;ll usually last days longer with this top coat!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of Base and Top coat for sometime now and finding it for $5 online was an absolute steal!!  LOVE IT, will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> My nail polish chips easily</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even describe how amazingly good this top coat is one of the best out there. I love how it keeps your mani so nice and for so long and it gives it this lovely shine love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is THE best top coat that I have found -- and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  It really does protect your color.  If I get a small chip -- after 3-ish days -- I file down the rough edges to make it blend in, apply my normal manicure steps -- and with these occasional touchups, I can get a whole week out of a manicure.  In the past, if I did my nails in the evening -- even a couple hrs b4 bedtime -- I&#x27;d still have blanket marks in the morning.  Now, I can do my nails just b4 going to bed, and there are no blanket marks.  It does get thick, but not until you&#x27;ve used almost 2/3 of the bottle.  Even replacing this more frequently bc of it getting so thick is cheaper than a manicure at a salon.</li>
            <li> Great! Nails dry in 20 min!</li>
            <li> A friend referred this product to me as the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;fastest drying&amp;#34; top coat. I will agree with both after using it. FYI...it is thicker than I expected, but that doesn&#x27;t interfere with the way it works. It dries super fast and protects the polish perfectly. Its also great to reapply another coat (especially at the top) if you are noticing any chipping or rubbing off of the color!</li>
            <li> Works well to protect your polish but when you have designs it will smear them a little</li>
            <li> So I at first was very excited and pleased with this product. But after using it a few times, I&#x27;ve found it doesn&#x27;t hold up well at all. My nail polish ends up chipping rather quickly and it shrinks up on the polish, making it look odd. And the worst feature in my opinion is the smell! It is terrible and with its harmful chemicals, I just feel this product is not worth it. I ended up throwing it away and buying a Sally Hansen one at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Long lasting top coat in centuries. I cannot the smell but overall good product. Will purchase again and again! Great price!</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with this product.  I love that it&#x27;s really glossy and dries incredibly fast.  I hate it because I can never finish an entire bottle.  When you get to 1/2 down, the polish becomes thick.  You get to 2/3 down, and it&#x27;s un-usable, it turns goopy, so it&#x27;s thrown away.</li>
            <li> Just got my first bottle today and was so excited to try it out.  I have long, natural nails that I hardly ever paint because of chipping.  So, this is my hope for Seche Vite, I can paint my nails and have it last a good 5 days before I have to look down and think \\&quot;Hot mess!\\&quot;  And yes, I hand wash dishes (the killer of the great paint job!). So I slap on some polish and then slap on some Seche Vite and Wow, this stuff is great!&lt;br /&gt;First, my nails are hard as rocks!  I&#x27;ll probably never break a nail on a door handle again.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the shine is so pretty...&lt;br /&gt;Third, it dried pretty darn quick.  I didn&#x27;t time it or anything, but I&#x27;ve never done a paint job with a single base coat, 2 polish coats, and a top coat dried so fast that I was eating pizza 45 minutes later and not a smudge to be found.  Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Now this last thing is the reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars:  (and it could be user error, I admit it)but the very tip of my nails, the polish has pulled back on about half of my nails revealing just the tiniest sliver of white that really I can only see close up.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was my initial coverage not being as thick with the polish colors, the top coat, or perhaps these nails were more dry when I used the top coat. I&#x27;ll definitely have to practice more and update review later.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy overall and will continue to use it even if the very tips keep peeling back, it&#x27;s just so darn great!</li>
            <li> saw it on a review &amp; loved it, one happy customer great top coat! price is very good aswell !</li>
            <li> it does what i bought it for, very shiny and does not yellow when i smoke, a lot of top coats do.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Dries so quickly and lasts!</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking it would be as great as everyone says...but once it arrived, I saw a warned on the label that one of the ingredients is known to cause birth defects. I wanted to return it, as I have a little one around, and would love to have more! but Amazon doesn&#x27;t accept returns because it contains harmful ingredients. So now I&#x27;m stuck with it...and it says I need to contact the county to properly dispose of it. Really? If it&#x27;s that bad, it&#x27;s really not worth a longer lasting manicure...</li>
            <li> It works very well for me great product</li>
            <li> I used Seche Vite for years because so many people said it was the best. And I thought it was, but only because it dries so fast. It never seemed to prevent my polish from chipping; actually, whatever top coat the Vietnamese ladies use at my cheap neighborhood nail salon is far superior in terms of chipping. It doesn&#x27;t dry fast, but my manicure lasts at least a week. When I used Seche Vite, I always had chipping by Day 3. And shrinkage is definitely an issue. I recently tried Poshé because I&#x27;d seen it mentioned on some blogs and it was cheap at the beauty supply store. It dries even faster than Seche Vite. With Seche Vite, you still need to be careful with your nails for an hour or so, but with Poshé you&#x27;re good to go in like 10 minutes, 15 at the most. I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but my polish lasted 5 and 6 days without chips. There&#x27;s some shrinkage, as there will be with any fast-drying top coat, but it isn&#x27;t as bad as with Seche Vite. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see if it gets all gummy like Seche Vite does, but I figure I&#x27;ll just use the Seche Vite Restore with it if it does. Seche Vite is good, but I&#x27;m glad to have found something better.</li>
            <li> Hope this works the way it says it does.  First time I am trying this product and others just don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic for a quick dry, it lets my nails dry with in 20 minutes and it&#x27;s fantastic. It makes your nails look shiny and freshly polished. It doesn&#x27;t hold up against chips and scratches quite as well as other people say, but it does still help. I had to knock off a star because it has an absolutely horrible smell!</li>
            <li> the best top and dry coat...have been using it for years</li>
            <li> I have no idea why people rave so much about this product, i have tried it and it is absolutely terrible, it creates a film on the surface of the nail , which starts to peel off almost immediately, doesn&#x27;t even last 2 full days, if you use it as top and base coat, it doesn&#x27;t work either, it peels off  after just a day. Maybe the product itself was a fake, I really don&#x27;t know, why so many people think it is so great!</li>
            <li> Love this product !!  Really works !!</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever!!!</li>
            <li> Provides a beautiful, glossy coat and dries very quickly :) I&#x27;ve also dropped the bottle and it didn&#x27;t break!</li>
            <li> Great product. Drys insanely fast</li>
            <li> Seche Vite dry fast top coat is one of the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use OPI top coat but it does not prevent chips as well as this one.&lt;br /&gt;It has a somewhat thick texture that makes your nails dry fast and last more than 7 days.&lt;br /&gt;The high-end nail salons around my area also use it. The nail technicians speak highly of it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product acknowledged by both professionals and customers.&lt;br /&gt;The brand&#x27;s base coat is not as good as the top coat though. I would recommend OPI base coat.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have used it for years because it keeps my polish on longer and with great shine. It is half the price by going through Amazon.</li>
            <li> The best top coat that I have ever tried. It is very fast drying and has a brilliant shine.</li>
            <li> I bought this item based on all of the fabulous reviews, but I am so disappointed in this product.  I love the shine it gives, not going to lie, too bad it peels within minutes of putting it on my nails....hated that and would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is the fastest drying and glossiest topcoat I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I put two coats of fast dry nail polish from Avon and a coat of Seche Vite less than 4 minutes before putting on my winter coat and gloves. They still looked perfect...I cannot believe this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, the next time I purchased a bottle it was received in an original box that stated \\&quot;BIRTH DEFECTS AND REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES\\&quot; were plausible.</li>
            <li> My nails took just as long to dry with this as they do with regular polish.  Bettwr odf with the OPI quick dry!!</li>
            <li> It really does dry fast and it stays looking shiny for days.  Most polishes I&#x27;ve tried loose their shine after a day or so.  It looks like glass when you apply it, so shiny!!</li>
            <li> UPDATE 3/6/2016: I decided to give this another try because I actually lost my bottle of Sally Hansen Top Coat. I figured out there&#x27;s a trick to applying it to wet polish. You have to put a LOT of product on the brush. Enough so that it beads at the tip of the brush, and then you GENTLY pull it down the middle of your nail. You do not want the brush to make contact with your polish. The product should be goopy enough to make a sort of barrier between the brush and your nail so your design doesn&#x27;t smear. Try to finish the nail off in 3 strokes, one down the middle, and one down either side. It will level itself out. Try to keep it off your cuticle and skin because it shrinks as it dries and will peel back from your skin and makes the nail more prone to peeling prematurely. This time around I was able to apply a good coat except for one nail that had an excess amount of Seche Vite pool in one corner and as it dried, it wrinkled up. But the rest of my nails turned out good. I have to go to work in an hour and we&#x27;ll see if it can withstand 6 hours of hard labor. EDIT #2: I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. Glad I gave this top coat another try. It was a busy day at work. Scrubbing countertops with chemical cleaners, stocking the cooler, counting change in the registers, and not a single chip or dent in my nails. I let them dry for 2 and a half hours before going to work. I haven&#x27;t noticed any shrinkage however I don&#x27;t see an advantage to painting wet polish over dry polish. I would rather let my polish dry to avoid accidentally smearing the design, and you have less shrinkage. I feel comfortable upgrading my rating to 4 stars. The picture attached is after I came home from work.  OLD REVIEW: Probably the worst top coat I&#x27;ve used. The directions say you have to apply it to wet nail polish. I was using Sally Hansen&#x27;s Xtreme polish which is tacky dry in less than 30 seconds so the first time around, I was applying it to mostly dry polish. The top coat was peeling off within a couplehours. The next time I tried it, with a different nail polish, I alternated between applying color and this top coat. So I was applying it on very wet polish. Can you guess what happened? The brush pulled the colored polish right off my nail, unbeknownst to me, and tainted the entire bottle when I dipped the brush back in for more. There are now streaks of colored nail polish inside my Seche Vite bottle. So it doesn&#x27;t work on dry nails and it definitely does NOT work on wet nails! What a huge fail and waste of money. If you&#x27;re looking for an alternative, buy Sally Hansen&#x27;s Dries Instantly top coat. After Seche Vite, I tried OPI and it was equally as terrible. Sally Hansen gives you the shiny mirror-like look you want, smooths out nail ridges, and doesn&#x27;t drag polish designs. And it was a quarter of the price of Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> Makes your nails soo shiny and they dry so much more quickly! I definitely recommend this product for anyone that wants pretty nails</li>
            <li> I always wondered what to do after spending a long time painting my nails only to have them chip days later. A friend told me about this stuff, and I was not disappointed. It goes on smooth, drys quickly and keeps your polish looking new for twice or triple the time. The only drawback is the smell. It&#x27;s very strong. But honestly, after it dries, and I wash my hands the smell starts to fade. And it&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li> I have no idea how other people are having so many problems with this top coat. I&#x27;ve had nothing but excellent results! In fact, when it comes time to change polish, I have to SCRUB this stuff off. My polish doesn&#x27;t chip hardly at all and I leave my nail polish on for a week or so. I&#x27;m not easy on my polish either - I have kids and an OCD clean house, so I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands and cleaning, playing around with the kids, etc. It dries super quickly and contrary to what the number one critical reviewer claims, I&#x27;ve used this as a \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; to bring shine back to my polish and had no issues whatsoever. It does have an odor but I use it in a ventilated area (as you should do with any polish anyways) and I don&#x27;t have problems with it. I don&#x27;t like that it contains toulene but until there is another top coat that is in any way comparable to this one, I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I like this. It makes the polish pretty shiny and seems to help it last longer. The only thing I dislike is how thick it is and that it is not &amp;#34;3 free&amp;#34; like other polishes (it has toluene, which I&#x27;m kind of wary about). All in all though it&#x27;s a good option for the price.</li>
            <li> I started looking for this product after seeing it many times in YouTube videos containing nail art. It really does live up to its claims of drying instantly. My nails are set to touch within a minute, and hard to the point of hearing an audible &amp;#34;tap&amp;#34; when flicking them, with no risk of smudge, within 10 minutes. Although it&#x27;s fantastic for drying nails, it doesn&#x27;t do a great job at setting nail polish- I find that regardless of brand used, I&#x27;m still seeing chips within two days. But for setting polish, I haven&#x27;t found a better product yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will thicken up quite quickly if you leave the cap off or loose, so don&#x27;t do that!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long to get here. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks already and it works really great. Dries fast too. Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I am OCD about having my nails look perfect. I hate chips. But I do a lot of work with my hands so I was re-doing my nails every couple of days. I had a friend suggest Seche Vite and it did not disappoint. My nails now stay chip free for about a week. I know that still isn&#x27;t long but it&#x27;s a lot better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried AND it&#x27;s way cheaper and more practical than getting your nails done each week. Get it. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Dry Fast Top Nail Coat? They should change the product name!!! It;s the Fastest Drying Top Coat I have ever used!!!</li>
            <li> the best dry fast top coat i ever had!!&lt;br /&gt;you wont be dissapointed, after did my nail been washing disheds, shampoo my hair and gave bath  to my dog lol&lt;br /&gt;my nail still look fresh!!!!</li>
            <li> Goes on evenly and without imperfections. Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t cause any discolorations. Glad I read reviews on this brand and I have to agree with the majority that this top coat is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years and is the best top coat on the market!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product dries within minuets! doesn&#x27;t dull over time doesn&#x27;t chip. The only issue I have with it is that over a span of a month...  and I go thru So many bottles as I change my nail art every day . when you get to Half the bottle it starts to get stickey tacky.EVERY bottlehas done this. I have ordered NSI air shield to try. My nail girl swears by NSI air shield.[[ASIN:B0009FUZTW NSI Airshield Polish Sealant .5 oz.]]</li>
            <li> AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE BEST top coat EVER! so cool! it dries in like a minute and it looks like a gel manicure, even though it&#x27;s not! so glossy and shiney, no other top coat can ever have his affect or even 10% of this top coats awesomeness!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it came really fast too! use it with seche restore to get it back too it&#x27;s consistinsy when it gets thick. AWESOME!!! :D</li>
            <li> It makes ur nail polish dried within a seconds&lt;br /&gt;I always keep it with me its like a miricale</li>
            <li> Best top coat I have ever used. I&#x27;m very impatient and this definitely helped keep my nails!!!</li>
            <li> This puts such a nice shinny coat on my nails! It also seems to correct or hide any brush strokes left by nail polish.  I buy over and over again.</li>
            <li> This top is the best! Makes my nails looks so good and shiny. I used to paint my nails and they would never dry fast enough which would leave them looking like crap.</li>
            <li> Really love this top coat! Its super shiny and dries very fast with a perfect manicure finish. Also great thing is that when you want to take it off, it doesn&#x27;t take extensive rubbing with the remover.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat ever.</li>
            <li> A manicure isn&#x27;t a professional looking one without this stuff! Really seals it it to help the manicure&#x27;s staying power.</li>
            <li> Loved it at first! Dries SO fast and I could paint my nails every week or two (I like to switch up colors often). But after about two months of constantly painting my nails, MY NAILS STARTED DETERIORATING. Really strong chemicals in this. Beware. My nails are breaking in the middle of my nail bed, which has never happened to me before. They look awful! Just letting them breathe and grow out, but they&#x27;re still cracking and breaking. If you do use it, don&#x27;t overuse it. I&#x27;ll probably only use it once a month if I&#x27;m in a rush.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best topcoat I&#x27;ve used. It finishes like a gel manicure and it lasts much longer than other topcoats I&#x27;ve used. It also dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me, it made my polish shrink and peel away. It was terrible, surprised by all the great reviews</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is amazing!! I have tried so many different top coats and this one is hands down the BEST out there. Don&#x27;t waste your time one anything else.</li>
            <li> Best fast drying top coat I have used to date!  And best price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this forever and people always ask if I just got my nails done. I&#x27;m convinced my manicure stays because of this topcoat. I do use a base coat but switch around types on that one. I wash dishes, clean house, do yard work, etc. and the color stays.</li>
            <li> Love this! No more sheet imprints. Makes polish dry super fast!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve used because it dries my nails so fast and makes my life SO much easier. I&#x27;ve always had issues with messing up my nails because they didn&#x27;t try all the way. With this product, I don&#x27;t have to worry about that!</li>
            <li> People should not really use this product... Especially with the warning in the back of the bottle... According to the state of California this product has a dangerous chemical which can cause serious birth defects... But everyone is entitled to their own opinions of this product, but just a heads up...</li>
            <li> My nails looked great--the first day.  The peeling and chipping began the next morning, literally.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  Yes, I read and followed the instructions.  Quite disappointed.  I am going to try it with a couple of different nail polishes to see if I get better results.  If I do, I will come back and update my rating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and I love it. It dries the polish so quickly and with a beautiful shine minus the bubbles. It makes the polish last a while and nail polish tends to peel off my nails pretty quickly because they are so soft and thin. I always recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the Seche Vite that I&#x27;m used to using.  It&#x27;s not as thick, the bottle isn&#x27;t the same - and the brush is terrible.  Definitely just head to Sally to make sure you&#x27;re getting the real deal.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat and I must say this is the best I have ever used.I was looking for a top coat that dried fast and left a nice shine  this product dried in under two minutes just what I was searching for goes on well and is inexpensive also shipped very fast  so far after cleaning my house it has not chipped this will be a product I will use for now on.</li>
            <li> Product very thick and chips off right away.  I  don&#x27;t know if it has been sitting too long and is old.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Seche Vite Top Coat on Amazon because it was a bit more pricey at every store in my area. I heard it was a great top coat and I heard right! It dries fast, adds a beautiful finish to acrylic nails. Fast shipping! Would order again and again!</li>
            <li> This is a good quality top coat. It does take longer to dry than you&#x27;d expect from a fast dry top coat though.</li>
            <li> This product does seem to seal in the manicure pretty well. Use generously. Dries quickly. I saw this being used a lot on YouTube. After trying it out for a while, I bought more. It&#x27;s my #1 top coat now.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat.  There is no other top coat to buy.  It helps keep the shine and adds long lasting wear to your nail colors.</li>
            <li> Wow! This is, by far, the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  My nails dry super fast and they look like glass.</li>
            <li> this is some of the best top and base coat polish. Dries quick with a almost gel like finish.</li>
            <li> My favorite top coat. Arrived on time. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this topcoat, and you can&#x27;t beat the Amazon price.</li>
            <li> Dries through base coat and two coats of polish leaving nails nice and shiny!...THE best top coat that I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> Best of the best.  Keeps nail polish on for over a week and fast drying.</li>
            <li> Works great and drys in like 2 seconds worth the price !</li>
            <li> My favorite top coat for normal polish AND KONAD STAMPING.</li>
            <li> Where has this top coat been all my life? I&#x27;ll never use another!</li>
            <li> Sliced bread, move over.  This is the Best. Thing. Ever.</li>
            <li> Keeps my nails covered and lasting longer than it would normally. Leaves a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Dries very fast! Within seconds! Makes your nails look very shiny! But Don&#x27;t put a thick layer, it chips off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Best top coat I&#x27;ve used and the Amazon price is nice!  50% savings over local stores like Target...as long as you get the free shipping.  Painted my nails about an hour before bed....woke up to not one smudge.  I use another quick dry product afterwards but the quality and consistency of the Seche V is really perfect compared to my old top coat.  I&#x27;ll update on how many days I can get out of this manicure!</li>
            <li> Arrived in perfect condition, the product will please my girldfriend and really recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> i like it a lot. dries quick.</li>
            <li> I am torn about this product. The smell is absolutely toxic, but I guess it&#x27;s forgivable if it does what it says it does. However, I still find my nail polish chipping/wearing away at the tips of my fingernails, even when i sweep the brush along the edge of each nail. It&#x27;s not 100% effective, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Great fast drying top coat! Shiny and last long!</li>
            <li> You only need one coat over your polish and you are good! The polish dries super fast! I am happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I really like how fast Seche Vite dries. I go through a lot of top coats because I do my own nail designs and I&#x27;m doing my nails at least every other day. My only complaints about Seche is that it does cause polish shrinkage so it looks as if you have tip wear the next day. It also becomes very goopy half way through the bottle. But once you add Seche Restore, it&#x27;s usable again.</li>
            <li> This is such a bad top coat and it takes for ever to dry and when I wash my hands like in an hour it comes off</li>
            <li> Best top coat I have used.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Dries super quickly, but when I use it just directly on my nails, it turns a strange color brown at the ends after a day or two.</li>
            <li> Seriously this is the only clear coat you should ever use. Shame on you and everyone else that is not already using this. It makes your nails looks as though they were done by a professional. This is worth it and last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Dry really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Good price!&lt;br /&gt;easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;Really oily texture&lt;br /&gt;overall, like it, but will not buy another one</li>
            <li> Obviously it will dry fast.  I took off one star just because it doesn&#x27;t COMPLETELY dry until about 10-15 minutes depending on how thick you lay it on.  Great top coat compared to most out there.  Also it&#x27;s not obnoxiously shiny, just an overall great top coat.</li>
            <li> This top coat is literally the best thing that has ever to my life. I normally don&#x27;t leave reviews but for this I had to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the longest time I&#x27;ve been trying to find a top coat that worked well and dried fast. I&#x27;ve tried Sally Hansen products, Out the Door Top Coat, all of these, and none of them compare. With Seche Vite my nails literally dry in a minute, and within 15 minutes I can do the dishes, vacuum, run my fingers through my hair, etc. And no sheet marks at all! I&#x27;m totally guilty of always wanting to paint my nails right before bed and then I wake up and they&#x27;re ruined. Seche Vite literally made them stay glossy and they looked perfect in the morning. Seriously, it&#x27;s worth the money. The smell really isn&#x27;t any worse than nail polish remover smell and I&#x27;m sure the bottle gets thick over time but it&#x27;s kind of worth it. I always believe in spending more money for higher quality beauty products. It&#x27;s just worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: The nail polish bottle itself is VERY FRAGILE. I bought my first bottle of Seche Vite at Target and painted my nails only once with it. They looked great, super stoked, right? I was going on a trip that weekend and put the bottle in my bag to take with me. I dropped the bag on the floor, and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me or what, but it shattered and spilled everywhere. I was pretty devastated. So just be careful when traveling with it. Other than that, still worth it, as I went on Amazon and bought another brand new bottle because I couldn&#x27;t resist. Other than that, I honestly really found nothing wrong with this top coat.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful topcoat.  So far this is probably my favorite of all the brands I&#x27;ve tried but there are a few pros and cons as with most things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff dries fairly quickly, but isn&#x27;t INSTANT. You still have to wait a bit before touching your nails to anything but the wait time for me has been drastically reduced.  One issue I&#x27;ve noticed is if I apply too much color polish and then try to topcoat with this I sometimes get little &amp;#34;waves&amp;#34; in my work if I accidentally touch something because the top of the layer of paint will dry quick, but the bottom will still be wet.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend hopping into bed immediately after a mani or pedi for this reason.  Your sheets will leave all kinds of funky designs behind in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The edges will shrink in with this top coat.  I like the outsides around my nailbeds to be clear of polish anyways so this isn&#x27;t a huge deal for me, but if you don&#x27;t get close enough to the sides and top of your nail it could look funky, so take this into consideration when painting and don&#x27;t be afraid to get a bit closer than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing to be wary of is that when you put this stuff on it doesn&#x27;t always look even and the bottle can dry out faster than other products.  Sometimes it looks downright weird and gloopy when I put it on. The first time I used it I had a little freak out because I thought I ruined my mani I had just worked hard on, but fear not! When this stuff dries it is beautiful and all the weird glooping and uneveness evens out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these nit-picky things aside I really like this product.  The top coat is solid and leaves a beautiful finish to my nails.  If I&#x27;m in a hurry and my nails look nice and clean I&#x27;ll even throw this on alone because I think the finish is so nice and have cute, glossy nails.  The gloss isn&#x27;t overbearing, and it isnt underwhelming, for me it is just right!</li>
            <li> This nail polish dries within a minute of application and is shiny+hard after.  I used it as base and the entire nail polish cracked off the next day, definitely recommend that you only use this as top coat.</li>
            <li> It may smell like model glue but this is most def the best topcoat ever!!  I do my own nail art and it takes me some time, and with the usual top coats, even quick drying, I really can&#x27;t do much with my hands for the rest of the night if I want to keep them nice.  Not with this stuff, within 30 mins I can do normal everyday things and my work is not all marred.  I&#x27;m actually going to buy more while the price is right :)</li>
            <li> A little smelly but does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff. My nails last for almost two weeks when I use it and it helps dry your nails quickly meaning NO SMUDGES. I love you, Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> I only regret that I didn&#x27;t discover this sooner.  It&#x27;s all true.  You&#x27;re functioning and digging in your purse within an hour at most.  NO MORE SHEET MARKS on your nails the next morning.  I can go at least a week before any chipping occurs.  Excellent glossy shine, the likes of which I&#x27;ve never seen.&lt;br /&gt;This product is awesome awesome awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Get it.  Get two.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite top coat. I&#x27;ve tried so many top coats and this is hands down, pun totally intended! This is incredible. Nice and glossy, holds your charms, crystals etc. and it dries so fast. Just love it. It&#x27;s a must for a top coat!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this top coat.  It does dry very fast and hard.  It keeps the polish looking nice longer.</li>
            <li> My favorite top coat! I keep trying other products and I just don&#x27;t like them as much as seche vite.</li>
            <li> Now in the summer I change my nail color every two days, and it helps to have a fast dryer. This works, but I notice that it changes the color of the nail polish. It gives a yellowish top coat.</li>
            <li> , I have  used this product for awhile on others and on rare occasion myself. As  others have stated, it does dry fast and in under  5  minutes. The real product tends to be somewhat thick but spreads easily and covers minor flaws and evens the bumps from nail art and leaves a very shiny surface. I have noticed that different nail polish brands used underneath it can really affect the chipping and peeling of it. Some polishes (often cheaper ones) often will flake or peel off the next day while others I have used have stayed virtually chipless for more than a week. On toes it can last two weeks.  However,  it contains toluene as well as formaldehyde which both are toxic. Despite the pros, I&#x27;d rather not expose myself or others to these chemicals and have discontinued its use. I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars as a neutral review because it does work but to me health wise at the stake of vanity isn&#x27;t really worth the risk.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat. I usually destroy my nails after I do it but with this top coat, it dries instantly plus it&#x27;s really takes care of my nails.</li>
            <li> Love this top coat. Makes my nails hard and dries very fast! Great product!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat ever.  Ever. It dries quickly in a smooth gloss.  It doesn&#x27;t chip easily.  It is the top coat of my dreams!</li>
            <li> Seche Vite Fast Drying Top Coat is by far the best top coat I&#x27;ve used. For years I was an OPI devotee, and I assumed it was best if I used OPI topcoat with their polish. Seche Vite, however, has provided a much clearer and glossier finish than any other top coat I&#x27;ve tried. Also, it does not nick once it gets dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People tell me my nails look great all the time and they think they look professionally done. I think this is largely because of the glossy and clear finish I get from Seche Vite--though I will take credit for the years of experience, but a manicure or pedicure won&#x27;t look professional no matter how good you are if you don&#x27;t have a good top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that if I use and older bottle of Seche Top coat that I&#x27;ll be more prone to cracking of the top coat, but that&#x27;s only if I happen to pick up a bottle that is over a year old. Just be sure to keep a fresh bottle on hand and close it tightly, and this should help extend the life of your top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the one rev... Read more</li>
            <li> LOVe this top coat can&#x27;t count how many i have used in my life best ever dries so fast and very strong. Will continue to buy it. I would recommend getting a bottle of restorer as it does get thick this make applying easier and less wasteful.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in how easily it chipped</li>
            <li> Best topcoat ever! My nails usually chip the first day I paint them, and with this topcoat they last a good 3 days before a single chip. Even after the first chip, my nails stayed looking decent for over a week.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> Good but shrinks. I prefer &amp;#34;out the door&amp;#34; to this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty but it peels off within a day. I would be disappointed in this fact even it were just nail polish, but considering the point of this product is to protect the other coats, it&#x27;s even worse.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat that I have ever used. After buying this product, I will never buy another top coat again!</li>
            <li> Dries quickly, nails still look great after a few days.  The only complaint is the smell, but the pros far outweigh that one con.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the positive reviews regarding this product, I decided to try it. It does dry really fast, faster than any top coat I&#x27;ve used in the past. However, THIS STUFF PEELS OFF LIKE CRAZY. It also chips as well, this is not the product I thought it would be and in very disappointed with it. It peels off in one whole sheet, ugh!!! Frustrated.</li>
            <li> About as good a top coat as I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Perks your nail polish right off.</li>
            <li> This is the best..best...best for making your nail polish shiny and smooth.  Buy it!</li>
            <li> Pretty good sealing coat for nails. Especially good for dark colors, any brand.</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever. Dries fast and super shiny</li>
            <li> Good......... Dries really fast! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great price. Awesome polish</li>
            <li> Best topcoat I have ever used!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat that I have used, and I have used quite a few others. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Let me tell you something, if you weare this top coat, your polish is going to last for AGES!!!  This really is one of the better top coats out there if your number one criteria is staying power.  It also has the virtue of being very quick drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you have nails that tend to be unhealthy like I do (thin, cracks easily, etc.), you may want to look at a different top coat, either that, or alternate this top coat with a different one (which is what I do).  The reason being that it is such a good coating that no oxygen gets through AT ALL (either that or it&#x27;s just laden with nasty chemicals), and after a few weeks of wearing it your nails will start peeling like crazy unless you give them a vacation from this top coat.  I have discovered that if I alternate two weeks on, two weeks off, I can get away with wearing it.  Also, it smells really, really bad, like turpentine.  If not for those reasons it would definitely get five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, the other top coat I use when taking a Seche Vite vacation is Revlon.  It&#x27;s the only other one out there that can give this product a run for its money--polish lasts just as long (about 10 days), it smells less toxic, but it takes much longer to dry.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used!  It is super shiny and it dries super fast!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> best I&#x27;ve had. with washing dishes by hand &amp; giving kids baths, my opi &amp; this top coat lasted 1.5 weeks before I had to really repaint. amazing</li>
            <li> Basic top coat.  No better than anything else.</li>
            <li> The best top coat! Dries on so fast, I will often paint my nails just before bed with no smudges in the morning!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, I&#x27;m so glad I found it! Though it smells very strongly it works with any polish and is now the only top coat I recommend. I normally use this with China Glaze polish but it works well with OPI and cheapy polishes too. This is a major polish extender that every busy mom should try.</li>
            <li> Great top coat.  Dries fast and hard.  Works great when nails need refreshing between manicures or acrylic fills.</li>
            <li> Best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used!! It dries in under 30 seconds and lasts for at least a week. The price is awesome! Everywhere else I&#x27;ve seen this polish it&#x27;s been $6 or even $8, and on here i got it for around $4! Love love love and will absolutely order again when I&#x27;m getting low.</li>
            <li> Best topcoat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Good the first few uses then, too thick</li>
            <li> I have used Seche Vite many times before. It&#x27;s a great top coat. It dries super fast and it glossy and pretty. My only complaints are the smell and with some polishes it pulls away from the edge of the nail. It works so well though that I just suck it up and deal with the smell. I would buy this in a gallon if I could.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing top coat!  I have recently started stamping my nails and have tried several top coats with very disappointing results.  After carefully placing my designs on each nail, I would unavoidably find it smudged with the top coats I was using.  My research on the nail stamping blogs and the reviews on Amazon led me to Seche Vite. I ordered it on Amazon, but due to holiday mail traffic it is scheduled for delivery in a week.  To my surprise,  I found it while shopping at Target today.  I did my Christmas manicure in red and silver paisley and used Seche Vite as top coat.  It was very easy to apply, not to thick, and it did not smudge my beautiful nail art.  Love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It works ok but I like another brand  that I used better. this one took more time to dry even with me waiting 20 min. for the 2nd polish coat to dry. I think the one I like is called Maldvo? well, this one works but would buy the other brand over this one.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat. It dries super fast and it&#x27;s just an amazing top coat. definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very Good! I always use this top coat!!!</li>
            <li> This chips/peels off too fast for me.</li>
            <li> It is almost painfully strong smelling, but it does it&#x27;s job.  I always used to smudge my wet nails, but with this they dry in a minute or less and even I can&#x27;t mess them up in that short a period.  Also, I read other reviews that people found applying this polish to nails that had been dry for some time made the polish flake off.  This was not at all true for me.  I applied a second coat for more protection and shine several days after the first with no problems.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have used Seche Vite for years.  By far the best fat drying top coat on the market.  I can do my nails just before I go to bed and I never have marked up nails in the morning.  It leaves a wonderful shine and last for many uses.  About half the price than you will pay in a salon too.</li>
            <li> So far the best top coat I&#x27;ve found. .It dries fast without bubbling up and doesn&#x27;t peel as easily as most top coats.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different top coats and this one ROCKS. What used to take me 2 hours to dry now takes 10 minutes tops. For me it doesn&#x27;t increase the length of my manicure but it dries quickly and that&#x27;s what is most important to me. An amazing product.</li>
            <li> This is for real a fast drying topcoat. To me its worth the risk of whatever harmful ingredient is in it. In my opinion if it were truly deadly as people make it out to be then I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d be pulled from the shelves</li>
            <li> To the paranoids, this is not going to kill you if you&#x27;re using it once every couple of weeks. Just be smart and ventilate. For a little perspective, driving is by far one of the most dangerous things you can do daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the product, it works very well, as promised. It&#x27;s excellent for someone that always bumps their nails or is too busy to wait that long for nails to dry. My polish lasted almost two weeks as well. Gel polish is not an option for me because my nails grow very quickly.</li>
            <li> Dries very quickly but tends to peel off after a few days.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and is just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> this is a super top coat.  dries fast, very shiny and protects well.  i read a few reviews that said their polish peeled off.  i have never had this happen and wonder if they used a base coat before color and top coat.  i use seche base coat also and love it.</li>
            <li> I can not beleive how fast my polish dries using this.  It is truely a miracle in a bottle.  It does have a strong odor but if you are a nail polish junkie like i am its really not a big deal.  I love this stuff and will definately continue to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> This top coat, named \\&quot;Dry fast\\&quot; in French, does what it says it will.  Polish is dry to the touch in about 30-60 seconds and cured in about 5-10 minutes, depending on number and thickness of coats.  This, I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, a common complaint about this product is shrinkage.  So common, in fact, it&#x27;s been dubbed \\&quot;seche shrinkage.\\&quot;  This is exactly what it sounds like.  Somehow, when the top coat dries, it shrinks in, pulling the polish with it.  Even when tips have been wrapped, this stuff unwraps them in a matter of hours.  As a result, tip wear occurs within about half a day, chips occur within less than 24 hours, and polish pulls up from the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also contains toluene, which is no longer included in so-called \\&quot;3-Free\\&quot; products because of potential health hazards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product dries and hardens manicures quickly, which is why I gave it two stars, but I will keep looking for a quick dry top coat that protects instead of contributes to the ruin of my manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Drys/sets polish very quickly&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly shiny&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Contains toluene&lt;br /&gt;Smells really bad&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Seche shrinkage\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Contributes to polish chipping in less than 24 hours</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this top coat. Makes an at home nail polish look like an expensive manicure. So great!</li>
            <li> If you like to get your nails done, this is what you&#x27;ve been waiting for.  This product is great. 5-10 minutes and you are good to go!!</li>
            <li> dont hesitate about buying this product, it is wonderful....best i have ever used!! the smell that some describe was not bad at all and i am usually really sensitive to smells because of my migraines, but had no problems.</li>
            <li> I honestly think this is the best top coat ever. It dries so quickly, and dries the layers underneath. I *hate* waiting for my nails to dry, and this cuts the dry time down immensely. Within minutes I can do something without worrying about bumping and ruining my manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had with it was the extreme shrinkage it caused. Having a huge gap at the tips of my nails was a very unattractive look. I remedied this by wrapping my tips with the Seche Vite BEFORE applying it to the rest of the nail. I also let the tips dry just to make sure. Problem solved.</li>
            <li> This top coat has changed my life! For anyone who does their own manicures and pedicures, this is a must have! I can paint my nails, let dry for a few minutes apply this top coat, let that set for 5 minutes and go about my day without messing them up! I am obsessed with this! It makes painting your nails that much easier!</li>
            <li> Saw this top coat recommended in a magazine and bought it. It is the best top coat I have ever used. I used to do my nails twice a week. Now I can go 10 days between manicures. It dries almost instantly and keeps my nail polish from chipping. What could be better?</li>
            <li> This was a very small order.  It was a pleasure receiving it promptly. I was told that this is the best nail Top coat on the market.  I had no way to get it where I live.  This is great!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously used Essie Good to Go quick dry topcoat and SV is definitely a step up when it comes to dry time and high shine finish. Its also not too thick, which Essie often was. However, the harsh smell will definitely take some getting used to. Overall, this product is definitely worth the price here, which is half of what it costs to buy in stores.</li>
            <li> Love this top coat. Dries so fast and doesn&#x27;t smudge wet nail art.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0056C0LW4 Roll Call, A True Prison Story of Corruption and Redemption ( Roll Call Volume 1 )]] This is the best top coat available. My wife loves it. Thanks for making it so easy to get.</li>
            <li> Seche does what it says. Although, it gets thick. It still does the job. I love it. Your nails have to be painted at least for 30 seconds before applying the Seche. It&#x27;s great! I will be purchasing more!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Top Coat. It helps with chipping, and you can cover any brand of nail polish that might usually chip and the Seche Vite prevents the chipping. Strong odor from the bottle but who cares with an amazing, glossy, hard finished nail from home, right! Amazing, I&#x27;d recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> Read tons of good reviews and was excited to try this but I&#x27;m very disappointed. It dries fast but looks terrible. Here&#x27;s my list of pros/cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Dries fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Severe shrinkage&lt;br /&gt;Dries thin&lt;br /&gt;Dries with weird wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;Must apply to very wet polish or it&#x27;ll peel off easily&lt;br /&gt;Chips easily&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t apply the next day to refresh the shine, it&#x27;ll just peel off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given it several chances on several different polishes but I&#x27;m not even using the rest of the bottle because the shrinkage is so bad it makes my manicure look awful. I&#x27;m switching back to Sally Hansen&#x27;s Strengthening Top Coat. It dries hard, thick, and shiny and it&#x27;s only 3 bucks at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I have a base coat made by the same people and I have always loved it--works great. The polish stays on longer and my nails are well protected from the color (I use black nail polish). However, I was sort of disappointed by the top coat. My nails literally chip overnight. I paint them and I leave nearly an hour for drying--even though it isn&#x27;t needed considering this stuff dries in like 10 minutes. Then when I wake up, there are always small chips in the corners of my nail. After being out and about for a day, larger chips appear even without me doing anything to cause it. It&#x27;s pretty annoying, and it sort of defeats the purpose of having a top coat. Not awesome. Shiny, though!</li>
            <li> Keeps my nails looking like I just stepped out of the nail salon!</li>
            <li> My wife likes this but says it will not work as a basecoat like I read from another reviewer. When she used it as a base the paint flaked off within a day. As a top coat I think she is happy with it.</li>
            <li> I am in love. I have finally found a product that I can use that drys fast and wont chip! After day 2, I add a second coat and I&#x27;m good for at least a week and a half!!! Buy this!</li>
            <li> This top coat is so good. It postpones the need for a manicure. Just apply the top coat when nails are dull.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipper.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I purchased this top coat to use when doing my nails at home, but have also found it to be great to extend a salon manicure. A few days after I get my nails done, I paint this top coat over my nails and it helps prevent my nails from chipping. It dries quickly and gives a great glossy finish.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me... I swear, I sat perfectly still after applying this top coat for at least 10 minutes, and then moved very carefully for another 20.  Still managed to smudge my nails.  I was hoping this would be the solution to my constantly smudged nails, but, it didn&#x27;t dry fast enough for me.  Three stars because it is very shiny and did make my polish last a few days longer than usual.  I will try this again over a different brand of nail polish and see if it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I paint my nails about once a week.  Some might say that I&#x27;m obsessed, but I really think a 40-polish collection is small for girls these days... but I digress.  I used to have to reserve a good chunk of time out of my weekend just to paint my nails - not because the painting takes time, but because I have to sit idiotically still for hours waiting for the polish to dry, layer by layer.  No more - with this top coat, several layers are hard to the touch in 10 minutes flat!  (I usually wait about 15 min just to make sure, especially since I go a little crazy with the layers.  30 min if I want to engage in a nail-wrecking activity, such as washing the dishes or doing the laundry.  But infinitely better than the hours I used to (unsuccessfully) attempt to wait out!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this coat STINKS.  Definitely open a window before applying.  It&#x27;s worse than any of my strong-smelling polishes and coats.  But SO worth it!!</li>
            <li> I usually use the Sally Hansen Insta-Dri topcoat, which is about half the price when bought in-store. But when they were out of that, I grabbed a bottle of Seche Vite instead, since I&#x27;d heard so many good things about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice much difference. The shine seems the same to me. Both topcoats end up gloopy when they&#x27;re low and apply bubbly at that point. Both dry quickly, although the Seche feels &#x27;harder&#x27;. The biggest difference I have is that the Seche does some crazy polish peeling on me. I don&#x27;t know what it is that makes my polishes -- doesn&#x27;t matter which brand -- want to peel off within two days, but they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like this, but it was only OK. If I know I&#x27;m going to change my polish again in the next two days, I&#x27;d be fine using the Seche Vite again.</li>
            <li> I thought it&#x27;d be nice to save some money and skip manicures/pedicures one in awhile and just do them it at home between appointments.  I use this at a top coat along with Orly Bonder (orange-y with a purple cap).  And remember to wipe your nails with acetone-based (or straight aceton, as I opt to do) nail polish remover so that the nail polish &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; and your at-home manicure lasts.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff - dries very fast - no more smudges for me!!! Also makes my manicure last much longer with less chipping!!</li>
            <li> I am a nail technician, this is all I use</li>
            <li> It definitely dries super fast but oh boy does it peel off super fast as well! I think my manicure only lasted about a day or two with this before it started chipping. There are top coats from other brands that dry just as well/quickly without peeling off immediately. REALLY disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> It certainly dries fast. But you are not getting the highly glossy look probably at that expense.  I wish it was shinier.</li>
            <li> I took a picture of how my mani looked after 5 hours.  I am not a rough person.  I like to apply my manis before bed.  So this is how it looked after I slept.  I have NEVER had polish do this before.  I am hugely disappointed since I paid $8 for this.  It does as it promises, it does dry fast... But it chips just as fast.  Would not recommend at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to Add: I tried this again and I think my application was the culprit.  I either was waiting too long to apply the top coat (it should applied while polish is wet) or I was applying it on too thickly.  So far it has not chipped like before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA 4/8/14 I no longer use this.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or it simply is not compatible with my nails.  I do not know, but this stuff does not work for me.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know why people rave about this so much. Sure, it dries fast, but it makes my manicure chip within one or two days. It also shrinks the polish on my nail if i apply it after it has already dried, like if i wanted to touch it up mid week or something. And to top it all off it smells horrible. The only reason why I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars instead of one is because it dries fast and is shiny. Essie Good to Go does everything this claims to do (if not better) and actually lasts and can be re applied. I&#x27;m definitely going back to that.</li>
            <li> Got this last week and there are pros and cons to it so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Dries SUPER fast. Even over MANY coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Seems very very thick and gooey. But, it is easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And whats with the smell? So weird, doesn&#x27;t smell like any nail polish I&#x27;ve ever smelled before.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat ever! It dries super quick although the smell is pungent, but you get used to it. This is better than Out The Door Top Coat, that I originally thought was the best top coat. BUY BUY BUY!</li>
            <li> Usually I end up messing up my paint job before my nails are dry, but this top coat dries super fast and very hard. I haven&#x27;t worn it long enough to know if it chips/lasts, but I&#x27;m pleased just with the quick dry time.</li>
            <li> I applied the this top coat and it dried very quickly! I am so glad i bought this product! I swear it dried in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought this and followed recommendations to paint over still wet nails. Sometimes this means they take longer to dry, or stay &amp;#34;malleable&amp;#34; after I have put on the top coat. It is very very shiny but sometimes chips!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t drag the polish, doesn&#x27;t shrink, doesn&#x27;t crack or chip under normal use. Dries insanely fast. So like I said, it&#x27;s made of magic.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat ever. Dry&#x27;s very fast</li>
            <li> Fast shipping..great product!</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and well packed.  The top coat is the worst I have ever tried.  It goes on nice and glosses, dries quickly but peels off within 24 hours.  Would not recommend</li>
            <li> Super glossy. Nails dry almost instantly. No more waiting for my nails to dry and then still having them get messed up. Hated that. This stuff is AMAZING!!! My nails were good all week with NO nicks, chips, or peeling. I was hard on them this week. Scrubbing and cleaning my bathrooms, hanging a light fixture, painting, and working a full work week. And they were almost perfect at weeks end. Highly highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I&#x27;ve ever tried!!  I am always changing my nails and this allows me to do that without having to spend 10+ minutes waiting for my nails to dry. It&#x27;s awesome I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this quick dry top coat. It is very glossy. It has a strong smell to it, but it wears off. If you do nail art, be sure the colors are dry before applying the seche vite, or apply with a light hand as it can smear colors (i had trouble with a design using a black Essie).</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with my nails getting smudges and &amp;#34;sheet marks&amp;#34;/gouges-even when I would do them HOURS before any activity/bed. I no longer have that problem!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is truly a miracle product for me!! It dries within 5min and I am able to do ANYTHING without getting smudges/marks in my nails-that is so nice!! It does not matter how many coats of polish I use, it will handle all of them! It also coats nail art nicely(rhinestones, fimo, glitter, etc), has a beautiful shine, and protects my manicure from chipping/wearing(and doesn&#x27;t peel off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having 3kids(12, 9, and 15mos), I was often unable to do my nails just because I never had a 4hr block to allow them to dry(I am not exaggerating), now I do them every 2-3days like I used to before I had a crazy life!! I am even able to intricately and properly do my 12yr old&#x27;s nails and she is far from patient-after she sits for 5-10minutes, no problems(I used to hate spending 30min on her nail art only to have it ruined the minute she walked out of the room)...its like having a super hard coat of protective varnish on your nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say enough about how great this product is!! I am a convert, I will never buy another topcoat!!</li>
            <li> I completely regret buying this. It peels off in a day. It looks nice at first, but then peels way too fast.</li>
            <li> I have heard about this topcoat from all the favorite nail bloggers, so I just HAD to try it and I am in love, I will never try a different one now that I have found this topcoat. It is super shiny doesn&#x27;t smudge designs or stamping nail art. I would recommend getting the thinner by seche vite as well because the nail polish will become very thick once it is about half way. It dries very quickly and makes nail polish underneath dry faster and very hard. Love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> absolute must have for doing your nails at home. As good as a salon manicure anyway</li>
            <li> Best topcoat I&#x27;ve ever used. Extends the life of my polish by weeks. It&#x27;s amazing. Especially if you are in a rush to get ready &amp; need your nails to dry quickly. I paint right over wet polish with no problems.</li>
            <li> This polish (when worn alone, as a base, or as a top coat) made my nails so brittle...in less than 24 hours. My nails actually bend now, they are usually strong. I did my nails yesterday using this as a top coat. They dried fast but the polish started chipping today. It made my polish peel off in large chunks, not just little nicks. My color was completely ruined with chips in about 16 hours. This was my second try with it and these are the same results as the first time.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other high quality brands when I could not find this but none work as well.  Nails are completely dry and smudge proof in minutes. It gives a shiny hard coat to polish and is chip proof for at least a week.</li>
            <li> Nails dry super fast and left a nice shiny coat.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and like it very much.  Unfortunately, I live in a small town so I have to buy it over the internet and pay shipping on it; however, it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I love doing my nails now!  Seche dries my nails so fast! I no longer have to sit around and wait for my nails to dry and it does not leave any bubble looking splotches on my nails.  This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> The only reason I didnt give this polish 5 stars is because the blush for the polish is tilted side ways and it is very hard to make a straight line with the brush is wanting to paint my skin and not the actual nail.</li>
            <li> Best topcoat ever!  Smooth and shiny finish.  Makes my regular manicure last a week without chipping.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish for its quick drying time.  I can&#x27;t use any other topcoat anymore!!! I highly recommend this product.  I also got the nail polish shipped to me sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Very fast drying will order again</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Tried it for the first time and it dries faster than any they use in the nail salons.  Usually when I leave the salon i have been under their lamps and fans for 15 minutes and my nails are still damp and get scratched.  This stuff had my nails dry within 5 mintues!</li>
            <li> This and &amp;#34;Out the Door&amp;#34; are my two favorite top coats. I don&#x27;t know how I survived before discovering these two top coats. Dries super fast and keeps your polish shiny and glossy for DAYS! I love it!</li>
            <li> POISONOUS..DON&#x27;T KNOW WHY PEOPLE STILL BUY THIS!!  READ THE LABEL..INGREDIENT &amp;#34;TOLUENE&amp;#34; GETS INTO YOUR BLOODSTREAM AND IS HARMFUL..STOP SAYING THIS IS THE BEST OP COAT EVER ALL YOU MANICURE JUNKIES...IT IS KILLING YOU!!!</li>
