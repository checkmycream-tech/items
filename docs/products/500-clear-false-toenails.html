            <li>it was absolutely satisfying...</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this to all girls who love fancy nails</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>So glad I found them.</li>
            <li>More like a fingernail.</li>
            <li>and I still love the sturdyness</li>
            <li>These are seriously fantastic!  </li>
            <li>wou;d buy more.</li>
            <li>more packs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just make sure to use non-acetone nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>The others were ok.</li>
            <li>I love the nails.</li>
            <li>I was able to hit the beach.</li>
            <li>They fit my tiny toes perfectly and are better than brands I&#x27;ve found at drugstores.</li>
            <li>Once I glued it on &amp; polished it, it looked pretty good.</li>
            <li>These are awesome but took a long time to get here</li>
            <li>Your feet get the most use of your body all day every day so when they look good they usually feel good or you feel good about them.  </li>
            <li>Great and look very natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised how great these are.</li>
            <li>I got the clear ones and once I painted them they looked great.</li>
            <li>and you have to file the bottom to fit as well as the top</li>
            <li>They break soooo easily.</li>
            <li>Also breaks easily.</li>
            <li>I love the full cover nails for your fingers they have here.</li>
            <li>but they are all huge.</li>
            <li>The price is great if you have smaller toe nails.  </li>
            <li>these were ment to fit</li>
            <li>And as funny as it sounds, I wasn&#x27;t confident with my feet</li>
            <li>The shipping was pretty quick, the quality of the nails was good (the very tips of them are jagged</li>
            <li>I love the clear tips so much better than the opaque tips.</li>
            <li>so far I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased...</li>
            <li>so I decided to purchase these and use them until I was satisfied with my real toenails.</li>
            <li>it looks cute and im ready to put it on my toenails today..</li>
            <li>If kept full length, the ends will crack if you jam your toe into something.  </li>
            <li>love these toenails so much.</li>
            <li>But they look 100% better than real toenails.</li>
            <li>I think work best, they are thick and durable, but need to be beveled out on edge</li>
            <li>Luckily for me the nails are as the shape of my toes, so I don&#x27;t really have to file except if I cute in length which probably takes like 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>These nails are flexible, the right fit and stay on well with super glue.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s on free edge really well.</li>
            <li>So only use acetone if you want to take the nails off before they fall off on their own.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth ordering but don&#x27;t expect the quality of drug store brands.</li>
            <li>They are the right size for me....</li>
            <li>The surface of the nail is very easy to paint a solid color or do nail art on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put one coat of polish on them and my real nails and they are the most natural looking nails ever.</li>
            <li>Plus, these are clear, which makes them easily paintable (as opposed to the drugstore ones that I&#x27;ve seen pre-painted).</li>
            <li>but hey it was my first attempt ever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so difficult to keep them perfectly shaped and painted neatly.</li>
            <li>Such a better value than what you get at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>They are very cheap and worth every single penny because of all the time they save you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nail polish also goes right on and dries fast.</li>
            <li>but other then that they work, they all come nicely bagged in separate bags and numbered, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>For the price, you&#x27;re really getting a deal.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s 50 of each size, and its really just a matter of getting them glued and to your size.</li>
            <li>They glue on very well</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>They look real.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re comfortable too if applied properly.</li>
            <li>I could just be too much filing on my part.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use them.</li>
            <li>These toenails are absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The largest nail just perfectly fit&#x27;s my big toenail</li>
            <li>Thanks to the people who made these.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my toenails to big</li>
            <li>I dare say that no humans toenail has this much curvature.</li>
            <li>Each nails sides are cut straight and look unnatural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The toenails come quite long, which makes them easy to apply because there&#x27;s plenty of nail to hold onto.</li>
            <li>Sizes and shapes are more realistic than other brands.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re actually not bad; I only needed some for</li>
            <li>Thanks to these little helpers I don&#x27;t have to hide my feet away any more.</li>
            <li>These  are okay, but half well toe nails</li>
            <li>I just use regular super glue to apply them.  </li>
            <li>People might think its a strange thing to be excited over but think about it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty long but were very easy to trim down to normal length.</li>
            <li>Having short little toe nails during the summer isn&#x27;t always cute, having these made my feet look pretty.</li>
            <li>I only needed one of the sizes ( I lost a big toe toenail to an accident many years ago) and EVERY single one in that size had a split in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product went straight to the trash !</li>
            <li>They are a bit long and had to be trimmed, but that was easy enough.</li>
            <li>unlike most I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Makes my toes look like a professional pedicure!</li>
            <li>I put on a Gel Toe Cap, LARGE TOE to keep water from getting underneath and possibly causing fungus growth when in bathtub or shower...</li>
            <li>I guess I have extra large big-toe nails.</li>
            <li>I will still be using these for other people, but i doubt that I go through them quickly.</li>
            <li>spent ten minutes trying to get them to fit on my fingers before I realized der derr derrr</li>
            <li>You might also want to rough up the surface of your real toenails with a file before applying the fakes so that the glue has something to really grab onto.</li>
            <li>I had been hiding my feet for nearly 2 months before I found these...</li>
            <li>Looks soo natural.</li>
            <li>Good idea in theory, irrelevant in practice.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that they are thin,not too thick like others</li>
            <li>So when I stumbled (funny thing to say) upon these while looking at nail polishes, I was astonished that they actually had such a thing.</li>
            <li>I had to get my big toenail removed a few years ago and have never figured out how to paint it to look like the rest of my toenails, (which I always kept painted a bright red, until I got the one removed) because with one not painted it looked odd.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the ones that used to be available at Walmart for some time, but they are so thick that they don&#x27;t conform well at all to the natural curve of my toes, and would pop off after a couple of days once the glue weakened a bit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Use plenty of glue on your real toenail and also put a drop on the fake toenail (more than one drop on the big toenail).</li>
            <li>real toenails are extremely brittle, they break and peel all the time.</li>
            <li>The other sizes are fine, but the biggest toe nail in the package is still too narrow for my toe.  </li>

            <li> These  are okay, but half well toe nails</li>
            <li> I just use regular super glue to apply them.  </li>
            <li> People might think its a strange thing to be excited over but think about it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty long but were very easy to trim down to normal length.</li>
            <li> Having short little toe nails during the summer isn&#x27;t always cute, having these made my feet look pretty.</li>
            <li> I only needed one of the sizes ( I lost a big toe toenail to an accident many years ago) and EVERY single one in that size had a split in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product went straight to the trash !</li>
            <li> They are a bit long and had to be trimmed, but that was easy enough.</li>
            <li> unlike most I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Makes my toes look like a professional pedicure!</li>
            <li> I put on a Gel Toe Cap, LARGE TOE to keep water from getting underneath and possibly causing fungus growth when in bathtub or shower...</li>
            <li> I guess I have extra large big-toe nails.</li>
            <li> I will still be using these for other people, but i doubt that I go through them quickly.</li>
            <li> spent ten minutes trying to get them to fit on my fingers before I realized der derr derrr</li>
            <li> You might also want to rough up the surface of your real toenails with a file before applying the fakes so that the glue has something to really grab onto.</li>
            <li> I had been hiding my feet for nearly 2 months before I found these...</li>
            <li> Looks soo natural.</li>
            <li> Good idea in theory, irrelevant in practice.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that they are thin,not too thick like others</li>
            <li> So when I stumbled (funny thing to say) upon these while looking at nail polishes, I was astonished that they actually had such a thing.</li>
            <li> I had to get my big toenail removed a few years ago and have never figured out how to paint it to look like the rest of my toenails, (which I always kept painted a bright red, until I got the one removed) because with one not painted it looked odd.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the ones that used to be available at Walmart for some time, but they are so thick that they don&#x27;t conform well at all to the natural curve of my toes, and would pop off after a couple of days once the glue weakened a bit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Use plenty of glue on your real toenail and also put a drop on the fake toenail (more than one drop on the big toenail).</li>
            <li> real toenails are extremely brittle, they break and peel all the time.</li>
            <li> The other sizes are fine, but the biggest toe nail in the package is still too narrow for my toe.  </li>
            <li> The package comes with enough nails to last a long time.</li>
            <li> They are really long to be toe nails, so you have to spend a good bit of time cutting and filing them down...</li>
            <li> I would suggest getting a professional acrylic nail tip clipper so that you don&#x27;t have to spend 10 years filing them down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them on for a week and have only had to replace one big nail because I jammed my toe and cracked the nail.  </li>
            <li> Super thin plastic, cannot be used.</li>
            <li> The largest nail is not large enough to cover a big toe.</li>
            <li> You have to be gentle when applying them or they will crack if pushed on too hard.  </li>
            <li> I cut them ends because I don&#x27;t like how long they are.  </li>
            <li> These were much smaller than I expected for toe nails.</li>
            <li> They actually arrived before they were expected to.</li>
            <li> The nails are long and curved over just like a fingernail.</li>
            <li> Well now I can put my painted toenails on display in my open toed shoes, sandals, flip flops, or plain bare feet.</li>
            <li> These were thin and not shaped quite right for toes.  </li>
            <li> The plastic is very thin and doesn&#x27;t fit toenails.  </li>
            <li> I had my big toe nail removed several years ago and have used fingernails in the past, never getting my two big toes to look alike.</li>
            <li> The sizes are also smaller than other store bought ones...</li>
            <li> the little toes are so big i cant even uses them.</li>
            <li> If you have wide toe nails you might want to read the description though because the biggest ones aren&#x27;t too wide.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t what I expected so</li>
            <li> poor dont like to stay on no matter how much glue you use.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that it took a really long time to arrive and you have to be careful with your foot activity because they might crack or something if you like kick a hard ball.</li>
            <li> I usually wear the smallest size big toe in a pack from Kiss, but that is the largest size in this pack.</li>
            <li> A bit long and require some cutting but exactly what I was looking for .</li>
            <li> Realistically, this product will only work for a small VERY small person, and I’m considered tiny!</li>
            <li> the smaller toes were hard to get on</li>
            <li> As a woman with average size feet (7.5 ft U.S.)</li>
            <li> These are less painful and more flexible than the ones I usually buy in the stores.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that I didn&#x27;t have the right sizes for the big toe.</li>
            <li> For example, the large fake nail was ¼ inch too narrow to cover my existing toe nail bed.  </li>
            <li> Too flimsy and too short what&#x27;s the point of wearing fake nails if your real nails are long than the fake toe nails.</li>
            <li> but I do think the nails themselves were a little shorter</li>
            <li> Btw, purchased a couple from different sellers on Amazon at different prices...turned out to be the same garbage :(.</li>
            <li> They are thin enough to conform.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend these ones to all my friends, family &amp; a few salons</li>
            <li> I had to apply a heavy amount of nail glue and acrylic just for it to not be flimsy.</li>
            <li> These toenails are not easy to apply nail polish to or apply.</li>
            <li> For starters, the fake nails are way TOO NARROW to accommodate the width of the entire nail.</li>
            <li> warning, they are a bit small.</li>
            <li> If you have to use the largest size in Kiss or Nailene brand fake toenails, these will likely be too small for</li>
            <li> Worst of all many had splits in their centers or bent tips.</li>
            <li> not sure whos toes</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a very small person with extremely narrow feet.</li>
            <li> also have to cut them down dramaticly.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the plastic used in these fake nails are very hard and thick.</li>
            <li> I do have to say when I complained, my $ was refunded.</li>
            <li> Like the idea of false nail bed being clear, however, the fake nails are poorly designed.</li>
            <li> slow shipping.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly but the quality is horrible.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re like a thin plastic.</li>
            <li> They came broken</li>
            <li> but they are quit thin</li>
            <li> And seriously, you can&#x27;t beat $3 for 500 of them!</li>
            <li> Sorry, not ordering again.</li>
            <li> this product is completely useless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the size I need is not included.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look fake.</li>
            <li> Nobody would guess they are fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use fake toenails all the time for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting quite the stockpile of random sizes.</li>
            <li> Some crazy glue and nail polish</li>
            <li> Very small , very disappointed :-(</li>
            <li> they lasted a week which shocked me</li>
            <li> Horrible product!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The ease to use...I will tell family,friends,clients and neighbors to sign in at amazon to purchase this item and more</li>
            <li> these are the best nails for someone who has had their large toenails removed ... I put one coat of polish on them and my real nails and they are the most natural looking nails ever. I have purchased many brands and these are, by far, the best. I only can use 1 of the sizes. I would love it if I could just purchase that size.</li>
            <li> Nice and flexible.  Great and look very natural.</li>
            <li> A bit long and require some cutting but exactly what I was looking for .</li>
            <li> For the price, you&#x27;re really getting a deal. There&#x27;s 50 of each size, and its really just a matter of getting them glued and to your size. Luckily for me the nails are as the shape of my toes, so I don&#x27;t really have to file except if I cute in length which probably takes like 30 seconds. Nail polish also goes right on and dries fast. Just make sure you get a good glue that will stick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised how great these are. They fit my tiny toes perfectly and are better than brands I&#x27;ve found at drugstores. They glue on very well (I use nailene glue. Best I&#x27;ve found) and look like professional pedicure. They&#x27;re pretty long but were very easy to trim down to normal length. Very happy and will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> My big toenail broke so it was cut really short so I didn&#x27;t like the way it looked. And as funny as it sounds, I wasn&#x27;t confident with my feet haha so I would avoid wearing sandals. But summer was coming up so I decided to purchase these and use them until I was satisfied with my real toenails. And these are awesome. They look real. Make the polish seem shinier. Only thing is that it took a really long time to arrive and you have to be careful with your foot activity because they might crack or something if you like kick a hard ball. They&#x27;re like a thin plastic. They&#x27;re comfortable too if applied properly.</li>
            <li> it looks cute and im ready to put it on my toenails today.. I just have to buy glue:)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it was 500 piece but as of talking about the price? it was absolutely satisfying...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this to all girls who love fancy nails</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Change it daily and paint it however I like. Makes a great summer time solution for sandals and flipflops</li>
            <li> I love these tips! They are the perfect fit. I love the clear tips so much better than the opaque tips.</li>
            <li> They came broken but they are good!!! Not there fault it was transit so buy these!! ❤️</li>
            <li> The shipping was pretty quick, the quality of the nails was good (the very tips of them are jagged so you will need to file them, good price but I do think the nails themselves were a little shorter then I would have liked. But over all they were a good buy.</li>
            <li> I still have my big toe nail. I see a lot of reviews are from women who have their big toe nails removed or damaged. The other sizes are fine, but the biggest toe nail in the package is still too narrow for my toe.  When I purchase the ones from the local pharmacies, I don&#x27;t even use the largest one in those packages, I use size 2 (0 and 1 are larger). Sorry, not ordering again. It&#x27;s a shame bcz I love the full cover nails for your fingers they have here.</li>
            <li> while my &#x27;lost&#x27; toenail grows out I can cover it with a #2 size, put polish on my toes and go ~~~ I had been hiding my feet for nearly 2 months before I found these...Perfection! I put on a Gel Toe Cap, LARGE TOE to keep water from getting underneath and possibly causing fungus growth when in bathtub or shower...so far I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased...TYVM</li>
            <li> I love these. I had my big toe nail removed several years ago and have used fingernails in the past, never getting my two big toes to look alike. These nails are flexible, the right fit and stay on well with super glue. So glad I found them.</li>
            <li> Not what I was looking for.  I wish they sold one size for people who have lost toenails.  These were thin and not shaped quite right for toes.  More like a fingernail.</li>
            <li> Love it! Looks soo natural.</li>
            <li> I love these perfect various sizes these allow me to have the perfect pedi while I grow out my toes! Will reorder when its time !</li>
            <li> They work. One big toe nail kept splitting. I could just be too much filing on my part.</li>
            <li> These were not usable.</li>
            <li> Good to practice nail art on</li>
            <li> Good idea in theory, irrelevant in practice. Like the idea of false nail bed being clear, however, the fake nails are poorly designed. For starters, the fake nails are way TOO NARROW to accommodate the width of the entire nail. For example, the large fake nail was ¼ inch too narrow to cover my existing toe nail bed.  As a woman with average size feet (7.5 ft U.S.) this product is completely useless. Secondly, the plastic used in these fake nails are very hard and thick. Realistically, this product will only work for a small VERY small person, and I’m considered tiny! Had to throw them away. Btw, purchased a couple from different sellers on Amazon at different prices...turned out to be the same garbage :(. Save your money!!!</li>
            <li> it took forever to arrive so when it did I forgot what they were. spent ten minutes trying to get them to fit on my fingers before I realized der derr derrr they were formy toes. the smaller toes were hard to get on but hey it was my first attempt ever. they lasted a week which shocked me cause I was wearing shoes not flip flops.on my second attempt and I still love the sturdyness</li>
            <li> Good price.  . .kinda slow shipping. And not a lot of sizes. Not for ppl with big nails</li>
            <li> Too flimsy and too short what&#x27;s the point of wearing fake nails if your real nails are long than the fake toe nails. I want my money back!!!</li>
            <li> These are seriously fantastic!  I&#x27;ve been using the ones that used to be available at Walmart for some time, but they are so thick that they don&#x27;t conform well at all to the natural curve of my toes, and would pop off after a couple of days once the glue weakened a bit.  THESE?.....THESE are wonderful!  They are thin enough to conform.  You have to be gentle when applying them or they will crack if pushed on too hard.  There are perfect sizes for all my toenails in there that perfectly lay on the nail bed without having to be pushed down at all.  If kept full length, the ends will crack if you jam your toe into something.  I cut them ends because I don&#x27;t like how long they are.  I&#x27;ve had them on for a week and have only had to replace one big nail because I jammed my toe and cracked the nail.  I just use regular super glue to apply them.  And seriously, you can&#x27;t beat $3 for 500 of them!</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price. If you have wide toe nails you might want to read the description though because the biggest ones aren&#x27;t too wide.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re actually not bad; I only needed some for the big toe cause I injured mine years ago and the nail won&#x27;t grow back. Once I glued it on &amp; polished it, it looked pretty good. However, if you&#x27;re in a hurry then I suggest you try finding these in a store or purchase from a company in the USA.  It took forever for mine to arrive. I do have to say when I complained, my $ was refunded.</li>
            <li> Love these! Having short little toe nails during the summer isn&#x27;t always cute, having these made my feet look pretty. I got the clear ones and once I painted them they looked great.</li>
            <li> Some nails are to big for my toes. Polish will not stick to them.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly but the quality is horrible. They break soooo easily. I dont know if i will purchase them again.</li>
            <li> would like it if you could buy only one size. great product for the money. good quality. wou;d buy more.</li>
            <li> Very small , very disappointed :-(</li>
            <li> WE LIKE THESE. DELIVERED AS PROMISED.</li>
            <li> These toenails are not easy to apply nail polish to or apply. And no instructions. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> These were much smaller than I expected for toe nails.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the size I need is not included. I guess I have extra large big-toe nails. The largest size 0 that I&#x27;ve seen in the Kiss brand is not included here.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t what I expected so I don&#x27;t really use them.</li>
            <li> These are awesome but took a long time to get here even if from china......they look perfect..... They are the right size for me....my own nail salon</li>
            <li> They are really long to be toe nails, so you have to spend a good bit of time cutting and filing them down...but other then that they work, they all come nicely bagged in separate bags and numbered, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Perfect camouflage for a damaged toenail.  Sizes and shapes are more realistic than other brands.</li>
            <li> Love love love!!! Got a email that these had been delivered- couldn&#x27;t wait to get home to try them. Within 30 minutes I had them applied and painted. Went to gym and ran 2 miles later that evenings- no problem at all.  My tip:  I clipped the falsey to the shape I needed before glueing- did not need to file forever like some comments I saw</li>
            <li> These toenails are absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fair warning, they are a bit small. The largest nail just perfectly fit&#x27;s my big toenail and I&#x27;m a very small person with extremely narrow feet. If you have to use the largest size in Kiss or Nailene brand fake toenails, these will likely be too small for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these toenails so much. They don&#x27;t look fake. Nobody would guess they are fake. But they look 100% better than real toenails. They allow you to have perfectly shaped toenails that are easy to polish. The surface of the nail is very easy to paint a solid color or do nail art on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My real toenails are extremely brittle, they break and peel all the time. It&#x27;s so difficult to keep them perfectly shaped and painted neatly. This is the perfect solution. I&#x27;m going to use fake toenails all the time for the rest of my life. Already bought two more packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toenails come quite long, which makes them easy to apply because there&#x27;s plenty of nail to hold onto. I would suggest getting a professional acrylic nail tip clipper so that you don&#x27;t have to spend 10 years filing them down. I got mine for $1.50 here on Amazon. They are very cheap and worth every single penny because of all the time they save you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use plenty of glue on your real toenail and also put a drop on the fake toenail (more than one drop on the big toenail). You might also want to rough up the surface of your real toenails with a file before applying the fakes so that the glue has something to really grab onto. This will make them last longer. Mine stay on for two weeks and some change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can change the polish as often as you&#x27;d like. Just make sure to use non-acetone nail polish remover. Acetone based nail polish remover will dissolve the nails. So only use acetone if you want to take the nails off before they fall off on their own.</li>
            <li> The largest nail is not large enough to cover a big toe. The others were ok. Disappointed that I didn&#x27;t have the right sizes for the big toe.</li>
            <li> Such a better value than what you get at the drugstore. Plus, these are clear, which makes them easily paintable (as opposed to the drugstore ones that I&#x27;ve seen pre-painted).</li>
            <li> These were smaller then those that I have purchased from a store in town.  The price is great if you have smaller toe nails.  I will still be using these for other people, but i doubt that I go through them quickly.</li>
            <li> The product is perfect and seller sent it right on time! I would buy from this seller again! The only reason this didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because the biggest size doesn&#x27;t even cover my big toe nail, and I don&#x27;t even have big toes!</li>
            <li> Good for the price but they are quit thin and you have to file the bottom to fit as well as the top unlike most I have used in the past. Over all for the price it&#x27;s worth ordering but don&#x27;t expect the quality of drug store brands.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that they are thin,not too thick like others</li>
            <li> These are the best nails &amp; I&#x27;ve tried them all. I&#x27;d recommend these ones to all my friends, family &amp; a few salons</li>
            <li> I had to get my big toenail removed a few years ago and have never figured out how to paint it to look like the rest of my toenails, (which I always kept painted a bright red, until I got the one removed) because with one not painted it looked odd. So when I stumbled (funny thing to say) upon these while looking at nail polishes, I was astonished that they actually had such a thing. Isn&#x27;t that a hoot? Well now I can put my painted toenails on display in my open toed shoes, sandals, flip flops, or plain bare feet. Now I can paint them all and put my best foot forward as the  fashionista I was born to be. Thanks to these little helpers I don&#x27;t have to hide my feet away any more. Thanks to the people who made these. People might think its a strange thing to be excited over but think about it. Your feet get the most use of your body all day every day so when they look good they usually feel good or you feel good about them.  I recommend these to anyone who has unsightly looking toenails, ( and you know who you are) to use these and make your feet beautiful again.</li>
            <li> These are less painful and more flexible than the ones I usually buy in the stores. They have stayed on longer and have survived several polish changes. They are a bit long and had to be trimmed, but that was easy enough. I only wish I could just buy only the size I need. I&#x27;m getting quite the stockpile of random sizes. The sizes are also smaller than other store bought ones... I usually wear the smallest size big toe in a pack from Kiss, but that is the largest size in this pack. So if you have larger/wider big toes, this probably won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my toenails to big</li>
            <li> I love the nails. The sizes are good and nail polish adheres to the nails just as if they were your own. The package comes with enough nails to last a long time.</li>
            <li> These  are okay, but half well toe nails I think work best, they are thick and durable, but need to be beveled out on edge that&#x27;s on free edge really well.</li>
            <li> I had to apply a heavy amount of nail glue and acrylic just for it to not be flimsy. Also breaks easily.</li>
            <li> The plastic is very thin and doesn&#x27;t fit toenails.  Horrible product!</li>
            <li> I had a toenail fungus and until I made it to the doctor  I was able to hit the beach. Some crazy glue and nail polish and I was good to go</li>
            <li> Great for beginners. They actually arrived before they were expected to.</li>
            <li> This product deserves zero stars! While they arrived almost instantly and they were packed well the nails themselves are not useable. The nails come sized out into individual plastic bags.The nails are long and curved over just like a fingernail. I dare say that no humans toenail has this much curvature.Each nails sides are cut straight and look unnatural.Worst of all many had splits in their centers or bent tips.I only needed one of the sizes ( I lost a big toe toenail to an accident many years ago) and EVERY single one in that size had a split in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product went straight to the trash !</li>
            <li> Everything that I wanted was what I got. The description was perfect and the picture is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Super thin plastic, cannot be used.</li>
            <li> poor dont like to stay on no matter how much glue you use. also have to cut them down dramaticly. not sure whos toes these were ment to fit but they are all huge. none of the corners are rounded there square all the way around.. the little toes are so big i cant even uses them.</li>
            <li> Use these all the time!  Makes my toes look like a professional pedicure!</li>
