            <li>Made detangling easy!  </li>
            <li>Beautician used this on my hair, works great not heavy and smells good.</li>
            <li>Perfect for natural curls, softens and moisturizes easily without grease and stiffness.</li>
            <li>but this is an okay product I would recommend anyone to try it as a beginner leave in.</li>
            <li>Can I say I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>This has become my one of my favorite go to products for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to my hair becoming stronger with each use.  </li>
            <li>Made it easy to detangle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad; but it hasn&#x27;t landed in the favorite category yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It calms the hair down and gives it a wonderful shine.</li>
            <li>Avalon KeraCare natural texture leave in conditioner makes my hair extremely soft and easy to detangle after washing and it smells wonderful as well!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff on my natural twa, it helps my curls to pop even more while adding moisture.</li>
            <li>OMG, my curles look amazing, so definited, so shiny, so soft.</li>

            <li>Well, I absolutely fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>It is true to its name</li>
            <li>Becuase this does not combat frizz for me on its own, I use the Clear Protein Gel (see my review), then I use my Sweet Almond Oil.</li>
            <li>Definitely 5 stars for sure!</li>
            <li>and it felt so good while it was wet.</li>
            <li>It is seriously the best thing ever at a really reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The product was the right consistency but my hair just didn&#x27;t respond to it.</li>
            <li>I simply preferred the TRESemme Naturals Nourishing Moisture Conditioner as a leave-in way better.  </li>
            <li>I used to love it back in 2012.</li>
            <li>I love it, nice slip, left his hair silky soft, and you could see the shine while it was wet.  </li>
            <li>I use it after every wash and it makes for easy blow drying and flat ironing when i choose to do those styles.</li>
            <li>I expected better from Keracare.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hairdresser recommended this product and it works very well on my daughters hair.  </li>
            <li>and afterwards applied an ample about of this leave in, it made my little bush very easy to comb thru</li>
            <li>Wish I had this product years ago when I first went natural!  </li>
            <li>So here I am now, ready to buy another one of these babies, regretting the day I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I love this entire Keracare Natural Hair line for African American hair.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this creme conditioning product, which conditions and gives greater hold for my thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I had really damaged hair a few months ago and this was the only thing that really tamed it and kept it super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves her naturally curl pattern hair soft and moist.</li>
            <li>So I purchased this to go with the KeraCare Natural Textures Defining Custard.  </li>
            <li>A site about natural hair care recommended it and I will buy again.</li>
            <li>Not heavy or sticky.  </li>
            <li>KeraCare&#x27;s Natural Textures leave in conditioner</li>
            <li>each strand coils and hair is soft and pliable.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s transitioning from keratin treatment and is trying to define her natural curl pattern.</li>
            <li>This Natural Textures Leave In Conditioner</li>
            <li>I need to order me some more!!!it left my hair very soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>african american w.2 children of diff hair types but works very well on either (1.fine and wavy, 2.</li>
            <li>Some, such as the American Crew creme have been good products and have calmed and conditioned my hair, whilst others have been a thin liquid and have simply conditioned without giving any control.</li>
            <li>I even add a few drops to water and some essential oils in a bottle to use as a moisturizing hair refreshing spritz should my hair dry out during the day.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t bad nor good in my opinion</li>

            <li> /&gt;Sadly, I ran out of it a few months ago and stupidly decided to buy the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Hair leave in&amp;#34; instead.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> it helps soften my hair.</li>
            <li> Great when between washes!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer..african american w.2 children of diff hair types but works very well on either (1.fine and wavy, 2. a bit courser</li>
            <li> Beautician used this on my hair, works great not heavy and smells good. All you need is very little conditioner.</li>
            <li> The best leave in conditioner you can buy. Perfect for natural curls, softens and moisturizes easily without grease and stiffness.</li>
            <li> Love this leave in! I wish the bottle was bigger. My hair is med/long, but I do not stretch. prefer the shrinkage look (makes my hair look fuller). My curles are 3 A/B/C.  My hair is thin (a little too thin for me, but I&#x27;m almost 50 and my hair has never been thick). I put some conditioner in the palm of and hand and finger through, This smells amazing. Becuase this does not combat frizz for me on its own, I use the Clear Protein Gel (see my review), then I use my Sweet Almond Oil. OMG, my curles look amazing, so definited, so shiny, so soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cream based leave in conditioner, which weighs my hair down. Also, I did not like the smell of the product either.</li>
            <li> The product was the right consistency but my hair just didn&#x27;t respond to it. That&#x27;s life; it happens. I would tell other people to purchase it...</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous \\&quot;Leave in Conditioner\\&quot; products such as American Crew, Tiggi, Olive Oil, Schwartkopf to name but a few on my thick wavy hair. Some, such as the American Crew creme have been good products and have calmed and conditioned my hair, whilst others have been a thin liquid and have simply conditioned without giving any control. This product which contains amla, shikakai, argan &amp; abyssnian oils is a thicker creme like conditioner which holds as well as conditions. It calms the hair down and gives it a wonderful shine. If you have thin hair, this product may be too thick to use on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this creme conditioning product, which conditions and gives greater hold for my thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this to go with the KeraCare Natural Textures Defining Custard.  I don&#x27;t know.  Honestly, I&#x27;ve only used this conditioner twice so this may not be a fair assessment.  I simply preferred the TRESemme Naturals Nourishing Moisture Conditioner as a leave-in way better.  It&#x27;s not bad; but it hasn&#x27;t landed in the favorite category yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, I will give it 3 stars.  Once I try it again, I will submit an update.</li>
            <li> Feels good in my hair and it&#x27;s an awesome detangler. A site about natural hair care recommended it and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff on my natural twa, it helps my curls to pop even more while adding moisture.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!! Made my hair silky.  I&#x27;m looking forward to my hair becoming stronger with each use.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I work at a Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store and have been transitions for about nine months until I finally chopped off my relaxed hair. I was conflicted between purchasing the keracare leave in conditioner or the As I Am, so when in doubt I went with the cheapest one(with my employee discount) so I purchased the keracare along with the &amp;#34;AMAZING&amp;#34; Denman brush. I washed my hair with kera care shampoo then conditioned it with the elasta all ultra hydration conditioner(love it!) and afterwards applied an ample about of this leave in, it made my little bush very easy to comb thru and it felt so good while it was wet. The smell isn&#x27;t bad nor good in my opinion but I been using everyday for about a week now along with other products but I&#x27;m still trying to find something to soften the texture if my hair but this is an okay product I would recommend anyone to try it as a beginner leave in. Probably continue to use it for anothe month then try the as I am</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they changed the recipe but the ingredients are not natural in this one that I was sent. It dried my hair out completely, total waste of money. Very disappointed. I will not be buying this product again. I used to love it back in 2012.</li>
            <li> My hair felt moisturized.  Made it easy to detangle.  Not heavy or sticky.  I will be using this product a lot!</li>
            <li> KeraCare&#x27;s Natural Textures leave in conditioner is the best leave in I have ever used. The slip is remarkable and makes detangling of the hair quite easy.</li>
            <li> Can I say I LOVE this product.  Wish I had this product years ago when I first went natural!  I wash or wet hair, mix with oil and hand comb through- each strand coils and hair is soft and pliable.</li>
            <li> This has become my one of my favorite go to products for my hair.  I use it after every wash and it makes for easy blow drying and flat ironing when i choose to do those styles.</li>
            <li> Just so so. I expected better from Keracare.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone with kinky tight curls. My hair felt as soft as silk and along with a wide tooth comb, my tangles disappeared...Blow drying was a breeze.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hairdresser recommended this product and it works very well on my daughters hair.  She&#x27;s transitioning from keratin treatment and is trying to define her natural curl pattern.</li>
            <li> I got it on sale last year at JCPenny and only paid like 5.00 dollars for it. I had never heard of this brand, but I had ran out of my other leave in conditioner and decided to try this one out. Well, I absolutely fell in love with it. I had really damaged hair a few months ago and this was the only thing that really tamed it and kept it super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I ran out of it a few months ago and stupidly decided to buy the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Hair leave in&amp;#34; instead. It left my hair so gross, it&#x27;s definitely not worth all of the money I paid for it. So here I am now, ready to buy another one of these babies, regretting the day I decided to try something new. It is seriously the best thing ever at a really reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It is true to its name</li>
            <li> This is one of the greatest leave-in conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used.  After using Keracare&#x27;s Cleansing Cream, you apply this conditioner and your hair just &#x27;drinks it in.&#x27;  This Natural Textures Leave In Conditioner provides the &#x27;slip&#x27; naturalistas have come to expect from a great conditioner.  I even add a few drops to water and some essential oils in a bottle to use as a moisturizing hair refreshing spritz should my hair dry out during the day.  This Keracare Naturals line is the best!</li>
            <li> Avalon KeraCare natural texture leave in conditioner makes my hair extremely soft and easy to detangle after washing and it smells wonderful as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural and I must say best leave in conditioner ever!!! I need to order me some more!!!it left my hair very soft and manageable! And it smells soo yummy!!</li>
