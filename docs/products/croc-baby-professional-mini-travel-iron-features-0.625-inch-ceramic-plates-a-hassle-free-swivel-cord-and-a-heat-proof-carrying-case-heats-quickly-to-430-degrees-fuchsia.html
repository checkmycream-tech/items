            <li>Heats up quick and works great.</li>
            <li>I loved how easy it was to put away</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been an awesome straighten since I received my pixie haircut.</li>
            <li>The iron heated up nicely and I loved the packaging and the mat included to place hot iron on.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the bag and the convenience of just putting it in my purse.</li>
            <li>It looks way better.</li>
            <li>I was able to straighten and curl with it, love that it comes with the case as well.</li>
            <li>this will be going on many trips with me.</li>
            <li>This iron at the most may have heated to 300-350.</li>
            <li>so I was able to use it abroad without issues.</li>
            <li>I love the size; it&#x27;s perfect for short hair.  </li>
            <li>Love the size and travel convinience.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for short hair.</li>
            <li>It came fast, very good price and its very convenient !!</li>
            <li>Love it and it is so easy to use and travel with.</li>
            <li>This mini flat iron is the perfect size and it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>I also love the light weight.</li>
            <li>Other than that I think It was a great buy!</li>
            <li>Used it in Madrid and worked just fine with an adapter - no need for a converter.</li>
            <li>This little iron was wonderful on a trip to Italy.</li>
            <li>, It would heat up, then the light would go off and it would shut itself off.</li>
            <li>The heat proof case was very useful too.</li>
            <li>Great Flat Iron!!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this and the day</li>
            <li>The size is great for straightening or pumping up some loose body curls.  </li>
            <li>The voltage was adequate; I just had to purchase the plug adapter</li>
            <li>The light flashed off and on and it didnt get hot.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is smaller (as described) but for traveling, it is WONDERFUL!  </li>
            <li>It gets really hot quickly, but the heat isn&#x27;t adjustable, which isn&#x27;t an issue for me.</li>
            <li>Light weight, only needed a plug adaptor instead of a whole converter, the included travel case is great for packing it up right after using if necessary.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a pretty good purchase.</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast and just as hot as the full size Croc.  </li>
            <li>and this is great for using after the initial go with the larger iron.</li>
            <li>so I could give it a more beachy look with different flips and curls.</li>
            <li>The croc however, I think, is better for thicker hair because it has a slightly bigger plate.</li>
            <li>temperature is hot (430F) and cannot be adjusted.</li>
            <li>Some of the other reviewers also mentioned that it does not get very hot, this is true, but I still managed to curl my hair just fine</li>
            <li>I LOVE this mini flat iron!</li>
            <li>I was able to wrap and go and not wait for it to cool down.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect, not too heavy, adjustable heat, so you have get those tight curls to flatten.&lt;br /&gt;Definately worth the price.</li>
            <li>Does not compare to the croc classic, but works good for a little thing.</li>
            <li>It heats up pretty fast but its not the fastest.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how small it really was, but the price was good and it served the purpose for quick touch ups while traveling.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m out the door, but this required a few passes to smooth out my strands (and even then it just wasn&#x27;t as smooth as I like).</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t take up much room in my luggage.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast.</li>
            <li>Handy for &#x27;re-touches&#x27; after using a regular  flat Iron.  </li>
            <li>No way to set it to a particular temp.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that one too.</li>
            <li>Does what a normal straightener does.</li>
            <li>and I normally use a Chi straightener</li>
            <li>This flat iron works great when my hair is too short to use a regular flat iron without burning my scalp.</li>
            <li>This is such a handy little straightener.</li>
            <li>I have very naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>This is quite hot for blonde hair</li>
            <li>so use it carefully - and quickly.</li>
            <li>This flat iron was a replacement for a different mini croc flat iron that I&#x27;ve had for many years.  </li>
            <li>While this flat iron does get hot, it is not nearly enough to leave my Afro as straight as a press or blow out would.</li>
            <li>Looked for it on amazon when I got home and was surprised that is</li>
            <li>so the rectangle prongs would fit into the round holes they have in Europe.  </li>
            <li>My brother has pretty curly hair and he has a mini flat iron like me, but not the same one.</li>
            <li>I recently went to New Orleans and threw this in my bag.</li>
            <li>It does get a little hot but the heat protection mat is clutch!</li>
            <li>You can grab a little more hair and if you run through your hair slowly it flattens it out and makes it really straight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure any compact straightener can be compared to a full size, but I wasn&#x27;t blown away by this one.</li>
            <li>We were very excited to get a baby Croc, but in less than a month, it is no longer heating well and has little affect on my girls&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li>Also, I like that this flat iron has spring plates which means it doesnt completely crush your hair.</li>
            <li>B002V7YE52 Turboion Baby Croc Professional Dual Voltage Mini Travel Flat Iron, Fuchsia, 5/8 Inch]]  </li>
            <li>I use mine everyday because I have shoulder length, fine hair and other irons are just too big.</li>
            <li>One way to check if it has spring plates (I don&#x27;t know what the plates are really called) is if you press down on the plates and it moves up into the iron.</li>
            <li>But hope you are selecting this as a secondary flat iron and not the primary one for regular use!</li>

            <li> For those with tightly coiled hair, I recommend washing, a blow dry, then a few passes of the baby croc for smooth edges.</li>
            <li> He has the Jose Eber petite flat iron which is even smaller than mine and heats up in 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I chose this mini flat iron for international travel as it lists</li>
            <li> , however the actual specs on the flat iron were 100-120v.</li>
            <li> Definitely works very well for travel, but because of the small size just beware it will take you a bit longer to straighten all of your hair if you have a lot like me.</li>
            <li> My goal was to flat iron my hair</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair shinier than when i use the flat iron alone.</li>
            <li> If you have longer hair you shouldn&#x27;t go for the mini flat irons.    </li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before buying this travel flat iron.</li>
            <li> Well priced, quality travel flat iron.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a flat iron to take with me to India</li>
            <li> and I was reading all these articles about flat irons not working well or blowing circuits.</li>
            <li> It never stayed on long enough to do my hair - returned!</li>
            <li> Remember to buy a thermal heat protector if you blow dry and flat iron your hair daily.</li>

            <li> so it wont take as long.</li>

            <li> it didn&#x27;t do the trick I had to do very small</li>

            <li> Hardly heats up enough to do anything to your hair, very disappointing!</li>
            <li> It was by far the worst iron ever.</li>

            <li> So far it&#x27;s been an awesome straighten since I received my pixie haircut. Does what a normal straightener does. Only complaint is the on and off switch. I wish it had an automatic off. That would save those moments when I become scatterbrained and forget if I turned it off or not. Other than that it&#x27;s a pretty good purchase.</li>
            <li> I got this to do my kids hair and my bangs. I found this in a store in my area and paid over 40- for it. Looked for it on amazon when I got home and was surprised that is was 1/2 the cost at the store. So took it back and got it from here. I love it. It works great and plus side it&#x27;s small enough to come with us when we travel as well.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this item because I had seen the results of the Mama Croc - which I ordered also.  I needed a mini straightner so that I can just do my bangs.  This one works wonderfully.  I only need go through my bangs once.  It heats up really fast and just as hot as the full size Croc.  I love the bag and the convenience of just putting it in my purse.</li>
            <li> Great Flat Iron!!! Sorta like an emo/scene style and this product is great. My goal was to flat iron my hair so I could give it a more beachy look with different flips and curls. It looks way better. This mini flat iron is the perfect size and it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. It heats up pretty fast but its not the fastest. If you want a 30 second heat up, this mini is not for you. It takes like 1 minute to heat up. My brother has pretty curly hair and he has a mini flat iron like me, but not the same one. He has the Jose Eber petite flat iron which is even smaller than mine and heats up in 30 seconds. I highly recommend that one too. The croc however, I think, is better for thicker hair because it has a slightly bigger plate. You can grab a little more hair and if you run through your hair slowly it flattens it out and makes it really straight. Also, I like that this flat iron has spring plates which means it doesnt completely crush your hair. It adjusts to your hair. This is supposed to be healthier for your hair. One way to check if it has spring plates (I don&#x27;t know what the plates are really called) is if you press down on the plates and it moves up into the iron. Remember to buy a thermal heat protector if you blow dry and flat iron your hair daily. Thats what i do with this iron and it makes my hair shinier than when i use the flat iron alone. It also protects your hair from heat damage and makes it look and feel healthier. If you have longer hair you shouldn&#x27;t go for the mini flat irons.

            <li> Hardly heats up enough to do anything to your hair, very disappointing!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a trip to Italy, and it was perfect.  Light weight, only needed a plug adaptor instead of a whole converter, the included travel case is great for packing it up right after using if necessary.  The size is great for straightening or pumping up some loose body curls.  Heats up quick and works great.</li>
            <li> Definitely works very well for travel, but because of the small size just beware it will take you a bit longer to straighten all of your hair if you have a lot like me. I was able to straighten and curl with it, love that it comes with the case as well.</li>
            <li> Does not compare to the croc classic, but works good for a little thing. I would recommend it for people with thinner hair rather than thick so it wont take as long.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use mine everyday because I have shoulder length, fine hair and other irons are just too big. It does get a little hot but the heat protection mat is clutch!</li>
            <li> This little iron was wonderful on a trip to Italy. It is dual voltage so to use I only needed the plug converter. Not my Chi straightener but with the limits on luggage weight this will be going on many trips with me. The heat proof case was very useful too. No packing delay in the mornings.</li>
            <li> It does the job when I am out of the US. It is not high powered like a CHI but it beats nothing at all!</li>
            <li> I chose this mini flat iron for international travel as it lists it is dual voltage.  Mine was not.  The paper insert said it was dual voltage (110-240), however the actual specs on the flat iron were 100-120v.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this and the day after I got it I decided to try it out. It was by far the worst iron ever. I have short curly hair and at 430 it should have straightend it and it didn&#x27;t. Even after I blow dried and then used it, it still wasnt up to par. This iron at the most may have heated to 300-350. Not more than that. But theres no way of knowing since there is only an on and off switch. No way to set it to a particular temp. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is such a handy little straightener. I used it on my pixie cut and love it!!! It is also great for bangs. I do wish there was a heat setting...but otherwise...the value is great!</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before buying this travel flat iron. I was surprised at how small it really was, but the price was good and it served the purpose for quick touch ups while traveling. Definitely a good purchase!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my best friend, she looooved it! It came fast, very good price and its very convenient !!</li>
            <li> The iron is compact and the travel case is nice. Also it&#x27;s dual voltage so I was able to use it abroad without issues. I don&#x27;t have finicky hair and I normally use a Chi straightener and I&#x27;m out the door, but this required a few passes to smooth out my strands (and even then it just wasn&#x27;t as smooth as I like). I&#x27;m not sure any compact straightener can be compared to a full size, but I wasn&#x27;t blown away by this one.</li>
            <li> I have coarse 4A hair and the straightening process can be a pain. While this flat iron does get hot, it is not nearly enough to leave my Afro as straight as a press or blow out would. For those with tightly coiled hair, I recommend washing, a blow dry, then a few passes of the baby croc for smooth edges. I do love the color, 360 swivel cord and carrying case that doubles as a heat resistant mat!</li>
            <li> Well priced, quality travel flat iron. Works well for small straightening jobs, it would take all day if you had long curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;The temperature is hot (430F) and cannot be adjusted. This is quite hot for blonde hair so use it carefully - and quickly.</li>
            <li> This flat iron was a replacement for a different mini croc flat iron that I&#x27;ve had for many years.  I love the size; it&#x27;s perfect for short hair.  It gets really hot quickly, but the heat isn&#x27;t adjustable, which isn&#x27;t an issue for me. I LOVE this mini flat iron!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my trip to Amsterdam and it did not work. I tried multiple outlets and 2 diff 2 prong plug converter and nothing worked. The light flashed off and on and it didnt get hot. total waste...</li>
            <li> I bought but return it ! I have long hair ,thick hair  it didn&#x27;t do the trick I had to do very small amounts.&lt;br /&gt;I think it would work great great on shorter hair !</li>
            <li> This is an awesome travel/detail iron. I have very naturally curly hair and this is great for using after the initial go with the larger iron. It gets out those little curls a bigger iron can&#x27;t seem to get to. I recently went to New Orleans and threw this in my bag. It works great. I also love the light weight. I have fibromyalgia and have trouble with holding anything too heavy. This is perfect, not too heavy, adjustable heat, so you have get those tight curls to flatten.&lt;br /&gt;Definately worth the price.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is smaller (as described) but for traveling, it is WONDERFUL!  I don&#x27;t have very thick hair, but it does go past my shoulder.  The iron heated up nicely and I loved the packaging and the mat included to place hot iron on.  I was able to wrap and go and not wait for it to cool down.  Loved the color too!  Great quality and happy I bought it!</li>
            <li> Good heat! Handy for &#x27;re-touches&#x27; after using a regular  flat Iron.  Again of good use for the wisps of hair framing the face!  Handy for travel.  But hope you are selecting this as a secondary flat iron and not the primary one for regular use!</li>
            <li> Excellent iron! One of the best I have used. Heats up quickly and works well on thick, long hair. The carry case makes it great for travel.</li>
            <li> Used it in Madrid and worked just fine with an adapter - no need for a converter. It&#x27;s very small, but then again it is for traveling. The  travel case is amazing and looks great as well. I loved how easy it was to put away and it didn&#x27;t take up much room in my luggage. Some of the other reviewers also mentioned that it does not get very hot, this is true, but I still managed to curl my hair just fine (I have thick, long hair). I would definitely recommend this product if you are traveling to Europe.</li>
            <li> We were very excited to get a baby Croc, but in less than a month, it is no longer heating well and has little affect on my girls&#x27; hair.  We are VERY disappointed and now wonder if it is truly a Croc product.  I purchased this based on their reputation and am left with regret.</li>
            <li> Perfect portable size and heats up quick. Loves that it comes with the heatproof mat to wrap around. love!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a trip to Spain, France, and Italy.  It worked well in all three countries.  The voltage was adequate; I just had to purchase the plug adapter so the rectangle prongs would fit into the round holes they have in Europe.  I would definitely recommend this product for a trip to Europe.  The travel case is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> Love the size and travel convinience.  just wish it would get a little bit hotter. Other than that I think It was a great buy!</li>
            <li> Perfect for short hair. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a flat iron to take with me to India and I was reading all these articles about flat irons not working well or blowing circuits. The trick is to buy one like this, a small travel size. You may not be able to straighten all your hair, but it worked great for me bangs. This was a great buy! It worked perfectly, no problems! I would definitely recommend this for traveling or for daily use!</li>
            <li> Love it and it is so easy to use and travel with. It meets my needs at home and on the road!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a trip to Paris - thank goodness I tried it before I took it with me, It would heat up, then the light would go off and it would shut itself off. It never stayed on long enough to do my hair - returned!</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel.  I have one in my gym bag and one for my suitcase.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife for a trip to Italy for the dual voltage - she loves it. Good product - would recomend.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works great when my hair is too short to use a regular flat iron without burning my scalp. It&#x27;s great for travel. It heats up fast. It comes with an awesome heat mat. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn&#x27;t have an auto shut off.</li>
