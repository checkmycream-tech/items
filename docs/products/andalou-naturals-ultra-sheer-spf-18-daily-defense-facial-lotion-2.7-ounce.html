            <li>nice scent to.</li>
            <li>It may be SPF 18, but my kids (fair skinned) do not get burned on their faces and it doesn&#x27;t sting their eyes like most sunscreen.</li>
            <li>nice aroma</li>
            <li>This is a nice weight moisturizer, but I would not at all call it UltraSheer.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent and</li>
            <li>It feels nice going on as well.</li>
            <li>glides on face and protects nice product</li>

            <li>Mild citrus scent is very nice.</li>

            <li>I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glowing skin hides many flaws, so anyone with mature/ing skin may want to try the dewey look as an alternative to matte.</li>
            <li>I love the way gives my skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I use it over my Daily Defense Lotion for the perfect dewey look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I probably sound like I work for the company but, believe me, I&#x27;m just a 40-something consumer who obsesses over skin care!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more than just icing on the cake for this consumer.look as an alternative to matte.</li>
            <li>I love the way gives my skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I use it over my Daily Defense Lotion for the perfect dewey look.  </li>

            <li>That&#x27;s more than just icing on the cake for this consumer.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>Love the consistency.  </li>
            <li>Love Andalou.</li>
            <li>I love this product; it was delivered in a timely manner as promised.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have bought it in a store, but got a better price through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I went in for a skin analysis and was told my skin is so healthy and has not sun damage.  </li>
            <li>so I can go out and not feel the need to add more sunscreen...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just recently switched over to this skincare line, and have found it to be excellent!  </li>
            <li>It outperforms some of the top brands out there</li>
            <li>and I feel better knowing that I&#x27;m not polluting my body with Neutrogena anymore.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite creams ever.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and it protected me from sunburn while in Arizona!</li>
            <li>Nice and Light Sun Screen.</li>
            <li>It does not have an overwhelming smell, and it does not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>I also sometimes mix this 50/50 with the Andalou tinted beauty balm and that works better than any chemical-laden foundation.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This is the best daily lotion I&#x27;ve found for my combination skin.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and smells great.</li>
            <li>But I say the more the merrier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try more Andalou products.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>My skin looks more healthy too.</li>
            <li>It has a refreshing smell, is light and perfect for daily wear.</li>
            <li>This also has a light, natural, fruity scent that is very pleasant without being strong.</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I think the moisture level is great as it is not greasy like many good moisturizers and is light weight, just needs a couple of minutes to dry before you put on your make-</li>
            <li>: The first thing I noticed was the pleasant, light scent.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, light citrus smell, love it.</li>
            <li>I love the chemical free spf and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy like the spf neutrogena product I had been using.  </li>
            <li>Sheer &amp; silky texture, nice light grape-like scent, spf, quality (ie: not scary) ingredients, excellent price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and it smells great too.</li>
            <li>It works well on my sensitive skin and feels great.  </li>
            <li>more importantly doesn&#x27;t sting if you get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li>The SPF portion was particularly important for me because there don&#x27;t seem to be too many moisturizers out there that are both paraben-free and have an SPF.  </li>
            <li>It also has a light scent that is not at all overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Love the light citrus scent.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and love the way it feels on my face.</li>
            <li>It was not chalky at all, and absorbed nicely.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a mild citrus smell to the sunscreen and it slides on very easily on the skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion has excellent consistency, smells great, and has completely replaced my Olay w/SPF that I had previously used every morning.</li>
            <li>First, I just want to note that I did not purchase my Andalou products from Amazon, but from a popular health food market.</li>
            <li>After having tried everything from ROC, Oil of Olay, Clinique, Kiehl&#x27;s and everything under the sun, this is hands down the best!</li>
            <li>Another fine product from Andalou.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blossom and Leaf Toner</li>
            <li>Another fine product from Andalou.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice lotion, and I love that it was natural and had SPF.  </li>
            <li>This is a great daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It leaves your face smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li>It has a light smell that doesn&#x27;t stick around and it feels moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Try their skin brightening products in this line if you are looking to even out the tone of your skin, and it really does nicely on reducing the appearance of lines as well.  </li>
            <li>that im using a product that is free from parabens.</li>
            <li>This product is not too greasy and feels light on my face.</li>
            <li>It goes on silky smooth, not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this as a gift for several friends to share this great product.</li>
            <li>Light and smells lovely and fresh and citrusy.</li>
            <li>So far so good for me.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are all natural and it know it is doing good for my face.</li>
            <li>- SPF, light weight, non-greasy, natural ingredients, paraben-free, cruelty-free, makes my face feel great, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>It is a bit too light for my liking, but overall very nice product.</li>
            <li>Like all the other products, it smells incredible without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like all the other products, it smells incredible without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Finding a good natural moisturizer with a decent sunscreen in it is not that easy!</li>
            <li>The label says to use AM and PM under moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily Defense Facial Lotion: This stuff smells amazing!</li>
            <li>The texture is rich and ohhh soooo creamy.</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased with the way this serum makes my face look and feel.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve been able to tolerate a face lotion that has sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m trying to be more aware of what I put on my face.  </li>
            <li>The scent is great, it is lightweight and I really like it so far.  </li>
            <li>For combination and dry skin types, this SPF is a great option.</li>
            <li>It feels smooth, and non greasy, light and liquid foundation goes on smoothly right away.</li>
            <li>Very light, pleasant smell, a little citrus-y.</li>
            <li>I took it along when boating last weekend, and my sister tried it and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Like a light, natural, orange creamsicle without being sickeningly sweet and overpowering, like so many skin care creams.</li>
            <li>arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Very nice, and certainly ultra sheer.</li>
            <li>This product DOES NOT contain effective, broad spectrum protection from the sun.  </li>
            <li>Light fragrance was absolutely yummy!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great product, especially for you $, and I would highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li>This is hands-down my new favorite daytime SPF lotion of all time.</li>
            <li>The first lotion that I have felt good about using regularly.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t irritate it, and actually made it look much better!</li>
            <li>I went to my local natural foods store and experimented with all their testers until I could find a good replacement that didn&#x27;t smell too strongly of some odor</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luminous Eye Serum: A very light, wonderfully smooth eye cream that instantly moisturizes and reduces the appearance of lines and creping.</li>
            <li>A very light, wonderfully smooth eye cream that instantly moisturizes and reduces the appearance of lines and creping.</li>
            <li>Did not need to use much product for smooth, even coverage on face.</li>
            <li>My sun-beaten and oftentimes problematic skin looks and feels 100x healthier and fresh without the excess grease and clogged pores.</li>
            <li>Its just a nice overall face lotion, the SPF is just a bonus.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money you spend on it.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve used all of them over the years, and this by far has been the most noticeable in the skin brightening and evening out the skin blotches that come with time.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this at my local health food store &amp; have been using it for over a month now, It smells nice</li>
            <li>far as the actual product goes, it did go on smoothly and was fairly lightweight for an SPF product.</li>
            <li>I searched many reviews of daily facial sunscreens to find something everyone could agree on, and this one had good reviews.  </li>
            <li>My favorite sunscreen thus far.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>Love the all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this daily for a while, works great and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I like that it is made from clean, pure products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a tough sell when it comes to skincare, so for me to be impressed is really saying something!</li>
            <li>The texture and appearance is somewhat creamy (rather than clear) and goes on smooth without pulling, which is very important when you have mature or maturing skin.</li>
            <li>I like bare minerals better.</li>
            <li>We live in the South, so it is so important that their faces are protected.</li>
            <li>At first I loved this product and bought more, but now I have decided it leaves my skin too greasy and am not happy with it.</li>
            <li>A very slight, pleasant scent (and</li>
            <li>I looked forever for a sunscreen / daily lotion that was made with cruelty free methods (no animal testing) and finally found my go-to favorite!</li>
            <li>I noticed an immediate difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>The scent of this is lovely and the product works perfectly as a daily moisturizer without being overly oily.</li>
            <li>I do wish it had more SPF, but I admit the further improvement to my skin overshadows that</li>
            <li>And after the first application there seemed to be a difference in the firmness of my skin.</li>
            <li>Not only did Andalou fill Arbonne&#x27;s shoes, they have them beat on so many levels.</li>
            <li>And they are much easier on the wallet!</li>
            <li>Not only did Andalou fill Arbonne&#x27;s shoes, they have them beat on so many levels.</li>
            <li>And they are much easier on the wallet!</li>
            <li>I love how sheer it goes on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit heavier than my former product but has better SPF protection.</li>
            <li>better deal at Amazon than the local Farmer&#x27;s market.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve tried this product.</li>
            <li>but it makes my skin really greasy!</li>
            <li>I just love the entire Andalou Naturals product line.</li>
            <li>All in all, I love this product and will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my third bottle and keep buying more.  </li>
            <li>Only wish it had a bit more spf.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough to go under make up with causing caking and it also doesn&#x27;t make my face feel super oily during hot, humid summer days.  </li>
            <li>Smells light, citrusy; absorbs quickly and with no white cast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week, but so far I really love it!  </li>
            <li>I use this daily on top of my 100 percent pure primer.  </li>
            <li>It is light, absorbs completely, but moisturizes my combination skin very well.</li>
            <li>It smells fruity, almost peachy, and very natural - no artificial or overpowering scents at all.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I saw on EWG that it has a much lower toxicity rating than Olay.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for those with combination skin, who spend time outdoors, and want a product that doesn&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
            <li>I love this SPF because it doesn&#x27;t make my light-brown skin look chalky, even on camera or direct sunlight, nor does it cause irritation like most SPFs seem to do lately.  </li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>Very affordable</li>
            <li>This product deserves five stars because it works well and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I found out that Whole Foods carries this, also, supposedly, so</li>
            <li>For some reason I can&#x27;t get it at Whole foods anymore.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>I really like it and will continue to order it for years to come.</li>
            <li>I have combination oily/dry skin and it works very well for me.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this cream, but it&#x27;s like slathering on sun block.  </li>
            <li>Kind of heavy for me.</li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;m super sensitive to smells right now as I am pregnant and most fragrances make me nauseated.)</li>
            <li>for a few years because it was the only thing to tackle my dry skin issues and it&#x27;s the perfect consistency for me.</li>
            <li>A little more than what I like to pay, but hopefully by paying a little more on &amp;#34;safer&amp;#34; cosmetics and creams now, I&#x27;ll be saving in the long run by keeping my skin healthy.</li>
            <li>My new go-to under-makeup face lotion!</li>
            <li>This stuff is very creamy, yet absorbs easily, unlike some other brands that tend to stay on the surface of the skin for longer than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>I am 24 and my face is dry sometimes, this product made my face feel and look so smooth.</li>
            <li>: If you like dewey, glowing skin, this is the ultimate product (and my personal favorite from Andalou).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many daily moisturizers and always come back to this one.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing without being greasy, provides great sun protection, and lacks scary ingredients.</li>
            <li>You really should only use products you can eat, and this one is pretty darn close.  </li>
            <li>It glides on smooth and absorbs quickly without a thick whitish cast like some.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t quite a heavy enough moisturizer for wintertime skin (easy enough to supplement with jojoba or argan oil) and some of the spf ingredients are a bit suspect according to [...], but it&#x27;s far better rated than a lot of the mainstream alternatives at ahem, drugstores, department stores, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand because is not greasy, so smooth, and help my damage skin due to the sun damages.</li>
            <li>As a new Andalou user, I can&#x27;t wait to see the long-term results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My new permanent face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>A year ago I was looking for a new face lotion to meet several criteria: natural (e.g. no parabens, preservatives, etc.), SPF, and light enough to wear during 90-degree summer days.  </li>
            <li>when my skin gets really dry, I am already finding spots that are dry in the summer, but I am going to keep using it for now because I love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I wear this daily, as I live in a very sunny high-altitude climate and am a redhead.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing a new moisturizer tomorrow, but I think, I may try this lotion again in the winter, when my skin is more dry due to the weather.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, goes on easily, absorbs quickly, no tacky feel while absorbing, and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight once it has absorbed into my face (the way that most sunscreen formulas feel on my face.)</li>
            <li>But it works well enough, and I really appreciate that it is natural.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural, earthy and sensual, like having aromatherapy on your face.</li>
            <li>It is nearly unscented.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural, earthy and sensual, like having aromatherapy on your face.</li>
            <li>It is nearly unscented.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m quite sensitive to scents).  </li>
            <li>I like that it has SPF18 in it and is all natural...</li>
            <li>My Face&#x27;s Face Factor (which I like very much) at my local Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>and I can tell that it&#x27;s keeping my skin soft.</li>
            <li>It smells great, my skin absorbs it almost instantly (and no residue is left behind), and seems to protect me from the sun well.</li>
            <li>I know I was very surprised to see that products I used on a regular basis were classified as highly toxic...</li>
            <li>The  Daily Defense Facial Lotion was the first product I purchased from Andalou Naturals.</li>
            <li>the last three years,  I&#x27;d been strictly using (and still mainly use) Eminence Organics because it took years off my face,  to the point others noticed.</li>
            <li>Doesnt leave a white residue if you tap your skin repeatedly after normal application, according to my wife.</li>
            <li>However, that could just be me as in the winter my skin gets dry in certain areas, so I have to use a heavier moisturizer at night.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have been searching for a low to no fragrance that had natural ingredients-</li>
            <li>I love Andalou Naturals (at least everything I have ever tried by them)!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and so finding something that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin is essential.</li>
            <li>barely there feel.  </li>
            <li>It is thick and substantial, yet it feels light and spreads luxuriously over the skin.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not so dull, and it&#x27;s not too rich for my oily T-Zone.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little pick me up first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>I was using Jason Vitamin C Effects daily lotion with SPF until it was apparently discontinued.</li>
            <li>It has helped to diminish them as well as the minor wrinkles on my forehead and near my mouth.</li>
            <li>Since I have been using it, I have not burned even after several hours in the sun, though my foundation (bare minerals) also contains an spf.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think it&#x27;s just not a good fit for me.</li>

            <li> nice scent to.</li>

            <li> nice aroma</li>
            <li> This is a nice weight moisturizer, but I would not at all call it UltraSheer.  </li>

            <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glowing skin hides many flaws, so anyone with mature/ing skin may want to try the dewey look as an alternative to matte.</li>
            <li> I love the way gives my skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I use it over my Daily Defense Lotion for the perfect dewey look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I probably sound like I work for the company but, believe me, I&#x27;m just a 40-something consumer who obsesses over skin care!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s more than just icing on the cake for this consumer.look as an alternative to matte.</li>
            <li> I love the way gives my skin a healthy glow.</li>

            <li> That&#x27;s more than just icing on the cake for this consumer.</li>

            <li> Love Andalou.</li>
            <li> I love this product; it was delivered in a timely manner as promised.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have bought it in a store, but got a better price through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I went in for a skin analysis and was told my skin is so healthy and has not sun damage.  </li>
            <li> so I can go out and not feel the need to add more sunscreen...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just recently switched over to this skincare line, and have found it to be excellent!  </li>
            <li> It outperforms some of the top brands out there</li>
            <li> and I feel better knowing that I&#x27;m not polluting my body with Neutrogena anymore.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite creams ever.</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and it protected me from sunburn while in Arizona!</li>
            <li> Nice and Light Sun Screen.</li>
            <li> It does not have an overwhelming smell, and it does not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> I also sometimes mix this 50/50 with the Andalou tinted beauty balm and that works better than any chemical-laden foundation.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is the best daily lotion I&#x27;ve found for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and smells great.</li>
            <li> But I say the more the merrier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try more Andalou products.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> My skin looks more healthy too.</li>
            <li> It has a refreshing smell, is light and perfect for daily wear.</li>
            <li> This also has a light, natural, fruity scent that is very pleasant without being strong.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I think the moisture level is great as it is not greasy like many good moisturizers and is light weight, just needs a couple of minutes to dry before you put on your make-</li>
            <li> : The first thing I noticed was the pleasant, light scent.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, light citrus smell, love it.</li>
            <li> I love the chemical free spf and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy like the spf neutrogena product I had been using.  </li>
            <li> Sheer &amp; silky texture, nice light grape-like scent, spf, quality (ie: not scary) ingredients, excellent price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and it smells great too.</li>
            <li> It works well on my sensitive skin and feels great.  </li>
            <li> more importantly doesn&#x27;t sting if you get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> The SPF portion was particularly important for me because there don&#x27;t seem to be too many moisturizers out there that are both paraben-free and have an SPF.  </li>
            <li> It also has a light scent that is not at all overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Love the light citrus scent.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and love the way it feels on my face.</li>
            <li> It was not chalky at all, and absorbed nicely.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a mild citrus smell to the sunscreen and it slides on very easily on the skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion has excellent consistency, smells great, and has completely replaced my Olay w/SPF that I had previously used every morning.</li>
            <li> First, I just want to note that I did not purchase my Andalou products from Amazon, but from a popular health food market.</li>
            <li> After having tried everything from ROC, Oil of Olay, Clinique, Kiehl&#x27;s and everything under the sun, this is hands down the best!</li>
            <li> Another fine product from Andalou.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blossom and Leaf Toner</li>
            <li> Another fine product from Andalou.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice lotion, and I love that it was natural and had SPF.  </li>
            <li> This is a great daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It leaves your face smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li> It has a light smell that doesn&#x27;t stick around and it feels moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Try their skin brightening products in this line if you are looking to even out the tone of your skin, and it really does nicely on reducing the appearance of lines as well.  </li>
            <li> that im using a product that is free from parabens.</li>
            <li> This product is not too greasy and feels light on my face.</li>
            <li> It goes on silky smooth, not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this as a gift for several friends to share this great product.</li>
            <li> Light and smells lovely and fresh and citrusy.</li>
            <li> So far so good for me.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are all natural and it know it is doing good for my face.</li>
            <li> - SPF, light weight, non-greasy, natural ingredients, paraben-free, cruelty-free, makes my face feel great, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> It is a bit too light for my liking, but overall very nice product.</li>
            <li> Like all the other products, it smells incredible without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like all the other products, it smells incredible without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Finding a good natural moisturizer with a decent sunscreen in it is not that easy!</li>
            <li> The label says to use AM and PM under moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily Defense Facial Lotion: This stuff smells amazing!</li>
            <li> The texture is rich and ohhh soooo creamy.</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased with the way this serum makes my face look and feel.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve been able to tolerate a face lotion that has sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m trying to be more aware of what I put on my face.  </li>
            <li> The scent is great, it is lightweight and I really like it so far.  </li>
            <li> For combination and dry skin types, this SPF is a great option.</li>
            <li> It feels smooth, and non greasy, light and liquid foundation goes on smoothly right away.</li>
            <li> Very light, pleasant smell, a little citrus-y.</li>
            <li> I took it along when boating last weekend, and my sister tried it and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Like a light, natural, orange creamsicle without being sickeningly sweet and overpowering, like so many skin care creams.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Very nice, and certainly ultra sheer.</li>
            <li> This product DOES NOT contain effective, broad spectrum protection from the sun.  </li>
            <li> Light fragrance was absolutely yummy!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a great product, especially for you $, and I would highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> This is hands-down my new favorite daytime SPF lotion of all time.</li>
            <li> The first lotion that I have felt good about using regularly.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t irritate it, and actually made it look much better!</li>
            <li> I went to my local natural foods store and experimented with all their testers until I could find a good replacement that didn&#x27;t smell too strongly of some odor</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luminous Eye Serum: A very light, wonderfully smooth eye cream that instantly moisturizes and reduces the appearance of lines and creping.</li>
            <li> A very light, wonderfully smooth eye cream that instantly moisturizes and reduces the appearance of lines and creping.</li>
            <li> Did not need to use much product for smooth, even coverage on face.</li>
            <li> My sun-beaten and oftentimes problematic skin looks and feels 100x healthier and fresh without the excess grease and clogged pores.</li>
            <li> Its just a nice overall face lotion, the SPF is just a bonus.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money you spend on it.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve used all of them over the years, and this by far has been the most noticeable in the skin brightening and evening out the skin blotches that come with time.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this at my local health food store &amp; have been using it for over a month now, It smells nice</li>
            <li> far as the actual product goes, it did go on smoothly and was fairly lightweight for an SPF product.</li>
            <li> I searched many reviews of daily facial sunscreens to find something everyone could agree on, and this one had good reviews.  </li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen thus far.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> Love the all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for a while, works great and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I like that it is made from clean, pure products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a tough sell when it comes to skincare, so for me to be impressed is really saying something!</li>
            <li> The texture and appearance is somewhat creamy (rather than clear) and goes on smooth without pulling, which is very important when you have mature or maturing skin.</li>
            <li> I like bare minerals better.</li>
            <li> We live in the South, so it is so important that their faces are protected.</li>
            <li> At first I loved this product and bought more, but now I have decided it leaves my skin too greasy and am not happy with it.</li>
            <li> A very slight, pleasant scent (and</li>
            <li> I looked forever for a sunscreen / daily lotion that was made with cruelty free methods (no animal testing) and finally found my go-to favorite!</li>
            <li> I noticed an immediate difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> The scent of this is lovely and the product works perfectly as a daily moisturizer without being overly oily.</li>
            <li> I do wish it had more SPF, but I admit the further improvement to my skin overshadows that</li>
            <li> And after the first application there seemed to be a difference in the firmness of my skin.</li>
            <li> Not only did Andalou fill Arbonne&#x27;s shoes, they have them beat on so many levels.</li>
            <li> And they are much easier on the wallet!</li>
            <li> Not only did Andalou fill Arbonne&#x27;s shoes, they have them beat on so many levels.</li>
            <li> And they are much easier on the wallet!</li>
            <li> I love how sheer it goes on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavier than my former product but has better SPF protection.</li>
            <li> better deal at Amazon than the local Farmer&#x27;s market.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve tried this product.</li>
            <li> but it makes my skin really greasy!</li>
            <li> I just love the entire Andalou Naturals product line.</li>
            <li> All in all, I love this product and will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle and keep buying more.  </li>
            <li> Only wish it had a bit more spf.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough to go under make up with causing caking and it also doesn&#x27;t make my face feel super oily during hot, humid summer days.  </li>
            <li> Smells light, citrusy; absorbs quickly and with no white cast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week, but so far I really love it!  </li>
            <li> I use this daily on top of my 100 percent pure primer.  </li>
            <li> It is light, absorbs completely, but moisturizes my combination skin very well.</li>
            <li> It smells fruity, almost peachy, and very natural - no artificial or overpowering scents at all.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I saw on EWG that it has a much lower toxicity rating than Olay.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for those with combination skin, who spend time outdoors, and want a product that doesn&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
            <li> I love this SPF because it doesn&#x27;t make my light-brown skin look chalky, even on camera or direct sunlight, nor does it cause irritation like most SPFs seem to do lately.  </li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> Very affordable</li>
            <li> This product deserves five stars because it works well and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I found out that Whole Foods carries this, also, supposedly, so</li>
            <li> For some reason I can&#x27;t get it at Whole foods anymore.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> I really like it and will continue to order it for years to come.</li>
            <li> I have combination oily/dry skin and it works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this cream, but it&#x27;s like slathering on sun block.  </li>
            <li> Kind of heavy for me.</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;m super sensitive to smells right now as I am pregnant and most fragrances make me nauseated.)</li>
            <li> for a few years because it was the only thing to tackle my dry skin issues and it&#x27;s the perfect consistency for me.</li>
            <li> A little more than what I like to pay, but hopefully by paying a little more on &amp;#34;safer&amp;#34; cosmetics and creams now, I&#x27;ll be saving in the long run by keeping my skin healthy.</li>
            <li> My new go-to under-makeup face lotion!</li>
            <li> This stuff is very creamy, yet absorbs easily, unlike some other brands that tend to stay on the surface of the skin for longer than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I am 24 and my face is dry sometimes, this product made my face feel and look so smooth.</li>
            <li> : If you like dewey, glowing skin, this is the ultimate product (and my personal favorite from Andalou).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many daily moisturizers and always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing without being greasy, provides great sun protection, and lacks scary ingredients.</li>
            <li> You really should only use products you can eat, and this one is pretty darn close.  </li>
            <li> It glides on smooth and absorbs quickly without a thick whitish cast like some.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t quite a heavy enough moisturizer for wintertime skin (easy enough to supplement with jojoba or argan oil) and some of the spf ingredients are a bit suspect according to [...], but it&#x27;s far better rated than a lot of the mainstream alternatives at ahem, drugstores, department stores, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand because is not greasy, so smooth, and help my damage skin due to the sun damages.</li>
            <li> As a new Andalou user, I can&#x27;t wait to see the long-term results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My new permanent face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> A year ago I was looking for a new face lotion to meet several criteria: natural (e.g. no parabens, preservatives, etc.), SPF, and light enough to wear during 90-degree summer days.  </li>
            <li> when my skin gets really dry, I am already finding spots that are dry in the summer, but I am going to keep using it for now because I love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I wear this daily, as I live in a very sunny high-altitude climate and am a redhead.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing a new moisturizer tomorrow, but I think, I may try this lotion again in the winter, when my skin is more dry due to the weather.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, goes on easily, absorbs quickly, no tacky feel while absorbing, and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight once it has absorbed into my face (the way that most sunscreen formulas feel on my face.)</li>
            <li> But it works well enough, and I really appreciate that it is natural.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural, earthy and sensual, like having aromatherapy on your face.</li>
            <li> It is nearly unscented.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural, earthy and sensual, like having aromatherapy on your face.</li>
            <li> It is nearly unscented.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m quite sensitive to scents).  </li>
            <li> I like that it has SPF18 in it and is all natural...</li>
            <li> My Face&#x27;s Face Factor (which I like very much) at my local Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> and I can tell that it&#x27;s keeping my skin soft.</li>
            <li> It smells great, my skin absorbs it almost instantly (and no residue is left behind), and seems to protect me from the sun well.</li>
            <li> I know I was very surprised to see that products I used on a regular basis were classified as highly toxic...</li>
            <li> The  Daily Defense Facial Lotion was the first product I purchased from Andalou Naturals.</li>
            <li> the last three years,  I&#x27;d been strictly using (and still mainly use) Eminence Organics because it took years off my face,  to the point others noticed.</li>
            <li> Doesnt leave a white residue if you tap your skin repeatedly after normal application, according to my wife.</li>
            <li> However, that could just be me as in the winter my skin gets dry in certain areas, so I have to use a heavier moisturizer at night.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have been searching for a low to no fragrance that had natural ingredients-</li>
            <li> I love Andalou Naturals (at least everything I have ever tried by them)!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and so finding something that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin is essential.</li>
            <li> barely there feel.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and substantial, yet it feels light and spreads luxuriously over the skin.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not so dull, and it&#x27;s not too rich for my oily T-Zone.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little pick me up first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> I was using Jason Vitamin C Effects daily lotion with SPF until it was apparently discontinued.</li>
            <li> It has helped to diminish them as well as the minor wrinkles on my forehead and near my mouth.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using it, I have not burned even after several hours in the sun, though my foundation (bare minerals) also contains an spf.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think it&#x27;s just not a good fit for me.</li>
            <li> This lotion is no exception - goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t cause any annoying shine.</li>
            <li> Andalou Naturals Daily Defense Facial Lotion SPF 18, is not worth using on any skin type of any individual.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin well hydrated all day long and not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li> It says on the back of the package &amp;#34;for dry to very dry skin&amp;#34; which would probably have deterred me had I known.</li>
            <li> No residue left over once rubbed in like other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Bye bye dry spots.</li>
            <li> Only been using less than a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using natural products from various  for about 6 years to avoid the chemicals, but also because I saw some actual results when compared to expensive, chemical-laden products that never offered the long-term results they claimed.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely, sinks in.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this facial lotion for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Just be careful to not get in in your eye.</li>
            <li> and this has only happened a few times out of the year I&#x27;ve been using</li>
            <li> As the weather gets colder, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s enough of a daytime moisturizer for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> And I am extremely picky.</li>
            <li> And I am extremely picky.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it is so low.</li>
            <li> I will not use face products with citrus oils due to phytophotodermatitis.</li>
            <li> That may seem extreme, but after seeing a case of it up close I won&#x27;t ever risk having that happen.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to trying their other products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy - although I am over 50 and do have dry skin.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight thickness to it due to the sunscreen, but it moisturizes well.  </li>
            <li> Studies have shown that in the course of a year, the average person absorbs about 5 lbs.</li>
            <li> I needed a facial moisturizer with sunscreen that wasn&#x27;t chock full of nasty chemicals, and after reading Amazon reviews for various contenters, picked this one.</li>
            <li> Like all products, it can burn a little</li>
            <li> Felt a little greasy all day.</li>
            <li> It is a little shinny for summer, but a little powder helps with this.</li>
            <li> A few months ago,  I decided to save a few bucks and mix things up by trying Andalou&#x27;s tumeric serum and eventually this lotion.</li>
            <li> and Firm Cream</li>
            <li> that is has an spf for everyday protection.</li>
            <li> I wear it under mineral powder and it&#x27;s not too heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> I have used it everyday for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> Wear it everyday ......</li>
            <li> but I have found very little discomfort as it stays in place well</li>
            <li> I usually use Aveeno, but now I&#x27;m trying to use cruelty-free products instead.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it had a citrus oil in it, and although I couldn&#x27;t find anything online about this particular product having a bad reaction I didn&#x27;t want to risk it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have very pale skin that will burn after 15 minutes of sun exposure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe; it&#x27;s not fruity like the others -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe; it&#x27;s not fruity like the others -</li>
            <li> Leaves a subtle glow on my skin.</li>
            <li> about 1/2 gone so even though it&#x27;s a little expensive it lasts.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it eventually made my face break out.  </li>
            <li> A faint citrus-like scent.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> arrived quickly. Just as described.</li>
            <li> This is a great summer time moisturizer and SPF. You feel really good putting this on because it smells good, but you also know you&#x27;re protecting your skin. As the weather gets colder, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s enough of a daytime moisturizer for my dry skin. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> So happy to have found this! I was using Jason Vitamin C Effects daily lotion with SPF until it was apparently discontinued. I went to my local natural foods store and experimented with all their testers until I could find a good replacement that didn&#x27;t smell too strongly of some odor I didn&#x27;t care for. This won and I made the purchase in the store. Time to buy more, and found this great deal on Amazon. This stuff is very creamy, yet absorbs easily, unlike some other brands that tend to stay on the surface of the skin for longer than I&#x27;d like. Very light, pleasant smell, a little citrus-y. Perfect for me!</li>
            <li> No problems. Fast delivery. Great product!</li>
            <li> Doesnt leave a white residue if you tap your skin repeatedly after normal application, according to my wife.</li>
            <li> I like bare minerals better.</li>
            <li> Great Lotion for your face with SPF 18!</li>
            <li> Perfect!!! No greasy at all and it smells great!</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer with a nice citrus fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I saw on EWG that it has a much lower toxicity rating than Olay. If you don&#x27;t know what EWG is, look it up and check out all your beauty products-- I know I was very surprised to see that products I used on a regular basis were classified as highly toxic... Gross! This lotion has excellent consistency, smells great, and has completely replaced my Olay w/SPF that I had previously used every morning. Will definitely keep buying this! I bought this in October and it&#x27;s probably about 1/2 gone so even though it&#x27;s a little expensive it lasts.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. It has a refreshing smell, is light and perfect for daily wear. Excellent quality product. I have reordered multiple times. Good price point.</li>
            <li> The  Daily Defense Facial Lotion was the first product I purchased from Andalou Naturals. I noticed an immediate difference after the first use. Did not need to use much product for smooth, even coverage on face. Light fragrance was absolutely yummy! My sun-beaten and oftentimes problematic skin looks and feels 100x healthier and fresh without the excess grease and clogged pores. A definite MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li> I looked forever for a sunscreen / daily lotion that was made with cruelty free methods (no animal testing) and finally found my go-to favorite! The scent of this is lovely and the product works perfectly as a daily moisturizer without being overly oily. I highly recommend this for those with combination skin, who spend time outdoors, and want a product that doesn&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using natural products from various  for about 6 years to avoid the chemicals, but also because I saw some actual results when compared to expensive, chemical-laden products that never offered the long-term results they claimed. At 36, it&#x27;s been nothing but tinted moisturizer these days and some blush, eyeliner, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last three years,  I&#x27;d been strictly using (and still mainly use) Eminence Organics because it took years off my face,  to the point others noticed. I&#x27;ve also been using Andalou body butter  (kukui?) for a few years because it was the only thing to tackle my dry skin issues and it&#x27;s the perfect consistency for me. A few months ago,  I decided to save a few bucks and mix things up by trying Andalou&#x27;s tumeric serum and eventually this lotion. I love both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love this SPF because it doesn&#x27;t make my light-brown skin look chalky, even on camera or direct sunlight, nor does it cause irritation like most SPFs seem to do lately.  I do wish it had more SPF, but I admit the further improvement to my skin overshadows that and it encourages me to put it on regularly. Above all, it doesn&#x27;t make me breakout. Woot! It&#x27;s also great smelling and moisturizing without non-greasy.</li>
            <li> Perfect transaction and lovely products. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless SPF face lotions, I haven&#x27;t been a fan of them. This one however smells great, and doesn&#x27;t leave me with a greasy feeling on my face. Its just a nice overall face lotion, the SPF is just a bonus.</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> First, I just want to note that I did not purchase my Andalou products from Amazon, but from a popular health food market. My review is strictly about the products themselves. Here is what I&#x27;ve used so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lift and Firm Cream: The first thing I noticed was the pleasant, light scent. It smells fruity, almost peachy, and very natural - no artificial or overpowering scents at all. The texture is rich and ohhh soooo creamy. It is thick and substantial, yet it feels light and spreads luxuriously over the skin. My face feels thoroughly pampered by this cream. And after the first application there seemed to be a difference in the firmness of my skin. It also makes my face (and fingers) feel silky to the touch. The label says it can be used AM and PM but I&#x27;ve decided to make this my night cream. As a new Andalou user, I can&#x27;t wait to see the long-term results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revitalizing Serum: This also has a light, natural, fruity scent that is very pleasant without being strong. The texture and appearance is somewhat creamy (rather than clear) and goes on smooth without pulling, which is very important when you have mature or maturing skin. So far I am very pleased with the way this serum makes my face look and feel. The label says to use AM and PM under moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily Defense Facial Lotion: This stuff smells amazing! Like a light, natural, orange creamsicle without being sickeningly sweet and overpowering, like so many skin care creams. Again, they got the texture perfect - goes on smooth, no pulling, feels substantial on the skin but not weighty. It is the perfect foundation for use under makeup and gives the skin a nice, healthy glow. I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Omega Glow Facial Concentrate: If you like dewey, glowing skin, this is the ultimate product (and my personal favorite from Andalou). It is oil-based yet it absorbs beautifully into the skin leaving a healthy sheen without looking greasy. Glowing skin hides many flaws, so anyone with mature/ing skin may want to try the dewey look as an alternative to matte. Once again, the scent is amazing! It&#x27;s hard to describe; it&#x27;s not fruity like the others - it&#x27;s natural, earthy and sensual, like having aromatherapy on your face. My husband loves the scent. I love the way gives my skin a healthy glow. I use it over my Daily Defense Lotion for the perfect dewey look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luminous Eye Serum: A very light, wonderfully smooth eye cream that instantly moisturizes and reduces the appearance of lines and creping. It is nearly unscented. Feels like silk. Another fine product from Andalou.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blossom and Leaf Toner: I spray this on my face throughout the day to re-hydrate and freshen my skin. It leaves my face feeling refreshed and gives my senses a boost. Like all the other products, it smells incredible without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know to the skeptic I probably sound like I work for the company but, believe me, I&#x27;m just a 40-something consumer who obsesses over skin care! And I am extremely picky. Before discovering Andalou I was a devoted Arbonne user for years and was devastated when they changed the formula (and ruined) their RE9 line. I would have used their products for life if they didn&#x27;t change. But they did and I was left wondering if I would ever find \\&quot;love\\&quot; again in a skin care line. Not only did Andalou fill Arbonne&#x27;s shoes, they have them beat on so many levels. Just go to their website and read what they are all about, you will fall in love too! And they are much easier on the wallet! For the quality of the ingredients and results, you would expect to pay double, if not triple the amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, their products are vegan and cruelty-free! No animal testing, no animal ingredients. That&#x27;s more than just icing on the cake for this consumer.look as an alternative to matte. Once again, the scent is amazing!

            <li> This is a nice lotion, and I love that it was natural and had SPF.  It was not chalky at all, and absorbed nicely.  Unfortunately, it eventually made my face break out.  I have combination skin, and it was too greasy for the oilier parts of my face.</li>
            <li> I love how sheer it goes on. The natural ingredients are great, it smells so good almost as if you can eat it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a safer daily moisturizer with spf that won&#x27;t leave my face with a greasy film and this is it! It glides on smooth and absorbs quickly without a thick whitish cast like some. It still feels like a substantial moisturizer though, just without heaviness. The smell is a little pick me up first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> Great plant based product, smells nice and absorbs quickly with light feel to the lotion. Repeat customer on this product.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely, sinks in.  Moisturizing, non-greasy.  The first lotion that I have felt good about using regularly.  Studies have shown that in the course of a year, the average person absorbs about 5 lbs. of chemicals through their skin.  You really should only use products you can eat, and this one is pretty darn close.  I now check everything on the Environmental Working Group site, ewg dot org, for toxicity.  This is the best-rated line of products that I could find.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the smell of this moisturizer!  It&#x27;s a bit heavier than my former product but has better SPF protection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week, but so far I really love it!  No globs or white marks on my face after putting it on, and it doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling oily or anything.  A very slight, pleasant scent (and i&#x27;m quite sensitive to scents).  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand because is not greasy, so smooth, and help my damage skin due to the sun damages. I really love it. Use it with the night cream . It is worth the money you spend on it. Not greasy, light citrus smell, love it. better deal at Amazon than the local Farmer&#x27;s market.</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly.  Love the consistency.  Love Andalou. Great company.</li>
            <li> I love this product; it was delivered in a timely manner as promised.</li>
            <li> This is a great daily moisturizer. The SPF is too low for my liking. Not sure why it is so low. Their BB cream is SPF 30. It is a really nice moisturizer, though. Light and smells lovely and fresh and citrusy. I just add additional SPF after, with a mineral powder or a liquid face block like La Roche Posey.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t&#x27; count on it as a sunscreen, but as a moisturizer, it is great!</li>
            <li> It leaves your face smooth and not oily. I love that is has an spf for everyday protection. I am 24 and my face is dry sometimes, this product made my face feel and look so smooth.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Smells light, citrusy; absorbs quickly and with no white cast. I wear it under mineral powder and it&#x27;s not too heavy or oily. Great product!</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve tried this product. I like that it has SPF18 in it and is all natural...nice scent to. Goes on nicely and absorbs quickly. I like the feel of my face after applying. May buy again...I&#x27;m always trying and looking for that perfect product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product.  I love the chemical free spf and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy like the spf neutrogena product I had been using.  It has a light smell that doesn&#x27;t stick around and it feels moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Sheer &amp; silky texture, nice light grape-like scent, spf, quality (ie: not scary) ingredients, excellent price. My new go-to under-makeup face lotion!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have sensitive skin and so finding something that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin is essential. I also use this lotion on my kid&#x27;s faces when going to the beach or outside. We live in the South, so it is so important that their faces are protected. It may be SPF 18, but my kids (fair skinned) do not get burned on their faces and it doesn&#x27;t sting their eyes like most sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I highly recommend it.  The delivery was prompt as well.</li>
            <li> I started using this when I couldn&#x27;t find Kiss My Face&#x27;s Face Factor (which I like very much) at my local Whole Foods. I find this works wonderfully as a daily moisturizer. It&#x27;s not too heavy - although I am over 50 and do have dry skin. It has a very light citrus scent.</li>
            <li> Very nice, and certainly ultra sheer. It is a bit too light for my liking, but overall very nice product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Great sun protection and feels like a face cream. non greasy; no fragrance</li>
            <li> In love with this face cream! It has SPF in it and I can tell that it&#x27;s keeping my skin soft. It&#x27;s all natural and it smells great too. I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> I really like the product. I have used it everyday for a couple of years. I think it helps me  look younger!  I have bought it in a store, but got a better price through Amazon. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and it is made of plant stem cells.  I went in for a skin analysis and was told my skin is so healthy and has not sun damage.  As a kid I tanned all the time.  So the doc stated it was because of the skin products I&#x27;m using.  This one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product several times now and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. Finding a good natural moisturizer with a decent sunscreen in it is not that easy! This has SPF 18 so I can go out and not feel the need to add more sunscreen...even in the pool. It is non-greasy and moisturizes quite well - great for daytime use and under makeup.</li>
            <li> Great ingredients, love the smell, feels great on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just recently switched over to this skincare line, and have found it to be excellent!  It outperforms some of the top brands out there, I&#x27;ve used all of them over the years, and this by far has been the most noticeable in the skin brightening and evening out the skin blotches that come with time.  Try their skin brightening products in this line if you are looking to even out the tone of your skin, and it really does nicely on reducing the appearance of lines as well.  I&#x27;m a tough sell when it comes to skincare, so for me to be impressed is really saying something!</li>
            <li> So far so good for me. I feel great comfort in knowing that im using a product that is free from parabens. This product is not too greasy and feels light on my face. Hope I still feel the same way about this product by the summer time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at my local health food store &amp; have been using it for over a month now, It smells nice and I like that it as SPF, but it makes my skin really greasy! I am not sure if it&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s summer &amp; hot and humid? I will be purchasing a new moisturizer tomorrow, but I think, I may try this lotion again in the winter, when my skin is more dry due to the weather.</li>
            <li> I love this face lotion, it&#x27;s light but nourishing and my skin looks/feels great!  I&#x27;ve used it for a while now, it&#x27;s my fav.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and feels great. Leaves a subtle glow on my skin. Very affordable and I feel better knowing that I&#x27;m not polluting my body with Neutrogena anymore.</li>
            <li> I just love the entire Andalou Naturals product line. This product deserves five stars because it works well and is reasonably priced.  I gave their lip remedy product five stars also, for similar reasons, and I will definitely continue to purchase and use their products.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. One of my favorite creams ever. The smell in unbelievably awesome.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve been able to tolerate a face lotion that has sunscreen in it. A little goes a long way, goes on easily, absorbs quickly, no tacky feel while absorbing, and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight once it has absorbed into my face (the way that most sunscreen formulas feel on my face.) The mild tangerine/orange citrus smell is delightful (and I&#x27;m super sensitive to smells right now as I am pregnant and most fragrances make me nauseated.)</li>
            <li> I have been using this facial lotion for a few weeks now and I really like it.  It goes on silky smooth, not greasy at all.  It works well on my sensitive skin and feels great.  I am concerned about how well this will work in the winter when my skin gets really dry, I am already finding spots that are dry in the summer, but I am going to keep using it for now because I love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Wear it everyday ...... Love it goes on leave no white film. The only cream I keep coming back to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many daily moisturizers and always come back to this one. It&#x27;s got everything I need - SPF, light weight, non-greasy, natural ingredients, paraben-free, cruelty-free, makes my face feel great, and the price is right. I&#x27;ve bought this as a gift for several friends to share this great product.</li>
            <li> I usually use Aveeno, but now I&#x27;m trying to use cruelty-free products instead. This is hands-down my new favorite daytime SPF lotion of all time.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t quite a heavy enough moisturizer for wintertime skin (easy enough to supplement with jojoba or argan oil) and some of the spf ingredients are a bit suspect according to [...], but it&#x27;s far better rated than a lot of the mainstream alternatives at ahem, drugstores, department stores, etc.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;SPF&lt;br /&gt;wonderful fruit scent, not overpowering&lt;br /&gt;rubs on easily&lt;br /&gt;No skin reaction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin shiny&lt;br /&gt;Painful when accidentally gets in eye</li>
            <li> I only used this product once, and I had to stay inside! I didn&#x27;t realize it had a citrus oil in it, and although I couldn&#x27;t find anything online about this particular product having a bad reaction I didn&#x27;t want to risk it. I will not use face products with citrus oils due to phytophotodermatitis. That may seem extreme, but after seeing a case of it up close I won&#x27;t ever risk having that happen. It&#x27;s terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the actual product goes, it did go on smoothly and was fairly lightweight for an SPF product. It looked best with a powder over the top of it to reduce the shine. I didn&#x27;t notice as skin reaction with it, but I washed my face after an hour so I could go outside. It has a very pleasant orange smell to it, although that&#x27;s what caused my concern about the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. My skin is smooth and it protected me from sunburn while in Arizona! It was 118 degrees! I like that it is made from clean, pure products.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. nice aroma</li>
            <li> This is a nice weight moisturizer, but I would not at all call it UltraSheer.  It does have a slight thickness to it due to the sunscreen, but it moisturizes well.  I searched many reviews of daily facial sunscreens to find something everyone could agree on, and this one had good reviews.  I found out that Whole Foods carries this, also, supposedly, so I might check out the rest of the line in-store.&lt;br /&gt;It does a fair job of protecting from the sun.  Makeup goes over it well.  I took it along when boating last weekend, and my sister tried it and loved it.  It has a pleasant citrus smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  I wear a different moisturizer at night because of the weight of it (and we don&#x27;t need sunscreen at night...)&lt;br /&gt;Is it perfect?  Naw.  But it works well enough, and I really appreciate that it is natural.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feel! Perfect under makeup! A little goes a long way, so it lasts a while. Doesn&#x27;t cause break outs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it gets good reviews from the EWG for lower toxicity and I&#x27;m trying to be more aware of what I put on my face.  The scent is great, it is lightweight and I really like it so far.  A little more than what I like to pay, but hopefully by paying a little more on &amp;#34;safer&amp;#34; cosmetics and creams now, I&#x27;ll be saving in the long run by keeping my skin healthy.</li>
            <li> Dries out skin. Need to use Argon Oil under it.</li>
            <li> I use this daily on top of my 100 percent pure primer.  Nice scent and barely there feel.  I also use it alone and still feel protected from the sun.</li>
            <li> I needed a facial moisturizer with sunscreen that wasn&#x27;t chock full of nasty chemicals, and after reading Amazon reviews for various contenters, picked this one. So glad I did! It smells great, my skin absorbs it almost instantly (and no residue is left behind), and seems to protect me from the sun well. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Mild citrus scent is very nice. It is light, absorbs completely, but moisturizes my combination skin very well.</li>
            <li> Nice and Light Sun Screen.</li>
            <li> Best lotion I have ever used. Smells great</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen thus far. It does not have an overwhelming smell, and it does not irritate the skin. There&#x27;s a mild citrus smell to the sunscreen and it slides on very easily on the skin. It can be a bit on the oily side, so people with oily skin might not respond well to this. For combination and dry skin types, this SPF is a great option. After having tried everything from ROC, Oil of Olay, Clinique, Kiehl&#x27;s and everything under the sun, this is hands down the best!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product and the brand! I purchased three items: this, the apricot face wash and an overnight cream and love them all!</li>
            <li> Shipped in good time. Absorbs well into skin. Good feel, great smell (like grapefruit). Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I love Andalou Naturals (at least everything I have ever tried by them)! This lotion is no exception - goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t cause any annoying shine. It smells very nice too, and not feminine, so my husband and I share it. I wear mine under makeup and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with any of the makeup application at all. I also sometimes mix this 50/50 with the Andalou tinted beauty balm and that works better than any chemical-laden foundation.</li>
            <li> I love the refreshing smell! It feels nice going on as well.</li>
            <li> What a great moisturizer. It feels smooth, and non greasy, light and liquid foundation goes on smoothly right away. My skin looks great. I&#x27;ve ordered it again.</li>
            <li> I wear this daily, as I live in a very sunny high-altitude climate and am a redhead. It smells delightful and more importantly doesn&#x27;t sting if you get it in your eyes. Very light texture. I wear it over Andalou&#x27;s night cream as my skin is aging. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> glides on face and protects nice product</li>
            <li> No residue left over once rubbed in like other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used. A faint citrus-like scent. I love that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. It&#x27;s not greasy and I don&#x27;t breakout. For some reason I can&#x27;t get it at Whole foods anymore. They have substituted it for another sunscreen by the same company and it&#x27;s not the same at all.</li>
            <li> This is the best daily lotion I&#x27;ve found for my combination skin. It hydrates perfectly for my dryer areas, perking my skin up so it&#x27;s not so dull, and it&#x27;s not too rich for my oily T-Zone. It works great to prep the skin for makeup, and can also be worn at night to hydrate while I sleep. The scent is citrusy, but doesn&#x27;t bother my scent-sensitive nose. Holy Grail moisturizer here! I can&#x27;t imagine being without it.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. I have very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate it, and actually made it look much better! Bye bye dry spots.</li>
            <li> A year ago I was looking for a new face lotion to meet several criteria: natural (e.g. no parabens, preservatives, etc.), SPF, and light enough to wear during 90-degree summer days.  The SPF portion was particularly important for me because there don&#x27;t seem to be too many moisturizers out there that are both paraben-free and have an SPF.  This has now become my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; moisturizer in the mornings as it met these criteria.  It&#x27;s light enough to go under make up with causing caking and it also doesn&#x27;t make my face feel super oily during hot, humid summer days.  It also has a light scent that is not at all overwhelming.  The only con is that it doesn&#x27;t moisturize effectively enough in the winter.  However, that could just be me as in the winter my skin gets dry in certain areas, so I have to use a heavier moisturizer at night.  All in all, I love this product and will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> I love this face cream!! Reasonably priced and smells great. I have fair skin and this protects me from sun damage and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle and keep buying more.  It&#x27;s moisturizing without being greasy, provides great sun protection, and lacks scary ingredients.</li>
            <li> Keeps your face moisturized without making it oily and makes your skin glow! I have sensitive skin and have been searching for a low to no fragrance that had natural ingredients- this is it!  I really like it and will continue to order it for years to come.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer! I have combination oily/dry skin and it works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Love the light citrus scent. After about two weeks of using it, I notice my is smoother and the cilia around my eyes has diminished noticeably.</li>
            <li> At first I loved this product and bought more, but now I have decided it leaves my skin too greasy and am not happy with it.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product because I was looking for a natural/organic moisturizer with an spf. This was one of the few at Whole Foods that had an spf and it was on sale. I love this product! I think the moisture level is great as it is not greasy like many good moisturizers and is light weight, just needs a couple of minutes to dry before you put on your make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it around my eyes as I have stared to see some wrinkles. It has helped to diminish them as well as the minor wrinkles on my forehead and near my mouth. Just be careful to not get in in your eye. Like all products, it can burn a little but I have found very little discomfort as it stays in place well and this has only happened a few times out of the year I&#x27;ve been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very pale skin that will burn after 15 minutes of sun exposure. Since I have been using it, I have not burned even after several hours in the sun, though my foundation (bare minerals) also contains an spf. But I say the more the merrier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product, especially for you $, and I would highly recommend giving it a try. I am looking forward to trying their other products.</li>
            <li> Andalou Naturals Daily Defense Facial Lotion SPF 18, is not worth using on any skin type of any individual.  Why? This product DOES NOT contain effective, broad spectrum protection from the sun.  If you use this lotion you shall be doing a disservice to your skin and welcome skin cancer, sun sensitivity and wrinkles.  This lotion does have a wonderful feel, texture and fragrance, but nothing more.  If you truly wish to protect your skin from the outside elements and premature aging, use Andalou&#x27;s BB Sunscreen Creams with SPF 30.  These sunscreens are loaded with Zinc Oxide and offer the best in sun protection.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I&#x27;ll try to remember to update. Only been using less than a couple of weeks.  Update - 6/25/15: I still like it.  Update - 7/8/15: I still like it.   Update - 1/24/16: I still like it.</li>
            <li> This is the cream I use every day now under make-up. It keeps my skin well hydrated all day long and not at all greasy.  The smell is really nice too.  Can&#x27;t wait to try more Andalou products.  I already bought another three products from their range and I have loved all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal/dry skin which is very fair</li>
            <li> Works well and is non toxic</li>
            <li> Perfect for someone looking for all natural cruelty free face cream with spf. Smells great but doesn&#x27;t linger with you all day. My new permanent face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Too greasy.  I really wanted to like this cream, but it&#x27;s like slathering on sun block.  It smells like sunblock too.</li>
            <li> Kind of heavy for me. Felt a little greasy all day. I do like the citrusy scent. It says on the back of the package &amp;#34;for dry to very dry skin&amp;#34; which would probably have deterred me had I known. Overall, I think it&#x27;s just not a good fit for me.</li>
            <li> Love the all natural ingredients. It is light, non-greasy and has a very pleasant orange like scent. Does well underneath make-up</li>
            <li> Love this. It is a little shinny for summer, but a little powder helps with this. The ingredients are all natural and it know it is doing good for my face.</li>
            <li> Smells great, has spf protection and helps keep me hydrated in the CO air.  Only wish it had a bit more spf.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for a while, works great and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this face cream. He&#x27;s a golfer and appreciates the SPF already in it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and isn&#x27;t greasy.  I&#x27;m very happy with this face lotion.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is super light weight. My skin looks more healthy too. I use this with the cream cleanser.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and love the way it feels on my face. Looks good under my makeup. This should last a while.</li>
