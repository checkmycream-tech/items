    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SPRAY!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This is the perfect and ideal fragrance!</li>
            <li>Smells so good!</li>
            <li>Starts off as a citrus scent and turns to a warm inviting smell as the day goes on!</li>
            <li>OH SO SMELL GOOD..</li>
            <li>I find most floral perfumes cloying and over-sweet, so I was really happy to find a sandalwood scent like this as an alternative.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume!</li>
            <li>I purchased the Sandalwood perfume for my mother as a birthday gift, and it&#x27;s absolutely lovely!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>but it smells really nice.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice.  </li>
            <li>very nice, not over powering, but if you&#x27;re expecting true sandalwood,this is not for you.</li>
            <li>I discovered that if I layer this with the Persian Rose, it gives an interesting nuance to the notes together.</li>
            <li>Smells nice all day.  :-)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a more &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; smell, but not to the point that it resembles a men&#x27;s fragrance, it retains a feminine twist.</li>
            <li>Guys, is more of a ladies product.  </li>
            <li>This perfume is supposed to be sandalwood with citrus overtones, but to me it smells overwhelmingly like grapefruit.  </li>
            <li>What I got was mostly  a citrus fragrance .  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>The package was delivered on time, but received this bottle without a top.  </li>
            <li>I love the fragrance of sandalwood</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>hints of lemon come through more than sandalwood.</li>
            <li>Who could ask for more?</li>
            <li>and I really think the citrus tones add a beautiful light depth to the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Just very sweet and nothing like sandalwood.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge sandalwood fan</li>
            <li>and I understand that it&#x27;s a light fragrance</li>
            <li>...just right!</li>
            <li>whatever (I&#x27;m far from being a fragrance expert), but I can say that a) it smells amazing and b)</li>
            <li>I really adore this sandalwood perfume -- it&#x27;s got just enough citrus in it to flavor the sandalwood beautifully.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a true Sandalwook perfume....</li>
            <li>Not totally unpleasant, but not woodsy at all.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, not weak either</li>
            <li>It arrived super fast!</li>
            <li>so I thank Pacifica for full filling my wish up to some reasonable level</li>
            <li>Great scent, only wish bottle was larger.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I like Sandalwood smell very much</li>
            <li>I got another, more well known sandalwood spray at the same time, my husband hates that one.</li>
            <li>pleasant, light scent but not strong enough sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li>I was a bit concerned about buying perfume online without smelling it first, but the gamble really paid off.</li>
            <li>they pretty much need to be close to you, so you don&#x27;t have to worry that you&#x27;re overpowering others with scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too strong for my personal taste.</li>
            <li>IM LOOKING FOR PURE SANDALWOOD ...</li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s pure sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li>So, I think I paid a bit too much since it doesn&#x27;t last and isn&#x27;t strong.  </li>
            <li>I am one who is very sensitive to many commercial perfumes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been buying mine at whole foods, but for some reason they&#x27;ve been out for over a month.</li>
            <li>I have tried other sandalwood fragrances and to this day this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>The scent is heavier on citrus and less woody than I expected, but it still smells very nice.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the scent of their Mexican cocoa candles, so I&#x27;ll likely give that one a try, too.</li>
            <li>This product comes in a lovely little spray bottle.  </li>
            <li>I wear it because I personally love the smell, but it seems other folks really like it too as I frequently have random people comment that I smell good when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It does not have a flowery or artificial perfume smell which is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a heavy scent, so you&#x27;re not walking in a cloud of odor.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a straight sandalwood smell, get the essential oil.</li>
            <li>Normally, Sandalwood smells \\&quot;woodsy\\&quot; and is easily a \\&quot;male\\&quot; thing or unisex at the least.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a more subtle scent, It was cloying and smells like suntan lotion.</li>
            <li>So I spray a little of the Pacifica Sandalwood perfume under my arms right after I apply the deodorant.</li>
            <li>This perfume does last and certainly does smell like sandalwood but because it&#x27;s a perfume has other elements.</li>
            <li>Typically it is when someone is closer to me, say in a crowded elevator or line, that random people comment that it smells good.</li>

            <li> lasts for at least several hours after initial application, which is enough to get my endorsement.</li>
            <li> but the bottle I have smells very very faint almost to a point that you have to spray it more than three times to smell the scent.  </li>
            <li> not pleasant fragrance - it is like an old fashioned aftershave, not worth the money, would not purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> This one is much nicer, and significantly less expensive.</li>
            <li> I decided to check Amazon and found it here, in addition to a few other scents by Pacifica that I think I&#x27;ll give a try.</li>

            <li> but since I&#x27;m really active, I worry that it&#x27;s not enough to get me through the day without smelling bad.</li>
            <li> At least it came in a spray.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product; I read other reviews</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, Pacifica!</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible smell.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this perfume! Smells so good! Starts off as a citrus scent and turns to a warm inviting smell as the day goes on!</li>
            <li> I have tried other sandalwood fragrances and to this day this one is my favorite. I like that it has a hint of citrus and it lasts for quite some time. The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Sandalwood perfume for my mother as a birthday gift, and it&#x27;s absolutely lovely! I was a bit concerned about buying perfume online without smelling it first, but the gamble really paid off. The scent is woody with a hint of orange/ citrus-- it&#x27;s a more &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; smell, but not to the point that it resembles a men&#x27;s fragrance, it retains a feminine twist. The package was delivered before the estimated date, and the bottle was well protected within the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you if this is actually a perfume or cologne/ eau de perfume/ eau de toilette/ whatever (I&#x27;m far from being a fragrance expert), but I can say that a) it smells amazing and b) lasts for at least several hours after initial application, which is enough to get my endorsement.</li>
            <li> Too strong for my personal taste. I discovered that if I layer this with the Persian Rose, it gives an interesting nuance to the notes together.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SPRAY!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure how this is labeled as \\&quot;Sandalwood\\&quot;.....it smells nothing like it.  Smells like citrus/fruit.  Does not smell \\&quot;bad\\&quot; just don&#x27;t expect Sandalwood fragrance.  PS: Guys, is more of a ladies product.  Normally, Sandalwood smells \\&quot;woodsy\\&quot; and is easily a \\&quot;male\\&quot; thing or unisex at the least.  Not this time.  Stick with Caswell Massey, CrabTree or the like.  Sorry, Pacifica!</li>
            <li> This perfume is supposed to be sandalwood with citrus overtones, but to me it smells overwhelmingly like grapefruit.  Not totally unpleasant, but not woodsy at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for about a year and I absolutely love it! It does not have a flowery or artificial perfume smell which is great. Rather, it smells somewhat woody and citrusy (is citrusy a word?). I wear it because I personally love the smell, but it seems other folks really like it too as I frequently have random people comment that I smell good when I wear it. It&#x27;s not a heavy scent, so you&#x27;re not walking in a cloud of odor. Typically it is when someone is closer to me, say in a crowded elevator or line, that random people comment that it smells good. they pretty much need to be close to you, so you don&#x27;t have to worry that you&#x27;re overpowering others with scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been buying mine at whole foods, but for some reason they&#x27;ve been out for over a month. I decided to check Amazon and found it here, in addition to a few other scents by Pacifica that I think I&#x27;ll give a try. I LOVE the scent of their Mexican cocoa candles, so I&#x27;ll likely give that one a try, too.</li>
            <li> pleasant, light scent but not strong enough sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long because it&#x27;s alcohol based but it smells really nice.</li>
            <li> The perfume I ordered said sandalwood perfume.  What I got was mostly  a citrus fragrance .  I couldn&#x27;t even detect any sandal  wood fragrance in it</li>
            <li> This product comes in a lovely little spray bottle.  The scent is heavier on citrus and less woody than I expected, but it still smells very nice.</li>
            <li> not pleasant fragrance - it is like an old fashioned aftershave, not worth the money, would not purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like  sandalwood.  Just very sweet and nothing like sandalwood.  At least it came in a spray.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a true Sandalwook perfume....this isn&#x27;t it. Horrible smell.  In the trash! Was very disappointed. Still looking.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice.  It doesn&#x27;t last and I doubt it is noticeable to anyone else but myself.  So, I think I paid a bit too much since it doesn&#x27;t last and isn&#x27;t strong.  But it&#x27;s okay and I will use it until it is gone.</li>
            <li> I use salt crystal deodorant to avoid the aluminum in mass-marketed deodorants but since I&#x27;m really active, I worry that it&#x27;s not enough to get me through the day without smelling bad. So I spray a little of the Pacifica Sandalwood perfume under my arms right after I apply the deodorant. Smells nice all day.  :-)</li>
            <li> I was not a fan of this one. I was looking for a more subtle scent, It was cloying and smells like suntan lotion.</li>
            <li> The package was delivered on time, but received this bottle without a top.  I was not impressed with this product; I read other reviews and I understand that it&#x27;s a light fragrance but the bottle I have smells very very faint almost to a point that you have to spray it more than three times to smell the scent.  Again, the scent fades away, even on your clothing and you have to ask others can you smell the fragrance.  I&#x27;m not sure if the scent is seeping from the bottle because it has no top or what?  I love the fragrance of sandalwood but I&#x27;m not impressed.  I&#x27;ll keep it because I don&#x27;t want to go through the process of returns, maybe I&#x27;ll spray it in my linen closet.</li>
            <li> I am one who is very sensitive to many commercial perfumes. Pacifica is the only brand I think doesn&#x27;t smell like a chemical concoction of death. If you are looking for a straight sandalwood smell, get the essential oil. This perfume does last and certainly does smell like sandalwood but because it&#x27;s a perfume has other elements.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It arrived super fast!</li>
            <li> OH SO SMELL GOOD..LOVE IT. I HOPE JUST THE SMELL OF SANDALWOOD..IM LOOKING FOR PURE SANDALWOOD ...</li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s pure sandalwood scent. I love it. Spicy and lasting. I got another, more well known sandalwood spray at the same time, my husband hates that one. This one is much nicer, and significantly less expensive.</li>
            <li> Wow! I am hooked on Pacifica Perfumes and Colognes! This is the perfect and ideal fragrance! Not too strong, not weak either...just right!</li>
            <li> I really adore this sandalwood perfume -- it&#x27;s got just enough citrus in it to flavor the sandalwood beautifully. I find most floral perfumes cloying and over-sweet, so I was really happy to find a sandalwood scent like this as an alternative.</li>
            <li> Great scent, only wish bottle was larger.</li>
            <li> Divine scent but only lasts a very short time. Have tried it on skin, clothes but it&#x27;s gone within 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> very nice, not over powering, but if you&#x27;re expecting true sandalwood,this is not for you. hints of lemon come through more than sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Some people have reviewed this product saying the citrus undertones are bothersome.  I am a huge sandalwood fan and I really think the citrus tones add a beautiful light depth to the fragrance.  Plus it&#x27;s vegan and Pacifica does not test on animals.  Who could ask for more?</li>
            <li> I like Sandalwood smell very much so I thank Pacifica for full filling my wish up to some reasonable level</li>
            <li> It was not like it&#x27;s description. No sandalwood at all. Planning to. Return.</li>
