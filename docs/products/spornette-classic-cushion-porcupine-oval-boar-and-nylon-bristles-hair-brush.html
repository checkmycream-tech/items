            <li>maybe it was a good deal for someone else.   </li>
            <li>My mom used it and loved it.</li>
            <li>Spornette seems to be a good brand (check out their website)</li>
            <li>though to be fair I also changed my conditioner).</li>
            <li>Good quality porcupine bristles, though a couple did fall off when I was washing it</li>
            <li>My hair dresser recommended that I buy a good massage brush.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any bristles falling off and the handle and (lacquer) paint have held up nicely.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very glad i did.</li>
            <li>i am more than happy with it</li>
            <li>very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I was so very pleased to find these -- and purchased two.  </li>
            <li>just the right size and shape - fits my hand perfectly.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research on a good quality brush at reasonable price and here&#x27;s the best deal i found.</li>
            <li>This is a good brush, a nice mix of nylon and bristle and the handle is of nice quality.</li>
            <li>Love this brush!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I bought an Ambassador Hairbrush and love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this hairbrush!</li>
            <li>I own four Spornette brushes &amp; love them all!  </li>
            <li>Works great, quick shipping!</li>
            <li>and I actually liked what I smelled.</li>
            <li>I really love this brand, they are just as good as the super-expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>I liked so much&lt;</li>
            <li>Once you try it, you will want one of your own -</li>
            <li>(I kind of want to buy one for everyone I know)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice sturdy brush.  </li>
            <li>I love a good brushing.</li>
            <li>I had a brush that had both kinds of bristles, and liked it</li>
            <li>so that was nice.</li>
            <li>it does a great job smoothing out my hair by just brushing, and it also does a pretty good job straightening while blow drying.</li>
            <li>I have been using them for many years and the quality is still exceptional.</li>
            <li>Very easy to manage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It sits comfortably in your hand, it&#x27;s the perfect size... and really, I can&#x27;t stop raving about it to everyone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right kind of &#x27;scratchy&#x27; on my scalp, stimulating, not outchy, and the wood feels good in my hand.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this brush and for the price it is great and seems a higher quality than the price would suggest!</li>
            <li>and I like to use gel to give it even more body.  </li>
            <li>It is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i got this brush which has both boar bristle AND nylon pins.</li>
            <li>After a month - I can say that my hair is more shiny looking (</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this was made in Germany, it seems more along the lines of China.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>For people with thinner hair, this brush must be magical.</li>
            <li>I always love thee brushes.</li>
            <li>This is such a wonderful brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are smooth and flow nicely.  </li>
            <li>Corny title aside, I love this brush.</li>
            <li>in my experience with these types of brushes, the hole is there to allow air to move inside and out of the brush for comfort and pressure purposes; i.e. most brushes have a form of this hole built into the brush.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE them,</li>
            <li>I looked and looked, read so many reviews, and found the Spornette</li>
            <li>This is about the initial awesomeness at quality and just how awesome it</li>
            <li>Just an air hole, as it were. :).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just love this brush.</li>
            <li>This brush really does feel great.</li>
            <li>Also, it seems to make a lot of static, especially at first - ?  </li>
            <li>Significantly better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, which includes those &amp;#34;knot</li>
            <li>Favorite brush for 20 yrs.  </li>
            <li>I have nothing more to say.</li>
            <li>: On the plus side, I love how this brush feels on my head.  </li>
            <li>And it does so without creating static.</li>
            <li>it has boar bristles and nylon bristles to help better penetrate your hair.</li>
            <li>Good size, just right.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a &#x27;cheaper&#x27; but still good quality Mason Pearson type brush and this brush is certainly it!</li>
            <li>My sister is a cosmetologist of 10 years or so, and said these are pretty much the best brushes if you count bang for buck.</li>
            <li>Its easy to want to brush more often with this, seems to help my hair shine too.</li>
            <li>makes your hair silky smooth... buyin more.</li>
            <li>Glides through wet hair and is excellent for blow drying.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush in hopes that it would be better than my cheap Goody brush that I had been using.</li>
            <li>I also like the Spornette \\&quot;Luxury Cushion,\\&quot; \\&quot;Classic Cushion #26,\\&quot; and the \\&quot;Feel Good #29\\&quot; brushes.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>The handle is strong and the brush has held up well, we have had it for over a year I believe.</li>
            <li>The brush is very comfortable in my hand and it feels nice to brush my hair with this particular brush.</li>
            <li>Just Love it, I kinda feel my hair&#x27;s favorite time is right before bed, because knows i&#x27;m going to brush it ...</li>
            <li>The nylon pins ensure good penetration, massage the scalp, and reduce static and the boar bristle leaves the hair smooth and spread the natural hair oil.  </li>
            <li>We all have fine hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li>All that said, after I brush for awhile, including upside-down, trying to get the brush to penetrate all my hair, when I&#x27;ve finger-fluffed it again, THEN it&#x27;s pretty nice.  </li>
            <li>For the record I have waist length fine hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this brush for a couple months and it seems to be holding up just fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine, shoulder length hair</li>
            <li>Great for the price beat the $50 similar items.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing, it is gentle but gets all the knots out.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s no dust on any of my furniture, yet my brush was filled with dust all the time.</li>
            <li>Fantastic brush.</li>
            <li>My grandson has a fit when his hair is tangled and you try to brush it.  </li>
            <li>I am overall happy with this brush.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this brush because it is the same size.  </li>
            <li>great for my very short hair cut.  </li>
            <li>This brush when you take it out of the packet looks and smells cheap.</li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>They did not refund me, but they did respond promptly, saying they had never been contacted about this problem before, and offered to send me a replacement brush for free.  </li>
            <li>wooden)--maybe they thought it would be more appropriate for my hair type and not tear as much?</li>
            <li>- it does a good job and makes my daughter&#x27;s hair super soft.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and such a great product.  </li>
            <li>Was quite excited about this hair brush.</li>
            <li>I love this brush first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been familiar with this since, well forever.</li>
            <li>I think we have a perfect storm of hair trouble;  my 9yo daughter is on swim team (and despite my urging, never brushes her hair out when she finishes with practice!  aarrggghhh).  </li>
            <li>It will leave the hair glossy, smooth, and full of body.</li>
            <li>/&gt;9-18-12 (original review date, but I accidentally put the review on their mini-brush</li>
            <li>doing that regularly--apart from the fact that I shouldn&#x27;t have to--will significantly shorten the life-span of the brush.  </li>
            <li>However, how do I clean it?</li>
            <li>It seems kind of silly to gush about a hairbrush but this is truly the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>The dish brush, made with natural hairs, is still working perfectly, over a year later.</li>
            <li>I wish they made one that was rectangular and slightly rounded with no cushion - that would be the ideal shape for my hair.....</li>
            <li>old daughters love this brush too!</li>
            <li>so I give them as a special gift.</li>
            <li>The price was right, too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good brush, but they don&#x27;t really last.</li>
            <li>I have used this brush for many years and really like it.  </li>
            <li>The function of the brush was fine at first, though the shiny glaze finish on the wood started chipping almost immediately.</li>
            <li>I was no longer able to find it at my local beauty supply store and was glad to find it on the internet.  </li>
            <li>shipping was very fast and free.</li>
            <li>I think with the addition of the prongs in the bristles, it makes it so much easier to use and clean!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this brush for a couple of months now, and while it isn&#x27;t anything magical, it certainly does exactly what I wanted it to.</li>
            <li>My daughter has long, fine hair, and a sensitive head, and this brush works great with tangles.  </li>
            <li>It does feel like a good scalp massage despite my thick hair and it is very smooth.</li>
            <li>Great brush, I&#x27;ve noticed that a few of the bristles have already fallen out though</li>
            <li>Nice feel to wooden handle.</li>
            <li>I suppose it might be worth my while to purchase a Mason Pearson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>worth every penny</li>
            <li>loved this brush so much I had to buy a second to keep at work.</li>
            <li>I thought it was certainly worth the price.</li>
            <li>So, because that was so positive, I decided there&#x27;s something special about brushes, of any variety, made in Germany.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m making sure to clean this one rather regularly</li>
            <li>/&gt;Get this brush, you and your hair will thank, well, all the positive reviews on here, and Spornette of course!</li>
            <li>i reserved my review until i attempted a blow dry, and the brush held up better than i could have imagined!  </li>
            <li>(I always say I have lots of fine hair to a new hairdresser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of few brushes that successfully gets through my wavey, tangle-prone hair.  </li>
            <li>Much superior to the Bass hair brushes.</li>
            <li>This one was very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>So this is not so much a criticism as an observation and caution to other thick-haired people out there looking for a good brush.</li>
            <li>have average amount of fine hair and static has always been my enemy.</li>
            <li>High quality and makes my hair so soft, smooth and shiny!  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The nylon bristles untangle and smooth hair, and the boar bristles spread oil and give a natural shine.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this brush!! ^^</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;porcupine&amp;#34; bristles fell out of 2 of the holes the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Its a cheap hairbrush nowhere near the price they put on it.</li>
            <li>The best brush  to untangle thin curly hair!</li>
            <li>so much I&#x27;m going to order one for myself!&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend it!</li>
            <li>I have used this brush for many years and finally had to replace it.</li>
            <li>When I washed it for the first time, a bristle fell out.  </li>
            <li>thanks for the product!</li>
            <li>This is the second brush I bought and it is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love the bristles, but was wanting a brush that actually brushed my hair, rather than just smoothing it.</li>
            <li>This brush goes through her mane like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li>They make my hair have static, don&#x27;t brush all the way through and I always seem to have problems with the handles popping off or the bristles breaking out of the back piece.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I came back to buy 3 more for family members as gifts, I like this brush so much.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d really like this or the (unblunted) regular ends of the nylon bristles.</li>
            <li>Getting her brushed out in the morning before school used to be a real chore that, I&#x27;m ashamed to admit, I had begun skipping more and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is short so tangles aren&#x27;t much of an issue, but it&#x27;s pretty coarse, and the brush does a good job at getting it in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li>will say it&#x27;s holding true thus far.</li>
            <li>It will take out your tangles without your needing to even think about them while you brush with one hand and will not pull on your scalp (mine&#x27;s super sensitive).</li>
            <li>I use the large end of a comb to get out the lint that accumulates from my flannel sheets</li>
            <li>okay, it may have just been a loose one.  </li>
            <li>I felt it was only reaching the surface of my hair, and I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this one because it&#x27;s a combination of the nylon bristles to detangle my hair and massage my scalp, while also getting the benefit of boar hair bristles.</li>
            <li>She really likes both.</li>
            <li>It works really well and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My two teenage daughters enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this brush.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>This did the trick, works very well.</li>
            <li>, IT&#x27;S REASONABLY PRICED</li>
            <li>I really like using this brush on my hair.</li>
            <li>I did miss one bristle like others have said but it really doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>my curly/coily hair really responds well to this brush.  </li>
            <li>(My hair health is my desire for bore bristle) but the 100% bore, won&#x27;t reach my scalp very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing not everyone so much so.</li>
            <li>, her hair is already very thick/dense, and curly.  </li>
            <li>The boar bristles are gentle and the porcupine bristles go through my hair but are not scratchy on my scalp.</li>
            <li>This brush makes my hair look and feel so much fuller.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll even admit to being able to use it when my hair was wet (just to see how it performed).</li>
            <li>The bristles are just right for thick hair too, and give the scalp a nice massage.  </li>
            <li>Brush is okay but one set of bristles were missing right out of the package and a set of bristles were bent out of shape.</li>
            <li>this is the best hairbrush ever, especially for long heavy hair.  </li>
            <li>time I think I&#x27;ll pay a bit more and get the other brand.</li>
            <li>I worry that when I wash my brush (which I do every time I wash my hair) there is water getting in there which won&#x27;t dry easily, and will eventually either rot out the brush or create a mold problem.</li>
            <li>Brushing with the new Spornette is pure pleasure.</li>
            <li>The first brush I got was all boar bristle and the bristles were so soft</li>
            <li>Whenever I tried to gently pull the bristles back out to their original length, the whole bristle clump would pull out of the brush completely.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, there was a huge and unsightly bar code sticker directly on the back of the brush, which took ages to remove without damaging the varnish on the wood.</li>
            <li>BETTER than my Sephora All boar bristle oval cushion, and half the price.</li>
            <li>Easily brushes out tangles even for wet hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the original packaging anymore and can&#x27;t check where the brush was actually made, but, judging from the quality of the brush I received, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if manufacturing has moved to a cheaper source!</li>
            <li>which is the main reason I wanted something with boar</li>
            <li>/&gt;This would be a four or five star review, but it came missing one bristle--sad to see an empty hole, but other than that it&#x27;s perfect and exactly what I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but she&#x27;s pretty much the opposite; no swim team, straight hair, with normal thickness.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it as a gift to replace someone&#x27;s old brush, but we had to throw it away because the smell would fill the entire bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t brush hard because I find boar hair brushes to work better with gentle gliding motions anyway, but the whole idea of the cushion with nylon bristles is to help massage the scalp.</li>
            <li>and this really helps distribute the natural oils in your scalp &amp; hair to help decrease tangles.</li>
            <li>or if the bristles will fall out, but so far it seems very well constructed.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I wanted better quality than Walmart type brushes, all of which also seem to have bristles missing.  </li>
            <li>and I love using this everyday and plan to give as gifts for the ladies in my life.</li>
            <li>This one, with its plastic bristles, does a better job, but I still feel like it sort of packs down my hair, so that it&#x27;s not fluffy, but almost matted to my head.  </li>
            <li>You can also pull out the hair easily to clean it when loose hair gets tangled around it.</li>
            <li>I have 2&#x27; of super thick hair that tangles if I&#x27;m breathing, but this brush does a fantastic job of keeping my strands sorted without pulling.</li>
            <li>I can tell you right now that my hair has become obviously smoother and \\&quot;fluffier\\&quot; with no</li>
            <li>In some ways it seems a little pricey for a hair brush, and I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;ve used cheaper hair brushes in the past and been happy with them, then there isn&#x27;t really any reason to buy this one.</li>
            <li>It reaches my scalp, with good contact, but very comfortable with the cushioned rubber base.</li>
            <li>I gives me an absurd volume though, which is fine for most people, except I have a lot of volume already.</li>
            <li>It feels fantastic and doesn&#x27;t seem to pull or get caught as easily as other brushes I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably get a new one soon anyways though because some of the bristles have fallen out.</li>
            <li>The wooden handle is smooth and sturdy, this feels like a brush that&#x27;ll last years!</li>
            <li>I love that it has both the boar bristles and the thick plastic bristles to balance untangling and gently smoothing out your hair.</li>
            <li>The plastic handled one still tears my greying hair if I&#x27;m not careful, but not as much.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking at more expensive brushes of the same type as this one on the other hand, I&#x27;d say this brush is a good intro point to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i wanted one of those very expensive brushes from england, but really couldn&#x27;t justify paying that much for a brush no matter how good it is, so i opted for this instead.</li>
            <li>It helps distribute oil through my hair and might add to shine a little bit, though there isn&#x27;t a huge difference in the appearance of my hair.</li>
            <li>- a year later there is one row where the nylon bristles with the little balls on top</li>
            <li>The hairbrush I received is very nice, except that it is missing 1 hole of bristles in the middle of the brush, typical of a brush that has been used or is defected.</li>
            <li>old &amp; 10yr.</li>
            <li>and so far it&#x27;s been awesome!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;d like to add my brush was not missing any bristles as another reviewer had mentions, though it does have a hole</li>
            <li>This is the only brush that I use on my daughter&#x27;s waist-length, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed a rubbery smell from the cushion that never quite faded away completely.</li>
            <li>I was looking for my old brush I had for over 20 years, an Ambassador</li>
            <li>No missing brsitles.</li>
            <li>It looks like something to brush a dolls hair with, I sent it straight back</li>
            <li>I have very fine/thin fragile hair.</li>
            <li>But after I found another reputable brand of this type of brush in a store recently, it was harsh.</li>
            <li>I have learned to not apply too much pressure when brushing my hair with this thing but it would have been nice if there was little plastic balls at the end of the longer bristles like some other combs that are similar to this one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even hear a single complaint from her any more... and she even stands still when she sees me coming with the brush!)</li>
            <li>My hair is just past my shoulders and still growing, medium thickness of fine hair.</li>
            <li>suppose I could complain that the brush isn&#x27;t very heavy, meaning it&#x27;s not made from some exotic hardwood - and it may or may not be actual boar&#x27;s hair -</li>
            <li>I have an all boar-bristle brush that I got in Japan, and it can&#x27;t penetrate my very fine, very thick hair.  </li>
            <li>The brushes  arrived promptly and was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I buy no other type.</li>
            <li>I used to have another brush that this one not only replaced, but made my old one and all others seem like garbage to me!</li>
            <li>I have theses brushes for my kids, whose hair ranges from fine to thick.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear that the bristles were not properly anchored.</li>
            <li>; my two year old with curly hair actually lets me brush his hair now!  </li>
            <li>Very pleasantly surprised that such an inexpensive brush works so well.</li>
            <li>My fiance had been using a broken brush for awhile, I bought her this and another Spornette for Christmas (ok, one of her Christmas presents).</li>
            <li>/&gt;x Attracts dust like CRAZY - my home is vacuumed fairly often</li>
            <li>I have routinely broken the handles on many plastic hair brushes.  </li>
            <li>Not sure why that is, since other reviews said it eliminated static for them.  </li>
            <li>I had to clean my brush at least once a week and even keeping my brush in a dust bag didn&#x27;t stop the dust bunnies</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this brush after carefully reading product description and reviews.</li>
            <li>really transfers any oils you have on the shaft down to the ends too -</li>
            <li>The brush is now completely flat, with the central rings of bristles being super short or missing altogether</li>
            <li>A few weeks later and now most assuredly a few months later, doubts began to creep in (and have come to permanently settle). 1.</li>
            <li>dyed blonde (ie. damaged), naturally straight with annoying cowlicks and waves, and is quite thick and this brush made it through to the scalp and smoothed everything into a wonderful waterfall without making me look like I was wearing a helmet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I really couldn&#x27;t care less about any of those bragging points.  </li>
            <li>I requested a replacement from Amazon and that brush also had bristles missing in the exact same place.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Synopsis: It&#x27;s a brush, not magical or amazing, but it keeps my hair looking healthier than the cheaper brushes I&#x27;ve had before this, and work to my satisfaction for my thick moderately curly hair.</li>
            <li>Awhile back I ordered a Mason Pearson brush at three times the price of one of these and was very disappointed--tried to send it back but the customer service was typical Brit--snooty, unhelpful.  </li>
            <li>The finish was peeling and cracking off the new brush in less than a month, leaving bare wood.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> maybe it was a good deal for someone else.   </li>
            <li> My mom used it and loved it.</li>
            <li> Spornette seems to be a good brand (check out their website)</li>
            <li> though to be fair I also changed my conditioner).</li>
            <li> Good quality porcupine bristles, though a couple did fall off when I was washing it</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended that I buy a good massage brush.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any bristles falling off and the handle and (lacquer) paint have held up nicely.</li>

            <li> I did a lot of research on a good quality brush at reasonable price and here&#x27;s the best deal i found.</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought an Ambassador Hairbrush and love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this hairbrush!</li>
            <li> I own four Spornette brushes &amp; love them all!  </li>
            <li> Works great, quick shipping!</li>
            <li> and I actually liked what I smelled.</li>
            <li> I really love this brand, they are just as good as the super-expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> I liked so much&lt;</li>
            <li> Once you try it, you will want one of your own -</li>
            <li> (I kind of want to buy one for everyone I know)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice sturdy brush.  </li>
            <li> I love a good brushing.</li>
            <li> I had a brush that had both kinds of bristles, and liked it</li>
            <li> so that was nice.</li>
            <li> it does a great job smoothing out my hair by just brushing, and it also does a pretty good job straightening while blow drying.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for many years and the quality is still exceptional.</li>
            <li> Very easy to manage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It sits comfortably in your hand, it&#x27;s the perfect size... and really, I can&#x27;t stop raving about it to everyone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right kind of &#x27;scratchy&#x27; on my scalp, stimulating, not outchy, and the wood feels good in my hand.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this brush and for the price it is great and seems a higher quality than the price would suggest!</li>
            <li> and I like to use gel to give it even more body.  </li>
            <li> It is fabulous!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i got this brush which has both boar bristle AND nylon pins.</li>
            <li> After a month - I can say that my hair is more shiny looking (</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this was made in Germany, it seems more along the lines of China.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> For people with thinner hair, this brush must be magical.</li>
            <li> I always love thee brushes.</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are smooth and flow nicely.  </li>
            <li> Corny title aside, I love this brush.</li>
            <li> in my experience with these types of brushes, the hole is there to allow air to move inside and out of the brush for comfort and pressure purposes; i.e. most brushes have a form of this hole built into the brush.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE them,</li>
            <li> I looked and looked, read so many reviews, and found the Spornette</li>
            <li> This is about the initial awesomeness at quality and just how awesome it</li>
            <li> Just an air hole, as it were. :).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just love this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush really does feel great.</li>
            <li> Also, it seems to make a lot of static, especially at first - ?  </li>
            <li> Significantly better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, which includes those &amp;#34;knot</li>
            <li> Favorite brush for 20 yrs.  </li>
            <li> I have nothing more to say.</li>
            <li> : On the plus side, I love how this brush feels on my head.  </li>
            <li> And it does so without creating static.</li>
            <li> it has boar bristles and nylon bristles to help better penetrate your hair.</li>
            <li> Good size, just right.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a &#x27;cheaper&#x27; but still good quality Mason Pearson type brush and this brush is certainly it!</li>
            <li> My sister is a cosmetologist of 10 years or so, and said these are pretty much the best brushes if you count bang for buck.</li>
            <li> Its easy to want to brush more often with this, seems to help my hair shine too.</li>
            <li> makes your hair silky smooth... buyin more.</li>
            <li> Glides through wet hair and is excellent for blow drying.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush in hopes that it would be better than my cheap Goody brush that I had been using.</li>
            <li> I also like the Spornette \\&quot;Luxury Cushion,\\&quot; \\&quot;Classic Cushion #26,\\&quot; and the \\&quot;Feel Good #29\\&quot; brushes.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> The handle is strong and the brush has held up well, we have had it for over a year I believe.</li>
            <li> The brush is very comfortable in my hand and it feels nice to brush my hair with this particular brush.</li>
            <li> Just Love it, I kinda feel my hair&#x27;s favorite time is right before bed, because knows i&#x27;m going to brush it ...</li>
            <li> The nylon pins ensure good penetration, massage the scalp, and reduce static and the boar bristle leaves the hair smooth and spread the natural hair oil.  </li>
            <li> We all have fine hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li> All that said, after I brush for awhile, including upside-down, trying to get the brush to penetrate all my hair, when I&#x27;ve finger-fluffed it again, THEN it&#x27;s pretty nice.  </li>
            <li> For the record I have waist length fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a couple months and it seems to be holding up just fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine, shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> Great for the price beat the $50 similar items.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing, it is gentle but gets all the knots out.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no dust on any of my furniture, yet my brush was filled with dust all the time.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush.</li>
            <li> My grandson has a fit when his hair is tangled and you try to brush it.  </li>
            <li> I am overall happy with this brush.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this brush because it is the same size.  </li>
            <li> great for my very short hair cut.  </li>
            <li> This brush when you take it out of the packet looks and smells cheap.</li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> They did not refund me, but they did respond promptly, saying they had never been contacted about this problem before, and offered to send me a replacement brush for free.  </li>
            <li> wooden)--maybe they thought it would be more appropriate for my hair type and not tear as much?</li>
            <li> - it does a good job and makes my daughter&#x27;s hair super soft.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and such a great product.  </li>
            <li> Was quite excited about this hair brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been familiar with this since, well forever.</li>
            <li> I think we have a perfect storm of hair trouble;  my 9yo daughter is on swim team (and despite my urging, never brushes her hair out when she finishes with practice!  aarrggghhh).  </li>
            <li> It will leave the hair glossy, smooth, and full of body.</li>
            <li> /&gt;9-18-12 (original review date, but I accidentally put the review on their mini-brush</li>
            <li> doing that regularly--apart from the fact that I shouldn&#x27;t have to--will significantly shorten the life-span of the brush.  </li>
            <li> However, how do I clean it?</li>
            <li> It seems kind of silly to gush about a hairbrush but this is truly the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> The dish brush, made with natural hairs, is still working perfectly, over a year later.</li>
            <li> I wish they made one that was rectangular and slightly rounded with no cushion - that would be the ideal shape for my hair.....</li>
            <li> old daughters love this brush too!</li>
            <li> so I give them as a special gift.</li>
            <li> The price was right, too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brush, but they don&#x27;t really last.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for many years and really like it.  </li>
            <li> The function of the brush was fine at first, though the shiny glaze finish on the wood started chipping almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I was no longer able to find it at my local beauty supply store and was glad to find it on the internet.  </li>
            <li> shipping was very fast and free.</li>
            <li> I think with the addition of the prongs in the bristles, it makes it so much easier to use and clean!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a couple of months now, and while it isn&#x27;t anything magical, it certainly does exactly what I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long, fine hair, and a sensitive head, and this brush works great with tangles.  </li>
            <li> It does feel like a good scalp massage despite my thick hair and it is very smooth.</li>
            <li> Great brush, I&#x27;ve noticed that a few of the bristles have already fallen out though</li>
            <li> Nice feel to wooden handle.</li>
            <li> I suppose it might be worth my while to purchase a Mason Pearson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> worth every penny</li>
            <li> loved this brush so much I had to buy a second to keep at work.</li>
            <li> I thought it was certainly worth the price.</li>
            <li> So, because that was so positive, I decided there&#x27;s something special about brushes, of any variety, made in Germany.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m making sure to clean this one rather regularly</li>
            <li> /&gt;Get this brush, you and your hair will thank, well, all the positive reviews on here, and Spornette of course!</li>
            <li> i reserved my review until i attempted a blow dry, and the brush held up better than i could have imagined!  </li>
            <li> (I always say I have lots of fine hair to a new hairdresser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of few brushes that successfully gets through my wavey, tangle-prone hair.  </li>
            <li> Much superior to the Bass hair brushes.</li>
            <li> This one was very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> So this is not so much a criticism as an observation and caution to other thick-haired people out there looking for a good brush.</li>
            <li> have average amount of fine hair and static has always been my enemy.</li>
            <li> High quality and makes my hair so soft, smooth and shiny!  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The nylon bristles untangle and smooth hair, and the boar bristles spread oil and give a natural shine.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this brush!! ^^</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;porcupine&amp;#34; bristles fell out of 2 of the holes the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Its a cheap hairbrush nowhere near the price they put on it.</li>
            <li> The best brush  to untangle thin curly hair!</li>
            <li> so much I&#x27;m going to order one for myself!&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for many years and finally had to replace it.</li>
            <li> When I washed it for the first time, a bristle fell out.  </li>
            <li> thanks for the product!</li>
            <li> This is the second brush I bought and it is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I love the bristles, but was wanting a brush that actually brushed my hair, rather than just smoothing it.</li>
            <li> This brush goes through her mane like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li> They make my hair have static, don&#x27;t brush all the way through and I always seem to have problems with the handles popping off or the bristles breaking out of the back piece.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I came back to buy 3 more for family members as gifts, I like this brush so much.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d really like this or the (unblunted) regular ends of the nylon bristles.</li>
            <li> Getting her brushed out in the morning before school used to be a real chore that, I&#x27;m ashamed to admit, I had begun skipping more and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is short so tangles aren&#x27;t much of an issue, but it&#x27;s pretty coarse, and the brush does a good job at getting it in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> will say it&#x27;s holding true thus far.</li>
            <li> It will take out your tangles without your needing to even think about them while you brush with one hand and will not pull on your scalp (mine&#x27;s super sensitive).</li>
            <li> I use the large end of a comb to get out the lint that accumulates from my flannel sheets</li>
            <li> okay, it may have just been a loose one.  </li>
            <li> I felt it was only reaching the surface of my hair, and I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this one because it&#x27;s a combination of the nylon bristles to detangle my hair and massage my scalp, while also getting the benefit of boar hair bristles.</li>
            <li> She really likes both.</li>
            <li> It works really well and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My two teenage daughters enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this brush.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> This did the trick, works very well.</li>
            <li> , IT&#x27;S REASONABLY PRICED</li>
            <li> I really like using this brush on my hair.</li>
            <li> I did miss one bristle like others have said but it really doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> my curly/coily hair really responds well to this brush.  </li>
            <li> (My hair health is my desire for bore bristle) but the 100% bore, won&#x27;t reach my scalp very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing not everyone so much so.</li>
            <li> , her hair is already very thick/dense, and curly.  </li>
            <li> The boar bristles are gentle and the porcupine bristles go through my hair but are not scratchy on my scalp.</li>
            <li> This brush makes my hair look and feel so much fuller.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll even admit to being able to use it when my hair was wet (just to see how it performed).</li>
            <li> The bristles are just right for thick hair too, and give the scalp a nice massage.  </li>
            <li> Brush is okay but one set of bristles were missing right out of the package and a set of bristles were bent out of shape.</li>
            <li> this is the best hairbrush ever, especially for long heavy hair.  </li>
            <li> time I think I&#x27;ll pay a bit more and get the other brand.</li>
            <li> I worry that when I wash my brush (which I do every time I wash my hair) there is water getting in there which won&#x27;t dry easily, and will eventually either rot out the brush or create a mold problem.</li>
            <li> Brushing with the new Spornette is pure pleasure.</li>
            <li> The first brush I got was all boar bristle and the bristles were so soft</li>
            <li> Whenever I tried to gently pull the bristles back out to their original length, the whole bristle clump would pull out of the brush completely.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, there was a huge and unsightly bar code sticker directly on the back of the brush, which took ages to remove without damaging the varnish on the wood.</li>
            <li> BETTER than my Sephora All boar bristle oval cushion, and half the price.</li>
            <li> Easily brushes out tangles even for wet hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the original packaging anymore and can&#x27;t check where the brush was actually made, but, judging from the quality of the brush I received, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if manufacturing has moved to a cheaper source!</li>
            <li> which is the main reason I wanted something with boar</li>
            <li> /&gt;This would be a four or five star review, but it came missing one bristle--sad to see an empty hole, but other than that it&#x27;s perfect and exactly what I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> but she&#x27;s pretty much the opposite; no swim team, straight hair, with normal thickness.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I originally bought it as a gift to replace someone&#x27;s old brush, but we had to throw it away because the smell would fill the entire bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t brush hard because I find boar hair brushes to work better with gentle gliding motions anyway, but the whole idea of the cushion with nylon bristles is to help massage the scalp.</li>
            <li> and this really helps distribute the natural oils in your scalp &amp; hair to help decrease tangles.</li>
            <li> or if the bristles will fall out, but so far it seems very well constructed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I wanted better quality than Walmart type brushes, all of which also seem to have bristles missing.  </li>
            <li> and I love using this everyday and plan to give as gifts for the ladies in my life.</li>
            <li> This one, with its plastic bristles, does a better job, but I still feel like it sort of packs down my hair, so that it&#x27;s not fluffy, but almost matted to my head.  </li>
            <li> You can also pull out the hair easily to clean it when loose hair gets tangled around it.</li>
            <li> I have 2&#x27; of super thick hair that tangles if I&#x27;m breathing, but this brush does a fantastic job of keeping my strands sorted without pulling.</li>
            <li> I can tell you right now that my hair has become obviously smoother and \\&quot;fluffier\\&quot; with no</li>
            <li> In some ways it seems a little pricey for a hair brush, and I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;ve used cheaper hair brushes in the past and been happy with them, then there isn&#x27;t really any reason to buy this one.</li>
            <li> It reaches my scalp, with good contact, but very comfortable with the cushioned rubber base.</li>
            <li> I gives me an absurd volume though, which is fine for most people, except I have a lot of volume already.</li>
            <li> It feels fantastic and doesn&#x27;t seem to pull or get caught as easily as other brushes I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably get a new one soon anyways though because some of the bristles have fallen out.</li>
            <li> The wooden handle is smooth and sturdy, this feels like a brush that&#x27;ll last years!</li>
            <li> I love that it has both the boar bristles and the thick plastic bristles to balance untangling and gently smoothing out your hair.</li>
            <li> The plastic handled one still tears my greying hair if I&#x27;m not careful, but not as much.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking at more expensive brushes of the same type as this one on the other hand, I&#x27;d say this brush is a good intro point to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i wanted one of those very expensive brushes from england, but really couldn&#x27;t justify paying that much for a brush no matter how good it is, so i opted for this instead.</li>
            <li> It helps distribute oil through my hair and might add to shine a little bit, though there isn&#x27;t a huge difference in the appearance of my hair.</li>
            <li> - a year later there is one row where the nylon bristles with the little balls on top</li>
            <li> The hairbrush I received is very nice, except that it is missing 1 hole of bristles in the middle of the brush, typical of a brush that has been used or is defected.</li>
            <li> old &amp; 10yr.</li>
            <li> and so far it&#x27;s been awesome!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;d like to add my brush was not missing any bristles as another reviewer had mentions, though it does have a hole</li>
            <li> This is the only brush that I use on my daughter&#x27;s waist-length, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed a rubbery smell from the cushion that never quite faded away completely.</li>
            <li> I was looking for my old brush I had for over 20 years, an Ambassador</li>
            <li> No missing brsitles.</li>
            <li> It looks like something to brush a dolls hair with, I sent it straight back</li>
            <li> I have very fine/thin fragile hair.</li>
            <li> But after I found another reputable brand of this type of brush in a store recently, it was harsh.</li>
            <li> I have learned to not apply too much pressure when brushing my hair with this thing but it would have been nice if there was little plastic balls at the end of the longer bristles like some other combs that are similar to this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even hear a single complaint from her any more... and she even stands still when she sees me coming with the brush!)</li>
            <li> My hair is just past my shoulders and still growing, medium thickness of fine hair.</li>
            <li> suppose I could complain that the brush isn&#x27;t very heavy, meaning it&#x27;s not made from some exotic hardwood - and it may or may not be actual boar&#x27;s hair -</li>
            <li> I have an all boar-bristle brush that I got in Japan, and it can&#x27;t penetrate my very fine, very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The brushes  arrived promptly and was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I buy no other type.</li>
            <li> I used to have another brush that this one not only replaced, but made my old one and all others seem like garbage to me!</li>
            <li> I have theses brushes for my kids, whose hair ranges from fine to thick.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear that the bristles were not properly anchored.</li>
            <li> ; my two year old with curly hair actually lets me brush his hair now!  </li>
            <li> Very pleasantly surprised that such an inexpensive brush works so well.</li>
            <li> My fiance had been using a broken brush for awhile, I bought her this and another Spornette for Christmas (ok, one of her Christmas presents).</li>
            <li> /&gt;x Attracts dust like CRAZY - my home is vacuumed fairly often</li>
            <li> I have routinely broken the handles on many plastic hair brushes.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why that is, since other reviews said it eliminated static for them.  </li>
            <li> I had to clean my brush at least once a week and even keeping my brush in a dust bag didn&#x27;t stop the dust bunnies</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this brush after carefully reading product description and reviews.</li>
            <li> really transfers any oils you have on the shaft down to the ends too -</li>
            <li> The brush is now completely flat, with the central rings of bristles being super short or missing altogether</li>
            <li> A few weeks later and now most assuredly a few months later, doubts began to creep in (and have come to permanently settle). 1.</li>
            <li> dyed blonde (ie. damaged), naturally straight with annoying cowlicks and waves, and is quite thick and this brush made it through to the scalp and smoothed everything into a wonderful waterfall without making me look like I was wearing a helmet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I really couldn&#x27;t care less about any of those bragging points.  </li>
            <li> I requested a replacement from Amazon and that brush also had bristles missing in the exact same place.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Synopsis: It&#x27;s a brush, not magical or amazing, but it keeps my hair looking healthier than the cheaper brushes I&#x27;ve had before this, and work to my satisfaction for my thick moderately curly hair.</li>
            <li> Awhile back I ordered a Mason Pearson brush at three times the price of one of these and was very disappointed--tried to send it back but the customer service was typical Brit--snooty, unhelpful.  </li>
            <li> The finish was peeling and cracking off the new brush in less than a month, leaving bare wood.  </li>
            <li> When you first use it, a few hairs and bristles will fall out, but once they do the rest will stay for a long time.</li>
            <li> Finally decided that it was time to get a new hair brush (had my old Spornette for about 20+ years, was brushing my very long hair everyday).</li>
            <li> Previously I was buying a new Oxo brush every 2 months.</li>
            <li> Not sure why, suspect it may be due to perpetual washing NOT so much from being dipped in water BUT from being handled near water.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long this brush actually stays functional.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude with short hair so the long plastic bristles hit my scalp.</li>
            <li> The bore bristles help grab the hair, doing, what I&#x27;m going for, of distributing natural oils down</li>
            <li> The bigger issue though is that apparently there is nothing holding the bristles in place, so their much touted \\&quot;pneumatic\\&quot; feature (air \\&quot;pillow\\&quot; under the pink bristle pad) is just a hole that the bristles slowly sink into.  </li>
            <li> The brush is small - I have small hands and a lot of brushes are really huge</li>
            <li> I brush my hair only when it&#x27;s dry though.</li>
            <li> Nearly daily practices leave her hair dry, frizzy and tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected with not enough boar bristles.</li>
            <li> last forever if you don&#x27;t loose them.</li>
            <li> At less than $15, it is just as good as very expensive brushes.  </li>
            <li> I can hardly believe how much easier it is.  </li>
            <li> The brush does both of these jobs well, and I have used it on my hair when long (waist length) and when shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and it always gets tangled.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve purchased three in the last few years, but it&#x27;s still better than buying an ultra expensive brand.</li>
            <li> For me it creates funky air spaces within my hair that add strange waves and mounds when I flip my hair to the side.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only partial boar bristle.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a brush for so long</li>
            <li> I had hair down to the middle of my back.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser told me to invest in a boar&#x27;s hair brush to keep my hair from getting too dry</li>
            <li> When I first receive it, the texture and over all look is worse than I paid for.</li>
            <li> I find that the combination of bristles works well with wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t rip out my hair when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> In the end they sent me an extra free brush as well--slightly different style (plastic base instead of</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few months at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s an empty bristle tuft hole in each brush.  </li>
            <li> By chipping off I mean it started off small but now seemingly larger and larger slivers are coming off and is apparent when looking at brush.</li>
            <li> Hairbrush is hard to clean, seems perpetually dusty even after cleaning, wet dust is perpetually unappealing and where does it come from if I just washed it?, making me loath to put it near my hair.</li>
            <li> the down side, it&#x27;s a little larger than my last brush--unnecessarily so, and to me a little too heavy.  </li>
            <li> This is unlike any other brush that you find at the store.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought similar brushes in the past that were boar bristle with the nylon bristles but</li>
            <li> Not too small, but also not so big</li>
            <li> /&gt;(And, of couse, it works famously on my other daughter&#x27;s hair too -</li>
            <li> With my old brush, a few strokes would have half my hair flying away from my head and half of it stuck to my face!!</li>
            <li> (I got tired of constantly trying to pull them back up).  </li>
            <li> A few of the bristles were missing from the brush...not the German quality you would think.</li>
            <li> And it is almost impossible to clean this brush.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I really like how these brushes feel on the scalp--gentle but stimulating.  </li>
            <li> I even had a stranger comment on my &amp;#34;beautiful thick hair.&amp;#34; The brush also spreads the oil from the roots and evenly distributes it through the hair allowing me to go two extra days without having to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> But i do not know of any boars bristle brushes that do not begin to break down after 5 years.</li>
            <li> I like the way this brush rubs and exfoliates your scalp while also smoothing your hair down.  </li>
            <li> I had one of those for years before it started breaking down.</li>
            <li> The longer, plastic bristles seem to have been cut off bluntly leaving the ends a little sharp.</li>
            <li> The Spornette brush had very sharp plastic bristles that cut into my scalp and the boar bristles tangled and matted down my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few other items made in Germany, and they were of the highest quality.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a second one, and unfortunately, they do not seem to be as well made anymore.  </li>
            <li> There have been a lot less tears in our house over hair brushing, my 8yr.</li>
            <li> but it always ended up a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been decreasing the frequency of shampooing and wanted a brush that would distribute the oils throughout my thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> only brush I use for years and years, hard to find except for here!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d like to also note that a previous reviewer mentioned a hole in the brush inferring that a bristle was missing.  </li>
            <li> I was a little worried about the smell because of another review</li>
            <li> It makes it shine without being staticy, and it has little nylon bristles that grab the hair and hold it while brushing, so you aren&#x27;t just skimming over the surface.  </li>
            <li> was a little worried the nibs on the end of the nylon would be combersome.</li>
            <li> My niece has short, curly, thick hair, and she loves it too!</li>
            <li> A little disappointed but not worth the hassle of shipping back and waiting for a new one.</li>
            <li> Also, caused static in my hair which I hated.</li>
            <li> I have this and the round brush</li>
            <li> Arrived with hole where bristles were missing.</li>
            <li> Bristles also unevenly distributed.</li>
            <li> I was so hesitant of which bore brush to buy, to replace the 100% one I&#x27;ve had for a few years.</li>
            <li> not sure if the boar bristles are making my hair shinier or not yet....</li>
            <li> So hopefully no more bristles will fall out.  </li>
            <li> no more bristles have fallen out.  </li>
            <li> my old boar&#x27;s hair brush got rather dirty</li>
            <li> My hair is medium thick with a bit of curl</li>
            <li> I feel like I am getting a head massage with this brush, which works well for thick hair.</li>
            <li> Sad to say this brush is not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> A ridiculous way to package it.</li>
            <li> Not good for de-tangling.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly tough scalp.</li>
            <li> I have really thin hair</li>
            <li> I notice that the boar bristle was short on one side and so was the nylon one (they&#x27;re supposed to hook under the base and not come out.  </li>
            <li> The cushion behind the bristles makes if softer on the scalp.</li>
            <li> These type of brushes are hard to find and some are very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this brush for my daughter and was disappointed to find a section of bristles missing...</li>
            <li> I have medium thick hair and it was very uncomfortable on my scalp, and felt as if it was causing damage to the length of my hair.</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong with these.  </li>
            <li> The biggest reason you cannot go wrong with a Spornette product is their customer service.  </li>
            <li> I am so sad it didn&#x27;t work out, but I won&#x27;t torture my hair with this one.</li>
            <li> But with this brush, there&#x27;s almost NO STATIC at all!!!!!</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s absurd that a brush is deemed acceptable to be sold to customers this way.  </li>
            <li> but, unfortunately, they don&#x27;t seem to be around.  </li>
            <li> It sounds silly, but this brush has been life changing.</li>
            <li> I got this brush basically trying to find a cheaper version than the way too expensive for me Mason Pearson brush.  </li>
            <li> i would recommend it if you want an affordable alternative to a Maison Pierre brush, but it&#x27;s basically unusable because of how much dirty and dust it attracts.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot of effort to get it there, and then it&#x27;s disappointing.</li>
            <li> Also would have made it impossible to gift.</li>
            <li> and like a bad knock off.  </li>
            <li> I do not like giving bad reviews but in these cases would rather give others a heads up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really disappointed by this brush all in all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed and wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it.</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed and just ordered the \\&quot;Ambassador Hairbrush, Oval, Oak Handle\\&quot; as suggested by PizzyIzzy, another reviewer who was disappointed with the Spornette&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li> : there is a hole, of no bristles, in the rubber base.</li>
            <li> Generally I hate Bristle Brushes.</li>
            <li> The tips of the bristles are brutal on your scalp.  </li>

            <li> Love the brush n very good price! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Finally decided that it was time to get a new hair brush (had my old Spornette for about 20+ years, was brushing my very long hair everyday). Brushing with the new Spornette is pure pleasure. I brush my hair only when it&#x27;s dry though.</li>
            <li> This brush is a great value for the quality.  The nylon bristles untangle and smooth hair, and the boar bristles spread oil and give a natural shine.  The brush does both of these jobs well, and I have used it on my hair when long (waist length) and when shoulder length.  At less than $15, it is just as good as very expensive brushes.  Would purchase again.  Update: I owned one of these brushes for 10+ years, and never had a problem with it.  I recently purchased a second one, and unfortunately, they do not seem to be as well made anymore.  The finish was peeling and cracking off the new brush in less than a month, leaving bare wood.  While this doesn&#x27;t affect the function, it&#x27;s not what I was used to.</li>
            <li> I own four Spornette brushes &amp; love them all!  My hair is medium thick with a bit of curl and I like to use gel to give it even more body.  The Spornette 25 \\&quot;porcupine\\&quot; is wonderful for detangling as well as for distributing the gel/mousse throughout my hair.  I also like the Spornette \\&quot;Luxury Cushion,\\&quot; \\&quot;Classic Cushion #26,\\&quot; and the \\&quot;Feel Good #29\\&quot; brushes.  You just can&#x27;t go wrong with these.  Needless to say, I really like how these brushes feel on the scalp--gentle but stimulating.  Awhile back I ordered a Mason Pearson brush at three times the price of one of these and was very disappointed--tried to send it back but the customer service was typical Brit--snooty, unhelpful.  I ended up giving it to the local Cancer Society thrift shop--it was virtually unused, so maybe it was a good deal for someone else.   The biggest reason you cannot go wrong with a Spornette product is their customer service.  It is fabulous!  I had a question and got an immediate response from Laurie Sporn-Tratt at Spornette International.  I like to give these products as gifts, too.</li>
            <li> makes your hair silky smooth... buyin more. My daughter wouldnt let me brush her hair before but now she does.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on a good quality brush at reasonable price and here&#x27;s the best deal i found. I&#x27;m glad i got this brush which has both boar bristle AND nylon pins. The nylon pins ensure good penetration, massage the scalp, and reduce static and the boar bristle leaves the hair smooth and spread the natural hair oil.  My mom used it and loved it. She wanted one for herself! I was going order another one when i found another spornette brush for $4 at Ross!  Spornette seems to be a good brand (check out their website) and it&#x27;s made in German...</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended a boar bristle brush to distribute the oils throughout my hair. The first brush I got was all boar bristle and the bristles were so soft I felt it was only reaching the surface of my hair, and I have fine hair. I really like this one because it&#x27;s a combination of the nylon bristles to detangle my hair and massage my scalp, while also getting the benefit of boar hair bristles. The price was right, too! I was a little worried about the smell because of another review but I didn&#x27;t have any problems at all with that. In fact I had to put my nose into it to smell anything and I actually liked what I smelled.</li>
            <li> I use this brush for my granddaughter and she doesn&#x27;t complain. It&#x27;s a great brush.</li>
            <li> My family loves this brush! We all have fine hair that tangles easily and this really helps distribute the natural oils in your scalp &amp; hair to help decrease tangles. A friend who is a hairstylist recommended this brush and I would have ordered it earlier. There have been a lot less tears in our house over hair brushing, my 8yr. old &amp; 10yr. old daughters love this brush too!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this brush after carefully reading product description and reviews. Sad to say this brush is not worth the money in my opinion. I have medium thick hair and it was very uncomfortable on my scalp, and felt as if it was causing damage to the length of my hair. Also, caused static in my hair which I hated. I am so sad it didn&#x27;t work out, but I won&#x27;t torture my hair with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this brush for about a week and so far it&#x27;s been awesome!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have average amount of fine hair and static has always been my enemy. With my old brush, a few strokes would have half my hair flying away from my head and half of it stuck to my face!! But with this brush, there&#x27;s almost NO STATIC at all!!!!! amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the boar bristles are making my hair shinier or not yet....maybe I&#x27;ll do an update later on.&lt;br /&gt;But I can tell you right now that my hair has become obviously smoother and \\&quot;fluffier\\&quot; with no frizz!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brush!! ^^</li>
            <li> Glides through wet hair and is excellent for blow drying.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this brush and for the price it is great and seems a higher quality than the price would suggest! I am actually thinking about getting a second one. My hairdresser told me to invest in a boar&#x27;s hair brush to keep my hair from getting too dry (I guess it helps move the oils around). After a month - I can say that my hair is more shiny looking (though to be fair I also changed my conditioner). In any case, I recommend this brush. Also, I&#x27;d like to add my brush was not missing any bristles as another reviewer had mentions, though it does have a hole so the brush can \\&quot;breath\\&quot; and move.</li>
            <li> This is the only brush my daughters will use! It is wonderful, had to order 2!!</li>
            <li> Great for the price beat the $50 similar items. For the price one can buy two and they are durable.</li>
            <li> shipping was very fast and free. price of item was good.&lt;br /&gt;product itself is awesome, very pleased. i wanted one of those very expensive brushes from england, but really couldn&#x27;t justify paying that much for a brush no matter how good it is, so i opted for this instead. i&#x27;m very glad i did. i am more than happy with it and it feels wonderful on your scalp and hair. very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably the boar&#x27;s hair but this brush smells like a latrine!  I originally bought it as a gift to replace someone&#x27;s old brush, but we had to throw it away because the smell would fill the entire bathroom.  I don&#x27;t know if there was something we were supposed to do to remove the smell, but I won&#x27;t be buying this brand of brush again.</li>
            <li> My fiance had been using a broken brush for awhile, I bought her this and another Spornette for Christmas (ok, one of her Christmas presents). She really likes both. My sister is a cosmetologist of 10 years or so, and said these are pretty much the best brushes if you count bang for buck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for about three years now and it&#x27;s still going strong. I&#x27;ll probably get a new one soon anyways though because some of the bristles have fallen out.</li>
            <li> I really love this brand, they are just as good as the super-expensive brands.  I have this and the round brush and they make for a perfect styling pair.  This keeps my hair shiny and from getting split ends.  I like that it&#x27;s all in one piece and therefore there&#x27;s no groove for my hair to get stuck in and break.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it always gets tangled. This brush is amazing, it is gentle but gets all the knots out. I definitely recommend this brush to everyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brush, but they don&#x27;t really last. We&#x27;ve purchased three in the last few years, but it&#x27;s still better than buying an ultra expensive brand. The finish sometimes chips off but doesn&#x27;t affect the brushes ability to function.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brush! Very happy!</li>
            <li> Love this brush! I buy no other type. Doesn&#x27;t rip out my hair when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> great brush for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought three I liked so much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;even the wife likes it and she is bald as a cue ball!!</li>
            <li> Works great, quick shipping!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;porcupine&amp;#34; bristles fell out of 2 of the holes the first time I used it. Its a cheap hairbrush nowhere near the price they put on it. U can get this at a dollar store</li>
            <li> Just Love it, I kinda feel my hair&#x27;s favorite time is right before bed, because knows i&#x27;m going to brush it ...</li>
            <li> The best brush  to untangle thin curly hair! I ordered it for my girls and we like it so much I&#x27;m going to order one for myself!&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> The brushes  arrived promptly and was exactly what I expected.  I have been using them for many years and the quality is still exceptional.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;x Good quality porcupine bristles, though a couple did fall off when I was washing it&lt;br /&gt;x Affordable price&lt;br /&gt;x The brush is small - I have small hands and a lot of brushes are really huge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;x Attracts dust like CRAZY - my home is vacuumed fairly often and there&#x27;s no dust on any of my furniture, yet my brush was filled with dust all the time. I had to clean my brush at least once a week and even keeping my brush in a dust bag didn&#x27;t stop the dust bunnies&lt;br /&gt;x The wooden coating flakes just after a couple of months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really disappointed by this brush all in all. i would recommend it if you want an affordable alternative to a Maison Pierre brush, but it&#x27;s basically unusable because of how much dirty and dust it attracts.</li>
            <li> I have really thin hair and this is the only brush I use. It works really well and is very sturdy. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Was quite excited about this hair brush. A few weeks later and now most assuredly a few months later, doubts began to creep in (and have come to permanently settle). 1. Hairbrush is hard to clean, seems perpetually dusty even after cleaning, wet dust is perpetually unappealing and where does it come from if I just washed it?, making me loath to put it near my hair. 2. Wood around brush part is chipping off. Not sure why, suspect it may be due to perpetual washing NOT so much from being dipped in water BUT from being handled near water. By chipping off I mean it started off small but now seemingly larger and larger slivers are coming off and is apparent when looking at brush. 3. By this time I have purchased another brush of a different brand and have left this to relinquish inside my closet where I come across it and loathe it.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hair stylist. Best brush I ever had!</li>
            <li> The shorter boar bristles glide through my hair, and the longer nylon reach my scalp without scratching. BETTER than my Sephora All boar bristle oval cushion, and half the price. The wooden handle is smooth and sturdy, this feels like a brush that&#x27;ll last years!</li>
            <li> Arrived with hole where bristles were missing. Bristles also unevenly distributed. The German made version where its stated on the handle, as in picture? Not what I received. The tag says made in Germany but the quality doesnt line up with that, looks like China work to me and like a bad knock off.  I do not like giving bad reviews but in these cases would rather give others a heads up.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush. Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I feel like I am getting a head massage with this brush, which works well for thick hair. However, how do I clean it? Ammonia and water works for plastic brushes - but this has a wood handle and boar bristles. Any thoughts?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of brushes for about 20 years, they are the best.... also, my pets loooove them.</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful on the scalp and glides through the hair  with ease.  A good brush at a very good price.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for many years and finally had to replace it. Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush in hopes that it would be better than my cheap Goody brush that I had been using. The Spornette brush had very sharp plastic bristles that cut into my scalp and the boar bristles tangled and matted down my hair. I tried to use this multiple times to style and just brush my hair but it always ended up a frizzy mess. Wish I could get a refund, but since I can&#x27;t, save your money!</li>
            <li> this is the best hairbrush ever, especially for long heavy hair.  Once you try it, you will want one of your own - so I give them as a special gift.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush for my daughter and was disappointed to find a section of bristles missing...I ordered this because I wanted better quality than Walmart type brushes, all of which also seem to have bristles missing.  I requested a replacement from Amazon and that brush also had bristles missing in the exact same place.  I suspect every brush has this problem.  Maybe I&#x27;m a perfectionist but I think it&#x27;s absurd that a brush is deemed acceptable to be sold to customers this way.  I will be purchasing something else.</li>
            <li> Best value in a hairbrush in years. Porcupine-style quills detangle without yanking and massage scalp. Nice feel to wooden handle. This is my handbag brush, but I&#x27;ll eventually replace my home brush with this or another from the same brand.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended that I buy a good massage brush. This is an excellent brush. My two teenage daughters enjoy using it. This is unlike any other brush that you find at the store. I love it!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a boar hair brush as I have recently joined the \\&quot;no poo\\&quot; regimen. I really wanted to like this brush. And I did, but the lacquer on the wood started chipping the day I got it. I can&#x27;t believe this was made in Germany, it seems more along the lines of China. I suppose it might be worth my while to purchase a Mason Pearson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Update**** I bought an Ambassador Hairbrush and love it! It is what I was looking for when I ordered this brush [[ASIN:B000OLCM4W Ambassador Hairbrush, Oval, Oak Handle, 1 Hairbrush]]</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  My grandson has a fit when his hair is tangled and you try to brush it.  This brush justs glides through it.</li>
            <li> The tips of the bristles are brutal on your scalp.  Other than that - it does a good job and makes my daughter&#x27;s hair super soft.</li>
            <li> This is the only brush that I use on my daughter&#x27;s waist-length, straight hair.  It makes it shine without being staticy, and it has little nylon bristles that grab the hair and hold it while brushing, so you aren&#x27;t just skimming over the surface.  She has a mini brush from Spornette that she brings to school and she loves that also.  The handle is strong and the brush has held up well, we have had it for over a year I believe.</li>
            <li> The hairbrush I received is very nice, except that it is missing 1 hole of bristles in the middle of the brush, typical of a brush that has been used or is defected. A little disappointed but not worth the hassle of shipping back and waiting for a new one.</li>
            <li> I am overall happy with this brush. It does feel like a good scalp massage despite my thick hair and it is very smooth. I gives me an absurd volume though, which is fine for most people, except I have a lot of volume already. For people with thinner hair, this brush must be magical. For me it creates funky air spaces within my hair that add strange waves and mounds when I flip my hair to the side. They go away quickly, especially if I brush my fingers through. A very amusing experience, I assure you. So this is not so much a criticism as an observation and caution to other thick-haired people out there looking for a good brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend buying this if you&#x27;re looking for a full-size hairbrush. I&#x27;m so disappointed and wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it.</li>
            <li> When I first receive it, the texture and over all look is worse than I paid for. In a week the needles started to fall off. And it is almost impossible to clean this brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush based on the great reviews and good price. I&#x27;ve been decreasing the frequency of shampooing and wanted a brush that would distribute the oils throughout my thick, long hair. The function of the brush was fine at first, though the shiny glaze finish on the wood started chipping almost immediately. I also noticed a rubbery smell from the cushion that never quite faded away completely. The big deal-breaker for me was when, after a couple weeks, the bristle clumps began retracting into the cushion. It&#x27;s clear that the bristles were not properly anchored. I don&#x27;t brush hard because I find boar hair brushes to work better with gentle gliding motions anyway, but the whole idea of the cushion with nylon bristles is to help massage the scalp. If the bristles sink into the cushion, there&#x27;s no way you can apply any pressure at all! Whenever I tried to gently pull the bristles back out to their original length, the whole bristle clump would pull out of the brush completely. I don&#x27;t have the original packaging anymore and can&#x27;t check where the brush was actually made, but, judging from the quality of the brush I received, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if manufacturing has moved to a cheaper source! Totally disappointed and just ordered the \\&quot;Ambassador Hairbrush, Oval, Oak Handle\\&quot; as suggested by PizzyIzzy, another reviewer who was disappointed with the Spornette&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li> I always love thee brushes. At about 5 years the bristles begin to fall out. But i do not know of any boars bristle brushes that do not begin to break down after 5 years.</li>
            <li> I like the way this brush rubs and exfoliates your scalp while also smoothing your hair down.  I use it daily and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this brush. She always complains about brushes hurting her but not anymore. This did the trick, works very well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a &#x27;cheaper&#x27; but still good quality Mason Pearson type brush and this brush is certainly it! My hair is shoulder-length, dyed blonde (ie. damaged), naturally straight with annoying cowlicks and waves, and is quite thick and this brush made it through to the scalp and smoothed everything into a wonderful waterfall without making me look like I was wearing a helmet.&lt;br /&gt;It really transfers any oils you have on the shaft down to the ends too - which is the main reason I wanted something with boar bristle.&lt;br /&gt;It sits comfortably in your hand, it&#x27;s the perfect size... and really, I can&#x27;t stop raving about it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, IT&#x27;S REASONABLY PRICED (I kind of want to buy one for everyone I know)</li>
            <li> Great brush, I&#x27;ve noticed that a few of the bristles have already fallen out though</li>
            <li> Great Service and quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with the size, the brush and the good grip handle.  When I washed it for the first time, a bristle fell out.  I thought, okay, it may have just been a loose one.  There is also a hole where they missed putting in bristles. Then when I washed it the second time, a nylon bristle and a boar bristle fell out.  I notice that the boar bristle was short on one side and so was the nylon one (they&#x27;re supposed to hook under the base and not come out.  I use the large end of a comb to get out the lint that accumulates from my flannel sheets and this shouldn&#x27;t hurt it.  I was looking for my old brush I had for over 20 years, an Ambassador but, unfortunately, they don&#x27;t seem to be around.  I looked and called everywhere.  I was so happy to find this brush because it is the same size.  So hopefully no more bristles will fall out.  I&#x27;ll keep ya posted.  Update 1/25/16 - a year later there is one row where the nylon bristles with the little balls on top have fallen out.  4/4/15 Update:  I&#x27;ve washed it 4 times now and no more bristles have fallen out.  It&#x27;s a nice sturdy brush.  I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> I may have misread the description, but thought this was a boar bristle brush.  It&#x27;s only partial boar bristle. The rest are plastic or nylon, which do your hair no favors..</li>
            <li> only brush I use for years and years, hard to find except for here!</li>
            <li> The brush is very comfortable in my hand and it feels nice to brush my hair with this particular brush.</li>
            <li> Have purchased 6 of these as gifts and everyone loves them!</li>
            <li> I came back to buy 3 more for family members as gifts, I like this brush so much. The bristles are just right for thick hair too, and give the scalp a nice massage.  Its easy to want to brush more often with this, seems to help my hair shine too.</li>
            <li> Have three daughters, this is THE best brush a mother could own. We would never use another type of brush.</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful brush. Great value! and I love using this everyday and plan to give as gifts for the ladies in my life. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It seems kind of silly to gush about a hairbrush but this is truly the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I&#x27;ve bought similar brushes in the past that were boar bristle with the nylon bristles but the beads always came off.  That doesn&#x27;t happen with this brush because the nylon bristles are all one piece.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Spornette for years, and now have given all three of my daughters the same brush.  I feel it is the best hair brush out there...</li>
            <li> Has a great feel to the handle.  The bristles are smooth and flow nicely.  When you first use it, a few hairs and bristles will fall out, but once they do the rest will stay for a long time.</li>
            <li> Corny title aside, I love this brush. It gives a good scalp massage, helps me get away with a day in between showering and is the perfect size. Not too small, but also not so big I can&#x27;t throw it in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a four or five star review, but it came missing one bristle--sad to see an empty hole, but other than that it&#x27;s perfect and exactly what I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> I really like using this brush on my hair. I used to have another brush that this one not only replaced, but made my old one and all others seem like garbage to me!</li>
            <li> I love that it has both the boar bristles and the thick plastic bristles to balance untangling and gently smoothing out your hair. is marvelous. I did miss one bristle like others have said but it really doesn&#x27;t bother me. my old boar&#x27;s hair brush got rather dirty so I&#x27;m making sure to clean this one rather regularly - you should keep that in mind. just the right size and shape - fits my hand perfectly.</li>
            <li> this is a great brush!  my curly/coily hair really responds well to this brush.  i reserved my review until i attempted a blow dry, and the brush held up better than i could have imagined!  don&#x27;t spend $100+, get this one instead!  i&#x27;d like to also note that a previous reviewer mentioned a hole in the brush inferring that a bristle was missing.  in my experience with these types of brushes, the hole is there to allow air to move inside and out of the brush for comfort and pressure purposes; i.e. most brushes have a form of this hole built into the brush.  worth every penny; my two year old with curly hair actually lets me brush his hair now!  thanks for the product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a couple of months now, and while it isn&#x27;t anything magical, it certainly does exactly what I wanted it to. In some ways it seems a little pricey for a hair brush, and I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;ve used cheaper hair brushes in the past and been happy with them, then there isn&#x27;t really any reason to buy this one. If you&#x27;re looking at more expensive brushes of the same type as this one on the other hand, I&#x27;d say this brush is a good intro point to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Synopsis: It&#x27;s a brush, not magical or amazing, but it keeps my hair looking healthier than the cheaper brushes I&#x27;ve had before this, and work to my satisfaction for my thick moderately curly hair.</li>
            <li> Brush is okay but one set of bristles were missing right out of the package and a set of bristles were bent out of shape.</li>
            <li> loved this brush so much I had to buy a second to keep at work. it does a great job smoothing out my hair by just brushing, and it also does a pretty good job straightening while blow drying.</li>
            <li> I had hair down to the middle of my back.  I have routinely broken the handles on many plastic hair brushes.  I had some similar to thi by Fuller brush -- made in France -- but they don&#x27;t carry them anymore.  I was so very pleased to find these -- and purchased two.  I LOVE them,</li>
            <li> This is the second brush I bought and it is fantastic!  great for my very short hair cut.  My husband also loves it.</li>
            <li> I was so hesitant of which bore brush to buy, to replace the 100% one I&#x27;ve had for a few years. I love the bristles, but was wanting a brush that actually brushed my hair, rather than just smoothing it. I looked and looked, read so many reviews, and found the Spornette brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being made in Germany, actually a big deal to me.  I&#x27;ve bought a few other items made in Germany, and they were of the highest quality. The dish brush, made with natural hairs, is still working perfectly, over a year later. Previously I was buying a new Oxo brush every 2 months. So, because that was so positive, I decided there&#x27;s something special about brushes, of any variety, made in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say it&#x27;s holding true thus far. I did just get this, so this review isn&#x27;t about the longevity. (Although I do see myself coming back and writing an update at that time.). This is about the initial awesomeness at quality and just how awesome it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love this brush first use. My hair is just past my shoulders and still growing, medium thickness of fine hair. (I always say I have lots of fine hair to a new hairdresser. They see it, and then agree). So, finding the perfect brush, it&#x27;s taken a while. I&#x27;ve found it. I&#x27;m so happy. I love a good brushing. From the scalp stimulation to the hair being conditioned. (My hair health is my desire for bore bristle) but the 100% bore, won&#x27;t reach my scalp very well. It takes a lot of effort to get it there, and then it&#x27;s disappointing. This brush does it all. It reaches my scalp, with good contact, but very comfortable with the cushioned rubber base. The bore bristles help grab the hair, doing, what I&#x27;m going for, of distributing natural oils down the shaft.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried the nibs on the end of the nylon would be combersome. But they aren&#x27;t, in any way, like what I had hoped they wouldn&#x27;t be. Big, white, plastic ends. Nope, nothing like that. Instead, it&#x27;s just the ends are blunted. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d really like this or the (unblunted) regular ends of the nylon bristles. I have a fairly tough scalp. But after I found another reputable brand of this type of brush in a store recently, it was harsh. Actually scratchy like another reviewer had said.  Now that I&#x27;ve got this one, I&#x27;m so happy. It&#x27;s the right kind of &#x27;scratchy&#x27; on my scalp, stimulating, not outchy, and the wood feels good in my hand. Very easy to manage. Good size, just right. Love it! Will buy another if anything ever happens to this one.&lt;br /&gt;As I did see it mentioned in another review, and then see others comment on it: there is a hole, of no bristles, in the rubber base. This is to allow air from depression of the rubber to escape, intake etc...  I&#x27;ve been familiar with this since, well forever. I&#x27;m guessing not everyone so much so. So, here you go. No missing brsitles. Just an air hole, as it were. :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this brush, you and your hair will thank, well, all the positive reviews on here, and Spornette of course!</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected with not enough boar bristles.</li>
            <li> Just love this brush. Last one lasted 10 years. The cushion behind the bristles makes if softer on the scalp.</li>
            <li> A perfect hairbrush.  My daughter has long, fine hair, and a sensitive head, and this brush works great with tangles.  My niece has short, curly, thick hair, and she loves it too!</li>
            <li> This brush really does feel great. It helps distribute oil through my hair and might add to shine a little bit, though there isn&#x27;t a huge difference in the appearance of my hair. Not good for de-tangling. For the record I have waist length fine hair. I thought it was certainly worth the price.</li>
            <li> This looks like a great brush.  I have an all boar-bristle brush that I got in Japan, and it can&#x27;t penetrate my very fine, very thick hair.  This one, with its plastic bristles, does a better job, but I still feel like it sort of packs down my hair, so that it&#x27;s not fluffy, but almost matted to my head.  Also, it seems to make a lot of static, especially at first - ?  Not sure why that is, since other reviews said it eliminated static for them.  All that said, after I brush for awhile, including upside-down, trying to get the brush to penetrate all my hair, when I&#x27;ve finger-fluffed it again, THEN it&#x27;s pretty nice.  I&#x27;ll keep using it, see how it goes.  I wish they made one that was rectangular and slightly rounded with no cushion - that would be the ideal shape for my hair.....</li>
            <li> I think we have a perfect storm of hair trouble;  my 9yo daughter is on swim team (and despite my urging, never brushes her hair out when she finishes with practice!  aarrggghhh).  Nearly daily practices leave her hair dry, frizzy and tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, her hair is already very thick/dense, and curly.  Getting her brushed out in the morning before school used to be a real chore that, I&#x27;m ashamed to admit, I had begun skipping more and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ENTER: this brush!  Awesomeness.  I can hardly believe how much easier it is.  Significantly better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, which includes those &amp;#34;knot genie&amp;#34; brushes (the palm-held ones, without a handle).  I guess it&#x27;s the combo of the longer nylon bristles with the shorter boar&#x27;s hair, I donno.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose I could complain that the brush isn&#x27;t very heavy, meaning it&#x27;s not made from some exotic hardwood - and it may or may not be actual boar&#x27;s hair - but I really couldn&#x27;t care less about any of those bragging points.  All I know is is makes brushing out my daughter&#x27;s hair MAGNITUDES easier in the morning.  And that&#x27;s why I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(And, of couse, it works famously on my other daughter&#x27;s hair too - but she&#x27;s pretty much the opposite; no swim team, straight hair, with normal thickness.  This brush goes through her mane like a hot knife through butter.  I don&#x27;t even hear a single complaint from her any more... and she even stands still when she sees me coming with the brush!)</li>
            <li> Favorite brush for 20 yrs.  last forever if you don&#x27;t loose them. I have nothing more to say. Thank you</li>
            <li> This brush is the perfect texture for tearing through your brushing without tearing your hair! It will take out your tangles without your needing to even think about them while you brush with one hand and will not pull on your scalp (mine&#x27;s super sensitive). It will leave the hair glossy, smooth, and full of body. It also looks nice and feels wonderful in the hand. Much superior to the Bass hair brushes.</li>
            <li> I was pricing Mason Pearson boar bristle hairbrushes when I stumbled upon Spornette. The Spornette Porcupine Oval Cushion Brush is a German made piece that is built to last a lifetime at a fraction of the price of a Mason Pearson.</li>
            <li> This brush works as well as the more expensive boars hair brushes and is the second one I have purchased.  Easily brushes out tangles even for wet hair</li>
            <li> I like the feel of wood instead of plastic.  I use this hairbrush everywhere I go and even pack it for the gym.  I find that the combination of bristles works well with wet or dry hair.  I&#x27;ve had this brush for a couple months and it seems to be holding up just fine.</li>
            <li> This brush when you take it out of the packet looks and smells cheap. It looks like something to brush a dolls hair with, I sent it straight back</li>
            <li> I have theses brushes for my kids, whose hair ranges from fine to thick.  Works well on all of them.  I bought extras for when they misplace them because nothing else works on their hair quite as well, from simple brushing to doing ponytails.  The handle is comfortable to hold.  You can also pull out the hair easily to clean it when loose hair gets tangled around it.</li>
            <li> Love this hairbrush! The boar bristles are gentle and the porcupine bristles go through my hair but are not scratchy on my scalp. Highly recommend this brush. Seller packaged it well and shipped promptly. Great transaction all around!</li>
            <li> I had a brush that had both kinds of bristles, and liked it a lot so got this one to replace it. I have only had it about a month, so cannot comment on how durable it is or if the bristles will fall out, but so far it seems very well constructed. My hair is short so tangles aren&#x27;t much of an issue, but it&#x27;s pretty coarse, and the brush does a good job at getting it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit rough, so if you have a sensitive scalp that may be a concern, but I personally like it.</li>
            <li> My sister loves these brushes!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my mom and she just loves it!  She would definately recommend this product to a friend</li>
            <li> I have very fine/thin fragile hair. This brush makes my hair look and feel so much fuller. I even had a stranger comment on my &amp;#34;beautiful thick hair.&amp;#34; The brush also spreads the oil from the roots and evenly distributes it through the hair allowing me to go two extra days without having to wash my hair. It sounds silly, but this brush has been life changing.</li>
            <li> Generally I hate Bristle Brushes. They make my hair have static, don&#x27;t brush all the way through and I always seem to have problems with the handles popping off or the bristles breaking out of the back piece. This one is not like that. I think with the addition of the prongs in the bristles, it makes it so much easier to use and clean! The handle is all one piece and sturdy so that was nice. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got this brush basically trying to find a cheaper version than the way too expensive for me Mason Pearson brush.  This brush does not disappoint.  I have fine, shoulder length hair and I have had no issues whatsoever.  It feels like a mini scalp massage every time I use it.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any bristles falling off and the handle and (lacquer) paint have held up nicely.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for many years and really like it.  I was no longer able to find it at my local beauty supply store and was glad to find it on the internet.  Like the boar bristles.  These type of brushes are hard to find and some are very expensive.  This one was very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> October 2013: The \\&quot;extra gentle\\&quot; boar-bristle-with-nylon air-pillow brush is holding up (this is the one with the plastic handle in stead of the wood), that is, the bristles aren&#x27;t sinking in.  (I can&#x27;t comment on the life span of the replacement wooden one they sent, since I haven&#x27;t been using it.)  The plastic handled one still tears my greying hair if I&#x27;m not careful, but not as much.  Overall, it was a bit of a hassle, but I did appreciate how the company handled the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 2013: Contacted the company, with my receipt and pictures, requesting my money back.  They did not refund me, but they did respond promptly, saying they had never been contacted about this problem before, and offered to send me a replacement brush for free.  In the end they sent me an extra free brush as well--slightly different style (plastic base instead of wooden)--maybe they thought it would be more appropriate for my hair type and not tear as much? It was listed as \\&quot;extra gentle\\&quot;.  We&#x27;ll see how it holds up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 2013:  The brush is now completely flat, with the central rings of bristles being super short or missing altogether (I got tired of constantly trying to pull them back up).  Consequently the brush catches and tears my hair instead of detangling it--I now, unintentionally, have bangs, which I didn&#x27;t want.  If I can figure out how to upload pictures, I will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9-18-12 (original review date, but I accidentally put the review on their mini-brush I also bought, instead of here): On the plus side, I love how this brush feels on my head.  It&#x27;s one of few brushes that successfully gets through my wavey, tangle-prone hair.  And it does so without creating static. (It does pull the wave out though--&#x27;wish it didn&#x27;t.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the down side, it&#x27;s a little larger than my last brush--unnecessarily so, and to me a little too heavy.  The bigger issue though is that apparently there is nothing holding the bristles in place, so their much touted \\&quot;pneumatic\\&quot; feature (air \\&quot;pillow\\&quot; under the pink bristle pad) is just a hole that the bristles slowly sink into.  If I work at it, I can grab a hold of individual tufts and pull them back up, but of course they don&#x27;t all come up evenly, and some of the individual bristles get accidentally pulled out, so doing that regularly--apart from the fact that I shouldn&#x27;t have to--will significantly shorten the life-span of the brush.  We&#x27;ll see how long this brush actually stays functional.  I&#x27;ve only had it a few months at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there&#x27;s an empty bristle tuft hole in each brush.  I worry that when I wash my brush (which I do every time I wash my hair) there is water getting in there which won&#x27;t dry easily, and will eventually either rot out the brush or create a mold problem. Just speculation, but of concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I think I&#x27;ll pay a bit more and get the other brand. I had one of those for years before it started breaking down.</li>
            <li> I have 2&#x27; of super thick hair that tangles if I&#x27;m breathing, but this brush does a fantastic job of keeping my strands sorted without pulling. It feels fantastic and doesn&#x27;t seem to pull or get caught as easily as other brushes I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ll even admit to being able to use it when my hair was wet (just to see how it performed). I wash my hair twice a week and I&#x27;ve even noticed an improvement of condition between washes. Very pleasantly surprised that such an inexpensive brush works so well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude with short hair so the long plastic bristles hit my scalp.The longer, plastic bristles seem to have been cut off bluntly leaving the ends a little sharp. I have learned to not apply too much pressure when brushing my hair with this thing but it would have been nice if there was little plastic balls at the end of the longer bristles like some other combs that are similar to this one.</li>
            <li> A few of the bristles were missing from the brush...not the German quality you would think. Don&#x27;t think I would buy Spornette again.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a brush for so long and this was perfect. it has boar bristles and nylon bristles to help better penetrate your hair. You will not regret buying this</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and such a great product.  High quality and makes my hair so soft, smooth and shiny!  I would recommend anyone considering buying a boar bristle/natural hair brush to purchase this one.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush, a nice mix of nylon and bristle and the handle is of nice quality. HOWEVER, there was a huge and unsightly bar code sticker directly on the back of the brush, which took ages to remove without damaging the varnish on the wood. Also would have made it impossible to gift. A ridiculous way to package it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. Very good product.</li>
