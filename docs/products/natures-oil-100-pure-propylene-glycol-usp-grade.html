            <li>Excellent price, excellent shipping cost for such a heavy liquid.  </li>
            <li>Loving it, great quality and work better than expected....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d just started making my own e juice, and these came very fast.</li>
            <li>I have already recommended this specific product to my friends interested in e-juice production and they are very happy with it as well.</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>great if you mix it with powder poison and put it into the cracks of your wooden slates for terminates,, takes a couple of times but get the job done</li>
            <li>So you know you won&#x27;t end up with a super strong batch.</li>
            <li>If you vape and are looking to make your own e-liquid to save some money I highly recommend this PG.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li>Propylene glycol is a useful addition to his protocol.</li>
            <li>I own a PAX herbal vaporizer that needs regular lubrication.</li>
            <li>It was great and exactly what I expected it&#x27;s much bigger than what is represented in the picture, and that was a huge plus.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I was needing.</li>
            <li>A 16oz bottle of clear viscous sweet smelling goop</li>
            <li>NATURE&#x27;S OIL, THEY SENT OUT FAST,</li>
            <li>and you go through them relatively fast.</li>
            <li>Always crystal clear and 100% pure.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered a few more no regrets whatsoever as the first bottle has just run out.</li>
            <li>I tried diy for the first time with this and haven&#x27;t turned back</li>
            <li>This seems to be functioning exactly the same</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more when my supply runs low here in the near future.</li>
            <li>I have a near lifetime supply.</li>
            <li>Normally I&#x27;d apply directly to the metal, but I find this method better for multiple uses, is easier to spread evenly and less of a mess.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Both products were broken when recieved</li>
            <li> Great stuff for ecigs . I tried diy for the first time with this and haven&#x27;t turned back</li>
            <li> If you vape and are looking to make your own e-liquid to save some money I highly recommend this PG. I have already recommended this specific product to my friends interested in e-juice production and they are very happy with it as well. There&#x27;s not very much you can say about a bottle of PG so I&#x27;ll just talk on the purpose for which I bought this and give you a few price points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 15ml bottle of e liquid is around 7-$15 depending on the vendor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think of it this way, a 50/50 blend with this bottle of PG and an equally sized bottle of VG will make about 31 30ml bottles of e-liquid for about the price of one 30ml premade juice. Buy either some concentrated nicotine or unflavored 24mg /ml nic and cut it down to the strength you want, plus a 30ml bottle of flavoring and you&#x27;ve got yourself about 1000ml of juice for less than what you&#x27;d spend on juice for a month. Plus then you know where it came from, who made it, and don&#x27;t have to worry if some guy made it in his dusty basement with mold in the air and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it, a lot of us started vaping to quit smoking, and along with quitting we wanted to save that money! If you make your own juice you save even more money which means more of a vape budget for a nice RDA, mod or something &#x3D;p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I do warn you, if you&#x27;re not very good at measuring and calculating things this may not be for you. There are various websites and apps to calculate your mixture of nicotine base to PG and VG for desired strength, and really it&#x27;s not very hard if you can do basic math but if you&#x27;re not comfortable doing it I would suggest just buying 24mg unflavored nic. So you know you won&#x27;t end up with a super strong batch.</li>
            <li> Bought this along with menthol crystals in order to brew my own menthol drops to avoid purchasing Halo Sub-Zero. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I dilute this product 50:50 and spray it on my dog&#x27;s coat between his oil baths to maintain the moisture in his coat. He has sebaceous adenitis so his coat requires external (and internal) moisturizing supplementation.  Propylene glycol is a useful addition to his protocol.</li>
            <li> Loving it, great quality and work better than expected....</li>
            <li> It was great and exactly what I expected it&#x27;s much bigger than what is represented in the picture, and that was a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Excellent price, excellent shipping cost for such a heavy liquid.  This is the only PG I use, and it&#x27;s excellent.</li>
            <li> Great Shipping response time and the product came well packed, in tact, and as promised.&lt;br /&gt;Would recomend this to all my DIY friends for thier E-Juice needs.</li>
            <li> I use this to create my own ejuice for electronic cigarettes and it is a great quality product.  Always crystal clear and 100% pure.  Have purchased several bottles of this and each one is perfect.</li>
            <li> Great stuff , looks exactly like picture</li>
            <li> Works fine.  Good value.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! At a good fair price! Mixs well with no taste and great for thinning out your thicker e-liquids or to mix up you own personal mixes!</li>
            <li> Perfect for food grade uses.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product.  It is versatile and suits my needs perfectly.  The bottle was very securely sealed.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Pleased. I&#x27;m not a propgly connoisseur, so don&#x27;t know what else to say, other than there bottles ARE indeed plastic. They DO look like glass, gotta say. I&#x27;d just started making my own e juice, and these came very fast.</li>
            <li> awesome worked perfectly for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> great service no Issues</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I was needing.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great service!</li>
            <li> good product and price</li>
            <li> great if you mix it with powder poison and put it into the cracks of your wooden slates for terminates,, takes a couple of times but get the job done</li>
            <li> Clean,nice bottles. PG is tasteless and clean. Will buy again from seller.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li> Good quality, I use it for mixing e-juice. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Awesome for making vape flavors.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service</li>
            <li> What is it? : A 16oz bottle of clear viscous sweet smelling goop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do with it: I use this as lubricant on the mouthpiece stem of my PAX by Ploom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a taste test of both this product and PAX lubricant, I can see no difference.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have a near lifetime supply. No problems at all to report.&lt;br /&gt;~Pour some in a cup, dilute with a splash of water[sometimes it can be thick], soak with q-tip and apply. Normally I&#x27;d apply directly to the metal, but I find this method better for multiple uses, is easier to spread evenly and less of a mess.</li>
            <li> I WANTED TOO BE MY OWN E-JUICE MAKER. WANTED THE BEST PG OUT THERE. AND THAT IS JUST WHAT I GOT WITH NATURE&#x27;S OIL, THEY SENT OUT FAST,WAS PACKED GOOD, AND BEST OF ALL WAS PRICED VERY GOOD. SO IF YOU WANT TOO SAVE LOADS OF $$$$$$$$$$$$$ BUY FROM THEM. IF YOU WANT TOO GET LESSER PG, SHOP SOMEWHERE OTHER THEN HERE. THANK YOU I WELL BE ORDERING MORE THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Great product at a more than bargain price.  Will definitely buy more when my supply runs low here in the near future.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and value, I order all my vaping needs from this Co.</li>
            <li> Seems great for e-juice!</li>
            <li> I add this to my shampoos and my hair is noticeably softer and shinier!</li>
            <li> this was not what i need but i still want to give a good review it was my own fault i thought this was for something eles but they deliver asap and the products are great</li>
            <li> great item fast shipping</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my Electronic cigarrette DIY needs. Much more affordable than buying from an Ecig vendor. Twice the size for half the price!</li>
            <li> Bought it for the pax. Works perfectly, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need more for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Great for my e-liquid needs. I just ordered a few more no regrets whatsoever as the first bottle has just run out. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I own a PAX herbal vaporizer that needs regular lubrication. The included lubricant is Propylene Glycol but local shops (and online) sell tiny little packets for like $12/5-pack. They must have 1/2oz in each pack and you go through them relatively fast. This seems to be functioning exactly the same and I can&#x27;t imagine running out within the next few years. It&#x27;s great to have the peace of mind to lubricate after every use and not feel like you&#x27;re shelling out too much money just to take care of your PAX.</li>
            <li> Everything as expected</li>
