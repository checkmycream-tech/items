            <li>Wonderful product and a good price :)</li>
            <li>great stuff, make my beard feel, look, and smell great :-)</li>
            <li>I saw this product on Amazon and its label denotes its good for psoriasis.</li>
            <li>Why did they change a good thing?  </li>
            <li>Good stuff here.</li>
            <li>It has a good consistency and lathers rather well.</li>
            <li>product itself is good.</li>
            <li>A good all name in pine tar shampoo â€“ as it should be.</li>
            <li>and it all good</li>
            <li>made it look good and kept it supple and manageable.  </li>
            <li>If you use it you will get complements on your hair and have a wonderful clean feeling.</li>
            <li>The smell is not the greatest, but my husband doesn&#x27;t mind and it evaporates rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Great product for sure.</li>
            <li>Used this product for the first time and was impressed that the fragrance was nice and pleasant.</li>
            <li>The smell is great; very clean and invigorating.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use conditioner and the smell did not bother me, but it may you!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>The smell is something to get used to for sure!</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more soon!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite shampoos!</li>
            <li>Definitely more woodsy/manly but being from minnesota, maybe that&#x27;s just what we like?!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>it smells strong but worked great for her oily skin.</li>
            <li>I actually kind of liked it.</li>
            <li>To each his own.  </li>
            <li>It can give you kind of a burnt rubber smell.</li>
            <li>it was perfect, great shampoo for a fraction of what local stores would have charged me</li>
            <li>It is best used with a conditioner to keep the hair soft and looking good.</li>
            <li>lmao</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used just about every psoriasis shampoo out there, and Grandpa&#x27;s is absolutely the best.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to all my friends, and people I meet at my dermatologist that have any kind of skin issues like I do.</li>
            <li>While it does have a very strong scent out of the bottle, I honestly like the rugged pine aroma that it leaves.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a stronger pine smell, but maybe it&#x27;s a good thing that the smell isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>Along with the Pine Tar products, we also really love the Orange Essence Bar; that really smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong.</li>
            <li>Does smell very strongly of pine tar, but it fades as the hair dries.  </li>
            <li>It is, by far, the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used to control my psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>i suggest adding a dropperfull of tea tree oil (mason vitamins) along with a nice heaping teaspoon or more of castor oil.</li>
            <li>I am now a &amp;#34;Grandpa&amp;#34; myself, but I can certainly recommend this to people of any age who want a great shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My husband says it&#x27;s the cleanest his hair has ever felt, and fell in love with it after trying it on a trip to Finland.</li>
            <li>I love the pine tar aroma</li>
            <li>I love their bar soap but for earth smell shampoo...not even close to CVS coal tar shampoo...</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Ive tried this product and many others-</li>
            <li>I have tried most of the dandruff shampoos on the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>that it helped \\&quot;control\\&quot; my psoriasis and reduce plaques, but it never made my scalp healthy and its fragrance was nothing to brag about either.  </li>
            <li>With the T formula I was using, even while drying my hair, I&#x27;d have to top and scratch.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s probably more from habit than anything else.</li>
            <li>I have been using the soap and this shampoo for more than 30 years and they continue to do the job unlike everything else recommended to me.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my scalp healthy that otherwise has a tendency to itch, etc.</li>
            <li>My hair is softer and more shiny now too.  </li>
            <li>I do wish it was better smelling but</li>
            <li>Will be buying more Grandpa&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>but it smells better.</li>
            <li>He is able to tolerate the Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar soap, shampoo, and conditioner</li>
            <li>I will buy him more when he runs out.</li>
            <li>So, I decided to check Amazon for a better price than the stores had.  </li>
            <li>I was quite pleased.</li>
            <li>Plus I love the scent.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li>Love the smell too.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Works better than the prescription stuff the doctor ordered.  </li>
            <li>within 24 hours the itching got better.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a seal on top of the bottle to protect leaking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells better than Heritage Products Tannenbaum Pine Tar Shampoo, and is a bit thicker in consistency.  </li>
            <li>The cooling sensation, is one of the things I like the most, kinda</li>
            <li>It has a &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; scent that is actually refreshing</li>
            <li>I love the smell of both.</li>
            <li>This is just a guess, but I doubt many women would like either one.  </li>
            <li>Some people may not care for the smell, but I love it.</li>
            <li>but i deff will be buying more along with the conditioner...</li>
            <li>and as i said, will deff be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It smells like pine trees (sounds good right?)  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Good product and price, fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I used to use Grandpa&#x27;s Bar Soap to clean my big beard, and it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, there is not a flake in sight.</li>
            <li>I notice that I can wait 2-3 additional days before shampooing vs using more commonly available shampoos.  </li>
            <li>So far so great</li>
            <li>The bar soap helped, but it had a strong, funky smell.  </li>
            <li>It does have a funky smell, and my wife is not fond of it, but I don&#x27;t think the smell is as strong as Grandpa&#x27;s bar soap.  </li>
            <li>smells too strong but it heals my hair</li>
            <li>Very strong and distinct.</li>
            <li>Quick service, love the shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean, smells clean!</li>
            <li>Fantastic for dandruff sufferers</li>
            <li>The shampoo is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I feel fortunate to have found Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Shampoo and Grandpa&#x27;s conditioner.  </li>
            <li>so I said, \\&quot;I think it is my hair\\&quot; and she confirmed that.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>It conditions my hair and leaves my scalp free from the itch.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t handle the way it smells for my personal use, but works great for the dog.</li>
            <li>I only ever use this when I have some scalp irritation, but it&#x27;s great for what it&#x27;s made to do.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>but if it is as good as shampoo WOW.................</li>
            <li>Bought it and it is NOT the original formula.</li>
            <li>I use the bar version of Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap in the shower and I love the stuff, but it always feels funny in my hands when I wash my hair with it, so I bought this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this and the old, original bar soap that I&#x27;ve been using for many years.  </li>
            <li>Listen, this will make your head feel really clean from build up.</li>
            <li>Leaves you clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sticking with the MG 217 coal tar shampoo, which, in my opinion, smells far better and soothes the scalp itch and flakiness better too.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing, I saw many reviewers talking positively about the scent.</li>
            <li>Very good shampoo just a little thinner than I like.</li>
            <li>I have to say though that I have seborrhoeic dermatitis and this stuff took it right off!  </li>
            <li>Its aroma is powerful when in use, but fades appropriately after drying, and is exactly what you&#x27;re looking for if you want a truly woodsy smell in your hair or beard.</li>
            <li>great stuff; the FDA might not allow labeling the purpose for pine tar because it hasn&#x27;t proven in trial to be effective for enough people, but it definitely works for me; will buy again and again.</li>
            <li>I would describe it as a moldy burnt old personâ€™s house if I&#x27;m being kind.</li>
            <li>This is a deal breaker if you have any kind of professional job where you must interact with clients or customers.</li>
            <li>well.&lt;br /&gt;I will warn that it has a wired smell that some may not be able to get pass, but once he is out of the shower I really can&#x27;t smell it on him.  </li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t say at the top weather it is the \\&quot;original\\&quot; or the \\&quot;New Advanced</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for me, and I would highly recommend it to other people.</li>
            <li>For dry scalp or dandruff, this is THE best natural shampoo for you.  </li>
            <li>Use it every other day and it works great for my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>a great help!!I used other products</li>
            <li>But they work, leave you feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>It fades quickly from the hair though.</li>
            <li>Both are mild.  </li>
            <li>My husband has mild psoriasis on his scalp which is exacerbated by stress.</li>
            <li>Maybe someone with mild dandruff would benefit.</li>
            <li>Yes, it has a scent of pine, which I find invigorating, but which dissipates quickly after I leave the shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After first use, i noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a very powerful cleanser, even when using a small amount, great care must be used to effect a full rinse out of the product.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this to help with my psoriasis and it really works!!</li>
            <li>I use this Pine Tar Shampoo and it really controls this problem!!  </li>
            <li>You will find the effort well worth the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipment</li>
            <li>Well worth the price as well.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>and freshly paved tar pavement.</li>
            <li>Yes, there is a distinct aroma that is not all flowers.  </li>
            <li>As far as effectiveness, I am a bit itchier and flakier than I would have been had I used Tannenbaum&#x27;s, but I found my hair softer and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>Your mileage may vary in your particular instance, but as for me, I cannot say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>Plus with this Texas heat right now, sweat could be aggravating the psoraisis.</li>
            <li>He says its worth both quirks knowing its helping him avoid the pain he&#x27;s experienced in the past.</li>
            <li>It lathers really well and makes my hair feel really clean.</li>
            <li>Your hair and scalp really feel clean when you use this.  </li>
            <li>I would like it a lot more if it smelled more like a pine tree and less like tar.</li>
            <li>A very good product that make hair workable and soft without harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>was very fast, without any glitch.</li>
            <li>Pine tar has proven better for my hair, just as effective as coal tar, and pine tar is far less toxic.</li>
            <li>I have to say that with the first application it worked fantastically.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a city girl, and I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time in the woods, but the time I have spent in the woods I can honestly say that they did not smell like this horrendous shampoo.  </li>
            <li>a pretty stubborn problem of plaque psoriasis.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works consistently.</li>
            <li>It is the first shampoo to get his dandruff under control.  </li>
            <li>We have tried several products from Grandpa&#x27;s and love them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has done all of that and actually keeps my psoriasis in better control than even maximum strength formulas of coal tar were.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a healthy, cruelty-free alternative from traditional itchy scalp shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different products.  </li>
            <li>2nd use, even more...</li>
            <li>My husband and I both get flakes from time to time, this product gets rid of it fast!  </li>
            <li>I like better than selsun blue and head and shoulders.  </li>
            <li>We used both alternating since they have different ingredients and seen way better results with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Gave a good lather with very little product.</li>
            <li>and my symptoms are pretty much gone.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great, the fragrance I wish was a little less strong though.</li>
            <li>Dry scalp is better but not cured</li>
            <li>They all felt great on my head, but after getting out of the shower and after my hair is dry i could swipe my hand through my hair and flakes would fly- not thick heavy flakes, but just what would seem like a nonstop stream of little flakes if i kept swiping all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My ex certainly didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Formula\\&quot; like they used to do, rest assured it is the \\&quot;New Advanced Formula\\&quot; version; doesn&#x27;t smell of pine/smoke like the original, but has a chemical smell and is very oily exactly the same as the new formula.</li>
            <li>Just tried it - like it, more gentle than the soap on hair, but it does dry my hair - need to get conditioner too.</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo after reading other positive reviews and it has worked better than I could imagine.</li>
            <li>A few drop produce tons of amazing suds.  </li>
            <li>Myself, I really like it.</li>
            <li>Really like the product</li>
            <li>This shampoo was recommended to me by a sales clerk at Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo really helped my dog&#x27;s coat.</li>
            <li>I found this product to be very concentrated.</li>
            <li>Ive had skin problems on my face and head my whole life.</li>
            <li>none of them really worked.</li>
            <li>Now and then, not overly much, I had a need to scratch</li>
            <li>but this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I really really really like the smell of both the Pine Tar Shampoo and the Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>partner also really loves the fragrance of my hair after using these products.</li>
            <li>I have, er, had a very itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li>I am very please with it&#x27;s results.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It really cleans you and it makes you just smell like a man.</li>
            <li>but this goes together really well.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes the Pine Tar products.  </li>
            <li>Used to use coal tar products, but the condition of my hair suffered greatly and I ran across some literature (can&#x27;t remember where sadly) indicating that coal tar is more of a toxin than I would like to apply to my skin on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>It worked really well on my hair:  </li>
            <li>A few drops work into a nice lather for your whole body.  </li>
            <li>To remedy this, is simply picked out a nice tea tree, lavender and blue cypress conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is, but my hair just feels extra clean when I use this stuff.</li>
            <li>Using just a tiny amount of this shampoo and water leaves my skin moist and clean.  </li>
            <li>My daughter, who&#x27;s pretty sensitive to smells said yum you smell like bacon or beef jerky.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always suffered from a huge dry scalp problem.</li>
            <li>Full strength, the scent is kind of weird, but it really works for scalp misbehavior.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Results of use of this product left my hair soft, and manageable, my scalp felt clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>but it does not work, it gives more dandruff and it is a waste of money, i will never get it again</li>
            <li>Helped tremendously with my dry skin and redness.</li>
            <li>I read through some of the other reviews before I bought this product back in May, but I don&#x27;t think there were as many as there are now.  </li>
            <li>I am almost out of this first bottle, so I&#x27;m going to order it again with my next Amazon order and will order two bottles so that I&#x27;ll always have a backup.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure I will love it forever.  </li>
            <li>I loved the smell, but it didn&#x27;t  last long,lathered well, but oddly enough it dried out my hair and scalp</li>
            <li>The strong odor fades once dry for a few hours so worth the benefits.</li>
            <li>Good thing a little goes a long way as the bottles are not all that big for the price.  </li>
            <li>And then a few years ago the brands that I liked to use stopped using coal tar solution as the active ingredient and claimed a \\&quot;new improved formula\\</li>
            <li>The rinsing out will take a considerable time to thoroughly wash the product out, so it will pay to be patient in this process.</li>
            <li>To early to say if it will help my beard druf</li>
            <li>He has sensitive skin so always uses the Pine Tar bar soap in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It may be natural, but it&#x27;s not the cure-all I was hoping it would be.</li>
            <li>It was by accident using the baby shampoo that I realized my skin was sensitive to the surfactants used in mainstream brands.  </li>
            <li>No reaction on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been alternating this with coal tar shampoo since I have a stockpile of it to go through.</li>
            <li>I tried a myriad of natural &amp; holistic methods as well, but they all ceased to have any effect.</li>
            <li>I was further convinced that using a different shampoo formula was part of my problem when I stayed at a hotel and used the complimentary shampoo.  </li>
            <li>found a shampoo at a natural foods retailer that was free of the harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>This is not wonderful for my hair, but good for the flakes.</li>
            <li>It might a little pricey as compared to other available shampoos, but it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>but my skin does get pretty dry after a shower and that includes my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is not slimy like many conditioners, but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>It smells like a campfire, but if you can get past that you will have soft, flake free hair.</li>
            <li>Since I am of the older generation I remember when some dandruff shampoos had this same smell.  </li>
            <li>I do highly recommend this product, but, again, be careful to use it sparingly as it is highly concentrated, and care must be taken to completely rinse it out, to avoid leaving hair feeling oily or greasy.</li>
            <li>I also have the bar soap witch is a pain to use when wash long hair, this is much preferred.</li>
            <li>Where it would normally look like a ski run, there was only black!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They both seem much milder than other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried and leave my hair less dry than most of them.  </li>
            <li>It pays to go back to the old ways!</li>
            <li>Have used the shampoo several times on my hair and it lathers up easily with just a small amount.  </li>
            <li>I have used several different products for the same condition and really like this over the counter option.</li>
            <li>This stuff actually smells like a musty old cabin.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, but no thanks, Grandpa.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is worth the trouble of  returning this $10 item.  </li>
            <li>I have very itchy scalp and dandruff that other non-medicated shampoos were not helping to alleviate.  </li>
            <li>My girlfriend was very hesitant due to the smell, but she loves how it cleans.</li>
            <li>Not a single friend of mine has said anything about the smell and they donâ€™t pull punches about anything.</li>
            <li>This was purchased with the hope I&#x27;d have to use the harsh coal tar formula less often, and while this works comparatively well, it doesn&#x27;t work BETTER or enough to warrant this smell.</li>
            <li>I found the smell refreshing, perhaps this is due to only using a small amount.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know there is no known cure at this time, but I have found this shampoo to be very gentle yet gives me a few hours of relief.  </li>
            <li>Pine tar shampoos work rather well at controlling my eczema in all areas with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Random side note, used African Black Soap shampoo as an alternative with less success, and a bar of African Black Soap worked better, but not nearly as well as the Pine Tar products.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the reasons that baby shampoo is tear free - it has less harsh ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product and it has helped my psoriasis a little.  </li>
            <li>but he finds it drying and unusually smelly when using but not after washing with it - it just lingers in the air a little.</li>
            <li>I have a place on my scalp that produces pretty large flakes over the past few years.  </li>
            <li>He has rosacea and his skin is very sensitive to other skin products for bathing, lotions, etc.  </li>

            <li> It might work great.</li>

            <li> Wonderful product and a good price :)</li>
            <li> great stuff, make my beard feel, look, and smell great :-)</li>
            <li> I saw this product on Amazon and its label denotes its good for psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Why did they change a good thing?  </li>
            <li> Good stuff here.</li>
            <li> It has a good consistency and lathers rather well.</li>
            <li> product itself is good.</li>
            <li> A good all name in pine tar shampoo â€“ as it should be.</li>
            <li> and it all good</li>
            <li> made it look good and kept it supple and manageable.  </li>
            <li> If you use it you will get complements on your hair and have a wonderful clean feeling.</li>
            <li> The smell is not the greatest, but my husband doesn&#x27;t mind and it evaporates rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product for sure.</li>
            <li> Used this product for the first time and was impressed that the fragrance was nice and pleasant.</li>
            <li> The smell is great; very clean and invigorating.</li>
            <li> Make sure to use conditioner and the smell did not bother me, but it may you!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> The smell is something to get used to for sure!</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more soon!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite shampoos!</li>
            <li> Definitely more woodsy/manly but being from minnesota, maybe that&#x27;s just what we like?!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li> it smells strong but worked great for her oily skin.</li>
            <li> I actually kind of liked it.</li>
            <li> To each his own.  </li>
            <li> It can give you kind of a burnt rubber smell.</li>
            <li> it was perfect, great shampoo for a fraction of what local stores would have charged me</li>
            <li> It is best used with a conditioner to keep the hair soft and looking good.</li>
            <li> lmao</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used just about every psoriasis shampoo out there, and Grandpa&#x27;s is absolutely the best.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to all my friends, and people I meet at my dermatologist that have any kind of skin issues like I do.</li>
            <li> While it does have a very strong scent out of the bottle, I honestly like the rugged pine aroma that it leaves.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a stronger pine smell, but maybe it&#x27;s a good thing that the smell isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> Along with the Pine Tar products, we also really love the Orange Essence Bar; that really smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong.</li>
            <li> Does smell very strongly of pine tar, but it fades as the hair dries.  </li>
            <li> It is, by far, the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used to control my psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> i suggest adding a dropperfull of tea tree oil (mason vitamins) along with a nice heaping teaspoon or more of castor oil.</li>
            <li> I am now a &amp;#34;Grandpa&amp;#34; myself, but I can certainly recommend this to people of any age who want a great shampoo.  </li>
            <li> My husband says it&#x27;s the cleanest his hair has ever felt, and fell in love with it after trying it on a trip to Finland.</li>
            <li> I love the pine tar aroma</li>
            <li> I love their bar soap but for earth smell shampoo...not even close to CVS coal tar shampoo...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Ive tried this product and many others-</li>
            <li> I have tried most of the dandruff shampoos on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> that it helped \\&quot;control\\&quot; my psoriasis and reduce plaques, but it never made my scalp healthy and its fragrance was nothing to brag about either.  </li>
            <li> With the T formula I was using, even while drying my hair, I&#x27;d have to top and scratch.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s probably more from habit than anything else.</li>
            <li> I have been using the soap and this shampoo for more than 30 years and they continue to do the job unlike everything else recommended to me.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my scalp healthy that otherwise has a tendency to itch, etc.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer and more shiny now too.  </li>
            <li> I do wish it was better smelling but</li>
            <li> Will be buying more Grandpa&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li> but it smells better.</li>
            <li> He is able to tolerate the Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar soap, shampoo, and conditioner</li>
            <li> I will buy him more when he runs out.</li>
            <li> So, I decided to check Amazon for a better price than the stores had.  </li>
            <li> I was quite pleased.</li>
            <li> Plus I love the scent.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li> Love the smell too.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Works better than the prescription stuff the doctor ordered.  </li>
            <li> within 24 hours the itching got better.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a seal on top of the bottle to protect leaking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells better than Heritage Products Tannenbaum Pine Tar Shampoo, and is a bit thicker in consistency.  </li>
            <li> The cooling sensation, is one of the things I like the most, kinda</li>
            <li> It has a &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; scent that is actually refreshing</li>
            <li> I love the smell of both.</li>
            <li> This is just a guess, but I doubt many women would like either one.  </li>
            <li> Some people may not care for the smell, but I love it.</li>
            <li> but i deff will be buying more along with the conditioner...</li>
            <li> and as i said, will deff be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It smells like pine trees (sounds good right?)  </li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Good product and price, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I used to use Grandpa&#x27;s Bar Soap to clean my big beard, and it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, there is not a flake in sight.</li>
            <li> I notice that I can wait 2-3 additional days before shampooing vs using more commonly available shampoos.  </li>
            <li> So far so great</li>
            <li> The bar soap helped, but it had a strong, funky smell.  </li>
            <li> It does have a funky smell, and my wife is not fond of it, but I don&#x27;t think the smell is as strong as Grandpa&#x27;s bar soap.  </li>
            <li> smells too strong but it heals my hair</li>
            <li> Very strong and distinct.</li>
            <li> Quick service, love the shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean, smells clean!</li>
            <li> Fantastic for dandruff sufferers</li>
            <li> The shampoo is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I feel fortunate to have found Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Shampoo and Grandpa&#x27;s conditioner.  </li>
            <li> so I said, \\&quot;I think it is my hair\\&quot; and she confirmed that.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> It conditions my hair and leaves my scalp free from the itch.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t handle the way it smells for my personal use, but works great for the dog.</li>
            <li> I only ever use this when I have some scalp irritation, but it&#x27;s great for what it&#x27;s made to do.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> but if it is as good as shampoo WOW.................</li>
            <li> Bought it and it is NOT the original formula.</li>
            <li> I use the bar version of Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap in the shower and I love the stuff, but it always feels funny in my hands when I wash my hair with it, so I bought this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this and the old, original bar soap that I&#x27;ve been using for many years.  </li>
            <li> Listen, this will make your head feel really clean from build up.</li>
            <li> Leaves you clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sticking with the MG 217 coal tar shampoo, which, in my opinion, smells far better and soothes the scalp itch and flakiness better too.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing, I saw many reviewers talking positively about the scent.</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo just a little thinner than I like.</li>
            <li> I have to say though that I have seborrhoeic dermatitis and this stuff took it right off!  </li>
            <li> Its aroma is powerful when in use, but fades appropriately after drying, and is exactly what you&#x27;re looking for if you want a truly woodsy smell in your hair or beard.</li>
            <li> great stuff; the FDA might not allow labeling the purpose for pine tar because it hasn&#x27;t proven in trial to be effective for enough people, but it definitely works for me; will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I would describe it as a moldy burnt old personâ€™s house if I&#x27;m being kind.</li>
            <li> This is a deal breaker if you have any kind of professional job where you must interact with clients or customers.</li>
            <li> well.&lt;br /&gt;I will warn that it has a wired smell that some may not be able to get pass, but once he is out of the shower I really can&#x27;t smell it on him.  </li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t say at the top weather it is the \\&quot;original\\&quot; or the \\&quot;New Advanced</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for me, and I would highly recommend it to other people.</li>
            <li> For dry scalp or dandruff, this is THE best natural shampoo for you.  </li>
            <li> Use it every other day and it works great for my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> a great help!!I used other products</li>
            <li> But they work, leave you feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> It fades quickly from the hair though.</li>
            <li> Both are mild.  </li>
            <li> My husband has mild psoriasis on his scalp which is exacerbated by stress.</li>
            <li> Maybe someone with mild dandruff would benefit.</li>
            <li> Yes, it has a scent of pine, which I find invigorating, but which dissipates quickly after I leave the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After first use, i noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a very powerful cleanser, even when using a small amount, great care must be used to effect a full rinse out of the product.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to help with my psoriasis and it really works!!</li>
            <li> I use this Pine Tar Shampoo and it really controls this problem!!  </li>
            <li> You will find the effort well worth the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipment</li>
            <li> Well worth the price as well.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> and freshly paved tar pavement.</li>
            <li> Yes, there is a distinct aroma that is not all flowers.  </li>
            <li> As far as effectiveness, I am a bit itchier and flakier than I would have been had I used Tannenbaum&#x27;s, but I found my hair softer and more manageable.  </li>
            <li> Your mileage may vary in your particular instance, but as for me, I cannot say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li> Plus with this Texas heat right now, sweat could be aggravating the psoraisis.</li>
            <li> He says its worth both quirks knowing its helping him avoid the pain he&#x27;s experienced in the past.</li>
            <li> It lathers really well and makes my hair feel really clean.</li>
            <li> Your hair and scalp really feel clean when you use this.  </li>
            <li> I would like it a lot more if it smelled more like a pine tree and less like tar.</li>
            <li> A very good product that make hair workable and soft without harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> was very fast, without any glitch.</li>
            <li> Pine tar has proven better for my hair, just as effective as coal tar, and pine tar is far less toxic.</li>
            <li> I have to say that with the first application it worked fantastically.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a city girl, and I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time in the woods, but the time I have spent in the woods I can honestly say that they did not smell like this horrendous shampoo.  </li>
            <li> a pretty stubborn problem of plaque psoriasis.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works consistently.</li>
            <li> It is the first shampoo to get his dandruff under control.  </li>
            <li> We have tried several products from Grandpa&#x27;s and love them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has done all of that and actually keeps my psoriasis in better control than even maximum strength formulas of coal tar were.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a healthy, cruelty-free alternative from traditional itchy scalp shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different products.  </li>
            <li> 2nd use, even more...</li>
            <li> My husband and I both get flakes from time to time, this product gets rid of it fast!  </li>
            <li> I like better than selsun blue and head and shoulders.  </li>
            <li> We used both alternating since they have different ingredients and seen way better results with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Gave a good lather with very little product.</li>
            <li> and my symptoms are pretty much gone.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is great, the fragrance I wish was a little less strong though.</li>
            <li> Dry scalp is better but not cured</li>
            <li> They all felt great on my head, but after getting out of the shower and after my hair is dry i could swipe my hand through my hair and flakes would fly- not thick heavy flakes, but just what would seem like a nonstop stream of little flakes if i kept swiping all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My ex certainly didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Formula\\&quot; like they used to do, rest assured it is the \\&quot;New Advanced Formula\\&quot; version; doesn&#x27;t smell of pine/smoke like the original, but has a chemical smell and is very oily exactly the same as the new formula.</li>
            <li> Just tried it - like it, more gentle than the soap on hair, but it does dry my hair - need to get conditioner too.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo after reading other positive reviews and it has worked better than I could imagine.</li>
            <li> A few drop produce tons of amazing suds.  </li>
            <li> Myself, I really like it.</li>
            <li> Really like the product</li>
            <li> This shampoo was recommended to me by a sales clerk at Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo really helped my dog&#x27;s coat.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be very concentrated.</li>
            <li> Ive had skin problems on my face and head my whole life.</li>
            <li> none of them really worked.</li>
            <li> Now and then, not overly much, I had a need to scratch</li>
            <li> but this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I really really really like the smell of both the Pine Tar Shampoo and the Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> partner also really loves the fragrance of my hair after using these products.</li>
            <li> I have, er, had a very itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> I am very please with it&#x27;s results.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It really cleans you and it makes you just smell like a man.</li>
            <li> but this goes together really well.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes the Pine Tar products.  </li>
            <li> Used to use coal tar products, but the condition of my hair suffered greatly and I ran across some literature (can&#x27;t remember where sadly) indicating that coal tar is more of a toxin than I would like to apply to my skin on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> It worked really well on my hair:  </li>
            <li> A few drops work into a nice lather for your whole body.  </li>
            <li> To remedy this, is simply picked out a nice tea tree, lavender and blue cypress conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is, but my hair just feels extra clean when I use this stuff.</li>
            <li> Using just a tiny amount of this shampoo and water leaves my skin moist and clean.  </li>
            <li> My daughter, who&#x27;s pretty sensitive to smells said yum you smell like bacon or beef jerky.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always suffered from a huge dry scalp problem.</li>
            <li> Full strength, the scent is kind of weird, but it really works for scalp misbehavior.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Results of use of this product left my hair soft, and manageable, my scalp felt clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> but it does not work, it gives more dandruff and it is a waste of money, i will never get it again</li>
            <li> Helped tremendously with my dry skin and redness.</li>
            <li> I read through some of the other reviews before I bought this product back in May, but I don&#x27;t think there were as many as there are now.  </li>
            <li> I am almost out of this first bottle, so I&#x27;m going to order it again with my next Amazon order and will order two bottles so that I&#x27;ll always have a backup.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure I will love it forever.  </li>
            <li> I loved the smell, but it didn&#x27;t  last long,lathered well, but oddly enough it dried out my hair and scalp</li>
            <li> The strong odor fades once dry for a few hours so worth the benefits.</li>
            <li> Good thing a little goes a long way as the bottles are not all that big for the price.  </li>
            <li> And then a few years ago the brands that I liked to use stopped using coal tar solution as the active ingredient and claimed a \\&quot;new improved formula\\</li>
            <li> The rinsing out will take a considerable time to thoroughly wash the product out, so it will pay to be patient in this process.</li>
            <li> To early to say if it will help my beard druf</li>
            <li> He has sensitive skin so always uses the Pine Tar bar soap in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It may be natural, but it&#x27;s not the cure-all I was hoping it would be.</li>
            <li> It was by accident using the baby shampoo that I realized my skin was sensitive to the surfactants used in mainstream brands.  </li>
            <li> No reaction on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been alternating this with coal tar shampoo since I have a stockpile of it to go through.</li>
            <li> I tried a myriad of natural &amp; holistic methods as well, but they all ceased to have any effect.</li>
            <li> I was further convinced that using a different shampoo formula was part of my problem when I stayed at a hotel and used the complimentary shampoo.  </li>
            <li> found a shampoo at a natural foods retailer that was free of the harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> This is not wonderful for my hair, but good for the flakes.</li>
            <li> It might a little pricey as compared to other available shampoos, but it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> but my skin does get pretty dry after a shower and that includes my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not slimy like many conditioners, but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It smells like a campfire, but if you can get past that you will have soft, flake free hair.</li>
            <li> Since I am of the older generation I remember when some dandruff shampoos had this same smell.  </li>
            <li> I do highly recommend this product, but, again, be careful to use it sparingly as it is highly concentrated, and care must be taken to completely rinse it out, to avoid leaving hair feeling oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> I also have the bar soap witch is a pain to use when wash long hair, this is much preferred.</li>
            <li> Where it would normally look like a ski run, there was only black!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They both seem much milder than other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried and leave my hair less dry than most of them.  </li>
            <li> It pays to go back to the old ways!</li>
            <li> Have used the shampoo several times on my hair and it lathers up easily with just a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I have used several different products for the same condition and really like this over the counter option.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually smells like a musty old cabin.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, but no thanks, Grandpa.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is worth the trouble of  returning this $10 item.  </li>
            <li> I have very itchy scalp and dandruff that other non-medicated shampoos were not helping to alleviate.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend was very hesitant due to the smell, but she loves how it cleans.</li>
            <li> Not a single friend of mine has said anything about the smell and they donâ€™t pull punches about anything.</li>
            <li> This was purchased with the hope I&#x27;d have to use the harsh coal tar formula less often, and while this works comparatively well, it doesn&#x27;t work BETTER or enough to warrant this smell.</li>
            <li> I found the smell refreshing, perhaps this is due to only using a small amount.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know there is no known cure at this time, but I have found this shampoo to be very gentle yet gives me a few hours of relief.  </li>
            <li> Pine tar shampoos work rather well at controlling my eczema in all areas with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Random side note, used African Black Soap shampoo as an alternative with less success, and a bar of African Black Soap worked better, but not nearly as well as the Pine Tar products.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the reasons that baby shampoo is tear free - it has less harsh ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product and it has helped my psoriasis a little.  </li>
            <li> but he finds it drying and unusually smelly when using but not after washing with it - it just lingers in the air a little.</li>
            <li> I have a place on my scalp that produces pretty large flakes over the past few years.  </li>
            <li> He has rosacea and his skin is very sensitive to other skin products for bathing, lotions, etc.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really describe it, but it&#x27;s not the usual &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This way, a bottle should last a long time, and flakes are no longer a problem.  </li>
            <li> Personally I didn&#x27;t care as long as it worked on my psoriasis and kept me flake</li>
            <li> Purchased this on a recommendation for a good beard shampoo and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had problems with a dry scalp and this shampoo eliminate the itchiness in a very short time.</li>
            <li> Regular soap, no matter how well it works on my face, seems to dry out my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Left it rough and coarse</li>
            <li> I wanted something natural and not full of Earth harming chemicals.  </li>
            <li> After the first use, I went shopping, tried on black blouses and dresses, ran my fingers through my hair.... and nothing!!!  </li>
            <li> bought this to test it taking care of my dandruff, but it&#x27;s still rough on my hair like other shampoos in that it removes all natural oils.</li>
            <li> The only draw back is that the smell can be a little intimidating, especially for a woman.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of shampoos and for a long time I was a fan of products that contain coal tar solution.  </li>
            <li> Along with the scalp brush he&#x27;s gotten rid of a long time nemesis.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it too long</li>
            <li> And it could be that since I ran out of the Tannenbaum product several weeks ago, my scalp might be in worse shape than it otherwise would have been with consistent use of either product.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I found I needed only a small amount of this thick product to produce a full lathering on my head.</li>
            <li> Although the cost of a bottle is very high compared to other shampoos,it only takes a very small amount and you get lots of lather.</li>
            <li> If you have dandruff or other scalp problems and store bought shampoo doesn&#x27;t cut it, this is the product that will finally work.</li>
            <li> I did not itch and my hair did not come out dry or frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone that is suffering from dry scalp and dandruff.</li>
            <li> is thicker when dry.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of all dry skin, and makes the hair still manageable.</li>
            <li> I have used shampoo for one month to see if it works for dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Whatever cheap, harsh chemicals were in hotel shampoo caused my scalp to get worse in just one or two days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it does help with the dry scalp !</li>
            <li> My scalp gets very dry, but I don&#x27;t have dandruff.  </li>
            <li> Selsun Blue, Jasons, Head and Shoulders to name a few-</li>
            <li> You would have to still use it everyday like Head and Shoulders to hold back dandruff.</li>
            <li> It is concentrated and not much is needed.</li>
            <li> The symptoms returned, as I expected.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops (5-6) is enough to get started.</li>
            <li> I have a nasty scalp condition &amp; male pattern baldness &amp; have spent hundreds of dollars trying dozens of medicated shampoos &amp; this is one of the very few that really makes a difference. :)</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I ran out of what I was using because I couldn&#x27;t find anything with coal tar other than T-Gel.  </li>
            <li> Other than that you can&#x27;t beat the anti-itch power of pine tar.  </li>
            <li> I tried other itchy scalp shampoos and oils.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try it out after reading other reviews of the product.  </li>
            <li> This stuff gets all the Brylcreem out of my hair and whatever other rusty garbage I&#x27;ve picked up during the day.</li>
            <li> I never had any luck with products where the active ingredient was selenium sulfide, pyrithione zinc or anything other than coal tar solution.  </li>
            <li> As Pete Rose used to say in TV commercials (not that excruciatingly awful recent one!)</li>
            <li> My scalp was always itchy and I dreaded wearing dark tops.</li>
            <li> Love their soap, hate their shampoo.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this product, no more itching or dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have not worn black in decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pine tar is supposed to be less toxic than coal tar.  </li>
            <li> It is arrived on time, but the cap of bottle was slightly opened when I opened the package.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The slight smell that remained was a slight smell of pine, that lasted less than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I still have a little dandruff here and there, but nothing like I used to.</li>
            <li> Use a little, suds up a lot.</li>
            <li> It definitely left my hair smooth, but it smelled so terrible  </li>
            <li> I thought the smell would go away once I dried my hair, but it did not.  </li>
            <li> Dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t determine if this works or not because the smell is horrible.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo, with the conditioner, for a week every few months.</li>
            <li> Oh, by the way, I did buy one of those black blouses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Grandpa!</li>
            <li> and he says his scalp is less itchy!</li>
            <li> No strong odor or residue.</li>
            <li> Even though I used a small amount, rinsed well and dried my hair, the smell lingered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair sort of slick.  </li>
            <li> It smells like I&#x27;m in a cabin in the wilderness, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;d have to get past the smell.</li>
            <li> Is is the strongest smelling thing ever and what&#x27;s worse, other people around you notice it.</li>
            <li> The scent fills the bathroom to start with, but fades to just a subtle hint that stays with me (and makes me feel outdoorsey) all day.</li>
            <li> And it does help with my seriously out of control scalp.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of other products without effect on the painful little sores that pop up after 3 days of no treatment.</li>
            <li> Using for over 2 months now, I have bad dry skin.</li>
            <li> it broke me out worse.</li>
            <li> But seriously donâ€™t let the smell drive you away, not as bad as some dandruff shampoos Iâ€™ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> The motor oil smell is not so bad on this shampoo (way less offensive than the bar soap).  </li>
            <li> This shampoo seems to clear up sebborhea as well as the coal tar shampoos, without the nasty coal tar.  </li>
            <li> At one time, T-Gel worked then suddenly failed.  </li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> It is a weird type of smell but goes together well.</li>
            <li> I told you it is weird</li>
            <li> The doctors I consulted gave me a 2% ketoconazole shampoo, but that was useless.</li>
            <li> weird I know,</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean its a bad product.  </li>
            <li> This stuff STINKS.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks.</li>
            <li> Eczema as a kid, chicken pox, and my skin never fully recovered.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my bf whose had painful eczema-like sores on his feet off and on for years now.</li>
            <li> and I hate the dandruff you can get with Beards....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to note, however embarrassing it may be, that I&#x27;m quite filthy.</li>
            <li> Idiots!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Helped tremendously with my dry skin and redness.</li>
            <li> This shampoo reminds me of the smell of a campfire amongst pine trees. My husband says it&#x27;s the cleanest his hair has ever felt, and fell in love with it after trying it on a trip to Finland. So if you&#x27;re looking for something that makes you feel like a Finnish woodsman, you should try this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Listen, this will make your head feel really clean from build up. But it does strip everything! Make sure to use conditioner and the smell did not bother me, but it may you! Very strong and distinct.</li>
            <li> So far so good. It is going to take awhile to see if it helps my wife&#x27;s psoriasis. Myself, I really like it. I love the pine tar aroma</li>
            <li> I love their bar soap but for earth smell shampoo...not even close to CVS coal tar shampoo...a perfect compliment to patchouli oil and no shipping charges.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on Amazon and its label denotes its good for psoriasis. I used it and it does help control it. I like the smell of it too.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for over a year. Really like the product and it works!</li>
            <li> Fantastic for dandruff sufferers</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to help with my psoriasis and it really works!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo was recommended to me by a sales clerk at Whole Foods.  I have very itchy scalp and dandruff that other non-medicated shampoos were not helping to alleviate.  I wanted something natural and not full of Earth harming chemicals.  I have to say that with the first application it worked fantastically.  I did not itch and my hair did not come out dry or frizzy.  I did end up returning the shampoo because the darned shampoo made my hair smell like truck stop beef jerky, and quite frankly I don&#x27;t care for beef jerky.  I thought the smell would go away once I dried my hair, but it did not.  I will admit, though, that the smell wasn&#x27;t quite as pungent.  I&#x27;m a city girl, and I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time in the woods, but the time I have spent in the woods I can honestly say that they did not smell like this horrendous shampoo.  So, it works.  Just watch out for the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  As Pete Rose used to say in TV commercials (not that excruciatingly awful recent one!) - a man likes to smell like a man.</li>
            <li> Dried my hair out. Left it rough and coarse</li>
            <li> Bought it and it is NOT the original formula. While it doesn&#x27;t say at the top weather it is the \\&quot;original\\&quot; or the \\&quot;New Advanced Formula\\&quot; like they used to do, rest assured it is the \\&quot;New Advanced Formula\\&quot; version; doesn&#x27;t smell of pine/smoke like the original, but has a chemical smell and is very oily exactly the same as the new formula. Idiots! Why did they change a good thing?  Love their soap, hate their shampoo.</li>
            <li> great stuff; the FDA might not allow labeling the purpose for pine tar because it hasn&#x27;t proven in trial to be effective for enough people, but it definitely works for me; will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really helped my dog&#x27;s coat. it smells strong but worked great for her oily skin.</li>
            <li> Quick service, love the shampoo.</li>
            <li> very good. as described.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be very concentrated. Therefore, I found I needed only a small amount of this thick product to produce a full lathering on my head. I found the smell refreshing, perhaps this is due to only using a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very powerful cleanser, even when using a small amount, great care must be used to effect a full rinse out of the product. Otherwise, the hair will feel somewhat greasy or oily. You will know when the hair is thoroughly rinsed, when the hair is squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results of use of this product left my hair soft, and manageable, my scalp felt clean and refreshed. The slight smell that remained was a slight smell of pine, that lasted less than a few minutes. I do highly recommend this product, but, again, be careful to use it sparingly as it is highly concentrated, and care must be taken to completely rinse it out, to avoid leaving hair feeling oily or greasy. The rinsing out will take a considerable time to thoroughly wash the product out, so it will pay to be patient in this process. You will find the effort well worth the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipment was very fast, without any glitch. Product arrived as advertised.</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo! If you have dandruff or other scalp problems and store bought shampoo doesn&#x27;t cut it, this is the product that will finally work. It smells like a campfire, but if you can get past that you will have soft, flake free hair.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and is as claimed. To early to say if it will help my beard druf</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Use it every other day and it works great for my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> It keeps my husband&#x27;s dermatitis (sp?) under control. The downside is it, of course, smells like pine tar! The strong odor fades once dry for a few hours so worth the benefits.</li>
            <li> I have (or should I say had???) a pretty stubborn problem of plaque psoriasis. I&#x27;ve suffered from it all my life.  At one time, T-Gel worked then suddenly failed.  I have not worn black in decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then along came Grandpa&#x27;s Wonder Pine Tar Shampoo.  After the first use, I went shopping, tried on black blouses and dresses, ran my fingers through my hair.... and nothing!!!  Where it would normally look like a ski run, there was only black!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this is a WONDER product. I cannot say enough about it.  Oh, by the way, I did buy one of those black blouses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Grandpa!</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo just a little thinner than I like.</li>
            <li> All of Grandpa Pine Tar products work great for me.  Great products.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my husband.  He has sensitive skin so always uses the Pine Tar bar soap in the shower.  Then he saw this and wanted to give it a try.  We have bought it several times already.</li>
            <li> Works Greats!  I have typr II diabetes and suffer from a skin condition in the summer from the heat.  This soap puts it a bay.</li>
            <li> Ive had skin problems on my face and head my whole life. I didnt want to visit yet another dermatologist to tell me i have flaky skin. Ive tried this product and many others- Selsun Blue, Jasons, Head and Shoulders to name a few- none of them really worked. Same goes for this shampoo. They all felt great on my head, but after getting out of the shower and after my hair is dry i could swipe my hand through my hair and flakes would fly- not thick heavy flakes, but just what would seem like a nonstop stream of little flakes if i kept swiping all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I just went to my regular doctor and she prescribed me Nizoral. Been using it ever since and it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note about this shampoo- A lot of people here complain about the smell- I actually kind of liked it.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is fantastic. I have tried most of the dandruff shampoos on the market. My seborrhea dermatitis was getting out of control. My scalp was always itchy and I dreaded wearing dark tops. I tried Grandpas worried that because it didn&#x27;t tingle like the medicinal shampoos it would not work. I could not be more wrong. My flakes and itchy ness were under control in 2weeks and now I only need to use every 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s it works&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s not a scent for women but it works so well that I can overlook it.</li>
            <li> Started to use because my face got itchy from my beard. I also used to get forehead itch and scalp itched a LOT prior to using this. Since I&#x27;ve been using this product, no more itching or dry skin. HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> sorry but it does not work, it gives more dandruff and it is a waste of money, i will never get it again</li>
            <li> I am a repeat customer.  I wear a beard....and I hate the dandruff you can get with Beards....I use this Pine Tar Shampoo and it really controls this problem!!  I would not be without it!</li>
            <li> I have only used this shampoo twice, but I have noticed a drastic change already. My scalp does not itch even a wee bit. I&#x27;m in love. No miracle cure for the dandruff yet but I&#x27;ll update if it happens. And the smell is.... something to get used to. I would describe it as a moldy burnt old personâ€™s house if I&#x27;m being kind. It fades quickly from the hair though. Not a single friend of mine has said anything about the smell and they donâ€™t pull punches about anything. I also have the bar soap witch is a pain to use when wash long hair, this is much preferred. It also doesn&#x27;t stink up the bathroom since itâ€™s contained in a bottle. But seriously donâ€™t let the smell drive you away, not as bad as some dandruff shampoos Iâ€™ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> The smell is something to get used to for sure! Can&#x27;t really describe it, but it&#x27;s not the usual &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to test it taking care of my dandruff, but it&#x27;s still rough on my hair like other shampoos in that it removes all natural oils. It may be natural, but it&#x27;s not the cure-all I was hoping it would be. You would have to still use it everyday like Head and Shoulders to hold back dandruff.</li>
            <li> great stuff, make my beard feel, look, and smell great :-)</li>
            <li> Works for me.  Dealer had it in stock and was shipped on time as specified.  No complaints</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very good for controlling my psoriasis</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always suffered from a huge dry scalp problem. I bought this shampoo after reading other positive reviews and it has worked better than I could imagine. I still have a little dandruff here and there, but nothing like I used to. I recommend this to anyone that is suffering from dry scalp and dandruff.</li>
            <li> Used this product for the first time and was impressed that the fragrance was nice and pleasant. No strong odor or residue. Gave a good lather with very little product. Did not need any conditioner either. Haven&#x27;t scratched my head all day. So far so good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had seborrhea for over 50 years.  Over that time I&#x27;ve tried every advertised shampoo on the market.  I know there is no known cure at this time, but I have found this shampoo to be very gentle yet gives me a few hours of relief.  I feel fortunate to have found Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Shampoo and Grandpa&#x27;s conditioner.  I have not seen them in any of the stores around here and found them while searching online.  I will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and a good price :)</li>
            <li> I read through some of the other reviews before I bought this product back in May, but I don&#x27;t think there were as many as there are now.  I&#x27;ve also read where a lot of reviewers don&#x27;t like the smell and claim that it does not work for them.  To each his own.  While the jury is still out on the fragrance of this shampoo, I&#x27;d put my results against anyone else who claims it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of shampoos and for a long time I was a fan of products that contain coal tar solution.  I never had any luck with products where the active ingredient was selenium sulfide, pyrithione zinc or anything other than coal tar solution.  I&#x27;ve tried them all.  And then a few years ago the brands that I liked to use stopped using coal tar solution as the active ingredient and claimed a \\&quot;new improved formula\\&quot; - none of them worked for me.  I ran out of what I was using because I couldn&#x27;t find anything with coal tar other than T-Gel.  And T-Gel worked in that it helped \\&quot;control\\&quot; my psoriasis and reduce plaques, but it never made my scalp healthy and its fragrance was nothing to brag about either.  So I starting using a left over bottle of baby shampoo just to wash my hair until I could find something that worked.  It was by accident using the baby shampoo that I realized my skin was sensitive to the surfactants used in mainstream brands.  This is one of the reasons that baby shampoo is tear free - it has less harsh ingredients.  My symptoms were reduced, but it still didn&#x27;t get rid of the flaking and plaques I had on my scalp.  I was further convinced that using a different shampoo formula was part of my problem when I stayed at a hotel and used the complimentary shampoo.  Whatever cheap, harsh chemicals were in hotel shampoo caused my scalp to get worse in just one or two days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a shampoo at a natural foods retailer that was free of the harsh chemicals.  I like the smell of it and it was supposed to assist with scalp health, but it still didn&#x27;t eliminate the plaques.  I then tried Grandpa&#x27;s bar soap because this retails stopped carrying the shampoo. The bar soap helped, but it had a strong, funky smell.  I put the bar inside a travel soap holder because it was so fragrant.  I finally ordered Grandpa&#x27;s shampoo from Amazon in May and have used it daily since.  My scalp has never been healthier.  I have no sores, no plaques, and no flakes.  It is, by far, the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used to control my psoriasis.  It does have a funky smell, and my wife is not fond of it, but I don&#x27;t think the smell is as strong as Grandpa&#x27;s bar soap.  I am almost out of this first bottle, so I&#x27;m going to order it again with my next Amazon order and will order two bottles so that I&#x27;ll always have a backup.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo.  The pine tar soap is also great for the skin.  Both are mild.  No reaction on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves you clean. My girlfriend was very hesitant due to the smell, but she loves how it cleans. It can give you kind of a burnt rubber smell.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  A few drops work into a nice lather for your whole body.  I uses it on my beard too.  Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My beard loves this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I was concerned about a pine tarry smell to my hair but didn&#x27;t need to be. Since using it my scalp where the psoriasis is located has not itched. With the T formula I was using, even while drying my hair, I&#x27;d have to top and scratch. I itched all the time. But with this pine tar shampoo the itchiness is 99% gone. Now and then, not overly much, I had a need to scratch but it&#x27;s probably more from habit than anything else. Plus with this Texas heat right now, sweat could be aggravating the psoraisis. My hair feels clean, smells clean!</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this, to compare with T-gel, in helping with the flaking from seborrheic dermatitis.  I didn&#x27;t even get through the bottle and the flakes started to re-appear.  Went back to T-gel and they went away again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible. While it does have a very strong scent out of the bottle, I honestly like the rugged pine aroma that it leaves. Purchased this on a recommendation for a good beard shampoo and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. Will be ordering more soon!</li>
            <li> I use pine tar and coal tar soaps to control the sores on my scalp.  This shampoo worked as it always has.  I have been using the soap and this shampoo for more than 30 years and they continue to do the job unlike everything else recommended to me.  I have tried a lot of other products without effect on the painful little sores that pop up after 3 days of no treatment. .Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar soap and shampoo work well for me.</li>
            <li> Great for eczema and controlling acne caused by oily hair.</li>
            <li> The motor oil smell is not so bad on this shampoo (way less offensive than the bar soap).  Perhaps it helps.  I&#x27;m not really sure.</li>
            <li> A very good product that make hair workable and soft without harsh chemicals.  Also leaves a shine in hair and no itch in scalp.  If you use it you will get complements on your hair and have a wonderful clean feeling.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works as advertised.....a great help!!I used other products but this is the real deal. Well worth the price as well.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> It might work great. It definitely left my hair smooth, but it smelled so terrible  it made me nauseous. My wife almost kicked me out of bed. It stunk up my pillow and e smell still hasn&#x27;t fully come out after a week and showering almost twice every day. I don&#x27;t doubt it works, I use coal tar on my hands occasionally. Is is the strongest smelling thing ever and what&#x27;s worse, other people around you notice it. This is a deal breaker if you have any kind of professional job where you must interact with clients or customers.</li>
            <li> It is concentrated and not much is needed. Even though I used a small amount, rinsed well and dried my hair, the smell lingered. I went to get a hair cut that afternoon and my hairdresser said in a shop voice, \\&quot;I smell something burning\\&quot;...so I said, \\&quot;I think it is my hair\\&quot; and she confirmed that. Well, if she could smell it then everyone can smell it, and I don&#x27;t think I want to be known as the lady with the campfire smelling hair. Men may like this shampoo; maybe it goes along with the manly smell. Not for me. I am sticking with MG 217 shampoo with conditioner for my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> My husband has mild psoriasis on his scalp which is exacerbated by stress. He&#x27;s tried several over the counter anti-dandruff  shampoos but they were hit or miss. This shampoo works consistently. The smell is not the greatest, but my husband doesn&#x27;t mind and it evaporates rather quickly. Most importantly, there is not a flake in sight.</li>
            <li> it was perfect, great shampoo for a fraction of what local stores would have charged me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Grandpa&#x27;s pine tar shampoo for years. It keeps my scalp healthy that otherwise has a tendency to itch, etc.</li>
            <li> Good product and price, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this shampoo twice now so I&#x27;m not sure I will love it forever.  I have to say though that I have seborrhoeic dermatitis and this stuff took it right off!  My hair is softer and more shiny now too.  As for the smell I think it smells like a woodsy campfire.  My daughter, who&#x27;s pretty sensitive to smells said yum you smell like bacon or beef jerky.  I do wish it was better smelling but seeing that it diminishes when my hair dries I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> A great match for Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap -- if you like the scent (it can be an acquired thing). Recommended over the plethora of floral and chemical scents on the market.</li>
            <li> I have used Pine Tar shampoo as a teenager for a scalp condition.  It&#x27;s good stuff!  I ordered it this time for my horse, for a skin condition he has.  I have not tried it on him yet, but I will.  The pine tar in the shampoo is quite medicinal.</li>
            <li> I really really really like the smell of both the Pine Tar Shampoo and the Conditioner.  They both seem much milder than other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried and leave my hair less dry than most of them.  I notice that I can wait 2-3 additional days before shampooing vs using more commonly available shampoos.  I assume this product does not irritate my scalp so that it does not react by producing excess oil to protect itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My partner also really loves the fragrance of my hair after using these products.</li>
            <li> Those are my son&#x27;s words when I asked him to rate this shampoo.  It is the first shampoo to get his dandruff under control.  Along with the scalp brush he&#x27;s gotten rid of a long time nemesis.  This shampoo does smell like pine tar but he likes that part too, I like the smell as well.  Good stuff here.</li>
            <li> This is not slimy like many conditioners, but a little goes a long way.  It seems to penetrate well.  Goes well with&lt;br /&gt;the shampoo.  Makes my hair sort of slick.  Smells really great, as I like the smell of pine tar products.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this shampoo, but what I received in the package is pine tar bath and shower gel!  I don&#x27;t think it is worth the trouble of  returning this $10 item.  Amazon, you fullfilled this ordered and I&#x27;m quite dissapointed!</li>
            <li> Yuck... Buy this product if you want to smell like a bon fire all day. I could even smell it after I showered the following day. The smell is very strong.</li>
            <li> Good thing a little goes a long way as the bottles are not all that big for the price.  However, it&#x27;s worth it.  Has done wonders for my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and have to rotate shampoos.  This is not wonderful for my hair, but good for the flakes.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, and this has great scent. It might a little pricey as compared to other available shampoos, but it is worth the money. I would definitely recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  I have a tendency to occasionally have some scalp problems but never as I use Pine Tar Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Robert</li>
            <li> Great stuff my hair loves it</li>
            <li> I loved the smell, but it didn&#x27;t  last long,lathered well, but oddly enough it dried out my hair and scalp Guess Im not mountain man enough. Used it in my beard too, over all score..meh.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I have, er, had a very itchy scalp.  This worked wonders.  I use it daily, I lather close to my scalp and let it sit for a while as I wash my face, and rinse.  The only draw back is that the smell can be a little intimidating, especially for a woman.  To remedy this, is simply picked out a nice tea tree, lavender and blue cypress conditioner.  Tada!  I smell like a lady again!  Other than that you can&#x27;t beat the anti-itch power of pine tar.  I tried other itchy scalp shampoos and oils.  Nothing holds a candle to Grandpas!</li>
            <li> I really like this product and it has helped my psoriasis a little.  I would like it a lot more if it smelled more like a pine tree and less like tar.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo for itchy and scalley scalp. I am very please with it&#x27;s results.  It is best used with a conditioner to keep the hair soft and looking good.</li>
            <li> Truth in advertising.  Great product.  My hair looks good, great control of  scalp flaking and itching.  Will be buying more Grandpa&#x27;s products.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> One rinse with this and my dandruff was gone.  I now add a small amount to the first rinse with my regular shampoo for prevention.  This way, a bottle should last a long time, and flakes are no longer a problem.  Full strength, the scent is kind of weird, but it really works for scalp misbehavior.  Recommended for flake sufferers everywhere.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite shampoos! The smell is great; very clean and invigorating. It lathers really well and makes my hair feel really clean. I don&#x27;t know what it is, but my hair just feels extra clean when I use this stuff. It&#x27;s perfect for me, and I would highly recommend it to other people.</li>
            <li> ...but it smells better. I was hoping for a stronger pine smell, but maybe it&#x27;s a good thing that the smell isn&#x27;t too strong. So far I&#x27;ve been alternating this with coal tar shampoo since I have a stockpile of it to go through. Eventually, I&#x27;d like to switch to nothing but this.</li>
            <li> This product did not do what we purchased it for.</li>
            <li> Smells great. It really cleans you and it makes you just smell like a man. It is a weird type of smell but goes together well. It smells like pine trees (sounds good right?)  and freshly paved tar pavement. I told you it is weird but this goes together really well. I tried it for my skin condition I have but it didn&#x27;t work and it broke me out worse. That doesn&#x27;t mean its a bad product.  It is a great product and I got it from a video review on it from This guy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great video review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/user/SupaFlyFatGuy859/featured</li>
            <li> I have used several different products for the same condition and really like this over the counter option. The ease of purchasing on line is great.</li>
            <li> We have tried several products from Grandpa&#x27;s and love them.  Yes, there is a distinct aroma that is not all flowers.  But they work, leave you feeling fresh and clean.  I especially like the conditioner.  Along with the Pine Tar products, we also really love the Orange Essence Bar; that really smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually smells like a musty old cabin.  Its aroma is powerful when in use, but fades appropriately after drying, and is exactly what you&#x27;re looking for if you want a truly woodsy smell in your hair or beard.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend after his last dandruff removing shampoo ran out (Kendra dandruff). We both agreed that it smells good! Definitely more woodsy/manly but being from minnesota, maybe that&#x27;s just what we like?! It smells like a mix of smokiness and pine, which is great! The shampoo got rid of his flakes and he says his scalp is less itchy! Win Win!</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo that works,</li>
            <li> This stuff STINKS. Before purchasing, I saw many reviewers talking positively about the scent. They must have the same affliction that &#x27;ole gramps had, as the odor left in my hair even days following use made me shudder. This was purchased with the hope I&#x27;d have to use the harsh coal tar formula less often, and while this works comparatively well, it doesn&#x27;t work BETTER or enough to warrant this smell. I&#x27;ll be sticking with the MG 217 coal tar shampoo, which, in my opinion, smells far better and soothes the scalp itch and flakiness better too. Thanks, but no thanks, Grandpa.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t determine if this works or not because the smell is horrible. If you want to smell like you&#x27;ve been cleaning chimneys all day, go for it. People next to you will think you&#x27;re a pine tree smoker. I&#x27;d rather just have dandruff.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes the Pine Tar products.  He has rosacea and his skin is very sensitive to other skin products for bathing, lotions, etc.  He is able to tolerate the Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar soap, shampoo, and conditioner well.&lt;br /&gt;I will warn that it has a wired smell that some may not be able to get pass, but once he is out of the shower I really can&#x27;t smell it on him.  Since I am of the older generation I remember when some dandruff shampoos had this same smell.  I will buy him more when he runs out.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks. lmao It does seem to control my scalp issues though. I haven&#x27;t been using it too long but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Look no further! Smells like a campfire but does the best job of any shampoo I have used for fairly severe scalp psoriasis.</li>
            <li> For dry scalp or dandruff, this is THE best natural shampoo for you.  It works great.  It has an odor, but it does not cling to your hair.  Once you have washed and rinsed, the odor is gone.  My husband won&#x27;t be without this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I had used T-Gel for a number of years and Neutrogena has been increasing the price of this for years too.  So, I decided to check Amazon for a better price than the stores had.  What I found, by accident actually was Grandpa&#x27;s Wonder Pine Tar Shampoo.  I decided to try it out after reading other reviews of the product.  Pine tar is supposed to be less toxic than coal tar.  Personally I didn&#x27;t care as long as it worked on my psoriasis and kept me flake free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has done all of that and actually keeps my psoriasis in better control than even maximum strength formulas of coal tar were.  It smells like smoke, like I have been camping, but oddly enough I like it.  It has a good consistency and lathers rather well.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  My scalp gets very dry, but I don&#x27;t have dandruff.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a healthy, cruelty-free alternative from traditional itchy scalp shampoos.  This stuff is the answer!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my bf whose had painful eczema-like sores on his feet off and on for years now. He likes this product and it is helping but he finds it drying and unusually smelly when using but not after washing with it - it just lingers in the air a little. He says its worth both quirks knowing its helping him avoid the pain he&#x27;s experienced in the past.</li>
            <li> I use the bar version of Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap in the shower and I love the stuff, but it always feels funny in my hands when I wash my hair with it, so I bought this stuff. It cleans my hair just as well as the bar soap does, it smells just as smoky and it&#x27;ll probably last longer too. I&#x27;d like to note, however embarrassing it may be, that I&#x27;m quite filthy. It&#x27;s an occupational hazard, I&#x27;m a glass-worker and junk-metal sculptor. This stuff gets all the Brylcreem out of my hair and whatever other rusty garbage I&#x27;ve picked up during the day. Great product, get some soon!</li>
            <li> We use on our westie. Keeps her white and helps with itching.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is magnificent. Use a little, suds up a lot. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now and my hair loves it. I used to use Grandpa&#x27;s Bar Soap to clean my big beard, and it worked wonderfully. When I discovered there is a Grandpa&#x27;s shampoo I was quite pleased. It is everything I suspected it would be. Plus I love the scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used just about every psoriasis shampoo out there, and Grandpa&#x27;s is absolutely the best. It conditions my hair and leaves my scalp free from the itch.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this shampoo along with Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap.  He loves this stuff, and it helps to keep is fungus issues under control.  The shampoo is very effective.</li>
            <li> Healing qualities. Healed a friend.  Also, has an odor that would probably keep the bugs away.  Healed MRSA very good.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Been using this for years now.&lt;br /&gt;It corrects my scalp problems instantly.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing else worked. Love the smell too.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had problems with a dry scalp and this shampoo eliminate the itchiness in a very short time. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  Works better than the prescription stuff the doctor ordered.  Started using it and within 24 hours the itching got better.  It pays to go back to the old ways!</li>
            <li> I have a place on my scalp that produces pretty large flakes over the past few years.  I have tried many different products.  I was hoping this would help me.  However, I do not think that it helps at all.  Maybe someone with mild dandruff would benefit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had severe seborrheic dermatitis for 25 years. The doctors I consulted gave me a 2% ketoconazole shampoo, but that was useless. I tried a myriad of natural &amp; holistic methods as well, but they all ceased to have any effect. Nothing I tried ever had any impact until I came across this Pine Tar shampoo. 1 application later, and my symptoms are pretty much gone.  Your mileage may vary in your particular instance, but as for me, I cannot say enough good things about this product.  EDIT: The symptoms returned, as I expected. This shampoo is still the only thing I have found that has had any effectiveness whatsoever in treating the issue.</li>
            <li> Just tried it - like it, more gentle than the soap on hair, but it does dry my hair - need to get conditioner too.</li>
            <li> It is arrived on time, but the cap of bottle was slightly opened when I opened the package.&lt;br /&gt;It was leaked about 1 ounce in the package. I had to wash it off...&lt;br /&gt;Hope there&#x27;s a seal on top of the bottle to protect leaking.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is good.</li>
            <li> smells too strong but it heals my hair</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase of Granpa&#x27;s pine tar shampoo! I like the fragrance and my hair is thicker when dry.</li>
            <li> thia product is as good as the soap ! it does help with the dry scalp ! i tell friends about the help it provides me !!</li>
            <li> A good all name in pine tar shampoo â€“ as it should be.</li>
            <li> Smells better than Heritage Products Tannenbaum Pine Tar Shampoo, and is a bit thicker in consistency.  As far as effectiveness, I am a bit itchier and flakier than I would have been had I used Tannenbaum&#x27;s, but I found my hair softer and more manageable.  And it could be that since I ran out of the Tannenbaum product several weeks ago, my scalp might be in worse shape than it otherwise would have been with consistent use of either product.  I have moderate to severe eczema, plaques and flaking, on my scalp, face, chest, hands, and a peculiar type of eczema that causes blisters as well.  Pine tar shampoos work rather well at controlling my eczema in all areas with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Random side note, used African Black Soap shampoo as an alternative with less success, and a bar of African Black Soap worked better, but not nearly as well as the Pine Tar products.  Used to use coal tar products, but the condition of my hair suffered greatly and I ran across some literature (can&#x27;t remember where sadly) indicating that coal tar is more of a toxin than I would like to apply to my skin on a regular basis.  Pine tar has proven better for my hair, just as effective as coal tar, and pine tar is far less toxic.</li>
            <li> THE SMELL...&lt;br /&gt;(Quits mid review to go puke)</li>
            <li> it did what it was suppose to and showed up when it was suppose to and it all good yep</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, the fragrance I wish was a little less strong though. A little bit goes a long way. I have psoriasis, so dry/scaly scalp is the norm for me. I use this shampoo, with the conditioner, for a week every few months. Gets rid of all dry skin, and makes the hair still manageable. The cooling sensation, is one of the things I like the most, kinda like you know its working if you feel it. I recommend this to all my friends, and people I meet at my dermatologist that have any kind of skin issues like I do.</li>
            <li> Your hair and scalp really feel clean when you use this.  It has a &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; scent that is actually refreshing</li>
            <li> Great stuff. It smells like I&#x27;m in a cabin in the wilderness, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming. The scent fills the bathroom to start with, but fades to just a subtle hint that stays with me (and makes me feel outdoorsey) all day.</li>
            <li> I love this and the old, original bar soap that I&#x27;ve been using for many years.  I love the smell of both. This is just a guess, but I doubt many women would like either one.  My ex certainly didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Works great for getting the skunk smell off of a dog.  I can&#x27;t handle the way it smells for my personal use, but works great for the dog.</li>
            <li> I have a nasty scalp condition &amp; male pattern baldness &amp; have spent hundreds of dollars trying dozens of medicated shampoos &amp; this is one of the very few that really makes a difference. :)</li>
            <li> Some people may not care for the smell, but I love it. It reminds me of being in the woods. And it does help with my seriously out of control scalp.</li>
            <li> It smells like BBQ sauce- not a smell you want on your hair.  Probably works (thus the 2 stars) but you&#x27;d have to get past the smell.</li>
            <li> I have used shampoo for one month to see if it works for dry scalp. Although the cost of a bottle is very high compared to other shampoos,it only takes a very small amount and you get lots of lather. Dry scalp is better but not cured so I will continue to use the shampoo. If I am cured at the end of one bottle,then I will definitely order another</li>
            <li> This shampoo seems to clear up sebborhea as well as the coal tar shampoos, without the nasty coal tar.  Does smell very strongly of pine tar, but it fades as the hair dries.  Leathers and rinsed well.  I only ever use this when I have some scalp irritation, but it&#x27;s great for what it&#x27;s made to do.</li>
            <li> Using for over 2 months now, I have bad dry skin. Eczema as a kid, chicken pox, and my skin never fully recovered. Im not sandpaper but my skin does get pretty dry after a shower and that includes my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After first use, i noticed a huge difference. 2nd use, even more... I just wish the bottle was a bit bigger but i deff will be buying more along with the conditioner...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip... to add extra potency and softness so your hair doesnt get that knotted feeling... i suggest adding a dropperfull of tea tree oil (mason vitamins) along with a nice heaping teaspoon or more of castor oil. So far so great and as i said, will deff be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> My order arrived promptly.  Have used the shampoo several times on my hair and it lathers up easily with just a small amount.  There is no pine smell in my hair afterwards.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both get flakes from time to time, this product gets rid of it fast!  I like better than selsun blue and head and shoulders.  We used both alternating since they have different ingredients and seen way better results with this shampoo.  I get pimples on my scalp sometimes too, weird I know, but this help that problem too.</li>
            <li> Great product for sure. Just a few drops (5-6) is enough to get started. O use a rubber circular finger brush to massage in scalp personally, and feel that is the way to go with any shampoo.  Then since the LUXURIOUS suds out.  A few drop produce tons of amazing suds.  Then because I like suds, I re do the drops and we are talking astronomical amount of suds.  It&#x27;s incedible.  I will never use another shampoo ever again.  I have not touched the Grandpas Conditioner yet but if it is as good as shampoo WOW.................This is the shampoo to beat.  Because of the tiny amount(drops) ratio to suds.  Bottle has great feel and dispensing cap too.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have been shaving my head for years but have been using Grandpa&#x27;s shampoo since I was letting my hair grow.  It worked really well on my hair:  made it look good and kept it supple and manageable.  Why do I use it now that I shave my head?  Regular soap, no matter how well it works on my face, seems to dry out my scalp.  Using just a tiny amount of this shampoo and water leaves my skin moist and clean.  I am now a &amp;#34;Grandpa&amp;#34; myself, but I can certainly recommend this to people of any age who want a great shampoo.  Yes, it has a scent of pine, which I find invigorating, but which dissipates quickly after I leave the shower.</li>
