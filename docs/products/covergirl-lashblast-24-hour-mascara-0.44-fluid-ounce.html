    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>According to my girlfriend this thing does its work; got it for a great price.</li>
            <li>This is a good mascara, which I found out it still in stores.  </li>
            <li>I actually liked the look it gave my lashes</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, but one of the two tubes I ordered arrived damaged and out of the packaging.</li>
            <li>Color lasts for hours once it sets in and doesn&#x27;t smudge nearly as easily as most mascaras.</li>
            <li>I would have rated it 5 stars if it had a BETTER Brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more resistant than waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Awesome mascara, lash looks like more big and long, very beautiful.</li>
            <li>It makes my eyelashes look beautiful, and a natural color.</li>
            <li>Only bought this one because of a great coupon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still a fan of the Lashblast original though.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t imagine what is in their special remover that will take it off though.  </li>
            <li>It does not make you lashes look full and thick,either.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Product accurately described - Brush is large for my eyelashes</li>
            <li>I tried, and she&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>It does melt just a little bit if its a warm sweaty day!</li>
            <li>First of all the color was brown.</li>
            <li>All kinds of soap, soaking with hot water, vaseline, even shampoo - tried everything EXCEPT buying their remover.  </li>
            <li>i love it, it last a lot!</li>
            <li>I dislike it so much that I am throwing it in the trash.</li>
            <li>Nothing works, makeup wipes, just water, even just trying to gently use your fingers to sort of pull it off.</li>
            <li>and this is what I need because my lashes are extremely straight and</li>
            <li>It really won&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li>You need to carry a magnifying glass along to read the fine print on the back that tells you, you can only remove it with there make up remover.  </li>
            <li>It destroyed my 16 year old daughters eyelashes, so she gave it to me.  </li>
            <li>I have brown/blonde lashes and this color gives me just enough darkness to pull off a natural day look!</li>
            <li>Key is to allow it at least an hour to set and when it does smudge a little, it&#x27;s easy cleanup!</li>
            <li>Everything else in the box was in fine condition, so it had to have been put in there with the packaging at least partially opened.</li>
            <li>I constantly have this mascara flake off into my eyes, trapped in my eyes, stuck to my contacts, hard to remove from my contacts more than any mascara I have ever used.  </li>

            <li> You need to carry a magnifying glass along to read the fine print on the back that tells you, you can only remove it with there make up remover.  Nothing else I tried will take it off and I broke several of my lashes off trying.  It does not make you lashes look full and thick,either.  I dislike it so much that I am throwing it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Like it but difficult to remove. I removed with coconut oil .</li>
            <li> I have used hundreds of mascaras in my lifetime, but I have never used one that caused such problems with flaking.  I constantly have this mascara flake off into my eyes, trapped in my eyes, stuck to my contacts, hard to remove from my contacts more than any mascara I have ever used.  I would never buy this product again.  Seriously, this mascara is flaky!</li>
            <li> First of all the color was brown. I ordered black. The formula stuck my eyelashes together and made them feel heavy all day. I couldn&#x27;t wait to take this crap off at the end of the day. Threw it away the next day.</li>
            <li> I actually liked the look it gave my lashes but it is impossible to take off. Nothing works, makeup wipes, just water, even just trying to gently use your fingers to sort of pull it off. It may work if you have another mascara under it but I will not be using it again</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, but one of the two tubes I ordered arrived damaged and out of the packaging. It didn&#x27;t look tampered with when I opened the bottle, so I&#x27;m just going to thoroughly sanitize the brush (the part I&#x27;m suppose to stick in my eye which was exposed to whatever else was in the amazon box...) and not bother to return it. Everything else in the box was in fine condition, so it had to have been put in there with the packaging at least partially opened.</li>
            <li> I have brown/blonde lashes and this color gives me just enough darkness to pull off a natural day look! Color lasts for hours once it sets in and doesn&#x27;t smudge nearly as easily as most mascaras. I have a tendency to forget I&#x27;m wearing eye makeup sometimes and rub my eyes due to allergies so it&#x27;s been tested.

            <li> Product accurately described - Brush is large for my eyelashes</li>
            <li> I like the formula of this mascara, it contains NO WATER and this is what I need because my lashes are extremely straight and any mascara that contains water straightens my lashes after I curl them. But don&#x27;t like the brush at all, I am using a brush that has longer bristles. I would have rated it 5 stars if it had a BETTER Brush.</li>
            <li> It really won&#x27;t come off. All kinds of soap, soaking with hot water, vaseline, even shampoo - tried everything EXCEPT buying their remover.  Can&#x27;t imagine what is in their special remover that will take it off though.  It&#x27;s more resistant than waterproof mascara.  It destroyed my 16 year old daughters eyelashes, so she gave it to me.  I tried, and she&#x27;s right - it&#x27;s terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still a fan of the Lashblast original though.  Only bought this one because of a great coupon.</li>
            <li> Spider lashes! D&#x3D; Won&#x27;t but this one again. I also got the wrong color...</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I love it so much. It makes my eyelashes look beautiful, and a natural color. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> The brush is really big - almost makes it hard to apply.  Maybe just because I&#x27;m used to a smaller one.  Not sure if I&#x27;d buy this specific one again.</li>
            <li> According to my girlfriend this thing does its work; got it for a great price.</li>
            <li> i love it, it last a lot!</li>
