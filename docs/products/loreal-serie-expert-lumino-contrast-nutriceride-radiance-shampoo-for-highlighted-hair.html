            <li> This is great shampoo, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, helps maintain my highlights, and is less expensive on this site than I pay at the salon.</li>

            <li> This time, it came with no quality seals and messy all over the inside of the plastic bag wrapped around it inside the box.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used it on my hair overseas, hard to find here in the USA</li>
            <li> This combination is a less expensive alternative to Oleo Relax shampoo and masque by Kerastase</li>
            <li> It does wonders for my thin, highlighted hair.</li>

            <li> I have been using this product for 4 months.  It smells fresh while not being too strong.  A small amount is needed to get my hair clean.  It foams up very well compared to some other high end shampoos.  L&#x27;Oreal simply does a great job with all of its product lines.  My stylist recommended that I pair this product with L&#x27;Oreal Professional Intense Repair Masque. The masque is fantastic and is the key to making my fine but naturally curly/frizzy hair easy to comb through, soft, and smelling great.  This combination is a less expensive alternative to Oleo Relax shampoo and masque by Kerastase and I am just as satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Even though this shampoo is supposed to be for highlighted hair, it is great for just colored hair. I have long, baby fine colored hair and I use this shampoo every day. It is very moisturizing without being heavy and making my hair full of static. It has a really nice light scent too. Slightly reminiscent of raspberries and that scent only lasts a little while after you wash your hair so you&#x27;re not smelling the shampoo all day.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!  I have really long hair and it leaves it smelling great, feeling clean and it makes my hair feel beautiful!  I highly recommend this product!  It arrived on time and was packaged well.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this before, and loved it. It does wonders for my thin, highlighted hair. The first time, it came with a quality seal and all kinds of assuring details. This time, it came with no quality seals and messy all over the inside of the plastic bag wrapped around it inside the box. Hmm! However, it&#x27;s definitely the correct product (did a lil side-by-side comparison) so I&#x27;m only dropping one star. Still, the inconsistency seemed strange. And sticky.</li>
            <li> My hair is shinning again, with our hard water, this product has brought back the shine.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect shampoo for highlighted hair.  My hairdresser used it on my hair overseas, hard to find here in the USA</li>

            <li> This shampoo is incredible! It lathers well and smells amazing!! Hair feels super clean &amp; smells fresh even the next day! I&#x27;m hooked!! Awesome product!!</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie. I currently alternate among Oribe, Kerastase, and Pureology. shampoos. I will add this product to my mix. It adds moisture to my hair with out making it oily. I can go a couple of days with one shampoos. A little bit goes a long way. The shampoo has a nice lather and it smells great. I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This I have been using for years and I love it...great for any kind of hair especially fine.  Nice and shinny</li>
