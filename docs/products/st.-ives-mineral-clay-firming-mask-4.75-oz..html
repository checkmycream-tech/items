            <li>I have been using St. Ives Mineral Clay mask for 20 years or more, and plan to use it for the rest of my life.[[ASIN:B000UVZLHQ</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have been using it on and off for years.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m tempted to use it more often than that.</li>

            <li>Love this mask.  </li>
            <li>Ives Mineral Clay Firming Mask for many years.</li>
            <li>and I love the feel of my skin after using it.</li>
            <li>which they gave you more of the product for your money</li>
            <li>So it wasn&#x27;t some placebo effect that most masks give.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with the St. Ives Timeless skin facial line.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>Not too sure about the firming aspect of this product</li>
            <li>I like it,however I don&#x27;t know if it was working as well as I wanted it to, but it might help if I used it more often</li>
            <li>Love how my skin feels after using it.</li>
            <li>Put it on your face, let it dry , then be prepared for an awesome effect  after you wash the clay residue off of your face.</li>
            <li>I first discovered this product 20 years ago.. and was absolutely thrilled to be able to purchase it on-line.. thank you :-)</li>
            <li>Good price, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>its good but firming part not that much.</li>
            <li>will recommend this product if you are looking for a bi-weekly easy to handle face mask.</li>
            <li>I remove the mask it helps fine lines to decrease.</li>
            <li>I have already noticed a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li>Drys out blemishes quickly!</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the temporary firming effect it has on the skin.  </li>
            <li>One time I used this product before going to have a facial and the woman told me my skin looked so great</li>
            <li>smooth, and my face</li>
            <li>The downside is that since this product started getting good reviews the price has gone up considerably.  </li>
            <li>It has no fragrance, and removes easily with cool water.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t leave on to long but great for absorbing oil!!!</li>
            <li>I saw it for under $4.00 originally and now it&#x27;s being advertized for $10.00 to $20.00.  </li>
            <li>In the Summer when my skin is especially oily, I love, love, love, this mask.  </li>
            <li>nothing great...nothing like original mudd masque that was discontinued...</li>
            <li>It overall worked great and was worth the money.</li>
            <li>I use this mask twice weekly and leave it on for about 30 minutes, it takes away the redness of my skin and helps it feel clean.</li>
            <li>clean yes.</li>
            <li>I think the price is fair compared to what&#x27;s out there for so much more and does the EXACT same thing.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t full Somebody used to it -(((((( It used before this item does to me...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair that because something works (which is what the manufacture wanted) that suddenly people have to get greedy.  </li>
            <li>The very first time I used the St. ives Mineral Clay Firming Mask I could tell that it works.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used this product a whole lot, but it does seem to tighten the face up and seem to make your skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>This mask is so simple to use as compared to the \\&quot;other\\&quot; popular one.  </li>
            <li>I wont be able to try the product,because it&#x27;s already old since the mask inside had air contact.</li>
            <li>the old blue clay product was way better the blue clay was real nice</li>
            <li>but it does leaves my skin feeling super clean and soft after.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin firm, \\&quot;nice tight\\&quot; and feels so clean after I wash it off.  </li>
            <li>My skin is oily/blemish-prone, but this really helps draw out impurities and calm my skin.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my wife wanted.</li>
            <li>maybe they&#x27;ve change how its made, or something in it, but it&#x27;s definitely different and more expensive, which is a shame, but it&#x27;s still one of the best on the market.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased the St Ives Mineral Clay Mask and love how it leaves my face feeling.  </li>
            <li>Definitely buying more.</li>
            <li>and I can say, I will now be an avid user of St. Ives Mineral Clay Firming Mask.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52 and need help with firming certain facial areas, mostly around mouth and jawline.  </li>
            <li>Use your favorite cleanser, dry your face thoroughly and apply this lovely blue treatment.</li>
            <li>I dont like it very much because it didnt do much for me..</li>
            <li>wow glows right after I use it! ..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long you have to use this so it may look better after longer use.  </li>
            <li>nThe o visible large pores.</li>
            <li>This product is very quick drying and seems to compliment the rest of my facial line very well.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s helping for the tiny fine lines I&#x27;ve started to notice.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone interested in ramping up their cleansing routine.</li>
            <li>It really works esp.</li>
            <li>and it really works.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use this as a mask but instead for wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Really helps acne caused by oily skin.</li>
            <li>it really does nothing ....</li>
            <li>I thought it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Skin seemed much smoother after use.  </li>
            <li>Oh my word, this stuff really does reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It cleanses my face and make my skin feel fresh and soft.</li>
            <li>And I wil not buy it at the very inflated price being charged now.</li>
            <li>but also I liked it because you could actually use it until the last drop.</li>
            <li>kinda like a lot of my other favorite items...</li>
            <li>It was very mild in smell and did not over dry his skin.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m older.....</li>
            <li>Highly recommended...</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this product, if you want to reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I feel I look a little better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice since it has arrived and my skin seems to like it a little better than the clay masks with what feels like menthol in them.</li>
            <li>It is becoming more difficult to find.</li>
            <li>Oh, well, have to find new favorites.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old finds that it really helps clear up acne.  </li>
            <li>I wish they would go back to that because I really don&#x27;t like the squeeze tube as much.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t tried the mask again, my face is still just as soft!</li>
            <li>I swear by this product, and if they ever discontinue it I will be sending as many angry emails until we get it back. :)</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel so smooth and tight....</li>
            <li>I do have a hard time finding most of the products</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to implement this into virtually any other program you&#x27;re currently using.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li>and it gives your face a natural glow.  </li>
            <li>I was about 25 yrs old.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This clay mask from St. Ives is wonderful! I discovered this by accident, and it has become a weekly routine (every Monday night). My skin is oily/blemish-prone, but this really helps draw out impurities and calm my skin. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in ramping up their cleansing routine. It&#x27;s easy to implement this into virtually any other program you&#x27;re currently using. Use your favorite cleanser, dry your face thoroughly and apply this lovely blue treatment. You will definitely see a difference in the quality of your skin/pore-size/radiance within a couple of uses. Try it and you will not be disappointed. And the best part is that, for under $5 a tube, it&#x27;s a great bargain! Great, great product....</li>
            <li> Mask id good working but...seller who send to me Mask is fraud... It wasn&#x27;t full Somebody used to it -(((((( It used before this item does to me... Seller from Broolkyn It&#x27;s souns like Russian they like fraud and lie..</li>
            <li> This mask is so simple to use as compared to the \\&quot;other\\&quot; popular one.  It makes my skin firm, \\&quot;nice tight\\&quot; and feels so clean after I wash it off.  My routine is every Sunday.  I too, wish I could use it more often, but I will stick to my routine as it is working so well for me.  Afterwards, I apply my favorite moisturizer and my skin looks and feels so GREAT! I think the price is fair compared to what&#x27;s out there for so much more and does the EXACT same thing.  I truly love it! Moreover, if you use an ample amount once a week, there should be no problem \\&quot;wasting\\&quot; it, as it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> WOW! This mask literally SUCKED my face out! I&#x27;m 25, and I feel 20 years younger... Had to buy one for my mom. Her response: \\&quot;WOW!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month and my skin looks more even toned. It even helped clear up a few blemishes!!! I have looked all over in stores for this product and the only place I found it was on Amazon. Good price, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 and need help with firming certain facial areas, mostly around mouth and jawline.  I&#x27;ve used this three times in two weeks and I do think it&#x27;s helping my skin.  It&#x27;s not going to give you a facelift by any means but it is benefitting, I think.  I also started doing facial exercises, so between the two I feel I look a little better.  I don&#x27;t know how long you have to use this so it may look better after longer use.  For now I&#x27;m happy with it.  The downside is that since this product started getting good reviews the price has gone up considerably.  I saw it for under $4.00 originally and now it&#x27;s being advertized for $10.00 to $20.00.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair that because something works (which is what the manufacture wanted) that suddenly people have to get greedy.  Consider the customers and their wallets these days.</li>
            <li> My skin gets allergic to almost everything it gets in contact with. I have been using this face mask for last 4 years, and whenever I have used it-this will NEVER leave any signs of allergy.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this product if you are looking for a bi-weekly easy to handle face mask.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to my uncles office in NY since I&#x27;m living abroad. He just gave me the package.   The product is broken and the top broken part is taped to hide the defection. Don&#x27;t buy anything from this seller! I wont be able to try the product,because it&#x27;s already old since the mask inside had air contact.</li>
            <li> This is a really great mask, esp. on the nose. Luv it. It really works esp. if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> It may be a little too early (2 weeks) for me to say, this firming mask is working as expected. However, I do notice the bags under my eyes are not so prominent. The eye lines are still there. I have been using St. Ives apricot hand &amp; foot scrub and apricot scrub for blemish /blackhead control for quite a while and I am very satisfied with the results.  I am hoping I will be just as pleased with the mineral clay firming mask.</li>
            <li> In the Summer when my skin is especially oily, I love, love, love, this mask.  I use it once a week and it really works.  I also enjoy the temporary firming effect it has on the skin.  I am 49 and I definitely feel and see some firming on my face.  Too bad I couldn&#x27;t use it every morning, but it would be too drying.</li>
            <li> Perfect for on spot acne treatment. Drys out blemishes quickly! Don&#x27;t leave on to long but great for absorbing oil!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use this as a mask but instead for wrinkles. I put a dab on a line that I have between my eyebrows and it seems to get worse when I sleep but when I wake up and remove the dry mask...the line is gone.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff! Really helps acne caused by oily skin. I only wish St. Ives had not discontinued this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice since it has arrived and my skin seems to like it a little better than the clay masks with what feels like menthol in them.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this product a whole lot, but it does seem to tighten the face up and seem to make your skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for more years than I can count, but as of late, have been unable to locate it anywhere...that is until I saw it on Amazon.  Please tell me this product is not being discontinued!  That would be a crime!</li>
            <li> I have tried many face masks (most with very high prices), and this is one of the best.  It makes my skin feel so soft and I do believe a few less lines.  I will try anything to improve the appearance of my aging skin and this is a good one!</li>
            <li> I found this a few years ago... it works great... Highly recommended... if it is not discontinued.... read somewhere it was... kinda like a lot of my other favorite items... Oh, well, have to find new favorites.</li>
            <li> it was just o k nothing great...nothing like original mudd masque that was discontinued...i would not buy it again it&#x27;s not worth it ....it really does nothing ....</li>
            <li> This product works wonders and keeps me looking younger. It acts like a minifacelift and decreases pore size. It has no fragrance, and removes easily with cool water. It is becoming more difficult to find. I have been using St. Ives Mineral Clay mask for 20 years or more, and plan to use it for the rest of my life.[[ASIN:B000UVZLHQ St. Ives Mineral Clay Firming Mask 4.75 oz.]]</li>
            <li> Dr. Oz recommended this product.  I thought it worked very well.  Skin seemed much smoother after use.  Would reccomend and buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been using it on and off for years. I apply the mask to my face when I feel like I have a tired look.&lt;br /&gt;Once I remove the mask it helps fine lines to decrease.</li>
            <li> This is one of the $5.00 products that Dr. Oz recomended for reducing wrinkles. It couldn&#x27;t be found in my town &amp; I searched &amp; searched for it. Finally got it through Amazon. Oh my word, this stuff really does reduce wrinkles. I&#x27;ve got awful lines above my upper lip, from being a cigarette smoker. The very first time I used the St. ives Mineral Clay Firming Mask I could tell that it works. I use it about once a week. But I&#x27;m tempted to use it more often than that. I highly recomend this product, if you want to reduce wrinkles. Also, you can&#x27;t beat that price.</li>
            <li> Iv used this for over 20 years so glad I found it since it&#x27;s discontinued</li>
            <li> Exactly what my wife wanted. She&#x27;s been using this stuff for years and now it&#x27;s hard to find in stores. I found it here online and she is happy. Wish I would have bought 2.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and I really like it.  My 16 year old finds that it really helps clear up acne.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this mask.  None on the market can compare!  I have been using this /////st. Ives Mineral Clay Firming Mask for many years.</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice, It does tighten the skin and I love the feel of my skin after using it.</li>
            <li> Used this product when it first came to market, and it was the best product for oily skin. tried it recently, and something has changed. maybe they&#x27;ve change how its made, or something in it, but it&#x27;s definitely different and more expensive, which is a shame, but it&#x27;s still one of the best on the market.</li>
            <li> For the little amount that is in this tube, it is pretty expensive. I dont like it very much because it didnt do much for me..</li>
            <li> I absolutly love this product!!!  It makes your face feel so smooth and tight....and it gives your face a natural glow.  One time I used this product before going to have a facial and the woman told me my skin looked so great and I knew it was this product because I can tell a difference every time I use it. Now that I&#x27;m older.....I find it harder to find this product at stores....I hope they never discontinue it. It&#x27;s a great product....probably one of the best clay masks I have ever used and I would definately recommend this to a friend (in fact I have!).  The only downside....is that it used to come in a plastic container about 15 years ago which they gave you more of the product for your money but also I liked it because you could actually use it until the last drop. I wish they would go back to that because I really don&#x27;t like the squeeze tube as much. But overall I give this a 5 stars because of the product itself!</li>
            <li> I found out about St. Ives Mineral Clay Firming mask from the Dr. Oz show. I&#x27;ve only used it once a week for just a few weeks. I think it&#x27;s helping for the tiny fine lines I&#x27;ve started to notice. I like this product and would recommend others to try it. I had to purchase it off Amazon because it is seriously hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 13 year old nephew who has been having terrible skin break outs. After only one use I could see a very big difference in his skin. It took out all the redness out of his skin and by the next morning his skin was a lot clearer. It was very mild in smell and did not over dry his skin. It overall worked great and was worth the money.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the St Ives Mineral Clay Mask and love how it leaves my face feeling.  It cleanses my face and make my skin feel fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> Recently my air conditioner went out and I&#x27;ve had to sit with my face in front of a fan constantly for 3 weeks since I cannot afford to fix it. Between the heat, constant sweating and the fan drying out my skin, my nose and around my eyes started to have the texture of beef jerky!!! You couldn&#x27;t tell just by looking, but to the touch it was horrible. This put me into a panic because I have always had nice skin. I tried everything, facial cleansers, exfoliating cleansers, different types of soap, I even tried holding my head under water and scrubbing in case it was just dead skin. Nothing worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this in my cabinet left over after my sister moved out and decided it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it. I left the clay on my face for 30 minutes, rinsed and all of the dryness was GONE! Not only was my skin now glowing, but it felt softer than it ever has! It&#x27;s been 3 days since and I haven&#x27;t tried the mask again, my face is still just as soft! So it wasn&#x27;t some placebo effect that most masks give. I swear by this product, and if they ever discontinue it I will be sending as many angry emails until we get it back. :)</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the St. Ives Timeless skin facial line. I do have a hard time finding most of the products but I have finally found all of them. I used this yesterday for the first time and I love this too!!!!!! This product is very quick drying and seems to compliment the rest of my facial line very well. I have already noticed a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and mouth. I work in a factory and I have some small issues with the dryness of my skin. I am very impressed with this stuff. I can use it once a week and not have to worry about drying my skin out. I hope that they never discontinue this stuff!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent mask. Definitely buying more. I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t get this at my local store when I can get St. Ives products but I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> This product feels great going on, and feels great coming off.  Not too sure about the firming aspect of this product but it does leaves my skin feeling super clean and soft after.  I never saw this product before and I can say, I will now be an avid user of St. Ives Mineral Clay Firming Mask.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I use this mask twice weekly and leave it on for about 30 minutes, it takes away the redness of my skin and helps it feel clean.</li>
            <li> Put it on your face, let it dry , then be prepared for an awesome effect  after you wash the clay residue off of your face.</li>
            <li> All of St. Ives Products are A+ for me! smooth, and my face wow glows right after I use it! .. Need to do this more often though!</li>
            <li> The best mudd for tightening up!  I hate giving my secret away - but everyone needs to know why Halle Berry is so jealous of me!</li>
            <li> the old blue clay product was way better the blue clay was real nice and you can never find any of the products in the store</li>
            <li> I like it,however I don&#x27;t know if it was working as well as I wanted it to, but it might help if I used it more often</li>
            <li> I first discovered this product 20 years ago.. and was absolutely thrilled to be able to purchase it on-line.. thank you :-)</li>
            <li> I have to get this mask by amazone because its not available at stores here in Houston TX. I saw the review and decided to get it. its good but firming part not that much. clean yes.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000UVZLHQ St. Ives Mineral Clay Firming Mask 4.75 oz.]]Makes your face feel tighter &amp; you notice that in a short time the wrinkles are smoothing out,</li>
            <li> When I started using the St Ives Mineral Clay Firming Mask I was about 25 yrs old. been using it for 30 yrs. And it does work; you can fell the tightening of the skin and nThe o visible large pores. Used on a regular routine ( 3x a week ) you&#x27;ll see the difference in 6 weeks. This item sold in beauty supply and drug stores for $3.99/tube. This product was discontinued by the manufacturer and can no longer be found in stores. And I wil not buy it at the very inflated price being charged now.</li>
            <li> Amazon was the only place for me to find this.  It is the best product.  I use it once a week.  I have been using this for 50 years.  I am 72 and everyone thinks I am no older than 57.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister and she swears by it. Love how my skin feels after using it. Too bad it&#x27;s so hard to get.</li>
