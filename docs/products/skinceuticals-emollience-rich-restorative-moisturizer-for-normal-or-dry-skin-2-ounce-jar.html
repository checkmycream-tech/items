            <li>Skinceuticals is an amazing line.</li>
            <li>When there are so many good smelling moisturizers out there, I decided I could not finish this.  </li>
            <li>So if you are 40 or more this would be good.</li>
            <li>SkinCeuticals is a fantastic lineup of effective products!</li>
            <li>Soaks in quickly which is great for mornings.</li>
            <li>makeup goes on nice just make sure to blend it into your skin.</li>
            <li>A light moisturizer good for day use.</li>
            <li>It is rich and makes my skin feel so good.  </li>
            <li>Nice and smooth your face feels soft,it goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>For my skin, I need I need more moisture and with his product I need to apply a couple times a day but have not found a suitable replacement and continue to use.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Would love it better in a tube so it would be easier to pack.</li>
            <li>I have tried many moisturizers but this one does it for me.  </li>
            <li>It is light and goes on nicely</li>
            <li>Having the oils in this product keep the skin happy and the face washes so much cleaner without irritation.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>Love skinceuticals products.</li>
            <li>so many people don&#x27;t know to do this.</li>
            <li>Finally a light moisturizer that will hold up during the day!</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels and looks on my skin</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>In comparison, my skin is responding much better to Skinceuticals over Perricone.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, consistency, and how it absorbs.  </li>
            <li>I love Skinceuticals Emollience.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy, absorbs fast, truly moisturizes, can be applied under makeup, great for all seasons, non-irritating, and no fragrance added.  </li>
            <li>An outstanding moisterizer.</li>
            <li>Also had an oil lie layer that floats on top.</li>
            <li>I love the texture -</li>
            <li>My skin needs more moisture than this at age 60.  </li>
            <li>Are there better ones out there...</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and feel of these products on my skin.</li>
            <li>Best moisturizer for dry skin on the market</li>
            <li>Great product - leaves my skin soft and hydrated without feely greasy!  </li>
            <li>but I was looking for better results on my fine lines.</li>
            <li>I have paid much more money for other face creams and this is the best one I have found.</li>
            <li>Good products with reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I get many comments from people on how young I look for my age, it pays to use good products that protect &amp; enrich.</li>
            <li>The scent and texture is fine.</li>
            <li>It has no odor and is fine alone or under make-up.</li>
            <li>Leaves NO oily residue..just finely moisturized skin.</li>
            <li>Pumps are much better at keeping ingredients fresh.  </li>
            <li>for those looking for paraben free products, this is not one.</li>
            <li>For those who don&#x27;t care about parabens, then this product is for you, but for those like me who look for paraben free and are concerned about some of the research linking cancers and parabens.</li>
            <li>I opt for paraben free....</li>
            <li>This light cream is moisturizing without any oily feeling.</li>
            <li>Good product - goes on easily - is not heavy - keeps my face moist all night.  </li>
            <li>It has a light, clean feel; isn&#x27;t oily or drying.</li>
            <li>Light and clean under or over makeup doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I love Skinceuticals products, but this is the first product I would never order again.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dewy and rich but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricier than some others I e tried, but worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It smells great and with my dry skin it works wonders.</li>
            <li>Great product to use every single night.</li>
            <li>This jar was really runny, like it was cut with a lot more water.  </li>
            <li>It stays on all day for a nice soft feel (not greasy).</li>
            <li>Now people may comment back and argue whether parabens are or aren&#x27;t good for you.</li>
            <li>Nice soft fragrance--not off-putting in any way.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>This cream is probably better suited to someone with normal skin.  </li>
            <li>love it in the winter not so much in the summer--makes me to  oily on hot summer days.  </li>
            <li>I should have never received a faulty product in the first place!</li>
            <li>Wonderful for dry skin and low humidity areas.  </li>
            <li>Just as the label says, it is rich but absorbs quickly and really makes my skin feel replenished.</li>
            <li>Nice weight, works well, especially in the warmer weather.  </li>
            <li>, I am pleased with the results so far.  </li>
            <li>They are well worth the price over drug store products.  </li>
            <li>Quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>Exactly the correct product and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference RIGHT away.</li>
            <li>I have used Skinceutical products in the past and have been happy with them.  </li>
            <li>I expected better from Skinceuticals!</li>
            <li>I can see differences right away in a few days when something is not of good quality.  </li>
            <li>I have several products from Skinceuticals and have been pleased with them.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon!</li>
            <li>First time that I buy them online.</li>
            <li>Fantastic face cream for this 50 year old who uses both Retin A and Vit. C on her face every day.</li>
            <li>and I finally found one that I love.  </li>
            <li>It is light and not heavily scented.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I first became acquainted with this product when I had a facial at a spa.  </li>
            <li>First time using this lotion and this brand.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m going to try and send it back if I can ever get the seller to answer me :-)</li>
            <li>I was under the allusion all of Skinceuticals were health conscious paraben free.</li>
            <li>Such a great product for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this brand to anyone with aging skin looking for a high quality product and this particular moisturizer is light after absorption.</li>
            <li>This is a nioe moisturizer, feels rich but not heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li>I chose Skinceuticals because I&#x27;ve had good luck with them in the past.  </li>
            <li>Good moisturizer but pretty thick.  </li>
            <li>I like purchasing it through Amazon.com where it is not only cheaper than if you purchase in a spa, but free shipping if you are a Prime member.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin really moist.  </li>
            <li>The one star is for the packaging not the product since I haven&#x27;t tried the emollient, which I really wanted.</li>
            <li>Works very well to moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing...good price</li>
            <li>It has really made a difference in my skin texture.</li>
            <li>It really has kept my skin from drying this winter.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much thinner almost runny.</li>
            <li>Your really taking a gamble with this seller.</li>
            <li>I love this cream and as a result I want to try other Skinceuticals products.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing for my normal skin.</li>
            <li>It is as good as products with big name which are more expensive</li>
            <li>I am not sure its worth $50 though, I bought it twice and since switched to Caudelie moisturizer - same price, more hydration!</li>
            <li>My dry forehead and cheeks were smooth and hydrated and I didn&#x27;t have to keep applying it all day (once in the morning, once at night.)</li>
            <li>The b5 serum from skin cosmetics works better to moisturize my skin and at half the price.</li>
            <li>My face is naturally dry and this is a fantastic moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Bought it from different suppliers twice from Amazon, many places simply do not carry it.</li>
            <li>I would never buy from this particular seller ever Again</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin feeling very soft with even the smallest amount!</li>
            <li>but this product is truly high end.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Skinceuticals Emollience Rich, Restorative Moisturizer For Normal Or Dry Skin,</li>
            <li>My skin is already very well cared for, but I noticed an increase in plumpness and fine lines were less noticeable.</li>
            <li>even though I normally don&#x27;t want to spend this amount of $</li>
            <li>I received a liquid like \\&quot;cream\\&quot; i have purchased this dry skin skinceauticals cream many of times prior and it has never had this consistency.</li>
            <li>, i have a dry sensitive skin, and live in a hot dusty climate , this moisturizer is easy to be absorbed and its perfume free , I am new to this brand , i got introduce to it after i did the assessment in The Skin Type Solution by Leslie Bauman , it is an amaaaaaazing book</li>
            <li>Product was not thick and rich as I expected from the name.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of expensive for face lotion, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>Usually the product is thicker and more like a cream.</li>
            <li>I could feel that it was dry where I was getting smile lines</li>
            <li>this product has really calmed it down improving fine lines and overall appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cream with nothing on it... pure and simple...</li>
            <li>I bought this originally for $80 at a spa in Arizona because my oily, slightly acne prone skin was about to fall off</li>
            <li>and my face feels soft and hydrated for the day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive and combo skin.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased this product on recommendation and was pleasantly surprised at the lightness of the moisturizer on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It provides a soft non greasy feel but does the job of moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li>I use this product on a regular basis and the Emollience arrived very runny.  </li>
            <li>But after a few weeks of using Emollience Rich my skin was clearing up.</li>
            <li>This was supposed to be for very dry skin, but it was actually a very light lotion not rich at all.  </li>
            <li>I had been using Proactiv which even dried the dry areas out more.    </li>
            <li>I live in high dry Colorado and this helps my skin a lot.</li>
            <li>I ordered a few of their other products and their sunblock stated paraben free no unnecessary chemicals.</li>
            <li>But this product really isn&#x27;t for dry skin at all.</li>
            <li>I was surprised since it&#x27;s for \\&quot;reg to dry skin\\&quot; and I have a very oily nose and chin, but it&#x27;s so light that it doesn&#x27;t negatively effect those areas.</li>
            <li>This product may work for you or not but the fact that they would not provide a refund especially when their product caused such a severe reaction, as a consumer I would be very concerned.</li>
            <li>Applies easily and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this brand and this particular product for a few years now and have always appreciated this product.</li>
            <li>I have never bought a high end moisturizer before as I usually save my money for treatment serums but it is worth the money and just bought my second jar.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this product for a week, but so far it works well.  </li>
            <li>As a moisturizer it was neither better nor worse than others.  </li>
            <li>I liked the product, but found it too expensive for a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>My skin is normal to dry.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this for anyone with normal or dry skin.</li>
            <li>This jar directly from England seems to be a little thicker and not quite so easy to spread on skin as others in the past.</li>
            <li>Long lasting and non-irritating for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Does not go on thick and aborbs quickly.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> So if you are 40 or more this would be good.</li>
            <li> SkinCeuticals is a fantastic lineup of effective products!</li>

            <li> For my skin, I need I need more moisture and with his product I need to apply a couple times a day but have not found a suitable replacement and continue to use.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Would love it better in a tube so it would be easier to pack.</li>
            <li> I have tried many moisturizers but this one does it for me.  </li>
            <li> It is light and goes on nicely</li>
            <li> Having the oils in this product keep the skin happy and the face washes so much cleaner without irritation.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> Love skinceuticals products.</li>
            <li> so many people don&#x27;t know to do this.</li>
            <li> Finally a light moisturizer that will hold up during the day!</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels and looks on my skin</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> In comparison, my skin is responding much better to Skinceuticals over Perricone.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, consistency, and how it absorbs.  </li>
            <li> I love Skinceuticals Emollience.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy, absorbs fast, truly moisturizes, can be applied under makeup, great for all seasons, non-irritating, and no fragrance added.  </li>
            <li> An outstanding moisterizer.</li>
            <li> Also had an oil lie layer that floats on top.</li>
            <li> I love the texture -</li>
            <li> My skin needs more moisture than this at age 60.  </li>
            <li> Are there better ones out there...</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and feel of these products on my skin.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer for dry skin on the market</li>
            <li> Great product - leaves my skin soft and hydrated without feely greasy!  </li>
            <li> but I was looking for better results on my fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have paid much more money for other face creams and this is the best one I have found.</li>
            <li> Good products with reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I get many comments from people on how young I look for my age, it pays to use good products that protect &amp; enrich.</li>
            <li> The scent and texture is fine.</li>
            <li> It has no odor and is fine alone or under make-up.</li>
            <li> Leaves NO oily residue..just finely moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> Pumps are much better at keeping ingredients fresh.  </li>
            <li> for those looking for paraben free products, this is not one.</li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t care about parabens, then this product is for you, but for those like me who look for paraben free and are concerned about some of the research linking cancers and parabens.</li>
            <li> I opt for paraben free....</li>
            <li> This light cream is moisturizing without any oily feeling.</li>
            <li> Good product - goes on easily - is not heavy - keeps my face moist all night.  </li>
            <li> It has a light, clean feel; isn&#x27;t oily or drying.</li>
            <li> Light and clean under or over makeup doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I love Skinceuticals products, but this is the first product I would never order again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dewy and rich but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricier than some others I e tried, but worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It smells great and with my dry skin it works wonders.</li>
            <li> Great product to use every single night.</li>
            <li> This jar was really runny, like it was cut with a lot more water.  </li>
            <li> It stays on all day for a nice soft feel (not greasy).</li>
            <li> Now people may comment back and argue whether parabens are or aren&#x27;t good for you.</li>
            <li> Nice soft fragrance--not off-putting in any way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This cream is probably better suited to someone with normal skin.  </li>
            <li> love it in the winter not so much in the summer--makes me to  oily on hot summer days.  </li>
            <li> I should have never received a faulty product in the first place!</li>
            <li> Wonderful for dry skin and low humidity areas.  </li>
            <li> Just as the label says, it is rich but absorbs quickly and really makes my skin feel replenished.</li>
            <li> Nice weight, works well, especially in the warmer weather.  </li>
            <li> , I am pleased with the results so far.  </li>
            <li> They are well worth the price over drug store products.  </li>
            <li> Quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> Exactly the correct product and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference RIGHT away.</li>
            <li> I have used Skinceutical products in the past and have been happy with them.  </li>
            <li> I expected better from Skinceuticals!</li>
            <li> I can see differences right away in a few days when something is not of good quality.  </li>
            <li> I have several products from Skinceuticals and have been pleased with them.</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> First time that I buy them online.</li>
            <li> Fantastic face cream for this 50 year old who uses both Retin A and Vit. C on her face every day.</li>
            <li> and I finally found one that I love.  </li>
            <li> It is light and not heavily scented.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I first became acquainted with this product when I had a facial at a spa.  </li>
            <li> First time using this lotion and this brand.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going to try and send it back if I can ever get the seller to answer me :-)</li>
            <li> I was under the allusion all of Skinceuticals were health conscious paraben free.</li>
            <li> Such a great product for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brand to anyone with aging skin looking for a high quality product and this particular moisturizer is light after absorption.</li>
            <li> This is a nioe moisturizer, feels rich but not heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li> I chose Skinceuticals because I&#x27;ve had good luck with them in the past.  </li>
            <li> Good moisturizer but pretty thick.  </li>
            <li> I like purchasing it through Amazon.com where it is not only cheaper than if you purchase in a spa, but free shipping if you are a Prime member.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin really moist.  </li>
            <li> The one star is for the packaging not the product since I haven&#x27;t tried the emollient, which I really wanted.</li>
            <li> Works very well to moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing...good price</li>
            <li> It has really made a difference in my skin texture.</li>
            <li> It really has kept my skin from drying this winter.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much thinner almost runny.</li>
            <li> Your really taking a gamble with this seller.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and as a result I want to try other Skinceuticals products.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing for my normal skin.</li>
            <li> It is as good as products with big name which are more expensive</li>
            <li> I am not sure its worth $50 though, I bought it twice and since switched to Caudelie moisturizer - same price, more hydration!</li>
            <li> My dry forehead and cheeks were smooth and hydrated and I didn&#x27;t have to keep applying it all day (once in the morning, once at night.)</li>
            <li> The b5 serum from skin cosmetics works better to moisturize my skin and at half the price.</li>
            <li> My face is naturally dry and this is a fantastic moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Bought it from different suppliers twice from Amazon, many places simply do not carry it.</li>
            <li> I would never buy from this particular seller ever Again</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin feeling very soft with even the smallest amount!</li>
            <li> but this product is truly high end.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Skinceuticals Emollience Rich, Restorative Moisturizer For Normal Or Dry Skin,</li>
            <li> My skin is already very well cared for, but I noticed an increase in plumpness and fine lines were less noticeable.</li>
            <li> even though I normally don&#x27;t want to spend this amount of $</li>
            <li> I received a liquid like \\&quot;cream\\&quot; i have purchased this dry skin skinceauticals cream many of times prior and it has never had this consistency.</li>
            <li> , i have a dry sensitive skin, and live in a hot dusty climate , this moisturizer is easy to be absorbed and its perfume free , I am new to this brand , i got introduce to it after i did the assessment in The Skin Type Solution by Leslie Bauman , it is an amaaaaaazing book</li>
            <li> Product was not thick and rich as I expected from the name.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of expensive for face lotion, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> Usually the product is thicker and more like a cream.</li>
            <li> I could feel that it was dry where I was getting smile lines</li>
            <li> this product has really calmed it down improving fine lines and overall appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cream with nothing on it... pure and simple...</li>
            <li> I bought this originally for $80 at a spa in Arizona because my oily, slightly acne prone skin was about to fall off</li>
            <li> and my face feels soft and hydrated for the day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive and combo skin.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased this product on recommendation and was pleasantly surprised at the lightness of the moisturizer on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It provides a soft non greasy feel but does the job of moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li> I use this product on a regular basis and the Emollience arrived very runny.  </li>
            <li> But after a few weeks of using Emollience Rich my skin was clearing up.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be for very dry skin, but it was actually a very light lotion not rich at all.  </li>
            <li> I had been using Proactiv which even dried the dry areas out more.    </li>
            <li> I live in high dry Colorado and this helps my skin a lot.</li>
            <li> I ordered a few of their other products and their sunblock stated paraben free no unnecessary chemicals.</li>
            <li> But this product really isn&#x27;t for dry skin at all.</li>
            <li> I was surprised since it&#x27;s for \\&quot;reg to dry skin\\&quot; and I have a very oily nose and chin, but it&#x27;s so light that it doesn&#x27;t negatively effect those areas.</li>
            <li> This product may work for you or not but the fact that they would not provide a refund especially when their product caused such a severe reaction, as a consumer I would be very concerned.</li>
            <li> Applies easily and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this brand and this particular product for a few years now and have always appreciated this product.</li>
            <li> I have never bought a high end moisturizer before as I usually save my money for treatment serums but it is worth the money and just bought my second jar.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a week, but so far it works well.  </li>
            <li> As a moisturizer it was neither better nor worse than others.  </li>
            <li> I liked the product, but found it too expensive for a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> My skin is normal to dry.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this for anyone with normal or dry skin.</li>
            <li> This jar directly from England seems to be a little thicker and not quite so easy to spread on skin as others in the past.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and non-irritating for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Does not go on thick and aborbs quickly.</li>
            <li> skin and recently noticed that my forehead and cheeks where getting dry (maybe the winter coming??)</li>
            <li> I have dry skin in the winter and found that I needed something a little heavier than my normal face cream.  </li>
            <li> I can buy Nivea or Curel or other very emolient creams for less than $10.00 in pharmacys.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizers for dry skin like mine</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really irrelevant, but rather this review is for people who look for paraben free.</li>
            <li> This product stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream once before a long time ago, I decided to try it again</li>
            <li> I was told that my skin was dry.</li>
            <li> it was so dry in the desert, and I had access to nothing else.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I did not feel that this product made any difference on my dry skin</li>
            <li> Not worth the price, IMHO same quality than a drug store $15 cream.</li>
            <li> so well it actually makes my skin less oily throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> but this one seems a little different...</li>
            <li> And a small jar of it can last a long time.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I continue to use it now everyday even though I&#x27;m back in the humid south because I swear it moisturizes</li>
            <li> I received the goods on time as I expected</li>
            <li> I had red irritated patches on my cheeks (due to a harsh exfoliant) when I purchased this and</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but don&#x27;t have any complaints after I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> All the other times it was a thicker cream</li>
            <li> I talked to someone at Blue Mercury about this product and they informed me that it&#x27;s loaded with Parabens, which has always caused problems for me in the past.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that with any &amp;#34;jar&amp;#34; cream, once opened and continued opening, the ingredients lose their efficacy over time.  </li>
            <li> Just average.</li>
            <li> It was runny almost like a white liquid when the product should be thick.</li>
            <li> I just started using this cream, it is half the cost of what I had been using, decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> It leaks when you travel; and yes, the lid was on tight.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over two years now.  </li>
            <li> I heartily recomment it for anyone whose skin needs a little help with moisture.</li>
            <li> it hydrtaes my skin and never feels greasy or too heavy.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel different from any less expensive face cream</li>
            <li> I only used it for two weeks, and it was expensive but there are going to be some hits, some miss.</li>
            <li> Made my skin very soft but after about a week it caused me to break out badly.</li>
            <li> I use it when I&#x27;m in a really dry and cold climate.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it is alot less expensive than if you bought on Skin Ceuticals</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in salons and when you do find it you end up being pressured into unnecessary spa treatments (botox, $700 extractions, etc).</li>
            <li> When it arrived, the packaging box, around the jar, was badly damaged and the jar was open and the moisturizer looked used.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> It is not a miracle, alas, but i do like it.</li>
            <li> Also was disappointed to read other reviews about all the parabens in this prodouct.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, did not work for my skin, made it seem tight and drier.</li>
            <li> it you wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using both, don&#x27;t think you can go wrong, at age 72</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this brand, though the price is painful.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This skin line caused a terrible reaction which included welts on my face and chest area for 2 days.  </li>
            <li> Is it the worst...</li>
            <li> It is terrible- burned my skin!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  It keeps my face moist all day and not greasy. Would love it better in a tube so it would be easier to pack.</li>
            <li> I have tried many moisturizers but this one does it for me.  It is expensive but worth every penny.  It is light and goes on nicely and my face feels soft and hydrated for the day.  I have several products from Skinceuticals and have been pleased with them.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer but pretty thick.  I use it when I&#x27;m in a really dry and cold climate.  If I use it during the summer it can make me break out.  Great intensive moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product (Skinceuticals Emollience) for 5-6 years now. It&#x27;s hard to find in salons and when you do find it you end up being pressured into unnecessary spa treatments (botox, $700 extractions, etc). I like purchasing it through Amazon.com where it is not only cheaper than if you purchase in a spa, but free shipping if you are a Prime member. Great product, great seller! Thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> Great product. Excellent service.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product after having a microderm treatment at the Bend Derma Spa. I was told that my skin was dry. I could feel that it was dry where I was getting smile lines but I was still getting acne. I had been using Proactiv which even dried the dry areas out more.    But after a few weeks of using Emollience Rich my skin was clearing up. Ah - because there are so many great antibacterial oils in here and it was soothing and moisturizing.     I&#x27;ve just run really low and won&#x27;t be driving the distance to Bend and have decided to order online because I can&#x27;t imagine going without this product on any day.    And if you have any questions about using oil on oily skin remember your science class - oil breaks up oil, water and oil separate. Having the oils in this product keep the skin happy and the face washes so much cleaner without irritation.</li>
            <li> It is alright-it does have a lot of emollients in it. I do not see a difference in my skin texture though. Maybe I was just hoping.</li>
            <li> Exactly the correct product and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing for my normal skin. I use it day and night. I&#x27;m happy with the product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this originally for $80 at a spa in Arizona because my oily, slightly acne prone skin was about to fall off it was so dry in the desert, and I had access to nothing else.  It provided immediate relief to my skin and smells amazing.  I continue to use it now everyday even though I&#x27;m back in the humid south because I swear it moisturizes so well it actually makes my skin less oily throughout the day.  I have never bought a high end moisturizer before as I usually save my money for treatment serums but it is worth the money and just bought my second jar.  I wish there was a day version with sunscreen in it but this product is truly high end.</li>
            <li> Such a great product for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over two years now.  It&#x27;s kind of expensive for face lotion, but it&#x27;s worth it.  And a small jar of it can last a long time.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years. It has a light, clean feel; isn&#x27;t oily or drying. I use it for evening moisturizer. Try a sample.</li>
            <li> I think this is a very good line of cosmetics! They do the job.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It smells great and with my dry skin it works wonders. Plus, it is alot less expensive than if you bought on Skin Ceuticals website.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it you wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for dry skin and low humidity areas.  Keeps my skin really moist.  I use this as a night moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Always a great product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years, love it!</li>
            <li> Not worth the price, IMHO same quality than a drug store $15 cream.</li>
            <li> Once in a great while I don&#x27;t like a Skinceuticals product, but this emollient face cream is great. Just as the label says, it is rich but absorbs quickly and really makes my skin feel replenished. I live in high dry Colorado and this helps my skin a lot. I use it day and night when I want to boost moisture.</li>
            <li> Loving this moisturizer!  I have dry skin and this has been perfect to get me though this winter.  highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love skinceuticals products. First time that I buy them online. I was skeptical at first, but don&#x27;t have any complaints after I gave it a try. Products arrived before time and the price is cheaper than the one I buy at the Doctor&#x27;s office. I would recommend anybody to try these products as well as online shopping.</li>
            <li> This is a nioe moisturizer, feels rich but not heavy on the skin. I am not sure its worth $50 though, I bought it twice and since switched to Caudelie moisturizer - same price, more hydration!</li>
            <li> Great price, great product! Absorbs quickly. Amazon also shipped it to me fast…I like that!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer ! Best ever</li>
            <li> Bought it from different suppliers twice from Amazon, many places simply do not carry it. Like Sephora, for example.&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves it, and we have tried a lot of different staff, to this point nothing can even come close to this one. The best  part of this emollience cream, that it does not clog pores.</li>
            <li> This jar was really runny, like it was cut with a lot more water.  won&#x27;t be buying again.  All the other times it was a thicker cream</li>
            <li> Light and clean under or over makeup doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Would recommend for day use.have used this for years was recommended by cosmetician.</li>
            <li> The one star is for the packaging not the product since I haven&#x27;t tried the emollient, which I really wanted. When it arrived, the packaging box, around the jar, was badly damaged and the jar was open and the moisturizer looked used.  I have heard great things about the moisturizer so I look forward to trying it in the future.</li>
            <li> Only product that has ever hydrated my skin without making it greasy and breakout!! My favorite skincare product and I have tried everything!</li>
            <li> this stuff is so totally great. it hydrtaes my skin and never feels greasy or too heavy. i love it!</li>
            <li> Perfect product, just original package damage as advertised. Skinceuticals Emollience Rich, Restorative Moisturizer For Normal Or Dry Skin, 2-Ounce Jar</li>
            <li> this is a great day/night cream. makeup goes on nice just make sure to blend it into your skin. so many people don&#x27;t know to do this. message it into your skin for best results like in a spa.</li>
            <li> Jar fell and broke before I could have a chance to use it over a period of time.</li>
            <li> This jar directly from England seems to be a little thicker and not quite so easy to spread on skin as others in the past.</li>
            <li> Finally a light moisturizer that will hold up during the day! Works very well to moisturize my skin. I will reorder! SkinCeuticals is a fantastic lineup of effective products!</li>
            <li> Made my skin very soft but after about a week it caused me to break out badly. I talked to someone at Blue Mercury about this product and they informed me that it&#x27;s loaded with Parabens, which has always caused problems for me in the past. I expected better from Skinceuticals! I love their serums but their creams and cleansers need to get with the times!</li>
            <li> Nice weight, works well, especially in the warmer weather.  It is not a miracle, alas, but i do like it.</li>
            <li> I have used Skinceutical products in the past and have been happy with them.  It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t like this product, I just think it&#x27;s a bit misleading.  I have dry skin in the winter and found that I needed something a little heavier than my normal face cream.  I chose Skinceuticals because I&#x27;ve had good luck with them in the past.  But this product really isn&#x27;t for dry skin at all. This cream is probably better suited to someone with normal skin.  I did not feel that this product made any difference on my dry skin and I will probably save it for spring or summer.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing...good price</li>
            <li> Fantastic face cream for this 50 year old who uses both Retin A and Vit. C on her face every day.</li>
            <li> and now I have a white head on my upper lip. My skin is normal to dry.  I love Skinceuticals products, but this is the first product I would never order again. My face looks shiny.  The scent and texture is fine. I haven&#x27;t had a pimple in years.&lt;br /&gt;Do not use if you have oily skin...</li>
            <li> This skin line caused a terrible reaction which included welts on my face and chest area for 2 days.  When I approached the company  about this situation they refused a refund. I finally received my refund a couple of months later but not by them. This product may work for you or not but the fact that they would not provide a refund especially when their product caused such a severe reaction, as a consumer I would be very concerned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a thicker but not greasy moisturizer and I finally found one that I love.  I&#x27;ve tried all of the big brands and med spa brands.  This is a winner.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a week, but so far it works well.  Just use at bedtime because it does not work well under makeup.  Just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a richer cream and if you are oilier, you may not like it.  I&#x27;m sensitive and combo skin.  It works great for me. I use it both summer and winter.  It has really made a difference in my skin texture. I will never use anything else. I&#x27;m hooked.  I wished I had discovered it years ago.  The only negative is that with any &amp;#34;jar&amp;#34; cream, once opened and continued opening, the ingredients lose their efficacy over time.  Pumps are much better at keeping ingredients fresh.  Nevertheless, I still use it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I actually have combo. skin and recently noticed that my forehead and cheeks where getting dry (maybe the winter coming??) This product was recommended to me by my medical spa. I was surprised since it&#x27;s for \\&quot;reg to dry skin\\&quot; and I have a very oily nose and chin, but it&#x27;s so light that it doesn&#x27;t negatively effect those areas. I noticed the difference RIGHT away. My dry forehead and cheeks were smooth and hydrated and I didn&#x27;t have to keep applying it all day (once in the morning, once at night.) I love this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad moisturizer. it just didn&#x27;t blow my mind, either. The b5 serum from skin cosmetics works better to moisturize my skin and at half the price.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product on recommendation and was pleasantly surprised at the lightness of the moisturizer on my skin.  It provides a soft non greasy feel but does the job of moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li> I just started using this cream, it is half the cost of what I had been using, decided to give it a try.  I love the way it feels and looks on my skin, I am pleased with the results so far.  I use Skinceutical&#x27;s C E Ferulic  under the moisture, have used this product for several years and decided to try the moisturizer cream.  I would recommend using both, don&#x27;t think you can go wrong, at age 72 I get many comments from people on how young I look for my age, it pays to use good products that protect &amp; enrich.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth your face feels soft,it goes on nicely. This product stays on for a long time. I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> i like this moisturizer, my skin like it too, i have a dry sensitive skin, and live in a hot dusty climate , this moisturizer is easy to be absorbed and its perfume free , I am new to this brand , i got introduce to it after i did the assessment in The Skin Type Solution by Leslie Bauman , it is an amaaaaaazing book</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.  I would recommend to anyone, however, I don&#x27;t know how it works with anyone struggling with acne.  I use morning and night. It is light and not heavily scented.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, did not work for my skin, made it seem tight and drier.</li>
            <li> I have just been using this product for 4 days and am already noticing a difference in my skin. I have used Perriconse Skin Finishing Moisturizer which is good but I was looking for better results on my fine lines. In comparison, my skin is responding much better to Skinceuticals over Perricone. I had red irritated patches on my cheeks (due to a harsh exfoliant) when I purchased this and this product has really calmed it down improving fine lines and overall appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I used the mild cleanser in conjunction and it has been superb!.</li>
            <li> Have been using this brand and this particular product for a few years now and have always appreciated this product. For my skin, I need I need more moisture and with his product I need to apply a couple times a day but have not found a suitable replacement and continue to use. I would recommend this brand to anyone with aging skin looking for a high quality product and this particular moisturizer is light after absorption.</li>
            <li> The product seems inferior.  I use this product on a regular basis and the Emollience arrived very runny.  Usually the product is thicker and more like a cream.</li>
            <li> Great product, not packaged well.  It leaks when you travel; and yes, the lid was on tight.</li>
            <li> no to impressed with product.</li>
            <li> Seemed to be the same as the dermatologist version but for a lower cost.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, consistency, and how it absorbs.  This is my 2nd time buying it....even though I normally don&#x27;t want to spend this amount of $</li>
            <li> I love Skinceuticals Emollience. Makes my skin soft and smooth. Skinceuticals products are amazing! Thank you and will purchase again!</li>
            <li> A light moisturizer good for day use. Soaks in quickly which is great for mornings. I prefer a richer cream for night time use. A good product and value.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for daytime.</li>
            <li> Feels like a layer of silk on your skin!  Best moisturizer for dry skin on the market it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Non-greasy, absorbs fast, truly moisturizes, can be applied under makeup, great for all seasons, non-irritating, and no fragrance added.  I bought this for my Mom too and she also loves it.</li>
            <li> I first became acquainted with this product when I had a facial at a spa.  I bought a couple items that day and used them regularly.  My skin condition is under control and I my dermatologist was very happy with how the skin on my face looked.  I will continue to use this brand, though the price is painful.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and as a result I want to try other Skinceuticals products.  It really has kept my skin from drying this winter.</li>
            <li> Good products with reasonable price. It is as good as products with big name which are more expensive then this one</li>
            <li> Good product - goes on easily - is not heavy - keeps my face moist all night.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> First time using this lotion and this brand. Product was not thick and rich as I expected from the name. I was looking for something with heavier moisturizing capabilities. Also was disappointed to read other reviews about all the parabens in this prodouct. Will not buy again and would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream once before a long time ago, I decided to try it again but this one seems a little different...it&#x27;s much thinner almost runny. It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel different from any less expensive face cream and I&#x27;m not noticing any improvement in my skin. I&#x27;ll try something different next time.</li>
            <li> Applies easily and a little goes a long way.  Skin feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> This face moisturizer is wonderful, I apply it each morning after cleansing along with my sunscreen. It stays on all day for a nice soft feel (not greasy). I have very dry skin and this product is working great for me.</li>
            <li> For those of you who care,....for those looking for paraben free products, this is not one. It has 5 different parabens: Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, and Isobutlparaben. Now people may comment back and argue whether parabens are or aren&#x27;t good for you. That&#x27;s really irrelevant, but rather this review is for people who look for paraben free. For those who don&#x27;t care about parabens, then this product is for you, but for those like me who look for paraben free and are concerned about some of the research linking cancers and parabens. I opt for paraben free....so I&#x27;m going to try and send it back if I can ever get the seller to answer me :-) Otherwise I&#x27;ll toss it in the trash I won&#x27;t even try to foist this off on my sister or mother. I was under the allusion all of Skinceuticals were health conscious paraben free. I ordered a few of their other products and their sunblock stated paraben free no unnecessary chemicals.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and non-irritating for my sensitive skin. It was recommended by my dermatologist. It has no odor and is fine alone or under make-up.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell of this.  As a moisturizer it was neither better nor worse than others.  When there are so many good smelling moisturizers out there, I decided I could not finish this.  I only used it for two weeks, and it was expensive but there are going to be some hits, some miss.</li>
            <li> love it in the winter not so much in the summer--makes me to  oily on hot summer days.  recommend emmoliance for fall and winter and something lighter for the summer months</li>
            <li> All of skinceuticals products are wonderful and great.  They are well worth the price over drug store products.  Try them.</li>
            <li> An outstanding moisterizer.</li>
            <li> Great product - leaves my skin soft and hydrated without feely greasy!  I recommend this for anyone with normal or dry skin.</li>
            <li> I received a liquid like \\&quot;cream\\&quot; i have purchased this dry skin skinceauticals cream many of times prior and it has never had this consistency. It was runny almost like a white liquid when the product should be thick. Also had an oil lie layer that floats on top. I would never buy from this particular seller ever Again and i would never recommend buying from them. Your really taking a gamble with this seller. When i contacted them (when i got the chance) months later to report the issue. I was given a rudeish reply to ship it back and they would send me another. Aint nobody got time for thAt. I should have never received a faulty product in the first place! A waste of money!!! Buyer beware here</li>
            <li> I just started using this moisturizer after it was recommended by the woman who gives me facials.  I love the texture - it leaves my skin feeling very soft with even the smallest amount!</li>
            <li> NOTHING to write home about ... Just average. Not at all up to their face serums. Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be for very dry skin, but it was actually a very light lotion not rich at all.  My skin needs more moisture than this at age 60.  I would have worked for me 20 years ago though. So if you are 40 or more this would be good.</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizer for night.</li>
            <li> This cream althought for sencative skin not work for me</li>
            <li> My face is naturally dry and this is a fantastic moisturizer. I have paid much more money for other face creams and this is the best one I have found.</li>
            <li> I liked the product, but found it too expensive for a moisturizer.  I can buy Nivea or Curel or other very emolient creams for less than $10.00 in pharmacys.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizers for dry skin like mine are like water: I need it around the clock, and paying more than 10 bucks will put me in the poor house!</li>
            <li> Although I wear this one mostly at night because it is richer than my daytime moisturizer, it is perfect for the daytime too.  Nice soft fragrance--not off-putting in any way.  I heartily recomment it for anyone whose skin needs a little help with moisture.</li>
            <li> My chemical peel doctor use this product line during my peel and after. He recommend not only this moisturizer but any product by skinceuticals. I must say they work wonders</li>
            <li> veyr nice and good quality and I would re-ordered again after finished the jar.  I would recommend to others.  I received the goods on time as I expected</li>
            <li> This light cream is moisturizing without any oily feeling. I use it day and night and love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cream with nothing on it... pure and simple... Is it the best...no.  Is it the worst...no...  Are there better ones out there... yes... but for the price...no.  Will I get it again...probably not.</li>
            <li> This cream was recommended to me by my aesthetician.  It is terrible- burned my skin!  PLEASE try this before buying it from this site because beauty products are not returnable.  I&#x27;m going to write the company and try to get my money back!  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and feel of these products on my skin. Quickly absorbed. Leaves NO oily residue..just finely moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> A great, creamy moisturizer!  I have over age 50 skin and use this as my daily moisturizer under my makeup.  My skin is already very well cared for, but I noticed an increase in plumpness and fine lines were less noticeable. People do mistake me for much younger like 40, and I am trying to keep that skin - this is a permanent addition to my regime. When people say it doesn&#x27;t matter brand for moisturizers, I say bunk - it does.  I can see differences right away in a few days when something is not of good quality.  This one is, do no hesitate to buy it!</li>
            <li> At age 44, this is just the moisturizer I&#x27;d been looking for.  It&#x27;s dewy and rich but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy. It&#x27;s pricier than some others I e tried, but worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I ahve been using this moisturizer for years. Does not go on thick and aborbs quickly. Skinceuticals is an amazing line.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best night moisturizers I have ever useed.  It is rich and makes my skin feel so good.  Great product to use every single night. Love that is is on Prime too!</li>
