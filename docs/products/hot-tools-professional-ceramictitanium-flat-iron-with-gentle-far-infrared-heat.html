    <ol>
            <li>What a great deal!!  </li>
            <li>The product is very good.</li>
            <li>Product works great.</li>
            <li>This was a great investment.  </li>
            <li>She was extremely pleased, as she had used this product in the salon where she worked, and had been impressed with it.</li>
            <li>and she loved it.</li>
            <li>This straightener is made by a good brand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using is ever since and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice straightener.  </li>
            <li>Works great and works quickly.  </li>
            <li>The temperature is good and the plates are smooth, but it pulls my hair where the plates are attached to the handle/housing.</li>
            <li>and if I did would have to pay alot more money then</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy this iron because I read some reviews that only gave it 1-2 stars, but I am very happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Be sure that you are used to ceramics when you get this.  </li>
            <li>Not the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had, but</li>
            <li>and she says it still gets nice and hot for her.</li>
            <li>but this one is great because it has 4 different heat settings which is great for all different hair types.  </li>
            <li>This device brags that there&#x27;s no space between the plates but that means also that your hair doesn&#x27;t pull through smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, curly hair and it works great!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and gives you different options of how warm you want it.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t tug on your hair as you pull it through.  </li>
            <li>As I paid $20 I really cant complain - but if you are looking for a realy great flat iron, this is not it.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair straight and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This item was working great until just a few days ago.</li>
            <li>I love how it leaves your hair smooth and shiny and my hair is frizzy and coarse.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and overall was very pleased.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, and packaging was adequate.  </li>
            <li>It gets really hot</li>
            <li>I tried this straightening iron at a friend&#x27;s house and could not believe how straight my hair could be!  </li>
            <li>i had the 1.5\\&quot; model with the rounded edges and all, and the purple coating chipped off on the first use, but i&#x27;ve never had any problems with this.</li>
            <li>My product arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>One of the two ceramic plates won&#x27;t get hot anymore.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this Flat Iron and can&#x27;t possibly live without it!!!</li>
            <li>My first one last several years, and this one is just as good</li>
            <li>I LOVE this flat iron, it straightens my hair easily and quickly, with this iron i can get my long thick curly frizzy hair to be straight and smooth and amazing.</li>
            <li>It also gets really hot (if you want it to), so it straightens really well.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it works really well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this iron!</li>
            <li>and I really like this one.  </li>
            <li>I like my old flat iron with the old metal plates much better.  </li>
            <li>I have checked prices on this particular iron at shops .. and was quoted $55-$65.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have been thru 6 different flat irons we love this one.  </li>
            <li>It is, so far, my favorite flat iron, however, it always breaks the same way!</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t say that I love it like I have past straighteners...</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd straightener exactly like this.  </li>
            <li>Was a gift for my wife when her old one broke.  </li>
            <li>It worked well, but the handle cracked near the change shortly after it was out of warranty.</li>
            <li>Professional in name only the Hot Tools 1177 died after 6 months of very little use (2 or 3 times a week on one person only).</li>
            <li>Everything else is to par, but it is frustrating to always have to repurchase, especially every other hair tool I own (curling iron, blow dryer, etc.)</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and straightens in half the time it took me with other straighteners.</li>

            <li> This flat iron works so well that I bought a second one for my travel bag.  </li>
            <li> When my Flat Iron which is the same as this one died after six years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different types of flat irons</li>
            <li> Could not find a 2 inch flat iron in the stores anymore  </li>
            <li> My daughter has long wavy hair and now its pin staight</li>
            <li> Was looking for a wide flat iron.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter who has curly and dry hair</li>
            <li> so be careful not to leave it on any surface that could burn.  </li>
            <li> Be careful to remember to turn it off though when you are done.  </li>
            <li> I bought this iron because I needed a high heat iron for my tough to straighten hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other straighteners</li>
            <li> That is typical of all irons,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a little awkward to use due to the unusual curve on the handle.</li>
            <li> Save your money and get something that you won&#x27;t have to replace in a few months.</li>
            <li> she uses ith everyday.  </li>
            <li> I only just bought it in December, 2005, and already it is broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to repurchase this iron about 6x in the past years.</li>
            <li> at least ones I&#x27;ve tried....</li>
            <li> This is the second item from this brand I&#x27;ve had bad luck with.</li>
            <li> Not too badly caught, just have to be careful pulling it out.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the tool...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that expensive for what you get.  </li>
            <li> Not as expensive as some of the pro models.  </li>

            <li> This is a really nice straightener.  It gets really hot so be careful not to leave it on any surface that could burn.  Because it&#x27;s a pro style, it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic shut off either.  Otherwise, it works really well.</li>
            <li> The temperature is good and the plates are smooth, but it pulls my hair where the plates are attached to the handle/housing. It&#x27;s also a little awkward to use due to the unusual curve on the handle.</li>
            <li> What a great deal!!  I have checked prices on this particular iron at shops .. and was quoted $55-$65. I love how it leaves your hair smooth and shiny and my hair is frizzy and coarse.  A must have!</li>

            <li> My daughter and I have been thru 6 different flat irons we love this one.  I have curly and frizzy hair now its sleek and staight!  My daughter has long wavy hair and now its pin staight she uses ith everyday.  Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this straightening iron at a friend&#x27;s house and could not believe how straight my hair could be!  I&#x27;ve tried other straighteners but this one is great because it has 4 different heat settings which is great for all different hair types.  It heats up quickly and straightens in half the time it took me with other straighteners.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this iron because I read some reviews that only gave it 1-2 stars, but I am very happy with my purchase.  This straightener is made by a good brand.  It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t tug on your hair as you pull it through.  It leaves hair straight and smooth.  I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my wife when her old one broke.  This has been used daily for years now and she says it still gets nice and hot for her. No complaints here.</li>
            <li> Be sure that you are used to ceramics when you get this.  I like my old flat iron with the old metal plates much better.  This device brags that there&#x27;s no space between the plates but that means also that your hair doesn&#x27;t pull through smoothly.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the tool...I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Not the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had, but it does get the job done.  Shipping was fast, and packaging was adequate.  I just can&#x27;t say that I love it like I have past straighteners...</li>
            <li> I LOVE this flat iron, it straightens my hair easily and quickly, with this iron i can get my long thick curly frizzy hair to be straight and smooth and amazing. i had the 1.5\\&quot; model with the rounded edges and all, and the purple coating chipped off on the first use, but i&#x27;ve never had any problems with this. i definatly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This item was working great until just a few days ago. I only just bought it in December, 2005, and already it is broken. One of the sides no longer heats up! This is the second item from this brand I&#x27;ve had bad luck with.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works so well that I bought a second one for my travel bag.  No problems with purchase. Received in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I bought this iron because I needed a high heat iron for my tough to straighten hair. I have thick, curly hair and it works great! The only downfall I can think of is sometimes a strand of hair may get caught in between the iron plates and the side of the iron. Not too badly caught, just have to be careful pulling it out. That is typical of all irons, at least ones I&#x27;ve tried....I highly recommend this iron!</li>
            <li> When my Flat Iron which is the same as this one died after six years.  I knew I had to get the same one again!  I LOVE this Flat Iron and can&#x27;t possibly live without it!!!</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd straightener exactly like this.  My first one last several years, and this one is just as good</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my daughter, a former beautician. She was extremely pleased, as she had used this product in the salon where she worked, and had been impressed with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different types of flat irons and I really like this one.  It&#x27;s not that expensive for what you get.  It also gets really hot (if you want it to), so it straightens really well.  I recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> As I paid $20 I really cant complain - but if you are looking for a realy great flat iron, this is not it.</li>
            <li> My product arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as promised.  I&#x27;ve been using is ever since and am very pleased.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a wide flat iron. This was a great investment.  Not as expensive as some of the pro models.  Works great and works quickly.  Be careful to remember to turn it off though when you are done.  I just melted my boyfriend&#x27;s bathroom scale when I forgot it on there.  Oh well.  Who needs a scale anyway!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to repurchase this iron about 6x in the past years. It is, so far, my favorite flat iron, however, it always breaks the same way! One of the two ceramic plates won&#x27;t get hot anymore. There is something faulty in the manufacturing of this. Everything else is to par, but it is frustrating to always have to repurchase, especially every other hair tool I own (curling iron, blow dryer, etc.) outlives this one every time.</li>
