    <ol>

            <li>It is the best electric toothbrush  </li>
            <li>This tooth brush does an excellent job</li>
            <li>best toothbrush I have used.  </li>
            <li>Excellent toothbrush !</li>
            <li>Very good brush</li>
            <li>It is truly the best gum &amp; tooth health device on the market - use it as directed --My order was completed on time packaged great.</li>
            <li>I experience no fuzzy feeling on my teeth when I wake up in the morning, which I experienced with my manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare toothe brush is great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The website has a lot of info, but the book is also great.</li>
            <li>but now I love this brush!!</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is a good deal.</li>
            <li>hopefully a good investment in my health.  </li>
            <li>The 3 intensity settings are good.  </li>
            <li>I did not try the training mode, but it may be good too.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>So I also purchased one and have been very pleased with the way my teeth feel after brushing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>The travel case is a nice bonus, too.  </li>
            <li>but I really like this product and am very happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>kind of like a dentist drill</li>
            <li>and it gets between teeth and gums very easy</li>
            <li>So far this toothbrush is working out perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I liked the snap-on brush heads for the Flexcare  brushes, as well as the slimmer, more elegant handle.  </li>
            <li>it was much better .  </li>
            <li>I have owned Oral-B brushes for more than a decade.  </li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Yes, I love this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>Meh... This was OK....</li>
            <li>Just better quality.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>we love our Sonicare, ordered it for our vacation home because we &amp;#34;missed&amp;#34; having it when we were there.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s top setting.  </li>
            <li>I love this Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Love this style of brush holder over the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; style ...</li>
            <li>Again if you&#x27;re teeth are pretty good</li>
            <li>If your teeth are overall in good shape it will be a good buy...</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands and I love this one the best.  </li>
            <li>Thought my old tooth brush did a great job.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, a couple months in, I&#x27;m happy with the Gum Health toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Brushes and cleans fairly well, but it is very noisy.</li>
            <li>Works great for me and like the timer to be sure all the teeth are brushed.</li>
            <li>this should be fine</li>
            <li>The 30-second tone that alerts you to move the brush to the next quadrant of your mouth is also great.  </li>
            <li>Vibrates mightily, but lighter touch...</li>
            <li>This brush is more competitively priced than most of the other brushes I was considering, and with some Amazon points and a coupon, I got an amazing deal--very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I wish the brush heads were more reasonably priced, but other than that, this is the perfect toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Very pleased so far!</li>
            <li>I love it when a product does exactly what it advertises.</li>
            <li>but after my first use, I love it.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean.  </li>
            <li>teeth are really clean, but your gums are paying the price&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>hx9332/05 diamond clean</li>
            <li>My teeth, gums, and mouth feel completely clean after every use.</li>
            <li>The new HX is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>However, it is very loud...considered returning it, but not convinced anything better out there.  </li>
            <li>While the Flexcare is a nice model and does a great job cleaning, I think it is too expensive and includes features I never used (and would bet most people don&#x27;t use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity and durability of this product, as I&#x27;ve only been using it several days, but as for what it does - excellent.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare 3 performs very well and much better than an older model.</li>
            <li>After having an old braun rechargeable for many many years I finally gave in and bought this.</li>
            <li>Battery life is great have only had to charge once after 2 months of daily brushing.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a simple no-fuss Sonicare, you may want to stick with the Easy Clean until the newer 2/3 Series brushes get the kinks worked out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first electric brush, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  </li>
            <li>more like a total of 1:30...</li>
            <li>the Flexcare died (after 3 years and 4 months of use), I decided to go with the most basic Sonicare toothbrush that had the quadpacer and the snap-on brush head (the features I found helpful).</li>
            <li>I have had worsening periodontal pockets for years, and my dentist&#x27;s feedback has consistently been &amp;#34;your</li>
            <li>First electrical toothbrush that I have ever purchased and/or owned.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with Sonicare, so</li>
            <li>so I decided to go with a more basic Sonicare this time around.</li>
            <li>The prolonged battery life is a real plus!</li>
            <li>My first electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as sleek as the Flexcare (see photo with Gum Health on left and Flexcare on right), but given that I never used the advanced features of the Flexcare</li>
            <li>Vibrates much more loudly than other Sonicare handles we&#x27;ve had, while also not vibrating as strongly at</li>
            <li>At first, it seems way too fast</li>
            <li>At first, the max setting was a bit too intense.  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this brand, and my teeth really do feel more clean and it is better for my gums as I was brushing too hard with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This Sonicare brush is a COMPLETELY different experience than my previous brushes - so gentle on my gums, and yet I can tell it&#x27;s very effective as well.  </li>
            <li>If you keep your mouth closed (mostly) while brushing, I promise you will not have toothpaste spraying everywhere.  </li>
            <li>It works as well as those that cost twice as much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i don&#x27;t understand why anyone wants or needs the noises/beeping, i guess it&#x27;s a fad.</li>
            <li>Sonicare toothbrushes work very well.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m much happier to pay for this vs paying for gum grafting surgery, so</li>
            <li>Only thing that I wonder about is WHEN will the third light, light up.</li>
            <li>The quadrant signal is very helpful.  </li>
            <li>The fact that the brush automatically turns off after 2 minutes is very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I can really feel the difference.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I charged it full when I first received it and haven&#x27;t had to recharge it in the last 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and use the low setting which seems to be more gentle than the sensitive setting on the DiamondClean.</li>
            <li>Your gums are supposed to be at 2-3mm pockets to be considered healthy, and getting these pockets reduced is key to me not needing a gum flap procedure (who wants their gums sliced open??).</li>
            <li>and i suspect Sonicare will eventually phase out the older &amp;#34;e&amp;#34; heads.</li>
            <li>Here are my main points about why I like the Sonicare 3 series.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It does have a high pitched feeling to it....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried out the fancy Sonicare with all the bells and whistles, and it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference as far as I am concerned...</li>
            <li>I have some history using different models and think the Gum Health  model is the right balance of features and cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The brush holds a charge for a super long time--I travel for work and have not had to bring the charger.  </li>
            <li>First impressions are not the same as owning something for a year or two.  </li>
            <li>It is such a brief pause - more like just a momentary pulse vs a total shut-off that interrupts brushing.  </li>
            <li>That may not seem like a big reduction, but it really is!</li>
            <li>little more functionality than the basic brush, and</li>
            <li>Really like the 30 second reminder and the automatic off at 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>, my old braun had that too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this for a few weeks, but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Two minutes does not seem like a long time, but actually thoroughly brushing by hand for a full two minutes can get tiring and</li>
            <li>But I much prefer the more expensive model....</li>
            <li>There are only three setting: low, medium, and high.</li>
            <li>I am 79 years old and looking forward to my next reorder.</li>
            <li>I’m not sure, but you might not get the full 31K vibrations on the lower settings.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I am anxious to see if I made the right choice.</li>
            <li>in spite of its ridiculous pausing and beeping every 30 seconds, (many dentists recommend brushing for 3 minutes) and in spite of the brush rattling, i&#x27;ve almost gotten used to the noises and because other upper-end brushes also beep and pause, i&#x27;ll be keeping this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>much noisier than my previous (and more expensive)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was led to this by my daughter.  After a dental appointment I was told I had some gum problems .  So my daughter had the same problem and after purchasing a skincare toothbrush it was much better .  So I also purchased one and have been very pleased with the way my teeth feel after brushing.  I also like the timer which shuts the toothbrush off after allotted time.  My next dental appointment isn&#x27;t for 2 months so I am anxious to see if I made the right choice.</li>
            <li> So far this toothbrush is working out perfectly.  It&#x27;s my first electric brush, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  After reading reviews I was worried about the noise and the mess this brush might create, neither of which is an issue at all.  If you keep your mouth closed (mostly) while brushing, I promise you will not have toothpaste spraying everywhere.  The brush holds a charge for a super long time--I travel for work and have not had to bring the charger.  I think I am on my 10th day w/o charging it currently.  The travel case is a nice bonus, too.  The 30-second tone that alerts you to move the brush to the next quadrant of your mouth is also great.  This brush is more competitively priced than most of the other brushes I was considering, and with some Amazon points and a coupon, I got an amazing deal--very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I love it when a product does exactly what it advertises.</li>
            <li> There were no batteries in the pkg.and on further review decided on the Sonicare HX6581/50.</li>
            <li> Instructions poorly done</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a good deal. It works as well as those that cost twice as much. It has a very small brush that I like because my mouth is small.</li>
            <li> Very good brush and it gets between teeth and gums very easy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a week so keep this in mind.  First impressions are not the same as owning something for a year or two.  I have owned Oral-B brushes for more than a decade.  Thought my old tooth brush did a great job.  The Sonicare brush is quiet and moves at a crazy fast speed.  At first, it seems way too fast but after my first use, I love it.  My teeth feel really clean.  I need to get used to the small brush but I really like this product and am very happy with this purchase.  Also like that the re-charge stand is so small.</li>
            <li> in spite of its ridiculous pausing and beeping every 30 seconds, (many dentists recommend brushing for 3 minutes) and in spite of the brush rattling, i&#x27;ve almost gotten used to the noises and because other upper-end brushes also beep and pause, i&#x27;ll be keeping this one.&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t understand why anyone wants or needs the noises/beeping, i guess it&#x27;s a fad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a few weeks, but I absolutely love it. I feel as though I&#x27;ve just come from the dentist office from a teeth cleaning. I experience no fuzzy feeling on my teeth when I wake up in the morning, which I experienced with my manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Did not know if I would get used to the vibration but now I love this brush!! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly disappointing fit and finish. The unit&#x27;s plastic white casing arrived with two embedded, indelible black marks in or on it. Oddly, one appears to be a partial finger print.</li>
            <li> It replaces my Sonicare Elite.  Battery would no longer charge, got tired of cleaning under the brush head.  Yuck.  The new HX is very easy to clean.  However, it is very loud...considered returning it, but not convinced anything better out there.  Quadrapacer feature says two minutes...more like a total of 1:30...so need to turn it on for another period of time...no big deal, I guess.  Vibrates mightily, but lighter touch...not sure it cleans as well as the Elite.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush. My dentist recommended this brand, and my teeth really do feel more clean and it is better for my gums as I was brushing too hard with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Painful, no where near the original.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd Sonicare I have had in the past 15+ Years-- It is truly the best gum &amp; tooth health device on the market - use it as directed --My order was completed on time packaged great. If necessary, in the next 10-15 years I will reorder. I am 79 years old and looking forward to my next reorder.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner after just a few weeks of using this.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare toothe brush is great.  It is the best electric toothbrush  I  have had.  No wonder it is recommended by dentist.</li>
            <li> Sonicare toothbrushes work very well. My teeth feel cleaner than they ever have with a traditional toothbrush. I have some history using different models and think the Gum Health  model is the right balance of features and cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had used the basic Elite series for a while, but the screw-in brushes got gross and smelly, so when the toothbrush died, I got the Flexcare. I liked the snap-on brush heads for the Flexcare  brushes, as well as the slimmer, more elegant handle.  While the Flexcare is a nice model and does a great job cleaning, I think it is too expensive and includes features I never used (and would bet most people don&#x27;t use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Flexcare died (after 3 years and 4 months of use), I decided to go with the most basic Sonicare toothbrush that had the quadpacer and the snap-on brush head (the features I found helpful). At the time of this review, that ends up being the Gum Health Sonicare, which is $80 vs. the Flexcare at $130.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, a couple months in, I&#x27;m happy with the Gum Health toothbrush. It&#x27;s not quite as sleek as the Flexcare (see photo with Gum Health on left and Flexcare on right), but given that I never used the advanced features of the Flexcare, I feel like I&#x27;ve made a smarter purchase this time around (assuming it lasts for a few years).</li>
            <li> Yes, I love this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;A little more functionality than the basic brush, and I think it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;ve tried out the fancy Sonicare with all the bells and whistles, and it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference as far as I am concerned...save some money (actually, a lot) and just get this one, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to believe how badly I was tearing up my gums with products like Oral B and Spinbrush battery-powered toothbrushes until I finally broke down and shelled out the $ for this product.  I have had worsening periodontal pockets for years, and my dentist&#x27;s feedback has consistently been &amp;#34;your teeth are really clean, but your gums are paying the price&amp;#34;.  This Sonicare brush is a COMPLETELY different experience than my previous brushes - so gentle on my gums, and yet I can tell it&#x27;s very effective as well.  I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity and durability of this product, as I&#x27;ve only been using it several days, but as for what it does - excellent.  And I&#x27;m much happier to pay for this vs paying for gum grafting surgery, so hopefully a good investment in my health.  Also I don&#x27;t find the quadpacer thing annoying at all, as some other reviewers have mentioned.  It is such a brief pause - more like just a momentary pulse vs a total shut-off that interrupts brushing.  Very pleased so far!</li>
            <li> Meh... This was OK.... If your teeth are overall in good shape it will be a good buy... But I much prefer the more expensive model.... (The one that charges in a glass cup . ) I bought this as a second emergency brush but after having had the other one this just fell short.  I even used the same brush so it must be something with the power and how it moves... Just better quality. Again if you&#x27;re teeth are pretty good this should be fine otherwise I would recommend the other model** as it truly is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**sonicare hx9332/05 diamond clean</li>
            <li> First electrical toothbrush that I have ever purchased and/or owned. I am pleased with it. Only thing that I wonder about is WHEN will the third light, light up. The 2-minute timer should be about 1 minute longer.</li>
            <li> we love our Sonicare, ordered it for our vacation home because we &amp;#34;missed&amp;#34; having it when we were there.</li>
            <li> Amazing. My mouth feels cleaner!</li>
            <li> much noisier than my previous (and more expensive) Sonicare&lt;br /&gt;on-off button is already acting upredictably</li>
            <li> This tooth brush does an excellent job</li>
            <li> it performs well.  i like the three power levels.  i had been using for past 20 years the &amp;#34;e-series&amp;#34; of heads and was not sure i would like the newer, smaller profile heads.  i do and i suspect Sonicare will eventually phase out the older &amp;#34;e&amp;#34; heads.</li>
            <li> best toothbrush I have used.  I have tried other brands and I love this one the best.  Really like the 30 second reminder and the automatic off at 2 minutes.  Battery life is great have only had to charge once after 2 months of daily brushing.</li>
            <li> Here are my main points about why I like the Sonicare 3 series.  I’ve been using this brush for about a month now.  This is my first experience with Sonicare, so I don’t have any comparisons with other models.  This is a great brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The 3 intensity settings are good.  I used them until I got used to max intensity.  At first, the max setting was a bit too intense.  I’m not sure, but you might not get the full 31K vibrations on the lower settings.&lt;br /&gt;- I did not try the training mode, but it may be good too.&lt;br /&gt;- The quadrant signal is very helpful.  It’s harder to do with manual brush and a clock or timer.&lt;br /&gt;- The fact that the brush automatically turns off after 2 minutes is very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;- The brush does all the work.  Two minutes does not seem like a long time, but actually thoroughly brushing by hand for a full two minutes can get tiring and boring.&lt;br /&gt;- I can really feel the difference.&lt;br /&gt;- The brush does seem to hold a charge for a few weeks – and I’m trying to use it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;- On a related note: I also use the Dr. Ellie system, which involves rinses, brush cleaning, and xylitol.  If you want to check it out: drellie.com.  The website has a lot of info, but the book is also great.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush ! Re</li>
            <li> Vibrates much more loudly than other Sonicare handles we&#x27;ve had, while also not vibrating as strongly at it&#x27;s top setting.  Most annoying is the combo button that adjusts the speed as well as turning it on and off; leading to times when you mean to turn it off, but then need to wait longer before you can turn it off, and then also need change the speed again at some point.  If you&#x27;re looking for a simple no-fuss Sonicare, you may want to stick with the Easy Clean until the newer 2/3 Series brushes get the kinks worked out.</li>
            <li> After having an old braun rechargeable for many many years I finally gave in and bought this. I charged it full when I first received it and haven&#x27;t had to recharge it in the last 2 weeks. I like the quadrant timer, my old braun had that too. It does have a high pitched feeling to it....kind of like a dentist drill but I&#x27;m already getting used to that. It&#x27;s probably that it has a lot of power. I would buy again!!</li>
            <li> Brushes and cleans fairly well, but it is very noisy.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare toothbrush. My last one was the DiamondClean and I was disappointed it only lasted 2 years and three months (just out of warranty). I felt like I paid for all it&#x27;s &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; and not much substance so I decided to go with a more basic Sonicare this time around. There are only three setting: low, medium, and high. I have sensitive teeth and use the low setting which seems to be more gentle than the sensitive setting on the DiamondClean. It gets the job done simply, which is what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Toothbrush head WITH the plastic cover on it fits into travel case&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Gentle&lt;br /&gt;Less expensive Sonicare choice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Louder than my last Sonicare. (This is the biggest problem with the brush for me)&lt;br /&gt;The brush head that comes with the device is on the small side but there are other head models that are compatible</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in big need of gum repair (Gum pockets at 6+ mm), and my dentist recommended the Sonicare. I picked this up along with some intercare brush heads and in the span of about three months I reduced my pockets by 1mm. Also picked up a waterpik, which combined with everything else, should have my at 4mm pockets going into my next cleaning in August. That may not seem like a big reduction, but it really is! Your gums are supposed to be at 2-3mm pockets to be considered healthy, and getting these pockets reduced is key to me not needing a gum flap procedure (who wants their gums sliced open??). I love this Sonicare. My teeth, gums, and mouth feel completely clean after every use. I wish the brush heads were more reasonably priced, but other than that, this is the perfect toothbrush. I&#x27;ll never buy another brand again.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare 3 performs very well and much better than an older model. The prolonged battery life is a real plus!</li>
            <li> Love this style of brush holder over the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; style ... less chance of mold build up (a little bleach worked well for me!)</li>
            <li> Works great for me and like the timer to be sure all the teeth are brushed.</li>
            <li> My first electric tooth brush. I like it. It has a 2 minute timer, as well as different speeds... It doesn&#x27;t take up any space on the counter. Ultimately my teeth feel cleaner.</li>
