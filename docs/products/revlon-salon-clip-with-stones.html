            <li>Lovely!</li>
            <li>Beautiful, great price, &amp; fast shipping</li>
            <li>I have another clip that curves and that&#x27;s a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a prettier one to use for nights out, and this one is nice, but it slips out after a while.</li>
            <li>IT IS BEAUTIFUL BUT VERY, VERY LARGE.</li>

            <li>Nice alligator clip - better quality</li>

            <li>Will keep this link so I can order more, should I ever lose these.</li>
            <li>I love this thing and wish it came in more colors.</li>
            <li>Just like me :-)</li>
            <li>I once had that looked similar and did a wonderful job of holding hair in place.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than nothing, but leaves me still in search of a better gripping clip.</li>
            <li>Looks better in your hair than it does in the picture.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my Grand Daughter.  </li>
            <li>Excellent, solid clip.  </li>
            <li>.Would buy more colors if they were offered</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make it more perfect is if it had a more curved shape to fit the shape of one&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>This clip stays in place comfortably but securely and works with so many fashion styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well made!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really pretty, and arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure she will enjoy this lovely hair clip.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much</li>
            <li>I love this clip, worth the money!</li>
            <li>Received very quickly.</li>
            <li>Pretty nice hair clip.</li>
            <li>Probably fine for thicker hair.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty!</li>
            <li>Worked fabulously for a formal event.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t rip or tear hair, smooth clamp.</li>
            <li>Price OK, but it was more reasonable in the retail store.</li>
            <li>This has a super strong grip.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better to buy this kind of things with actual pictures on hair.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and packaged securely.</li>
            <li>It looks gorgeous on the hair, I definitely will recommend it</li>
            <li>The item is veeery cute, but it doesn&#x27;t hold much hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;FYI, don&#x27;t leave it in the shower/around water, as it will rust pretty easily</li>
            <li>Very nice as expected!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty</li>
            <li>It is very pretty and has a sense of an antique style and look about it.  </li>
            <li>Works well, holds my very fine hair up tight and looks nice.</li>
            <li>Quality metal, pretty looking and well crafted!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough to hold my hair up, and that&#x27;s refreshing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very noticeable while the clip is in, I&#x27;m sure, but when you pay good money for a new product, you hope it comes with all its pieces.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a high quality clip like this for my fine hair for years.</li>
            <li>However, coming in at almost 5&amp;#34; long, it&#x27;s surprising it won&#x27;t hold much hair.</li>
            <li>This clip is very pretty looking, but does not grip my hair very well.</li>
            <li>The lovely stones give it a pretty nice and delicate touch</li>
            <li>Like them very much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I got two for future use at a price of just under 9 dollars for two here.</li>
            <li>looks exactly as on the picture, arrives in time.</li>
            <li>That can be a fine balance with my hair; not too light, not too tight, just right!  </li>
            <li>All the while it&#x27;s an attractive looking design and the rhinestones are subtle.</li>
            <li>It is pretty and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty and classy clip.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gold and stands out too much from the hair.</li>
            <li>Granted I have lots of hair, but was really hoping to replace a beak clip</li>
            <li>very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re just sitting down for dinner or at work, it should stay put most of the day.</li>
            <li>Attractive clip, subtle sparkle, good for dressing up or casual.</li>
            <li>beautiful clip that has no problem holding my thick long hair up.</li>
            <li>I would love it if I could find these same clips, just in a slightly smaller size.</li>
            <li>I have huge curly hair and that alligator clip is literally the only thing that can actually hold it up in a bun.</li>
            <li>It is also very strong - holds thick hair.</li>
            <li>Not too flashy or over the top - very pretty and professional looking.</li>
            <li>Only downside - it&#x27;s not as strong as my other alligator clip that I&#x27;ve had for years.</li>
            <li>I would like one with clear crystal stones too.</li>
            <li>if you have to run to catch a cab or something, your hair do comes completely undone.</li>
            <li>If your hair is thick, like mine, don&#x27;t expect to be able to hold it up with this clip.</li>
            <li>It definitely does not keep the bun as secure as my other one -</li>
            <li>Lovely subtle sparkle.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, tasteful hair clip - black with tiny blue rhinestones/ crystals.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty fancy for everyday use, but it works so well</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s pretty fancy for everyday use, but it works so well</li>
            <li> This clip is too flat for that.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, shoulder length hair and this clip is too heavy for it.  </li>
            <li> She has very long hair and has a sense of style herself.  </li>
            <li> Large Metal clips like this are very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some outrageous prices, but I thought that was a great deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rounded end also makes it harder to work it into the hair.</li>
            <li> Would order another if it came in other colors.</li>
            <li> This one blends in well with my dark (almost black( hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It holds hair tight.</li>
            <li> I danced and this stayed put (with other small bun pins, but still, this did almost all the work of holding the bulk of my hair up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy but not like some of these</li>
            <li> It is a little bit heavy</li>
            <li> However, when it arrived, one of the stones was already missing.</li>
            <li> Holds my long thick hair firmly without it feeling like it&#x27;s pinching, yay!  </li>
            <li> The spring mechanism is extremely tight, allowing it to grasp a lot of thick hair</li>
            <li> and it is so hard to find things to hold it all.</li>
            <li> and I wish I could wear it, but it is way too heavy and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> But I have a TON of hair (very thick) and this thing holds my hair all day.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the clip I will need to see if I can find some style like one side</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve unfortunately learned this from experience).</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> Slightly disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have long fine hair and it is so hard to find things to hold it all. I love this clip, worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty and classy clip. Works well, holds my very fine hair up tight and looks nice. Not too flashy or over the top - very pretty and professional looking. I love it and wish it came in more colors!</li>
            <li> IT IS BEAUTIFUL BUT VERY, VERY LARGE.</li>
            <li> I wear this clip almost every day.  It grips well and is beautiful.  It never gets tangled up in my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this clip. It holds hair tight. I would like one with clear crystal stones too. I have been looking for one since I got this one.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, well made clip. Lovely!</li>
            <li> Attractive clip, subtle sparkle, good for dressing up or casual. Interesting pattern.    I use these clips to hold all my hair up in a twist.  This clip is too flat for that.  Nothing wrong with the clip I will need to see if I can find some style like one side swept back that will work.</li>
            <li> This clip holds all two feet of my hair and it has held up to my kids playing with it so I call it a win.</li>
            <li> Worked fabulously for a formal event. My hairdresser asked me to bring a clip of about 5 inches for the formal updo with trailing curls. I read the Amazon reviews and saw that this one was reputed to hold a lot of hair solidly in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yep. It works. I have curly hair that reaches to my mid-back. This clip held me up and my updo looked fab. I danced and this stayed put (with other small bun pins, but still, this did almost all the work of holding the bulk of my hair up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I got two for future use at a price of just under 9 dollars for two here. I&#x27;ve seen some outrageous prices, but I thought that was a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it today to keep my hair up while I cooked. It&#x27;s pretty fancy for everyday use, but it works so well, I used it anyway.The only thing that would make it more perfect is if it had a more curved shape to fit the shape of one&#x27;s head. I have another clip that curves and that&#x27;s a nice bonus.But that&#x27;s not a glittery fancy clip and it&#x27;s gold and stands out too much from the hair. This one blends in well with my dark (almost black( hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Amazon gets this back in stock, because I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very nice as expected!</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a similar plastic clip I&#x27;ve had for years that finally broke and now I can&#x27;t find them anywhere.  This is shorter and more blunt and also heavier.  I have fine, thin, shoulder length hair and this clip is too heavy for it.  Probably fine for thicker hair.  The rounded end also makes it harder to work it into the hair.</li>
            <li> it feels solid but looks too larger than I expect. it&#x27;s better to buy this kind of things with actual pictures on hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy but not like some of these, I can still wear this one.</li>
            <li> Will keep this link so I can order more, should I ever lose these. They are well made and beautiful. I always get compliments on them.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a high quality clip like this for my fine hair for years. I love this thing and wish it came in more colors. Quality metal, pretty looking and well crafted!</li>
            <li> This has a super strong grip.  No teeth, so I have to angle it so the clip points up, or the hair might slip out.  But I have a TON of hair (very thick) and this thing holds my hair all day.</li>
            <li> It is pretty and very sturdy. However, coming in at almost 5&amp;#34; long, it&#x27;s surprising it won&#x27;t hold much hair.</li>
            <li> Just like me :-) This clip stays in place comfortably but securely and works with so many fashion styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well made!</li>
            <li> Large Metal clips like this are very hard to find.  I had purchased one at retail, and loved it, so when I saw this I had to purchase another for my daughter in law!  Price OK, but it was more reasonable in the retail store.</li>
            <li> Holds my long thick hair firmly without it feeling like it&#x27;s pinching, yay!  That can be a fine balance with my hair; not too light, not too tight, just right!  All the while it&#x27;s an attractive looking design and the rhinestones are subtle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty and I wish I could wear it, but it is way too heavy and uncomfortable. Too bad.</li>
            <li> This clip is very pretty looking, but does not grip my hair very well. Granted I have lots of hair, but was really hoping to replace a beak clip I once had that looked similar and did a wonderful job of holding hair in place. It&#x27;s better than nothing, but leaves me still in search of a better gripping clip.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t rip or tear hair, smooth clamp. Looks better in your hair than it does in the picture. Would order another if it came in other colors.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice hair clip. Great material.  The lovely stones give it a pretty nice and delicate touch</li>
            <li> Slightly disappointed. This is a really beautiful clip, and I love it! It&#x27;s strong enough to hold my hair up, and that&#x27;s refreshing. However, when it arrived, one of the stones was already missing. It&#x27;s not very noticeable while the clip is in, I&#x27;m sure, but when you pay good money for a new product, you hope it comes with all its pieces.</li>
            <li> Nice alligator clip - better quality</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;It looks exactly as on the picture, arrives in time. It looks gorgeous on the hair, I definitely will recommend it</li>
            <li> Beautiful, great price, &amp; fast shipping</li>
            <li> It is very pretty and has a sense of an antique style and look about it.  I purchased this for my Grand Daughter.  She has very long hair and has a sense of style herself.  I&#x27;m sure she will enjoy this lovely hair clip.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, tasteful hair clip - black with tiny blue rhinestones/ crystals. Not gaudy at all.  It is also very strong - holds thick hair. My mother loves it! It arrived quickly and packaged securely.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something like this for quite a while.  Stumbled across this one.  It is beautiful.  I use it almost every day and have not had any issues with jewels falling out.  It is a little bit heavy but I find that a plus.  I loved it so much I ordered a second one.</li>
            <li> Excellent, solid clip.  The spring mechanism is extremely tight, allowing it to grasp a lot of thick hair very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, don&#x27;t leave it in the shower/around water, as it will rust pretty easily (I&#x27;ve unfortunately learned this from experience).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty, and arrived in good condition. Only downside - it&#x27;s not as strong as my other alligator clip that I&#x27;ve had for years. I have huge curly hair and that alligator clip is literally the only thing that can actually hold it up in a bun. I was looking for a prettier one to use for nights out, and this one is nice, but it slips out after a while. It definitely does not keep the bun as secure as my other one - if you have to run to catch a cab or something, your hair do comes completely undone. But if you&#x27;re just sitting down for dinner or at work, it should stay put most of the day.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery. Product as advertised.</li>
            <li> Very pretty! Sturdy. Appear to be well made. Like them very much. Lovely subtle sparkle. Good price. Received very quickly. .Would buy more colors if they were offered</li>
            <li> beautiful clip that has no problem holding my thick long hair up. It has great weight</li>
            <li> These are great hair clips -- but also gigantic. I would love it if I could find these same clips, just in a slightly smaller size.</li>
            <li> Everything I hoped for.</li>
            <li> The item is veeery cute, but it doesn&#x27;t hold much hair. If your hair is thick, like mine, don&#x27;t expect to be able to hold it up with this clip.</li>
