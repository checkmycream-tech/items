            <li>This is the best shampoo for interractial girls!</li>
            <li>Wonderful!  </li>
            <li>That means it lowers the surface tension of a liquid like a foaming agent - perfect in a detergent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its a very good shampoo for my curly hair</li>
            <li>However this shampoo gave me great results.</li>

            <li>Great products.</li>
            <li>Just for Me Hair Milk Shampoo has a pleasant, fruity, tropical scent.</li>
            <li>I am not as impressed with the conditioner, but this by far is the best kids shampoo I have used yet.</li>
            <li>My hair felt so good that I bypassed conditioner.</li>
            <li>A good milk shampoo that cleans hair well.</li>
            <li>This product has a good smell to it.</li>
            <li>It smells really good</li>
            <li>can leave me with some very interesting surprises.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is supposed to be good for \\&quot;curly or wavy\\&quot; textured hair, but it works nicely with wayward hair as well.  </li>
            <li>I liked this shampoo as soon as I opened the bottle because it smells so good.  </li>
            <li>do love the light, very pleasant scent of it though.</li>
            <li>shampoo lathers up great and rinses out easily.</li>
            <li>The shampoo smelt good and the texture was very light.</li>
            <li>and it was just as amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing scalp relief.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is not the kind of shampoo I would purchase or even use again.</li>
            <li>and it has done a nice job in both.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is nice to know that I can use the</li>
            <li>It is nice to know that I can use the</li>
            <li>and that worked nicely for when I didn&#x27;t have time to shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner also went in nicely and didn&#x27;t leave her hair greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Together they made a nice set.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it has a fresh, almost innocent scent to it that goes along with her</li>
            <li>And I liked the smell.</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair feeling nicely conditioned.</li>
            <li>My hair felt clean and light, and it had noticeably more volume, which I found quite impressive!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to switch to safer products whenever good alternatives are available.</li>
            <li>One of the things i liked most was it&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo, my hair was shinier and more manageable.</li>
            <li>it smells a bit more like an 80&#x27;s tanning oil might.  </li>
            <li>I tried out this shampoo and was pleased with the result.  </li>
            <li>my hair, but perhaps not any better than a lot of shampoos.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fact that it is now an Amazon Add-on item, as are most of the \\&quot;Just For Me: products,  item is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just For Me Hair Milk Nourishing Detangler, 10-Ounce Bottle]], I was so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However... after two weeks of using, I had been noticing a lot more hair loss in the shower drain.</li>
            <li>I had figured I was just shedding more because of the weather, etc.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this product.</li>
            <li>My daughter curls are very shiny and bouncy and I would recommend this product to anyone who has daughters with curly hair and who is looking for a great hair product.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in la-la-la-la love with this product</li>
            <li>Okay, maybe it will work</li>
            <li>I tried to find more information about the product.  </li>
            <li>I just love the</li>
            <li>And I am so glad to be able to get it on the Subscribe and Save Program</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair feels softer and is more manageable because of this shampoo and I no longer have to use texturizer softners on her hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product for my hair</li>
            <li>My granddaughter just turned seven and is enjoying growing up.</li>
            <li>I also appreciate the healthy ingredients like biotin, honey, vitamin E and C, and shea butter.</li>
            <li>In fact, it leaves the hair better conditioned than the conditioner does.</li>
            <li>and i said that i loved this because it smells calm, clean and nice.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>recommend using this shampoo with a good conditioner as it strips out oily residue pretty efficiently.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product but nothing extraordinary.  </li>
            <li>This is one really nicely scented shampoo that reminds me of fresh cocoanut on a sunny day.</li>
            <li>But it is gentle, lathers well and smells good.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner isn&#x27;t as good for white hair and works better on ethnic hair, but the shampoo is quite versatile!</li>
            <li>Most are over-priced and don&#x27;t give me any significant  results.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, and it can get oily quickly, and it&#x27;s also colored.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is rich and lovely.</li>
            <li>My toddler has curly hair which tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>The Just For Me Hair Milk Shampoo spreads easily and cleans well.</li>
            <li>I found Just for me rinsed fine and didn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li>This is fine with me.  </li>
            <li>This is fine with me.  </li>
            <li>So odd though, considering great the shampoo is!</li>
            <li>the light tropical coconut smell this shampoo has.  </li>
            <li>It seems to clean well, lathers well, and rinses easily.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light coconut and not overpowering.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves next to no tangles and smells great too.</li>
            <li>If that information had been available on the Amazon page, I would not have requested this product, but it wasn&#x27;t, and it just doesn&#x27;t work for my fine-textured, old-white-lady</li>
            <li>It works very well and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>They leave my daughters hair with such full, shiny, beautiful fresh curls we love these products.</li>
            <li>When used with the conditioner, my hair is allowed to air dry, I have these BEAUTIFUL waves that I don&#x27;t even have to style my hair to get.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>These products are flat out great, whether for hair conditioning, cleaning or detangling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shampoo is not tear free, so it probably isn&#x27;t the best bet for small children like mine who forget to close their eyes.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels baby soft after use and it smell too good to be true.</li>
            <li>It lathers easily and rinses out quickly.</li>
            <li>The lather is rich if not luxurious.  </li>
            <li>This did not immediately clean my scalp the way my go to shampoo does i.e. [[ASIN:B0093GBU92</li>
            <li>The bottle has a good heft to it (not likely to be knocked over) and the graphics are cheerful.</li>
            <li>My child has a wild head of curly hair and this is the first product she&#x27;s ever been able to apply herself so that she can comb her own hair out after her shower.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this shampoo.</li>
            <li>As an Amazon Vine reviewer, I have been trying a lot of good quality shampoos of various kinds.</li>
            <li>Good product overall.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good for my two white children&#x27;s hair because they have thinner hair, but it works in a pinch for them too.</li>
            <li>and I was able to part it without snarls which is unusual for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised how nice this shampoo was!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Made my hair thicker and full of body</li>
            <li>With a pleasant fragrance and a consistency that is easily distributed through the hair, plus a nice soft result after my hair dried,</li>
            <li>Luckily, it did not linger in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a fairly thin shampoo that lathers nicely and has a light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Even though I liked the way this shampoo performed, we&#x27;ve went back to using tear free Burt&#x27;s Bees baby shampoo.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I got the shampoo and conditioner from Vine, I had set it in the tub to test, something she quickly discovered when she took her bath.</li>
            <li>The lather wasn&#x27;t strong but it got it clean, and my hair does feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>but this shampoo is mild and does not cause me any reaction, so it is worth the trade</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t dry out my hair (I tested it alone, without any conditioner) but it somehow moisturized my hair more than most shampoos I&#x27;ve tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although it is my understanding that this shampoo is geared towards younger people of ethnic descent, I&#x27;m loving it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective we will be using it in the future we also have the conditioner, detangler, and hair moisturizer</li>
            <li>shampoo has a thick texture and to my nose a very mild pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>, it has a nice, clean scent, and it left my hair feeling silky soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>I found that my hair was comb-able right away</li>
            <li>It is more of a conditioning shampoo than one that rinses easily but it does leave the hair quite soft and most certainly not stripped and</li>
            <li>Made with shea butter, honey and soy milk, this milk like shampoo provides a generous lather and a gentle clean.</li>
            <li>A rinse with lukewarm water results in silky smooth hait that is vibrant and shiny without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Apparently, this product line is geared towards children, and more towards children with \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; hair.  </li>
            <li>and I loved the way this left my hair feeling so feather soft.</li>
            <li>My daughter hair was very soft and silky her hair became tangle free</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo on my 3 year old daughter, who has fine semi-curly hair.  </li>
            <li>The bottle looks like a little milk bottle and the bright cap and print would appeal to kids.</li>
            <li>My hair was not left feeling exceptionally clean or smooth.</li>
            <li>It rinsed cleanly and easily and left my hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li>but i like it now for the summer when i go to the beach or just want to bathe because its so freaking hot in ny</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just something to be aware of...</li>
            <li>For most of my life I suffered from dandruff until I learned that I had to use a daily 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>First I&#x27;ve found that works for all of us.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d be willing to order it online to purchase.</li>
            <li>the Shampoo and Conditioner are now Grandma approved, and she even left some for me when it was my turn in the tub. :-)</li>
            <li>This shampoo makes hair feel silky when it first goes on and de-oiled after the rinse.</li>
            <li>and my son is willing to use it.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and being in Germany, it is hard to get those favorite products.</li>
            <li>any rate, I found the texture to be nice, much like other shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>&quot; clean - just clean - it also doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp</li>
            <li>The Pina Colada smell is not as strong nor offensive as traditional suntan lotion.  </li>
            <li>Axe 3 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Plus Bodywash Total Fresh ([[ASIN:B00AE07BC6 Axe 3 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Plus Bodywash Total Fresh, 12 Ounce]]) and, most recently, Clear Men Scalp Therapy Scalp Comfort Anti-Dandruff 2 in 1 Shampoo/Conditioner</li>
            <li>This shampoo added so much moisturizer that I had to shampoo after 2 days</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am always in the market for a gentle shampoo.</li>
            <li>It probably should; it makes using shampoo and conditioner so much simpler.  </li>
            <li>and didn&#x27;t pay much attention.</li>
            <li>and I could run my fingers straight through her hair.</li>
            <li>Though some didn&#x27;t care to much for it, I thought it to be a plus.</li>
            <li>, I like this product so much that I would make it my every day, go-to shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li>It lathers really well</li>
            <li>This really gets into the hair and takes away all the oily residues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend this shampoo but the follow up product is very skippable.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B005FQMDRM Pantene Pro-V Fine Hair Solutions Flat to Volume 2 in 1 Shampoo &amp; Conditioner 12.6 Fl Oz</li>
            <li>Palmolive Original Dish Liquid, 30 Fluid Ounce]].  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s full of substances that environmental groups caution against, such as PEG-30 and sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS).</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and frequent washing is essential in maintaining body.</li>
            <li>This did a good job the little ones are washing and conditioner allot since they are in and out of the pool, and playing outside...</li>
            <li>I doubt I would purchase this product again because it&#x27;s typical and nothing more.</li>
            <li>My ends look better than they&#x27;ve looked with much more expensive</li>
            <li>My allergist always told me to use a variety of antihistamines/decongestants in order to prevent a resistance to a particular brand.  </li>
            <li>Many say they are intended for African American children.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The creamy white bottle is fitting for a shampoo that calls itself \\&quot;hair milk,\\&quot; and the creamy white texture of the liquid inside fits, too.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive scalp and a years-long history of problems with shampoo, so it is an unusual thing that I can find a shampoo that I can use at all.  </li>
            <li>It has a rather thin consistency and spreads easily, making your hair feel silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>In fact, SLS is the second ingredient, right after water.</li>
            <li>My test of any new shampoo is how my hair feels and looks after washing without any conditioner or additional product.</li>
            <li>It left a light scent on my hair, but wasn&#x27;t cloying nor did it seem to last all day.  </li>
            <li>and I found that I could easily brush out my hair (long enough to sit on) without recourse to any form of conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once I could get past the strong scent, much like suntan lotion, the Just for me</li>
            <li>I often skip a day between shampoos, and most of the shampoos I use allow me to do that without my hair feeling kind of dirty on the second day.  </li>
            <li>The smell is coconut with a faint chemical smell; not exactly the best but acceptable.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how inexpensive it was, too!  </li>
            <li>had tried the shampoo on its own as well as with the companion products and was so pleased with how it cleaned and how my hair felt, and am so disappointed that I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li>The same is true of my scalp which had some itch pre-shampoo and kept the same itch post-shampoo.</li>
            <li>but maybe it&#x27;s a problem with my tap water but like [[ASIN:B003M04GZK Special pack of 5 PRELL SHAMPOO CLASSIC GREEN 13.5 oz]]</li>

            <li>My Hispanic dad, who is fast approaching eighty, is visiting me for the 4th of July holiday</li>
            <li>Naturally this depends upon the weather and summer humidity</li>
            <li>when rinsing you feel like you don&#x27;t even need a conditioner as your hair is soft and untangled.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a shampoo and conditioner for my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s curly hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>, my hair is soft, shiny and with almost no frizz.</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with the conditioner and so far (after 2 weeks of using it)</li>
            <li>and it leaves my daughter hair hydrated, soft and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my son who has fairly short mostly straight hair uses some of the products.</li>
            <li>The shampoo left my long hair easy to comb, and that&#x27;s the bigger plus for me.</li>
            <li>many other better-known brands such as Pantene and Dove also have SLS as their second listed ingredients.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes there might be a fragrance or a different feel as I used both the shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
            <li>Normally the sheer weight of my hair pulls a lot of the wave</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t wanna dry out my hair with older-people products and that whole process..</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s worth replacing your normal shampoo though.</li>
            <li>A small amount well distributed through damp hair results in a pleasant thick lather.</li>

            <li>The scent is not particularly pleasant but the only good part about the scent is that it is not very strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I do not particularly like the scent and this particular shampoo</li>
            <li>For a vibrant head of hair devoid of tangles, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have long, straight, dry, 56-year-old  hair.</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo isn&#x27;t very thick and it lathered into her hair easily.</li>
            <li>Just For Me hair products are marketed to younger people with hair typical of those with black sub-Saharan African ancestry but for the most part, they work well for people of any age with other types of hair, too.</li>

            <li> Wonderful!  </li>
            <li> That means it lowers the surface tension of a liquid like a foaming agent - perfect in a detergent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its a very good shampoo for my curly hair</li>
            <li> However this shampoo gave me great results.</li>

            <li> can leave me with some very interesting surprises.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is supposed to be good for \\&quot;curly or wavy\\&quot; textured hair, but it works nicely with wayward hair as well.  </li>
            <li> I liked this shampoo as soon as I opened the bottle because it smells so good.  </li>
            <li> do love the light, very pleasant scent of it though.</li>
            <li> shampoo lathers up great and rinses out easily.</li>
            <li> The shampoo smelt good and the texture was very light.</li>
            <li> and it was just as amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing scalp relief.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is not the kind of shampoo I would purchase or even use again.</li>
            <li> and it has done a nice job in both.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is nice to know that I can use the</li>
            <li> It is nice to know that I can use the</li>
            <li> and that worked nicely for when I didn&#x27;t have time to shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner also went in nicely and didn&#x27;t leave her hair greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Together they made a nice set.</li>
            <li> Best of all, it has a fresh, almost innocent scent to it that goes along with her</li>
            <li> And I liked the smell.</li>
            <li> It leaves the hair feeling nicely conditioned.</li>
            <li> My hair felt clean and light, and it had noticeably more volume, which I found quite impressive!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to switch to safer products whenever good alternatives are available.</li>
            <li> One of the things i liked most was it&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo, my hair was shinier and more manageable.</li>
            <li> it smells a bit more like an 80&#x27;s tanning oil might.  </li>
            <li> I tried out this shampoo and was pleased with the result.  </li>
            <li> my hair, but perhaps not any better than a lot of shampoos.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fact that it is now an Amazon Add-on item, as are most of the \\&quot;Just For Me: products,  item is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just For Me Hair Milk Nourishing Detangler, 10-Ounce Bottle]], I was so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However... after two weeks of using, I had been noticing a lot more hair loss in the shower drain.</li>
            <li> I had figured I was just shedding more because of the weather, etc.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter curls are very shiny and bouncy and I would recommend this product to anyone who has daughters with curly hair and who is looking for a great hair product.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in la-la-la-la love with this product</li>
            <li> Okay, maybe it will work</li>
            <li> I tried to find more information about the product.  </li>
            <li> I just love the</li>
            <li> And I am so glad to be able to get it on the Subscribe and Save Program</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair feels softer and is more manageable because of this shampoo and I no longer have to use texturizer softners on her hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my hair</li>
            <li> My granddaughter just turned seven and is enjoying growing up.</li>
            <li> I also appreciate the healthy ingredients like biotin, honey, vitamin E and C, and shea butter.</li>
            <li> In fact, it leaves the hair better conditioned than the conditioner does.</li>
            <li> and i said that i loved this because it smells calm, clean and nice.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> recommend using this shampoo with a good conditioner as it strips out oily residue pretty efficiently.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product but nothing extraordinary.  </li>
            <li> This is one really nicely scented shampoo that reminds me of fresh cocoanut on a sunny day.</li>
            <li> But it is gentle, lathers well and smells good.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner isn&#x27;t as good for white hair and works better on ethnic hair, but the shampoo is quite versatile!</li>
            <li> Most are over-priced and don&#x27;t give me any significant  results.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, and it can get oily quickly, and it&#x27;s also colored.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is rich and lovely.</li>
            <li> My toddler has curly hair which tangles easily.  </li>
            <li> The Just For Me Hair Milk Shampoo spreads easily and cleans well.</li>
            <li> I found Just for me rinsed fine and didn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li> This is fine with me.  </li>
            <li> This is fine with me.  </li>
            <li> So odd though, considering great the shampoo is!</li>
            <li> the light tropical coconut smell this shampoo has.  </li>
            <li> It seems to clean well, lathers well, and rinses easily.  </li>
            <li> The scent is light coconut and not overpowering.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves next to no tangles and smells great too.</li>
            <li> If that information had been available on the Amazon page, I would not have requested this product, but it wasn&#x27;t, and it just doesn&#x27;t work for my fine-textured, old-white-lady</li>
            <li> It works very well and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> They leave my daughters hair with such full, shiny, beautiful fresh curls we love these products.</li>
            <li> When used with the conditioner, my hair is allowed to air dry, I have these BEAUTIFUL waves that I don&#x27;t even have to style my hair to get.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> These products are flat out great, whether for hair conditioning, cleaning or detangling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shampoo is not tear free, so it probably isn&#x27;t the best bet for small children like mine who forget to close their eyes.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels baby soft after use and it smell too good to be true.</li>
            <li> It lathers easily and rinses out quickly.</li>
            <li> The lather is rich if not luxurious.  </li>
            <li> This did not immediately clean my scalp the way my go to shampoo does i.e. [[ASIN:B0093GBU92</li>
            <li> The bottle has a good heft to it (not likely to be knocked over) and the graphics are cheerful.</li>
            <li> My child has a wild head of curly hair and this is the first product she&#x27;s ever been able to apply herself so that she can comb her own hair out after her shower.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this shampoo.</li>
            <li> As an Amazon Vine reviewer, I have been trying a lot of good quality shampoos of various kinds.</li>
            <li> Good product overall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good for my two white children&#x27;s hair because they have thinner hair, but it works in a pinch for them too.</li>
            <li> and I was able to part it without snarls which is unusual for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised how nice this shampoo was!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Made my hair thicker and full of body</li>
            <li> With a pleasant fragrance and a consistency that is easily distributed through the hair, plus a nice soft result after my hair dried,</li>
            <li> Luckily, it did not linger in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a fairly thin shampoo that lathers nicely and has a light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Even though I liked the way this shampoo performed, we&#x27;ve went back to using tear free Burt&#x27;s Bees baby shampoo.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I got the shampoo and conditioner from Vine, I had set it in the tub to test, something she quickly discovered when she took her bath.</li>
            <li> The lather wasn&#x27;t strong but it got it clean, and my hair does feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> but this shampoo is mild and does not cause me any reaction, so it is worth the trade</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry out my hair (I tested it alone, without any conditioner) but it somehow moisturized my hair more than most shampoos I&#x27;ve tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although it is my understanding that this shampoo is geared towards younger people of ethnic descent, I&#x27;m loving it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective we will be using it in the future we also have the conditioner, detangler, and hair moisturizer</li>
            <li> shampoo has a thick texture and to my nose a very mild pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> , it has a nice, clean scent, and it left my hair feeling silky soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> I found that my hair was comb-able right away</li>
            <li> It is more of a conditioning shampoo than one that rinses easily but it does leave the hair quite soft and most certainly not stripped and</li>
            <li> Made with shea butter, honey and soy milk, this milk like shampoo provides a generous lather and a gentle clean.</li>
            <li> A rinse with lukewarm water results in silky smooth hait that is vibrant and shiny without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Apparently, this product line is geared towards children, and more towards children with \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; hair.  </li>
            <li> and I loved the way this left my hair feeling so feather soft.</li>
            <li> My daughter hair was very soft and silky her hair became tangle free</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo on my 3 year old daughter, who has fine semi-curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The bottle looks like a little milk bottle and the bright cap and print would appeal to kids.</li>
            <li> My hair was not left feeling exceptionally clean or smooth.</li>
            <li> It rinsed cleanly and easily and left my hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li> but i like it now for the summer when i go to the beach or just want to bathe because its so freaking hot in ny</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just something to be aware of...</li>
            <li> For most of my life I suffered from dandruff until I learned that I had to use a daily 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> First I&#x27;ve found that works for all of us.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d be willing to order it online to purchase.</li>
            <li> the Shampoo and Conditioner are now Grandma approved, and she even left some for me when it was my turn in the tub. :-)</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes hair feel silky when it first goes on and de-oiled after the rinse.</li>
            <li> and my son is willing to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and being in Germany, it is hard to get those favorite products.</li>
            <li> any rate, I found the texture to be nice, much like other shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> &quot; clean - just clean - it also doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp</li>
            <li> The Pina Colada smell is not as strong nor offensive as traditional suntan lotion.  </li>
            <li> Axe 3 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Plus Bodywash Total Fresh ([[ASIN:B00AE07BC6 Axe 3 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Plus Bodywash Total Fresh, 12 Ounce]]) and, most recently, Clear Men Scalp Therapy Scalp Comfort Anti-Dandruff 2 in 1 Shampoo/Conditioner</li>
            <li> This shampoo added so much moisturizer that I had to shampoo after 2 days</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am always in the market for a gentle shampoo.</li>
            <li> It probably should; it makes using shampoo and conditioner so much simpler.  </li>
            <li> and didn&#x27;t pay much attention.</li>
            <li> and I could run my fingers straight through her hair.</li>
            <li> Though some didn&#x27;t care to much for it, I thought it to be a plus.</li>
            <li> , I like this product so much that I would make it my every day, go-to shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li> It lathers really well</li>
            <li> This really gets into the hair and takes away all the oily residues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend this shampoo but the follow up product is very skippable.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B005FQMDRM Pantene Pro-V Fine Hair Solutions Flat to Volume 2 in 1 Shampoo &amp; Conditioner 12.6 Fl Oz</li>
            <li> Palmolive Original Dish Liquid, 30 Fluid Ounce]].  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s full of substances that environmental groups caution against, such as PEG-30 and sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS).</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and frequent washing is essential in maintaining body.</li>
            <li> This did a good job the little ones are washing and conditioner allot since they are in and out of the pool, and playing outside...</li>
            <li> I doubt I would purchase this product again because it&#x27;s typical and nothing more.</li>
            <li> My ends look better than they&#x27;ve looked with much more expensive</li>
            <li> My allergist always told me to use a variety of antihistamines/decongestants in order to prevent a resistance to a particular brand.  </li>
            <li> Many say they are intended for African American children.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The creamy white bottle is fitting for a shampoo that calls itself \\&quot;hair milk,\\&quot; and the creamy white texture of the liquid inside fits, too.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive scalp and a years-long history of problems with shampoo, so it is an unusual thing that I can find a shampoo that I can use at all.  </li>
            <li> It has a rather thin consistency and spreads easily, making your hair feel silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> In fact, SLS is the second ingredient, right after water.</li>
            <li> My test of any new shampoo is how my hair feels and looks after washing without any conditioner or additional product.</li>
            <li> It left a light scent on my hair, but wasn&#x27;t cloying nor did it seem to last all day.  </li>
            <li> and I found that I could easily brush out my hair (long enough to sit on) without recourse to any form of conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once I could get past the strong scent, much like suntan lotion, the Just for me</li>
            <li> I often skip a day between shampoos, and most of the shampoos I use allow me to do that without my hair feeling kind of dirty on the second day.  </li>
            <li> The smell is coconut with a faint chemical smell; not exactly the best but acceptable.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how inexpensive it was, too!  </li>
            <li> had tried the shampoo on its own as well as with the companion products and was so pleased with how it cleaned and how my hair felt, and am so disappointed that I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> The same is true of my scalp which had some itch pre-shampoo and kept the same itch post-shampoo.</li>
            <li> but maybe it&#x27;s a problem with my tap water but like [[ASIN:B003M04GZK Special pack of 5 PRELL SHAMPOO CLASSIC GREEN 13.5 oz]]</li>

            <li> Naturally this depends upon the weather and summer humidity</li>
            <li> when rinsing you feel like you don&#x27;t even need a conditioner as your hair is soft and untangled.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo and conditioner for my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s curly hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> , my hair is soft, shiny and with almost no frizz.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with the conditioner and so far (after 2 weeks of using it)</li>
            <li> and it leaves my daughter hair hydrated, soft and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my son who has fairly short mostly straight hair uses some of the products.</li>
            <li> The shampoo left my long hair easy to comb, and that&#x27;s the bigger plus for me.</li>
            <li> many other better-known brands such as Pantene and Dove also have SLS as their second listed ingredients.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes there might be a fragrance or a different feel as I used both the shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
            <li> Normally the sheer weight of my hair pulls a lot of the wave</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t wanna dry out my hair with older-people products and that whole process..</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s worth replacing your normal shampoo though.</li>
            <li> A small amount well distributed through damp hair results in a pleasant thick lather.</li>

            <li> The scent is not particularly pleasant but the only good part about the scent is that it is not very strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I do not particularly like the scent and this particular shampoo</li>
            <li> For a vibrant head of hair devoid of tangles, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight, dry, 56-year-old  hair.</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo isn&#x27;t very thick and it lathered into her hair easily.</li>
            <li> Just For Me hair products are marketed to younger people with hair typical of those with black sub-Saharan African ancestry but for the most part, they work well for people of any age with other types of hair, too.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, and wavy, naturally Caucasian blonde and white, with very dry ends.  </li>
            <li> scent lasts about a day, and the waves don&#x27;t fall flat even in humidity, I suppose the oils help hold moisture into the hair to prevent that.  </li>
            <li> We compared notes and decided to go back to our old shampoo, and within a few days, our hair loss had gone back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> and I have long blonde hair!  </li>
            <li> Because I wash my hair daily, it is hard to find a shampoo that leaves my hair with this much</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference between this shampoo and other shampoos when it came to the actual cleaning of the hair.</li>
            <li> The scent left on my hair is very subtle, but fresh.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps in a few months when she&#x27;s a bit older and can remember to keep her eyes closed, we&#x27;ll finish using this bottle up.</li>
            <li> only negative is the smell does linger in your hair (reminiscent of ladies&#x27; hand lotions), so it may cause headaches for those sensitive to it.</li>
            <li> It is like taking an antibiotic for too long; soon, the antibiotic won&#x27;t work.  </li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out</li>

            <li> It left my hair slightly fragrant.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair slightly fragrant.  </li>
            <li> However!This is not the only hair cleaning product i use because it is for little girls</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my understanding this shampoo is targeted toward children between 5 and 14 years old with ethnic-type or kinky, hard to control hair</li>
            <li> I use conditioner and &amp;#34;The Wet Brush&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain which age group</li>

            <li> In the past, I have used Pantene Pro-V 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner, Flat to Volume [</li>
            <li> So I have to find something not too drying, not too moisturizing, and something that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair everyday like with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> The scent is slightly coconut and does not linger on my hair.</li>
            <li> Also, I didn&#x27;t have any annoying itch as though I needed to wash my hair or didn&#x27;t thoroughly wash it enough the first time.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have long, straight, dry, 56-year-old  hair. As an Amazon Vine reviewer, I have been trying a lot of good quality shampoos of various kinds. Most are over-priced and don&#x27;t give me any significant  results. However this shampoo gave me great results. After using this shampoo, my hair was shinier and more manageable. My one complaint is that I usually shampoo my hair every 4-5 days. This shampoo added so much moisturizer that I had to shampoo after 2 days or my hair felt oily. So this is for those who shampoo every day or two.</li>
            <li> Made with shea butter, honey and soy milk, this milk like shampoo provides a generous lather and a gentle clean. It rinsed cleanly and easily and left my hair soft and clean. The bottle looks like a little milk bottle and the bright cap and print would appeal to kids. However, the odor is objectionable. There is an artificial vanilla/nut aroma that is both harsh and chemical. Luckily, it did not linger in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always in the market for a gentle shampoo. My hair is fine and frequent washing is essential in maintaining body. But for the objectionable aroma, this shampoo would be on my roster. 3.5 stars.</li>
            <li> Although it is my understanding that this shampoo is geared towards younger people of ethnic descent, I&#x27;m loving it.  My hair is long, and wavy, naturally Caucasian blonde and white, with very dry ends.  Normally the sheer weight of my hair pulls a lot of the wave out.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo smells like coconut, but not an entirely natural coconut- it smells a bit more like an 80&#x27;s tanning oil might.  The lather is rich if not luxurious.  The scent left on my hair is very subtle, but fresh.  When used with the conditioner, my hair is allowed to air dry, I have these BEAUTIFUL waves that I don&#x27;t even have to style my hair to get.&lt;br /&gt;The scent lasts about a day, and the waves don&#x27;t fall flat even in humidity, I suppose the oils help hold moisture into the hair to prevent that.  My ends look better than they&#x27;ve looked with much more expensive shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;It does not make my hair look oily in the least.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is one really nicely scented shampoo that reminds me of fresh cocoanut on a sunny day. A small amount well distributed through damp hair results in a pleasant thick lather. A rinse with lukewarm water results in silky smooth hait that is vibrant and shiny without being greasy. My hair felt so good that I bypassed conditioner. For a vibrant head of hair devoid of tangles, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i just did the review for the Hair Milk Curl Smoother, 8oz and i said that i loved this because it smells calm, clean and nice. However!This is not the only hair cleaning product i use because it is for little girls but i like it now for the summer when i go to the beach or just want to bathe because its so freaking hot in ny and i don&#x27;t wanna dry out my hair with older-people products and that whole process.. i also recently did the texturizer treatment and this shampoo does not scare me like other ones do lol</li>
            <li> Once I could get past the strong scent, much like suntan lotion, the Just for me Hair milk wasn&#x27;t bad. I have thin, dry, frizzy, flyaway hair. The lather wasn&#x27;t strong but it got it clean, and my hair does feel soft and smooth. I just smell like a day at the beach, even now, 1/2 hour after showering. I found Just for me rinsed fine and didn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this shampoo. The scent is not particularly pleasant but the only good part about the scent is that it is not very strong. My hair was not left feeling exceptionally clean or smooth. The same is true of my scalp which had some itch pre-shampoo and kept the same itch post-shampoo. This is not the kind of shampoo I would purchase or even use again. It is just blah.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly thin shampoo that lathers nicely and has a light, pleasant scent. I&#x27;ve used it on my (frizzy, wavy, colored) hair and my daughter&#x27;s curly hair and it has done a nice job in both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem-- and this is very common with shampoos-- is the ingredient list. It&#x27;s full of substances that environmental groups caution against, such as PEG-30 and sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). In fact, SLS is the second ingredient, right after water. According to the Environmental Working Group, SLS has been proven in medical studies to cause:&lt;br /&gt;-Irritation of the skin and eyes&lt;br /&gt;-Organ toxicity&lt;br /&gt;-Developmental/reproductive toxicity&lt;br /&gt;-Neurotoxicity, endocrine disruption, ecotoxicology, and biochemical or cellular changes&lt;br /&gt;-Possible mutations and cancer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Mercola also says that SLS is often contaminated by two known carcinogens, ethylene oxide and 1,4 dioxane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an industry-wide problem, though-- many other better-known brands such as Pantene and Dove also have SLS as their second listed ingredients. It&#x27;s just something to be aware of... I&#x27;m trying to switch to safer products whenever good alternatives are available.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product but nothing extraordinary.  I had high hopes there might be a fragrance or a different feel as I used both the shampoo &amp; conditioner but it was like almost any other I&#x27;ve tried.  One of my objections is why the writing on the bottles is so small? I doubt I would purchase this product again because it&#x27;s typical and nothing more.</li>
            <li> I am a Caucasian male who is rapidly approaching fifty.  For most of my life I suffered from dandruff until I learned that I had to use a daily 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner.  In the past, I have used Pantene Pro-V 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner, Flat to Volume [[[ASIN:B005FQMDRM Pantene Pro-V Fine Hair Solutions Flat to Volume 2 in 1 Shampoo &amp; Conditioner 12.6 Fl Oz (Pack of 6)]]]; Axe 3 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Plus Bodywash Total Fresh ([[ASIN:B00AE07BC6 Axe 3 in 1 Shampoo Plus Conditioner Plus Bodywash Total Fresh, 12 Ounce]]) and, most recently, Clear Men Scalp Therapy Scalp Comfort Anti-Dandruff 2 in 1 Shampoo/Conditioner ([[ASIN:B00AE07932 Clear Men Scalp Therapy Scalp Comfort Anti-Dandruff 2 in1 Shampoo/Conditioner, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]]).  All of these products have worked wonderfully.  However, I don&#x27;t like to use a hygiene product for an extended period of time because my body develops a resistance.  It is like taking an antibiotic for too long; soon, the antibiotic won&#x27;t work.  My allergist always told me to use a variety of antihistamines/decongestants in order to prevent a resistance to a particular brand.  I believe this also applies to hygiene products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Just For Me doesn&#x27;t have a 2 in 1 hair conditioner and shampoo.  It probably should; it makes using shampoo and conditioner so much simpler.  In order to prevent dandruff, I must use shampoo and conditioner every day.  I received from the Amazon Vine Program both the Just For Me Hair Milk Shampoo and the Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner ([[ASIN:B002MO9BW0 Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner, 13.5-Ounce Bottle]]).  There exists some controversy as to the targeted users for these products.  Many say they are intended for African American children.  I have used them faithfully for over a week and haven&#x27;t had any problems.  I simply squirt dabs of shampoo and conditioner into my palm and mix them together.  Both the shampoo and conditioner smell heavenly and have a milky, white appearance.  I rub the mixture into my hair and let it remain until after I finish lathering the rest of my body with soap.  I must admit that the mixture of shampoo and conditioner does not lather well.  This is fine with me.  I prefer to use the two products simultaneously in order to keep me from having to remember whether or not I used the conditioner.  When they are in separate bottles, I sometimes forget to use the conditioner.  I work two jobs and can&#x27;t afford to dawdle in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I didn&#x27;t have any trouble rinsing the shampoo and conditioner concoction out of my hair.  It left my hair slightly fragrant.  Afterwards, I rubbed a little bit of Biolage Gelee Firm Hold Gel ([[ASIN:B006NA7V3U Biolage Gelee Firm Hold Gel, 16.9 Ounce]]) in my hair and blow dried it.  My hair looked voluminous and shiny and it remained that way throughout the day.  Also, I didn&#x27;t have any annoying itch as though I needed to wash my hair or didn&#x27;t thoroughly wash it enough the first time.  When the bottles of Just For Me Hair Milk Shampoo and Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner have been emptied, I will probably cycle through the other products I have mentioned earlier.  In this manner, my hair never becomes resistant to one product.  It is nice to know that I can use the Just For Me Hair Milk product line in order to control my dandruff.  My Hispanic dad, who is fast approaching eighty, is visiting me for the 4th of July holiday and I convinced him to try the Just For Me Hair Milk Shampoo and the Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner.  He is using the two products simultaneously just like me.  Yesterday, he said, \\&quot;Give them a five star rating.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B.

            <li> This shampoo is supposed to be good for \\&quot;curly or wavy\\&quot; textured hair, but it works nicely with wayward hair as well.  I have salt and pepper hair that has a tendency to wave, curl, or stick out.  Naturally this depends upon the weather and summer humidity can leave me with some very interesting surprises.  I tried out this shampoo and was pleased with the result.  It did \\&quot;tame\\&quot; my hair, but perhaps not any better than a lot of shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try [[ASIN:B003U4LI7W Just for Me Hair Smoothing Edges Cr&amp;egrave;me]] and that worked nicely for when I didn&#x27;t have time to shampoo.  I do like the light tropical coconut smell this shampoo has.  It left a light scent on my hair, but wasn&#x27;t cloying nor did it seem to last all day.  Shampoos with fragrances are simply a matter of preference.  The conditioner is not faring as well in the review department (I didn&#x27;t try this out), but I think people will like this shampoo.  The fact that it is now an Amazon Add-on item, as are most of the \\&quot;Just For Me: products,  item is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUST FOR ME HAIR PRODUCTS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002MO780W Just for Me Hair Milk Shampoo with Shea Butter, Soymilk &amp; Honey]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002MO3CG6 Just for Me Hair Nourishing Detangler]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002MO9BW0 Just for Me Hair Milk Conditioner]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002MOBZSS Just for Me Hair Curl Perfecter]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003U4LI7W Just for Me Hair Smoothing Edges Cr&amp;egrave;me]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0040H00PE Just for Me Hair Curl Smoother]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00AWM389G Just for Me Hair Nourishing Cream Cleanser]]</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive scalp and a years-long history of problems with shampoo, so it is an unusual thing that I can find a shampoo that I can use at all.  [[ASIN:B002MO780W Just For Me Hair Milk Shampoo, 13.5-Ounce Bottle]] is one of the very few I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t cause a severe reaction and leave me clawing at my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I do not particularly like the scent and this particular shampoo does not leave my hair \\&quot;squeeky\\&quot; clean - just clean - it also doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp and I found that I could easily brush out my hair (long enough to sit on) without recourse to any form of conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 - Not my fave, don&#x27;t like the smell but this shampoo is mild and does not cause me any reaction, so it is worth the trade off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li> With a pleasant fragrance and a consistency that is easily distributed through the hair, plus a nice soft result after my hair dried, I though I had found the perfect shampoo. When used with the [[ASIN:B002MO9BW0 Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner, 13.5-Ounce Bottle]] and [[ASIN:B002MO3CG6 Just For Me Hair Milk Nourishing Detangler, 10-Ounce Bottle]], I was so pleased with the results. My hair looked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However... after two weeks of using, I had been noticing a lot more hair loss in the shower drain. I had figured I was just shedding more because of the weather, etc. and didn&#x27;t pay much attention. My daughter (who&#x27;s home from college) was also trying the Just For Me Hair Milk products along with me, and had commented one morning that she was losing a ton of hair and thought that strange. We compared notes and decided to go back to our old shampoo, and within a few days, our hair loss had gone back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried the shampoo on its own as well as with the companion products and was so pleased with how it cleaned and how my hair felt, and am so disappointed that I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I liked this shampoo as soon as I opened the bottle because it smells so good.  It has a rather thin consistency and spreads easily, making your hair feel silky smooth.  Lathers well and when rinsing you feel like you don&#x27;t even need a conditioner as your hair is soft and untangled.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo and conditioner for my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s curly hair. I came across this product and bought it. I used it today on her hair.The minute I put the shampoo in her hair it just transformed. My daughter hair was very soft and silky her hair became tangle free and I could run my fingers straight through her hair. The shampoo smelt good and the texture was very light. I love everything about this product. After I shampooed her hair I used the conditioner and it was just as amazing. My daughter curls are very shiny and bouncy and I would recommend this product to anyone who has daughters with curly hair and who is looking for a great hair product.</li>
            <li> Great! even detangles. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This shampoo gets the job done without leaving your hair covered in perfume. The smell is coconut with a faint chemical smell; not exactly the best but acceptable. Here is a link to the matching conditioner: [[ASIN:B002MO9BW0 Just For Me Hair Milk Conditioner, 13.5-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
            <li> Amazing scalp relief.&lt;br /&gt;I love it cos it makes enough foam. Its a very good shampoo for my curly hair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference between this shampoo and other shampoos when it came to the actual cleaning of the hair. One of the things i liked most was it&#x27;s scent. Though some didn&#x27;t care to much for it, I thought it to be a plus. It also felt like it conditioned the hair a bit too, though it doesn&#x27;t contain conditioner. That&#x27;s just how it left my hair feeling. Good product overall. Not sure if it&#x27;s worth replacing your normal shampoo though.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo on my 3 year old daughter, who has fine semi-curly hair.  It seems to clean well, lathers well, and rinses easily.  The scent is light coconut and not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is not tear free, so it probably isn&#x27;t the best bet for small children like mine who forget to close their eyes.  Even though I liked the way this shampoo performed, we&#x27;ve went back to using tear free Burt&#x27;s Bees baby shampoo.  Perhaps in a few months when she&#x27;s a bit older and can remember to keep her eyes closed, we&#x27;ll finish using this bottle up.</li>
            <li> I started exploring this brand in preparation for our adoption of three African children. I didn&#x27;t expect, though, for it to work well on my and my daughter&#x27;s coarse hair (I&#x27;m white, she&#x27;s Asian). It&#x27;s not as good for my two white children&#x27;s hair because they have thinner hair, but it works in a pinch for them too. It moisturizes well and leaves hair manageable. The conditioner isn&#x27;t as good for white hair and works better on ethnic hair, but the shampoo is quite versatile! First I&#x27;ve found that works for all of us.</li>
            <li> This did not immediately clean my scalp the way my go to shampoo does i.e. [[ASIN:B0093GBU92 Palmolive Original Dish Liquid, 30 Fluid Ounce]].  The Pina Colada smell is not as strong nor offensive as traditional suntan lotion.  It&#x27;s not for everybody but maybe it&#x27;s a problem with my tap water but like [[ASIN:B003M04GZK Special pack of 5 PRELL SHAMPOO CLASSIC GREEN 13.5 oz]], I can smell an underlayer of stank water which is not the case when I use dishwashing detergent.</li>
            <li> These products are flat out great, whether for hair conditioning, cleaning or detangling. My child has a wild head of curly hair and this is the first product she&#x27;s ever been able to apply herself so that she can comb her own hair out after her shower.</li>
            <li> Just for Me Hair Milk Shampoo has a pleasant, fruity, tropical scent. It is more of a conditioning shampoo than one that rinses easily but it does leave the hair quite soft and most certainly not stripped and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Just For Me hair products are marketed to younger people with hair typical of those with black sub-Saharan African ancestry but for the most part, they work well for people of any age with other types of hair, too.</li>
            <li> My hair feels baby soft after use and it smell too good to be true. I&#x27;m in la-la-la-la love with this product</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!!  My daughter who is SSSSSOOOOOOOOOOOO picky about her hair loves this shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out but it doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy feeling either.  A different shampoo (a Dove one, I think) left our hair limp and too soft so that it felt greasy and gross.  This one is perfect.  Leaves next to no tangles and smells great too.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and being in Germany, it is hard to get those favorite products. I cant trust my daughters hair to just anybody! This is the best shampoo for interractial girls! Fast shipping too!!</li>
            <li> I often skip a day between shampoos, and most of the shampoos I use allow me to do that without my hair feeling kind of dirty on the second day.  This one doesn&#x27;t work for me because  I didn&#x27;t like the feel even immediately after shampooing and rinsing thoroughly; my hair didn&#x27;t have that squeaky-clean feeling I like. Okay, maybe it will work - I&#x27;ll give it a try.  Nope, on the second day, my hair felt dirty to me.  Not obviously \\&quot;this woman hasn&#x27;t washed her hair in 3 weeks\\&quot; dirty, but a heavy, somewhat oily feel I don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried to find more information about the product.  Apparently, this product line is geared towards children, and more towards children with \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; hair.  If that information had been available on the Amazon page, I would not have requested this product, but it wasn&#x27;t, and it just doesn&#x27;t work for my fine-textured, old-white-lady hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love the light, very pleasant scent of it though.</li>
            <li> This does not detangle like it claims.  But it is gentle, lathers well and smells good.  My toddler has curly hair which tangles easily.  I use conditioner and &amp;#34;The Wet Brush&amp;#34;.  On non-washing days I use a detangler.</li>
            <li> As I work this shampoo through my daughters hair I can feel her the tangles breaking apart.  Wonderful!  I am not as impressed with the conditioner, but this by far is the best kids shampoo I have used yet.</li>
            <li> I just love the Just For Me Hair Milk Shampoo. I never have to use a conditioner after shampooing. And I am so glad to be able to get it on the Subscribe and Save Program</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my understanding this shampoo is targeted toward children between 5 and 14 years old with ethnic-type or kinky, hard to control hair but I don&#x27;t see why it wouldn&#x27;t work for anyone. It works very well and has a nice scent. Nothing that&#x27;s going to change the world. Keep out of tiny eyeballs.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo alone with no conditioner and I loved the way this left my hair feeling so feather soft. I felt like I was petting baby animal fur when all was done and dried. There was no dandruff and hair did not feel weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is the smell does linger in your hair (reminiscent of ladies&#x27; hand lotions), so it may cause headaches for those sensitive to it.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in the texture of my daughter&#x27;s hair since I started using this shampoo. She has very thick curly hair. The texturize softeners would make her hair loose a lot of the curl. My daughter&#x27;s hair feels softer and is more manageable because of this shampoo and I no longer have to use texturizer softners on her hair.</li>
            <li> My test of any new shampoo is how my hair feels and looks after washing without any conditioner or additional product. My hair is waist length, undyed and unprocessed, half white/half brown. It is probably a 1B texture. It is prone to a halo of frizz in humid weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo has a thick texture and to my nose a very mild pleasant smell. The scent is slightly coconut and does not linger on my hair. It lathers easily and rinses out quickly. I found that my hair was comb-able right away and I was able to part it without snarls which is unusual for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry, my hair is soft, shiny and with almost no frizz. The ends are not fly-away. Because I wash my hair daily, it is hard to find a shampoo that leaves my hair with this much shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even thought I might be an off label user, I like this product so much that I would make it my every day, go-to shampoo. I do not see it in my local grocery/department stores but I&#x27;d be willing to order it online to purchase. The bottle has a good heft to it (not likely to be knocked over) and the graphics are cheerful. This is a great product that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have sometimes difficult hair, and it&#x27;s often a challenge to find products that are agreeable with it.  My hair is very fine, and it can get oily quickly, and it&#x27;s also colored.  So I have to find something not too drying, not too moisturizing, and something that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  I was actually surprised how nice this shampoo was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked really well for me.  My hair felt clean and light, and it had noticeably more volume, which I found quite impressive!  It didn&#x27;t dry out my hair (I tested it alone, without any conditioner) but it somehow moisturized my hair more than most shampoos I&#x27;ve tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really great shampoo.  It lathers really well, it has a nice, clean scent, and it left my hair feeling silky soft and clean.  I was surprised how inexpensive it was, too!  I will definitely purchase it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing though - do NOT purchase the conditioner of this brand.  It&#x27;s absolutely awful!  I will be using the shampoo alone, or with another brand of conditioner.  The conditioner was watery and gross, and yet it left my hair feeling gunky like I hadn&#x27;t showered in a couple days!  It was far and above the worst conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  So odd though, considering great the shampoo is!</li>
            <li> A good milk shampoo that cleans hair well.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my hair and I have long blonde hair!  Made my hair thicker and full of body and I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair everyday like with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> This product has a good smell to it. I use it in combination with the conditioner and so far (after 2 weeks of using it) it seems to work well on my daughters curls.</li>
            <li> This did a good job the little ones are washing and conditioner allot since they are in and out of the pool, and playing outside... its been used often. It&#x27;s effective we will be using it in the future we also have the conditioner, detangler, and hair moisturizer they compliment each other well. Great products. This Shampoo lathers well and smells pleasnt and it leaves my daughter hair hydrated, soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Even my son who has fairly short mostly straight hair uses some of the products. They leave my daughters hair with such full, shiny, beautiful fresh curls we love these products.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter just turned seven and is enjoying growing up. She likes to use her Mom&#x27;s and my stuff, and while still a \\&quot;little\\&quot; girl, enjoys the feminine side of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I got the shampoo and conditioner from Vine, I had set it in the tub to test, something she quickly discovered when she took her bath. Looking at the words, she decided that \\&quot;Just for Me,\\&quot; referred to her, and insisted that her mom use it on her hair. I&#x27;m not certain which age group they are after with that title, but I think they hit the market with that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo isn&#x27;t very thick and it lathered into her hair easily. The conditioner also went in nicely and didn&#x27;t leave her hair greasy at all. Together they made a nice set. Best of all, it has a fresh, almost innocent scent to it that goes along with her personality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the Shampoo and Conditioner are now Grandma approved, and she even left some for me when it was my turn in the tub. :-)</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes hair feel silky when it first goes on and de-oiled after the rinse. That&#x27;s because of the ingredients. I think this shampoo compares favorably with Fekkai and even ALTERNA shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo has Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Cocamidopropyl Betaine, the key ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Lauryl Sulfate comes from coconut and palm oils. It&#x27;s used for all kinds of detergents to remove oily residues. This really gets into the hair and takes away all the oily residues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cocamidopropyl Betaine comes from coconut oil and dimethylaminopropylamine. It&#x27;s a surfactant. That means it lowers the surface tension of a liquid like a foaming agent - perfect in a detergent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using this shampoo with a good conditioner as it strips out oily residue pretty efficiently.</li>
            <li> The Just For Me Hair Milk Shampoo spreads easily and cleans well. The hair does not feel dried out after you rinse the shampoo out. Almost feels like you don&#x27;t need a conditioner. It smells great and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The creamy white bottle is fitting for a shampoo that calls itself \\&quot;hair milk,\\&quot; and the creamy white texture of the liquid inside fits, too. The graphic design on the bottle might make you wonder if it&#x27;s a product for kids, but nevertheless it does the job whatever your age. (But who is the \\&quot;me\\&quot; on the label, from a marketing perspective? Dunno -- maybe just me!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I found the texture to be nice, much like other shampoos I&#x27;ve used. And I liked the smell. It almost seemed coconut-y. The shampoo left my long hair easy to comb, and that&#x27;s the bigger plus for me. I also appreciate the healthy ingredients like biotin, honey, vitamin E and C, and shea butter.</li>
            <li> I like the Just for Me Hair Milk products. The shampoo is rich and lovely. It smells really good and my son is willing to use it. He needs moisture or his hair becomes a bristly bushy mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo lathers up great and rinses out easily. It leaves the hair feeling nicely conditioned. In fact, it leaves the hair better conditioned than the conditioner does. I recommend this shampoo but the follow up product is very skippable.</li>
