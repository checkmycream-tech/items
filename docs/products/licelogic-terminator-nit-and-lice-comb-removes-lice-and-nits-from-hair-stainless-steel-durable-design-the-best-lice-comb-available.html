            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>Although this is the best comb I&#x27;ve seen, it still does not remove all nits.</li>
            <li>and its been one of the best things ive bought onlilne.</li>

            <li>This is a great comb and truly effective.  </li>
            <li>I believe the comb did a good job.</li>
            <li>This comb is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This comb is amazing.  </li>
            <li>it did not comb the nits out on its own.</li>
            <li>I needed something for my own hair, and tested it on my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Feels nice</li>
            <li>this is amazing my daughters love it.  </li>
            <li>you seem to get more than you do hair with this comb.</li>
            <li>we were having so many probs getting rid of lice</li>
            <li>Seeing all the bugs and nits come out of her hair was yuck, but did a 100% better job than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ll have this on hand if any if us get lice again.</li>
            <li>more so</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best lice comb on the market!</li>
            <li>This means they easily grab onto whatever is grabbing onto one&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>This cut it down to 2 hours tops and did a great job!</li>
            <li>And we have been lice free 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>This one has the teeth that are very close together to help you comb out nits and lice and get your head clean!!</li>
            <li>This is well worth the price!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s completely clean.  </li>
            <li>Follow up at the prescribed time with the second dose of RID, just for good measure.</li>
            <li>Two weeks later I ran the comb through her hair just to check and we were still good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really is superior to any other available lice/nit comb.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>many, many tries.  </li>
            <li>Every one needs to try this its worth the money</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as expected.</li>
            <li>Because the comb is steel with some rubbery grippy  material built into the handle, it is easy to clean with an old toothbrush then sterilize in boiling water.</li>
            <li>Now even though I can comb through her hair pretty quick, she screams because its ripping her hair out.</li>
            <li>Unlike plastic combs in the box, this combs right through our hair.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t pull hair near as much and Gets the nits a lot better than any nit comb I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>Repeat the combing a week later, and just to make sure, a week after that.  </li>
            <li>It only pulled 2 nits out of her hair, so I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because I had already gotten so many out, or if the comb didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I received this comb and within 30 minutes all three girls were completely nit free.  </li>
            <li>This is a great comb - very sturdy with plenty of room for getting to the scalp through thick hair.</li>
            <li>We came home shampoo&#x27;s conditioned and then used this little miracle, low in behold we could not believe our eyes when we saw how much more we were still able to get, that even the teachers could not see.  </li>
            <li>I had to go through my daughters whole head and pick them out by hand.</li>
            <li>I got this comb because the plastic one that came with the medication pulled her hair too much.  </li>
            <li>This comb works very well.  </li>
            <li>(Plus vacuuming, way too much laundry and bagging up stuffed animals for weeks)  </li>
            <li>The tines are very closely spaced and grooved.</li>
            <li>After our family&#x27;s lice experience, I&#x27;ve learned that nothing really kills the bugs nor their eggs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The ultra long prongs are easy to work through any length of hair.</li>
            <li>It got more out in less time.</li>
            <li>rubberized grip allows you to use the comb with conditioner (I highly suggest doing it that way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for long thick hair.</li>
            <li>On wet hair, it was not quite as effective (but still beat any other comb I tried).</li>
            <li>So when our 4 year old got lice, it has been ongoing for months, we think we have it gone then</li>
            <li>My 5 year old daughter had a mystery case of lice.</li>
            <li>I work at a summer camp, and this year my cabin of nine year old girls had a lice infestation.</li>
            <li>and stuff gets stuck at the very top of the teeth under the round metal holder which makes it difficult to clean properly.</li>
            <li>I have three little girls all in elementary school, so they bring home lice every so often</li>
            <li>We are of European and African decent if that helps with hair type.</li>
            <li>On the first day it pulled more nits and lice out of my daughters long thick hair that any other comb or treatment.</li>
            <li>There is a metal seem on the edges that will pull your hair out if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>My daughter has thick light brown hair, and I had been combing through her hair for a week after treating her once with Nix.  </li>
            <li>On the 2nd day there was still a small amount of nits coming out but by day 3 she was finally lice free.</li>
            <li>When this comb came, I treated her head again (7 days after the first treatment) and then dried her hair per the instructions on the comb package.  </li>
            <li>She has long, thick (but fine) hair</li>

            <li> So far, nothing compares to old fashioned hand picking, at least with regards to the nits.</li>
            <li> I got it a long  time ago.</li>
            <li> We spent $30 4 times at the pharmacy with shampoos, gels, combs, sprays and they came back.  </li>
            <li> My girls&#x27; hair is long and curly and it does tend to get tangled up when using the comb - part of the shape of the comb tines.</li>

            <li> a few weeks later it is back.  </li>
            <li> This comb has wire wrapped around every single section of the comb and it grabs the nit and pulls it through, using this with the olive oil 30 min 2 days in a row</li>
            <li> I saw all the other reviews, plus various other advice columns that recommended this.</li>
            <li> If my kids ever again face the scourge of lice I will reach for the Ladybug and eradicate the little creatures with (very relative) ease.</li>
            <li> We keep missing one or two tiny nits, because we can&#x27;t see.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and will probably last forever.</li>
            <li> all a few weeks later I&#x27;d find another one.  </li>
            <li> I spent tons of money on over the counter treatments before finding this.</li>
            <li> I think it should be clamped closed</li>
            <li> I wet</li>
            <li> and I have spent hours upon hours picking out nits.  </li>
            <li> I know because we did it all with minimal results.</li>
            <li> I did find I had to drag it along her scalp line to get all these missed nits and bugs, but it worked!  </li>
            <li> I still used it a week or 2 afterwards in case anything was missed due to combing and cleaning, but she was in the clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sitting in the health center nearly half a day, I worked along side the nurses, combing out my girls&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> We even started waiting turns to use it, instead of all the other combs on hand!</li>
            <li> The ultra tight comb will get every egg, but some how even works on my thick coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on any other type of comb.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on any other lice comb.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, I&#x27;d buy a new one to see.</li>
            <li> genius ides to make a comb that actually catches/damages the nits in this very common problem for anyone with children in school.</li>
            <li> We had a terrible time getting rid of the lice on my 2 girls, regular lice combs just glide by the critters on their superfine hair.</li>
            <li> daughter had lice over the summer and this little thing saved my life and hers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about this.</li>
            <li> She was getting angry and frustrated with me always having to pick through her hair, and since she&#x27;s blonde, it was a real pain to be doing it by look alone.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone having a hard time with otc lice treatments not working</li>
            <li> After treating lice for approximately 1 month this comb helped resolve the infestation in 2 uses.</li>
            <li> Even with a flashlight it was almost impossible.</li>
            <li> I was sick of the fight every night to get her to sit still.</li>
            <li> Lice are disgusting.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get the worst of it all in two days, but you have to keep combing in the shower for 2 weeks.</li>

            <li> This comb is amazing.  My daughter has thick light brown hair, and I had been combing through her hair for a week after treating her once with Nix.  I kept finding nits every day, and was picking things out by hand.  When this comb came, I treated her head again (7 days after the first treatment) and then dried her hair per the instructions on the comb package.  I sectioned her hair and combed it out, and this comb caught nits/tiny bugs I couldn&#x27;t even see.  This comb is amazing.  Now a day later, I combed through her hair again and it&#x27;s completely clean.  I would recommend this comb to anyone.  It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> you seem to get more than you do hair with this comb. doesn&#x27;t pull hair near as much and Gets the nits a lot better than any nit comb I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Decided to get this comb after buying several different brand kits (I had a collection of plastic and metal combs from various kits).  NONE of them comb out the way this one does.  Finally got rid of lice many, many tries.  The trick is to comb out the hair several times after the treatment.  Repeat the combing a week later, and just to make sure, a week after that.  No nits&#x3D;no recurring lice.</li>
            <li> Lice are disgusting. The best thing to do is treat with an over the counter product like RID, but ALSO buy this Terminator lice and nit comb. The easiest way to use this comb is in the shower (mom and kids wore bathing suits for modesty&#x27;s sake), with conditioner still in the hair to ease the comb through the hair, while rinsing the comb between strokes in a white ceramic bowl of water. You&#x27;ll see the nits and nymphs floating in the bowl. Do this once a day in the evening for 2 weeks, until you don&#x27;t see anymore &amp;#34;debris&amp;#34; (lice, nits, or nymphs). You&#x27;ll get the worst of it all in two days, but you have to keep combing in the shower for 2 weeks. Check the hair thoroughly in the morning and pull out any nits you see before nymphs get a chance to hatch. Follow up at the prescribed time with the second dose of RID, just for good measure. This comb is a godsend!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy the cheaper knockoff</li>
            <li> It does not work as well as it days it does...it did not comb the nits out on its own. I had to go through my daughters whole head and pick them out by hand.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both do not have the greatest vision.  So when our 4 year old got lice, it has been ongoing for months, we think we have it gone then a few weeks later it is back.  We keep missing one or two tiny nits, because we can&#x27;t see.  My daughters teachers were even helping us pick nits after school!!  The day this comb arrived, the teacher had thought they got everything that day.  We came home shampoo&#x27;s conditioned and then used this little miracle, low in behold we could not believe our eyes when we saw how much more we were still able to get, that even the teachers could not see.  I did find I had to drag it along her scalp line to get all these missed nits and bugs, but it worked!  Thank you, I will always recommend this comb to anyone having this problem!!</li>
            <li> Works great! Now can&#x27;t wait for them to be gone!!!</li>
            <li> Does the job as it is supposed to!</li>
            <li> Great comb, does the job.  Great for long thick hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great comb and truly effective.  Don&#x27;t waste money on any other type of comb. This one has the teeth that are very close together to help you comb out nits and lice and get your head clean!!</li>
            <li> Although this is the best comb I&#x27;ve seen, it still does not remove all nits. I needed something for my own hair, and tested it on my daughter&#x27;s hair. I would have a nit in sight on her hair, but when I would use this comb, it did not always grasp the nit. So far, nothing compares to old fashioned hand picking, at least with regards to the nits.</li>
            <li> Works great wish I got it a long  time ago. Every one needs to try this its worth the money</li>
            <li> Got the fleas off my cat with this thing. It&#x27;s heavy and will probably last forever.</li>
            <li> This saved me from lice, couldn&#x27;t get rid of it until, I got this comb and started combing my hair out twice a day.  Eventually got rid of all lice.</li>
            <li> I have tried for months to get rid of the lice in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Just when I thought I got them all a few weeks later I&#x27;d find another one.  This Terminator comb finally did the trick and managed to get all the lice and eggs out.</li>
            <li> this is amazing my daughters love it.  we were having so many probs getting rid of lice and after i read the reviews on this i had to try it out and its been one of the best things ive bought onlilne.</li>
            <li> Best nit comb i&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li> My kid picked up some nits at camp!!!  I got this comb because the plastic one that came with the medication pulled her hair too much.  This comb works very well.  It pulled out stuff I didn&#x27;t see.  The nits haven&#x27;t reappeared after a month si I believe the comb did a good job.</li>
            <li> best thing to use to help rid your child of lice</li>
            <li> After treating lice for approximately 1 month this comb helped resolve the infestation in 2 uses. On the first day it pulled more nits and lice out of my daughters long thick hair that any other comb or treatment. On the 2nd day there was still a small amount of nits coming out but by day 3 she was finally lice free. Two weeks later I ran the comb through her hair just to check and we were still good. I spent tons of money on over the counter treatments before finding this. Would recommend to anyone having a hard time with otc lice treatments not working</li>
            <li> Buy this! Buy this! Buy this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter had lice over the summer and this little thing saved my life and hers! She has long, thick (but fine) hair and I would sit there for hours just picking thru her hair and not even make a dent. This cut it down to 2 hours tops and did a great job! Seeing all the bugs and nits come out of her hair was yuck, but did a 100% better job than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I used this comb, her lice was gone in 2 days. I still used it a week or 2 afterwards in case anything was missed due to combing and cleaning, but she was in the clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ll have this on hand if any if us get lice again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about this. I saw all the other reviews, plus various other advice columns that recommended this. My 5 year old daughter had a mystery case of lice. We had no idea where it came from, and she was the only one in the house who had it, even though she had been sleeping with me in my bed and her brothers who were visiting for summer break. She hadn&#x27;t been anywhere that she could have caught it, so I have no idea where it came from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, we had done the OTC stuff and they came back. She was getting angry and frustrated with me always having to pick through her hair, and since she&#x27;s blonde, it was a real pain to be doing it by look alone. Even with a flashlight it was almost impossible. I was sick of the fight every night to get her to sit still. So, we bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I got a defective one, because all this seems to do is rip her hair out. The edges are unfinished, so her hair gets caught there. Now even though I can comb through her hair pretty quick, she screams because its ripping her hair out. Plus, there is a gap where the teeth are inserted into the handle so things collect there. I think it should be clamped closed more so that doesn&#x27;t happen. I wet comb her hair out with conditioner in it, to minimize knots, and I end up having to take a toothpick and scraping stuff out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I guess it does what it says. It only pulled 2 nits out of her hair, so I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because I had already gotten so many out, or if the comb didn&#x27;t work. We&#x27;ll keep it around just in case there is a next time, especially with school starting, but I wish it wasn&#x27;t defective. If it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, I&#x27;d buy a new one to see.</li>
            <li> We had a terrible time getting rid of the lice on my 2 girls, regular lice combs just glide by the critters on their superfine hair. We spent $30 4 times at the pharmacy with shampoos, gels, combs, sprays and they came back.  This comb has wire wrapped around every single section of the comb and it grabs the nit and pulls it through, using this with the olive oil 30 min 2 days in a row and i didn&#x27;t find anymore on them. (Plus vacuuming, way too much laundry and bagging up stuffed animals for weeks)  And we have been lice free 6 weeks.  I used the fairy tails lice repel shampoo as well since they were going back to daycare and I think that helped too.</li>
            <li> This will help rid your house of these vermin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ultra long prongs are easy to work through any length of hair. The ultra tight comb will get every egg, but some how even works on my thick coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;The rubberized grip allows you to use the comb with conditioner (I highly suggest doing it that way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really is superior to any other available lice/nit comb.</li>
            <li> Seems to do the trick!&lt;br /&gt;Little worried about it keeping up over time (hopefully we won&#x27;t need to use it ever again!) and stuff gets stuck at the very top of the teeth under the round metal holder which makes it difficult to clean properly. I still decided to give it five stars though for the (finally!) genius ides to make a comb that actually catches/damages the nits in this very common problem for anyone with children in school.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as expected.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have found this comb years ago.  I have three little girls all in elementary school, so they bring home lice every so often and I have spent hours upon hours picking out nits.  I received this comb and within 30 minutes all three girls were completely nit free.  This is a MUST for any mom with girls still in school.</li>
            <li> got out all the lice!</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best lice comb on the market! I work at a summer camp, and this year my cabin of nine year old girls had a lice infestation. Sitting in the health center nearly half a day, I worked along side the nurses, combing out my girls&#x27; hair. In my opinion, The Terminator was the best comb we used. We even started waiting turns to use it, instead of all the other combs on hand! It got more out in less time. My go to tool in times of lice emergencies!</li>
            <li> Even though the description calls it the LiceLogic Terminator Nit Comb, what I received was branded as Ladybug. No matter, it worked great. The tines are very closely spaced and grooved. This means they easily grab onto whatever is grabbing onto one&#x27;s hair. The instructions say to use it on dry or nearly dry hair. I have to agree. On wet hair, it was not quite as effective (but still beat any other comb I tried). Because the comb is steel with some rubbery grippy  material built into the handle, it is easy to clean with an old toothbrush then sterilize in boiling water. If my kids ever again face the scourge of lice I will reach for the Ladybug and eradicate the little creatures with (very relative) ease.</li>
            <li> Incredible file pulling nits off and riding the pesky lice</li>
            <li> This is a great comb - very sturdy with plenty of room for getting to the scalp through thick hair. My girls&#x27; hair is long and curly and it does tend to get tangled up when using the comb - part of the shape of the comb tines. But it removes even the tiniest fleck of dander.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the price! Unlike plastic combs in the box, this combs right through our hair. I luv playing w/it ..running it through my hair while watching tv lol. Feels nice</li>
            <li> the only comb that actually got out all the nits and lice from my childs hair. would recommend this comb to anyone with children.</li>
            <li> This thing pulled the remainder of our indestructible pests out of our hair. We are of European and African decent if that helps with hair type.</li>
            <li> There is a metal seem on the edges that will pull your hair out if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> After our family&#x27;s lice experience, I&#x27;ve learned that nothing really kills the bugs nor their eggs. You basically have to comb them out, and this is the only comb that will get them out. Don&#x27;t waste your money on any other lice comb. Don&#x27;t poison yourself with the over the counter lice treatments. Don&#x27;t soak your head in Listerine for two hours. None of those things will work...I know because we did it all with minimal results. What ultimately got rid of our lice problem was this comb and some detangler spray to make it possible to comb the hair without weeping and gnashing of teeth. We also used products from Lice Knowing You and were very happy.</li>
            <li> tried multiple combs and treatment. this comb actually is tighter between teeth adn works!</li>
