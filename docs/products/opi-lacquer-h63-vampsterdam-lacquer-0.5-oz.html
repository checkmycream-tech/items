            <li>This polish is so nice.</li>
            <li>Nice purple hue polish</li>
            <li>I cannot say much about how chip resistant it is because I can&#x27;t ever get my nails to look flawless for more than two days since I use my hands a lot.</li>
            <li>The color as absolutely fantastic and provides good coverage.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this color!  </li>
            <li>The varnish was a good consistency and came quickly.</li>
            <li>I tend to do that with most of my OPI</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have received many compliments.  </li>
            <li>Another favorite of mine.  </li>
            <li>I love the OPI names.</li>
            <li>I love the name of this</li>
            <li>It was well packaged for safe shipping and arrived sooner than promised.</li>
            <li>I love this color and the James Bond line is a plus.  </li>
            <li>Great color detail and very chip</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>It is in keeping with the OPI constant of excellent quality.  </li>
            <li>time I will apply a top coat which should add more shine and staying power.</li>
            <li>I happened to try this color at the nail salon and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite polish.  </li>
            <li>I really love this color.</li>
            <li>one of my favorite OPI colors.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments when I wear this color.</li>
            <li>This is a stunning fall vampy color.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this color.</li>
            <li>Truthfully, I get my toes done at the salon but loved this color so much, I bought a bottle from Amazon</li>
            <li>Great near neutral color that wears for seven days!  </li>
            <li>Love the price and the product is SUPER!</li>
            <li>Enjoy:)</li>
            <li>To be honest, it is the exact color of a used tampon.</li>
            <li>Lasts longer and delivery is absolutely quick!</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>I love this so much OPI has taken over my manicure case.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true you do get what you pay for and aren&#x27;t you worth it?</li>
            <li>Have received many compliments as my new pedicure color choice.</li>
            <li>Overall I love this nail polish!</li>
            <li>Nice rich color, dries quickly with one coat, but is not really shiny.  </li>
            <li>A really nice deep plum color.</li>
            <li>I rarely have to touch it up...</li>
            <li>If you like a classy light color also buy \\&quot;Sweetheart\\&quot; by OPI.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty color more like a deep plum color</li>
            <li>So be aware that you will receive one bottle.  </li>
            <li>The color is very deep and I, for one, think it makes my wife&#x27;s hands look even better than they already do.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t apply a top coat, and after 2 days the polish on my nail edges was wearing away, and now on the third day it&#x27;s chipping on 6 nails and the gloss is mostly gone, thus, only four stars.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for this Winter.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>I love this deep plum color.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite go to color for fall but especially for October!</li>
            <li>It looks really pretty.</li>
            <li>Most of the time my manicure is French but ever so often there is a shade that I just have to put on my fingernails.</li>
            <li>Besides Vamsterdam, Midnight in Moscow is another amazing dark color.</li>
            <li>Nice dark color.</li>
            <li>I always wear &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not really a waitress&amp;#34; and decided to try some new colors, glad I did!</li>
            <li>Once dry, the polish has a more matte finish rather than a glossy one.  </li>
            <li>Another beautiful deep red from OPI, I cant seem to get enough of these colors.</li>
            <li>The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it chips really easily, too fast.</li>
            <li>Based on previous reviews I thought this would be an awesome deep red color,</li>
            <li>and I was in such awww</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>if I should paint my nails the same color because my nails are short but nice.  </li>
            <li>If you enjoy rich long lasting color, you have got to try this.</li>
            <li>This color is deep and true.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this polish for purchase.</li>
            <li>Overall, pretty color though!</li>
            <li>colors, this is one of my new favs.</li>
            <li>, this is my new fave,  </li>
            <li>Other than the inaccurate description, the polish itself is of good quality and is long lasting.  </li>
            <li>Near black inside, but stunning dark plum in natural light.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t chip as quick as other brands.</li>
            <li>I am a major fan of OPI since first starting to get my nails professionally done.  </li>
            <li>I recently got a manicure with this nail color and really like it.</li>
            <li>I wanted a color that is very different from my current collection of polishes, and I certainly got that!</li>
            <li>The polish is such a rich, deep color and OPI lasts so long.</li>
            <li>The color is a deep purple that sometime looks a little maroon depending on the light as it has some brown and red undertones.</li>

            <li> , this is my new fave,  </li>
            <li> Other than the inaccurate description, the polish itself is of good quality and is long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Near black inside, but stunning dark plum in natural light.</li>

            <li> I am a major fan of OPI since first starting to get my nails professionally done.  </li>

            <li> The polish is such a rich, deep color and OPI lasts so long.</li>
            <li> The color is a deep purple that sometime looks a little maroon depending on the light as it has some brown and red undertones.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and informed them about the inaccurate description, and in a nutshell, they simply said they were not responsible for amazon&#x27;s inaccurate description.  </li>
            <li> Glimmer is subtle, not too much sparkle,</li>
            <li> I was really nervous when I bought this color, because I usually don&#x27;t wear anything this dark.  </li>
            <li> The color looks deep purple or dark plum.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who likes OPI&amp;#34;s dark colors and deep purples.</li>
            <li> If you are an OPI enthusiast, it is very similar but slightly darker than Suzi and the 7 Dusseldorfs.</li>
            <li> You will love it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> So due to the lack of shine and inaccurate description along with crappy customer service, I deducted 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever get a manicure-- and decided to get the same color that of the workers was wearing.</li>
            <li> Dark purple</li>
            <li> I like to wear dark colors</li>
            <li> At least it has a flat brush.</li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t look like black.  </li>
            <li> Almost black.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s when it got really dark and a little glossy.</li>
            <li> With two coats it has a little bit deeper plum color than what this picture shows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dark purplish/plum color........</li>
            <li> I must have at least a half dozen &amp;#34;deep red&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I purchased this polish a few weeks ago and have not stopped wearing it since I got it!</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s what I usually do so</li>
            <li> One coat over an OPI base coat is a pretty translucent burgundy.</li>
            <li> This is WRONG INFORMATION!  </li>
            <li> Pardon my language, but this color is awful.</li>

            <li> Honestly, I bought it because of it&#x27;s name. I tend to do that with most of my OPI colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does look great on my fingernails. I feel pseudo - hip. And I like telling people what the name is.</li>
            <li> Good color. Love the price and the product is SUPER!</li>
            <li> looks great! Love this color!! I always wear &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not really a waitress&amp;#34; and decided to try some new colors, glad I did!</li>
            <li> I bought this color and I had a pedicure yesterday and it is absolutely beautiful.  The picture here does not do this color justice.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should paint my nails the same color because my nails are short but nice.  I went for it and I love it.  I have received many compliments.  You will love it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  If you like a classy light color also buy \\&quot;Sweetheart\\&quot; by OPI.  Another favorite of mine.  Enjoy:)</li>

            <li> This is a pretty color more like a deep plum color I love the name of this but I bought this because I think this is a nice Fall and Winter color.</li>
            <li> Love OPI polish best. This color is deep and true. It was well packaged for safe shipping and arrived sooner than promised. I would recommend this polish, this color, and this seller.</li>
            <li> I love this color and the James Bond line is a plus.  Great color detail and very chip resistant. Will order again.</li>
            <li> The description reads that this polish is a 20 pack.  This is WRONG INFORMATION!  I contacted the seller and informed them about the inaccurate description, and in a nutshell, they simply said they were not responsible for amazon&#x27;s inaccurate description.  So be aware that you will receive one bottle.  Other than the inaccurate description, the polish itself is of good quality and is long lasting.  The color looks deep purple or dark plum.  Nice rich color, dries quickly with one coat, but is not really shiny.  Once dry, the polish has a more matte finish rather than a glossy one.  So due to the lack of shine and inaccurate description along with crappy customer service, I deducted 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I purchased this polish a few weeks ago and have not stopped wearing it since I got it! The color is beautiful. A really nice deep plum color.</li>
            <li> This polish is so nice. I love it. I highly recommend this polish for purchase. This is a good brand of polish.</li>
            <li> I had this polish put on at the salon and I was in such awww I had to buy it for myself.........It&#x27;s very dark purplish/plum color........and I love it</li>
            <li> Another beautiful deep red from OPI, I cant seem to get enough of these colors. I must have at least a half dozen &amp;#34;deep red&amp;#34; colors, this is one of my new favs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my rockin&#x27; wife.  She has fair skin and darker colors look great on her.  She loves this color.  It is in keeping with the OPI constant of excellent quality.  It&#x27;s lasting and coats well.  The color is very deep and I, for one, think it makes my wife&#x27;s hands look even better than they already do.</li>
            <li> Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
            <li> Looks the same in person!</li>
            <li> My wife, she loves it!</li>
            <li> If you enjoy rich long lasting color, you have got to try this. I love this so much OPI has taken over my manicure case. It&#x27;s true you do get what you pay for and aren&#x27;t you worth it?</li>
            <li> Great near neutral color that wears for seven days!  It has an awesome shine that lasts and lasts. This is one of my OPI Favs!</li>
            <li> The only polish I (and my nail tech) use is OPI. I especially love the purple and violet colors and this one truly fits the bill. The polish is such a rich, deep color and OPI lasts so long. I rarely have to touch it up...my nails grow out before there are any chips. I won&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
            <li> I wanted a color that is very different from my current collection of polishes, and I certainly got that! One coat over an OPI base coat is a pretty translucent burgundy. Since I didn&#x27;t do an even application I applied a second coat and that&#x27;s when it got really dark and a little glossy. The color appears as in the advertised picture and looks good with my medium skin tone. I didn&#x27;t apply a top coat, and after 2 days the polish on my nail edges was wearing away, and now on the third day it&#x27;s chipping on 6 nails and the gloss is mostly gone, thus, only four stars.&lt;br /&gt;Next time I will apply a top coat which should add more shine and staying power.</li>
            <li> I happened to try this color at the nail salon and fell in love with it. Have received many compliments as my new pedicure color choice.</li>
            <li> Nice purple hue polish</li>
            <li> Love love love this color!  This is my favorite polish.  Dark purple but doesn&#x27;t look like black.  Product arrived in great shape and in the time specified.</li>
            <li> Excellent color! For those who lover deep purple, this is it! Lasts longer and delivery is absolutely quick!</li>
            <li> Based on previous reviews I thought this would be an awesome deep red color, something around blood red and red wine. To be honest, it is the exact color of a used tampon. Pardon my language, but this color is awful. At least it has a flat brush.</li>
            <li> Nice dark color. Almost black. Goes on smoothly and evenly. I like to wear dark colors I&#x27;m the winter. Product is great.</li>
            <li> Great nail polish for good price,  The color as absolutely fantastic and provides good coverage.  I&#x27;ll be back for more.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really love this color. Shipping was fast. The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it chips really easily, too fast. Overall, pretty color though!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for this Winter. The color is a deep purple that sometime looks a little maroon depending on the light as it has some brown and red undertones. It took two coats to get a uniform color but that&#x27;s what I usually do so no complaints there. I cannot say much about how chip resistant it is because I can&#x27;t ever get my nails to look flawless for more than two days since I use my hands a lot. Overall I love this nail polish!</li>
            <li> one of my favorite OPI colors. I got exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Great Color. My nails are my own and it did take 3 coats to look gorgeous!! I would recommend this to anyone who likes OPI&amp;#34;s dark colors and deep purples.</li>
            <li> I love this deep plum color. The varnish was a good consistency and came quickly. Truthfully, I get my toes done at the salon but loved this color so much, I bought a bottle from Amazon so I can ensure I get it when I have a pedi. My toes look great!</li>
            <li> I get many compliments when I wear this color. It is my favorite go to color for fall but especially for October!</li>
            <li> I love this color! Doesn&#x27;t chip as quick as other brands. I think OPI is overpriced, but I still buy it!</li>
            <li> I am a major fan of OPI since first starting to get my nails professionally done.  This is a great color and it takes a lot to show any wear and tear.  Great polish.</li>
            <li> I recently got a manicure with this nail color and really like it. I hardly ever get a manicure-- and decided to get the same color that of the workers was wearing. With two coats it has a little bit deeper plum color than what this picture shows. This color is perfect for fall!</li>
            <li> I was really nervous when I bought this color, because I usually don&#x27;t wear anything this dark.  I wore it on my toes when I went out with friends, and got a lot of complitments on it.  It looks really pretty.</li>
            <li> Great shade for both manicures and pedicures. Most of the time my manicure is French but ever so often there is a shade that I just have to put on my fingernails. Love it!</li>
            <li> the color is beautiful and as always i love OPI its the only polish i use and i will b buying again</li>
            <li> Fashion-forward color.  Glimmer is subtle, not too much sparkle, like I like.  Have a mountain of nail colors, this is my new fave,  Came back, bought a back up.</li>
            <li> This is a stunning fall vampy color. Near black inside, but stunning dark plum in natural light. If you are an OPI enthusiast, it is very similar but slightly darker than Suzi and the 7 Dusseldorfs.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color. It&#x27;s, in my opinion, a deep purple with brown undertones</li>
            <li> OPI Nail polish is the best around ! Thankyou for sending my nail polish. It&#x27;s terrific !</li>
            <li> Fiance loves the color!</li>
