            <li>and it&#x27;s held up nicely.</li>
            <li>It cleans my makeup brushes with ease and is so effective at reshaping and getting all iciness of my brushes.</li>

            <li>and I do think I&#x27;d like that better but won&#x27;t buy it til this glove is looking worn out.</li>
            <li>Great product, can&#x27;t believe how much cleaner my brushes are using this vs washing just by hand.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very happy with it overall.  </li>
            <li>The should look into making it a bit more snug</li>
            <li>Beyond satisfied.</li>

            <li>Enjoy it!</li>
            <li>love it&lt;br /&gt;works</li>
            <li>love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li>But after I was done, I had to figure out how to clean the glove because it was coated in make up!  </li>
            <li>which I think is the most important thing.</li>
            <li>Makes washing your brushes quick and easy, best part, you use clean water and know when the water runs clear the brush is clean.</li>
            <li>The glove makes it so easy and literally EVERYTHING comes out of the brush.</li>
            <li>Works great to deep clean my brushes!</li>
            <li>Two sides make it great for eye brushes and big brushes.</li>
            <li>this glove really clean brushes and its so easy to use</li>
            <li>If you are a professional makeup artist or makeup junkie you need this glove!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too happy to have found it here for more than 10 dollars less than the original price.</li>
            <li>my brushes are so clean.</li>
            <li>My hands didn&#x27;t touch water at all and all of my brushes are squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Does the job but not as great as I expected</li>
            <li>It helps make the job go relatively quickly</li>
            <li>I have far more $$ invested in my brushes</li>
            <li>It most definitely gets the make up brushes clean.</li>
            <li>Such an easy way to clean all my makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>It cuts your brush cleaning time in half and does a really good job.</li>
            <li>She showed me how she is able to gently super clean her makeup brushes and explained how expensive brushes are so she is thrilled to receive this Spa Cleaning Glove.</li>
            <li>I really debated on this one and whether it would be worth it  -</li>
            <li>I dont think this glove is worth the money, it is handy but does clean the brushes well enough but not worth full price..maybe $15 max.</li>
            <li>the glove is a bit big, its not a problem for me too much although I wish it fit more snuggly however, my business partner has smaller hands than I</li>
            <li>I normally have to do 4-5 clean and rinses each brush to really get them back to their original color by hand, and</li>
            <li>and I think in the long run I will be so happy I spent the money.</li>
            <li>I really like this glove for cleaning all my makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it saved too much time</li>
            <li>This glove makes cleaning brushes so much easier - I still don&#x27;t like to do it and put it off longer than I should, but this helps get the job done faster.  </li>
            <li>Cleans MakeUp brushes really well</li>
            <li>I really like this glove</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to not damage your brushes but the ridges help clean and rinse everything out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had is about 6 months and use it weekly - along with some of my regular shampoo - to clean a variety of brush sizes.  </li>
            <li>I use to dread washing my brushes...mainly because my hands get super sensitive and sometimes gets super dry afterwards and peel.</li>
            <li>All in all, it is a pretty nifty little product to use to clean brushes, and you can clean more than one small brushes at a time.</li>
            <li>I use it with high quality shampoo or brush cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I use it religiously and it really is worth the investment.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it if you want your brushes to last a longer</li>
            <li>I was not too happy about spending 40 bucks on a glove to clean make up brushes, but I hate doing it and hoped this would really save me time.  </li>
            <li>It also took a week to even ship out from the seller, so I looked at the other selling options before writing this review and saw that this seller also offered a free gift...</li>
            <li>It still looks like new</li>
            <li>If you have only two or three personal brushes that you use for your own personal use, you may not find this necessary.</li>
            <li>I only have 2 brushes to clean weekly, yet it takes me so long to do them..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind that it was used by the previous owner at all because I know that its clean from all of the cleaning of the brushes.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this really lathered them up and got in deep.  </li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty big for my hand, which is why I only gave it 4 stars.  </li>
            <li>If you have a lot of make-up brushes you use daily, I highly recommend investing in this product.</li>
            <li>and I definitely use less product trying to clean my brushes.  </li>
            <li>ITS SIMPLE, BUY THE GLOVE AND HAVE MORE TIME TO DO OTHER THINGS!!!!</li>
            <li>Well I tried some of the other options and this glove is what really works.  </li>

            <li> My only gripe (besides the ridiculous price tag) is that it fits large, even with the soft glove underneath.  </li>
            <li> I dont know what took me so long to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this together with the sigma dry &#x27;n shape - and I generally dry the brushes overnight.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, its not worth $35 plus shipping.</li>
            <li> , maybe cut it in half, but it did make the process seem a lot easier to me.  </li>
            <li> Cuts cleaning time in half</li>
            <li> It simplifies the process and the brushes come out cleaner with less cleanser.</li>
            <li> I saw a few makeup gurus use this brush</li>
            <li> Cuts my brush cleaning time in half!</li>
            <li> Yes, everyone is saying it is too expensive and there are other options.  </li>
            <li> However, I have small hands and it is a bit uncomfortable and weird to hold.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> its too expensive ...</li>
            <li> Although it is expensive I would still recommend this product.</li>
            <li> But having dirty brushes is worse because the skin on your face starts to pay the price for it.</li>
            <li> Not one bit sorry.  </li>
            <li> My hand tends to slide around inside the glove, even with the liner, so it is a bit awkward.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> It was a gift but the recipient is thrilled with the glove!  Said it works great!</li>
            <li> Best thing I ever got</li>
            <li> I really like this glove for cleaning all my makeup brushes. I bought this quite awhile ago and it&#x27;s held up nicely. Sigma did come out with a brush cleaning mat and I do think I&#x27;d like that better but won&#x27;t buy it til this glove is looking worn out.</li>
            <li> Great product, can&#x27;t believe how much cleaner my brushes are using this vs washing just by hand. I&#x27;ve never seen my MAC stippling brush white since I bought it!</li>
            <li> Works great to deep clean my brushes!</li>
            <li> I have sooo many makeup brushes and it took me FOREVER to clean all of them!!! The day I received my Sigma glove, I washed my brushes and I was amazed at how quickly and efficiently it cleaned them all!!!! You need to purchase this!!</li>
            <li> IF YOU DON&#x27;T BUY THIS GLOVE, YOU&#x27;LL JUST SPEND A WEEK CLEANING YOUR BRUSHES VS. 10 MINUTES. YOU DECIDE WHAT U WANT TO DO. ITS SIMPLE, BUY THE GLOVE AND HAVE MORE TIME TO DO OTHER THINGS!!!!</li>
            <li> I was not too happy about spending 40 bucks on a glove to clean make up brushes, but I hate doing it and hoped this would really save me time.  I only have 2 brushes to clean weekly, yet it takes me so long to do them.. I think it is my foundation (cover girl.. yuck).  Anyway, this really lathered them up and got in deep.  I normally have to do 4-5 clean and rinses each brush to really get them back to their original color by hand, and this did it one pass following the directions.  But after I was done, I had to figure out how to clean the glove because it was coated in make up!  I wouldn&#x27;t say it saved too much time, maybe cut it in half, but it did make the process seem a lot easier to me.

            <li> I really debated on this one and whether it would be worth it  - but I&#x27;m very happy with it overall.  I&#x27;ve had is about 6 months and use it weekly - along with some of my regular shampoo - to clean a variety of brush sizes.  It helps make the job go relatively quickly and I feel that the brushes are getting a very effective cleaning.  It still looks like new and I expect it will last quite some time. I purchased this together with the sigma dry &#x27;n shape - and I generally dry the brushes overnight.</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time with everything stated in the description. Product works just as described in all the reviews I watched. Cuts cleaning time in half and I definitely use less product trying to clean my brushes.  I&#x27;m too happy to have found it here for more than 10 dollars less than the original price. In my opinion, its not worth $35 plus shipping. I don&#x27;t mind that it was used by the previous owner at all because I know that its clean from all of the cleaning of the brushes. I&#x27;m happy that I bought this product and even happier that I didn&#x27;t have to pay full price for it!</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- IT CLEANS THE BRUSHES WELL ... which I think is the most important thing. It does what it is suppose to and cut my brush washing time in half&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- its too expensive ... however it does pay for itself over time so this may not be a con depending on what you can afford, and even then its a good investment&lt;br /&gt;- the glove is a bit big, its not a problem for me too much although I wish it fit more snuggly however, my business partner has smaller hands than I so she hates using it because it flops all over the place.  The should look into making it a bit more snug</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagin cleaning my brushes without this glove. I dont know what took me so long to purchase it. I saw a few makeup gurus use this brush and I was impressed with what I saw. I am very, very pleased!</li>
            <li> This glove makes cleaning brushes so much easier - I still don&#x27;t like to do it and put it off longer than I should, but this helps get the job done faster.

Makes a great gift also!</li>
            <li> This is the best thing since liquid foundation! Makes washing your brushes quick and easy, best part, you use clean water and know when the water runs clear the brush is clean. Two sides make it great for eye brushes and big brushes. Highly recommended for those that buy and use good quality make up brushes!</li>
            <li> Does the job but not as great as I expected</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist. I have dozens of brushes that I wash on a weekly or biweekly basis. this brush is a must for anyone cleaning loads of brushes. It simplifies the process and the brushes come out cleaner with less cleanser. Although it is expensive I would still recommend this product. If you have only two or three personal brushes that you use for your own personal use, you may not find this necessary. If you are a professional makeup artist or makeup junkie you need this glove!!!!!! (and I love the purple color)</li>
            <li> Cleans MakeUp brushes really well</li>
            <li> Enjoy it! Cuts my brush cleaning time in half!</li>

            <li> It most definitely gets the make up brushes clean. However, I have small hands and it is a bit uncomfortable and weird to hold.&lt;br /&gt;I personally think it is a bit overpriced, but it does the job well.</li>
            <li> love it&lt;br /&gt;works great</li>
            <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li> I use to dread washing my brushes...mainly because my hands get super sensitive and sometimes gets super dry afterwards and peel. But having dirty brushes is worse because the skin on your face starts to pay the price for it. The glove makes it so easy and literally EVERYTHING comes out of the brush. It&#x27;s gentle enough to not damage your brushes but the ridges help clean and rinse everything out. My hands didn&#x27;t touch water at all and all of my brushes are squeaky clean. If you have a lot of make-up brushes you use daily, I highly recommend investing in this product. It cuts your brush cleaning time in half and does a really good job.</li>
            <li> me and my brushes love this! this glove really clean brushes and its so easy to use</li>
            <li> Yes, everyone is saying it is too expensive and there are other options.  Well I tried some of the other options and this glove is what really works.  It is specifically designed for all your brush cleaning needs - from cleaning, rinsing, to grooming your brushes.  I have far more $$ invested in my brushes so I decided to go ahead and get this glove.  Not one bit sorry.  Love it!  Definetly an investment in my brushes and a huge time saver!</li>
            <li> My daughter picked this out as a Christmas gift she wanted. She loves it. She showed me how she is able to gently super clean her makeup brushes and explained how expensive brushes are so she is thrilled to receive this Spa Cleaning Glove.</li>
