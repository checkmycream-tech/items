            <li>Arrived promptly and she loved them.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with these colors.</li>
            <li>It is also a way to make a bright summer color more of a \\&quot;winter\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The colors in this set are spectacular.  </li>
            <li>They did not come in a &amp;#34;pack&amp;#34; or box of any kind.  </li>
            <li>A nice group of color choices.</li>
            <li>The matte top coat is nice to change up things.  </li>
            <li>I will say it is a nice collection to have, they each have a nice shine and are easy to go on.</li>
            <li>the smell was interesting....</li>
            <li>As I said, I love the colors but these are not for me.</li>
            <li>Purple is my favorite color</li>
            <li>If you love purple then these are the colors for you.</li>
            <li>I have bought more kleancolor nail polish for others.</li>
            <li>I will for sure be ordering more of these sets.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>love the colors.</li>
            <li>I love purple.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are a fabulous brand to buy- great quality and very very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I always start off with very clean nails</li>
            <li>but if you are looking for something that is a good polish in pretty colors I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using this brand, and now I have purchased more!</li>
            <li>The package arrived extremely quickly, too, which was a plus!</li>
            <li>These nailpolish colors are fantastic.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to buy these.</li>
            <li>I am a first time kleancolor user &amp; I just love these colors.</li>
            <li>I love the colors but these polishes do not stay on very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have issues with chipping, and find that even without a top coat they shine very well for days.</li>
            <li>The colors are gorgeous especially if you love purples there are a few different shades and all very beautiful.</li>
            <li>then that the colors are very pretty</li>
            <li>it goes on easy and dries fast.</li>
            <li>Shipping was also fast and easy</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;+ Comes with mat topcoat just for fun</li>
            <li>Maybe for the young kids today they would be ok but not for me.</li>
            <li>The brushes are normal size and make the polish go on easy.</li>
            <li>Same or better quality than chi, opi, essie, etc.</li>
            <li>I was iffy at first because I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors.</li>
            <li>I thought these looked pretty when I was shopping-</li>
            <li>These polishes actually turned out better than I thought they would.</li>
            <li>i was really hopping for the matte</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t like the fact you are high maintenance!</li>
            <li>Shipping was lighting fast</li>
            <li>I never really tried this brand but when I saw the colors and the price I couldn&#x27;t pass it up, and I&#x27;m so glad that I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>They are very pretty!&lt;br</li>
            <li>They came really fast and each bottle was wrapped in cardboard and then all of them were packed into the box with foam</li>
            <li>I purchased a second set as well as I liked them enough.</li>
            <li>Also they go on smoothly and dry fairly fast.</li>
            <li>I normally use Sinful Colors and thought I would give these a try.</li>
            <li>I normally use 2 coasts of Sinful colors, but with these, I had to use 3-4 coats.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is normal for Kleancolor, of it</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money - you can get better product at your corner drug store or dollar store.</li>
            <li>The dark blue is a gorgeous unusual blue that you can&#x27;t find elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Some of the shades look a little more blue, but it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li>They are regular size bottles and the colors are really neat.</li>
            <li>All of the polishes were old and clumpy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they changed out the Matte top coat for White polish or if they just messed up my order since the other colors were correct, but that was what I received white polish instead of Matte.</li>
            <li>The polish does go on a little thick but other than that these are great.</li>
            <li>about a year since I&#x27;ve had these and the polishes are still going strong out of the 6 polishes i&#x27;ve only had to throw one away because it became all thick and clumpy.</li>
            <li>these are just old polishes that have been sitting in storage too long.</li>
            <li>All of the colors are very pretty and last at least a week once applied.</li>

            <li> was what I expected from the product.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed that I did not receive the Matte top coat (which is why I gave it 3 stars as opposed to 4).</li>
            <li> They are a little thick and like with all kleancolor</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any issue with clumping or the polish being thick, but if so a little nail polish thinner should do the trick to make it a bit easier.</li>
            <li> The polish usually lasts for four days for me before I have to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only bad thing about these polishes is that they have an odd smell.</li>
            <li> Got these colors as they were the &#x27;in&#x27; thing lately....</li>
            <li> I am purple fanatic and while I like this collection</li>
            <li> This is a very thin polish and has a very bad, strong odor.</li>
            <li> but the brush part is so thin that it is hard to paint your nails....</li>
            <li> The polishes are very thick and syrupy.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> I also like the Madly Matte it gives you the option to change the look of your nailpolish, although I don&#x27;t find myself using it too often since I like the colors the way they are.</li>

            <li> They are a little thick and like with all kleancolor the smell was interesting.... But the colors are beautiful!</li>
            <li> i was really hopping for the matte but instead i got halo ughhh other then that the colors are very pretty</li>
            <li> I love the colors but these polishes do not stay on very well. I take great care of my nails and am always looking for some great polish. I have tried the expensive stuff and the cheap stuff and find that these polishes do not hold up. I normally use Sinful Colors and thought I would give these a try. I have to touch up my nails every day on the tips and had to fill in areas where the polish had chipped. This is a very thin polish and has a very bad, strong odor. I normally use 2 coasts of Sinful colors, but with these, I had to use 3-4 coats. I always start off with very clean nails so the polish stays on but these just did not hold up. Sorry Kleancolor - I just don&#x27;t like the fact you are high maintenance! As I said, I love the colors but these are not for me. I will give these to my daughter to use - she changes her polish almost every day so these will probably work for her.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for our daughter-in-law and she loves it.  They are regular size bottles and the colors are really neat.</li>
            <li> Great pop of color!  Same or better quality than chi, opi, essie, etc.The matte top coat is nice to change up things.  It is also a way to make a bright summer color more of a \\&quot;winter\\&quot; look color.  This was my first time using this brand, and now I have purchased more!</li>
            <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;+ The colors in this set are spectacular.  If you&#x27;re a &#x27;purple person&#x27; you&#x27;ll be delighted.&lt;br /&gt;+ Shipping was lighting fast&lt;br /&gt;+ Comes with mat topcoat just for fun&lt;br /&gt;+ Very good price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;- The polishes are very thick and syrupy.  These are the only Kleancolor polishes I have, so I don&#x27;t know if this is normal for Kleancolor, of it these are just old polishes that have been sitting in storage too long.</li>
            <li> I never really tried this brand but when I saw the colors and the price I couldn&#x27;t pass it up, and I&#x27;m so glad that I didn&#x27;t. The colors are gorgeous especially if you love purples there are a few different shades and all very beautiful. I also like the Madly Matte it gives you the option to change the look of your nailpolish, although I don&#x27;t find myself using it too often since I like the colors the way they are. Also they go on smoothly and dry fairly fast. The polish usually lasts for four days for me before I have to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:7/30/12- It&#x27;s been about a year since I&#x27;ve had these and the polishes are still going strong out of the 6 polishes i&#x27;ve only had to throw one away because it became all thick and clumpy. In no way do these compare to quality brands like OPI but if you are looking for something that is a good polish in pretty colors I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Purple is my favorite color so I was excited to buy these. They are very pretty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing about these polishes is that they have an odd smell. It reminds me of those bubbles with the wand from when I was younger. The polish does go on a little thick but other than that these are great.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these colors. I was iffy at first because I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand. But now i have my friends wanting to buy them. They are actually prettier in person than in the picture.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for a friend who loves purple. Some of the shades look a little more blue, but it&#x27;s alright. Arrived promptly and she loved them.</li>
            <li> These nailpolish colors are fantastic. Great 16th birthday gift for my sister! The package arrived extremely quickly, too, which was a plus!</li>
            <li> They did not come in a &amp;#34;pack&amp;#34; or box of any kind.  While they were individually wrapped in bubble wrap, one of the bottles was  broken and the bubble wrap was full of purple nail polish.</li>
            <li> All of the polishes were old and clumpy. Don&#x27;t waste your money - you can get better product at your corner drug store or dollar store.</li>

            <li> Pretty colors. Worked well for the price. I purchased a second set as well as I liked them enough. Lovely!!</li>

The dark blue is a gorgeous unusual blue that you can&#x27;t find elsewhere. All of the colors are very pretty and last at least a week once applied.

            <li> Satisfied with my purchase. A nice group of color choices.</li>
            <li> Got these colors as they were the &#x27;in&#x27; thing lately....but the brush part is so thin that it is hard to paint your nails....takes forever and no substance to the bristles.  Maybe for the young kids today they would be ok but not for me. Colors were GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> I am purple fanatic and while I like this collection I&#x27;m a little disappointed that I did not receive the Matte top coat (which is why I gave it 3 stars as opposed to 4). I don&#x27;t know if they changed out the Matte top coat for White polish or if they just messed up my order since the other colors were correct, but that was what I received white polish instead of Matte. I will say it is a nice collection to have, they each have a nice shine and are easy to go on. I don&#x27;t have any issue with clumping or the polish being thick, but if so a little nail polish thinner should do the trick to make it a bit easier. The brushes are normal size and make the polish go on easy. Shipping was also fast and easy considering I had 2 different orders from the same place. Kleancolor, is cheaper than O.P.I and China Glaze, but still a quality product. I don&#x27;t have issues with chipping, and find that even without a top coat they shine very well for days.</li>
            <li> was what I expected from the product. love the colors. it was sent on or before time. great price also</li>
            <li> I got this for the simple fact that it is purple!! I love purple. These polishes actually turned out better than I thought they would. Great buy for the price and great colors.</li>
