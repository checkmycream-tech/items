            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find the cherry flavor Vaseline anywhere, and was very excited to find it!</li>
            <li>This lip care product isn&#x27;t amazing.</li>
            <li>It was cheap, but great quality.</li>
            <li>The absolute best thing since sliced bread!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy and so timely with Amazon!</li>
            <li>The cherry flavor absorbs into your skin rather than just sit on top of your lips.</li>
            <li>Say goodbye to cracked and bleeding lips that repel and repulse by applying only the best.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Vaseline Lip Therapy, Cherry for many years.</li>

            <li>I keep a tube in my pocket and purse and use it many times a day.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact it comes in packs of 12.</li>

            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>My Hubby Love the cherry lip Therapy</li>
            <li>I wish i didnt have 10 more to use.</li>
            <li>Great price, fast receipt.  </li>
            <li>Great product... really works on chapped lips</li>
            <li>works better than chapstick and carmex burns my lips.  </li>
            <li>I love this product for lip moisture.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li>I have used the Cherry version of the Vaseline Lip Therapy for many years.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff, fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>So glad to find the cherry flavor on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Love buying it in bulk...</li>
            <li>so glad to be able to order in bulk (Pack of 12)</li>
            <li>Working pretty good</li>
            <li>I would not be as comfortable talking, or showing my face for that matter, without these magical lip therapy.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t sell this at the stores near me, so I am happy again.</li>
            <li>Easy to carry in my purse or pocket.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure once I&#x27;m off the medication I&#x27;ll continue to use this product since there&#x27;s no doubt it will give me amazing soft healthy lips.</li>
            <li>and I got it pretty quickly too! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Oh and did I mention the fresh, cherry scent?!</li>
            <li>Items not in original packaging and</li>
            <li>I have used this for many years and love the application ease and keeping my lips soft!</li>
            <li>also is not bad.  </li>
            <li>Cherry Lip Therapy is my favorite product because it provides instant moisture to your lips; much better than Chapstick or Burt&#x27;s Bees.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping, product was exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Only kind I ever use.</li>
            <li>Vaseline Lip Therapy is the outstanding product in the field and no one else produces luscious, soft lips like the scientists at Vaseline.  </li>
            <li>Interestingly, I also heard this confirmed by Dr. Oz on one of his shows.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a glamorous product - no color - scent &amp; taste is minimal</li>
            <li>Vaseline has been helping skin look beautiful and feel healthy , make my mouth moisturize and thick enough .</li>
            <li>This product will help you cure your chapped lips in a matter of days and keep your lips healthy with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is the only thing I use because I do not were lipstick.</li>
            <li>Love the availability to purchase a gross quantity, always loosing them.  </li>
            <li>I gave away several tubes to my friends who love it as much as me.</li>
            <li>, walmart don&#x27;t sale this no more, and I believe it was a good price</li>
            <li>Pure petroleum jelly with just a hint of tasty cherry flavor.  </li>
            <li>They have really mini jars of Vaseline but who wants to get their fingers greasy putting it on ?</li>
            <li>Very leary of using</li>
            <li>This exciting cherry flavor is a delicious surprise and these harsh winters and blazing summers of late</li>
            <li>I bought a 12pk; I leave one in my purse, one at work, and another one on my kitchen counter ready to use.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly!</li>
            <li>Very leary of using</li>
            <li>There are multiple types of lip balm available and several are very good and provide a good protective layer to prevent lip damage from the cold and dry air.</li>
            <li>The small tube is both handy and efficient and can be used discreetly in the highest class circumstances.  </li>
            <li>i cant live without it!</li>
            <li>The temporary alternate brands never follow my husband or son on their fishing trips either, so I am confident they feel the same as I do with the cherry flavor.</li>
            <li>I need to protect my lips from high winds, dirt and grime.</li>
            <li>I live in high altitude and am menopausal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s petroleum jelly, not a hard wax-based lip</li>
            <li>I cannot live without it.  </li>
            <li>Just as the picture shows, cherry Vaseline lip therapy packaged new.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s one in every corner of my apartment, one in my car, one in my purse, one in my office; I don&#x27;t think I can live without this anymore.</li>
            <li>I like this simple pure product much better than all the other heavily medicated options available.  </li>
            <li>It has been hard to find in the stores, so I bought as many as I think I can use.  </li>
            <li>This item is hard to come by in stores, so I was glad to order it in a pack of 12.</li>
            <li>Although I have purchased masculine packaged brands of lip protectants for my husband and son</li>
            <li>The pack of 12 is a real value and will keep lips moist and seductive without fears of running out, making it possible to slather copiously that healing, protective cherry goodness.</li>
            <li>My lips feel so soft.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find the cherry flavor, so I was excited when I found it on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>Thank goodness for the inter-net because in the past I would beg in vain for the store managers to special order when they did not have this product in stock.</li>
            <li>For those of us getting ready for the dry winter months, I cannot recommend this product enough.  </li>

            <li> For those of us getting ready for the dry winter months, I cannot recommend this product enough.  </li>
            <li> You can never have enough chapstick, and it&#x27;s hard to find the cherry flavor Vaseline lip therapy (usually can only find the original), so this is a fantastic purchase if you are addicted to chapstick like me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually cheaper in the long run anyway.</li>
            <li> I like that it provides long lasting lip protection and keeps me from having to reapply it over and over.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but no color in it :(((((</li>
            <li> However finding the cherry variety in the store is nearly impossible, most places only carry the regular.</li>
            <li> I have tried the other vaseline intensive care lip glosses, but they do not absorb the same as the cherry.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> my friends complain to me about the dry weather destroying their mouth, I tell them this is the last product they will ever need to buy.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find in the store and now I have enough tubes to last for twelve years.</li>
            <li> Some even promote fast healing and recovery if you are unfortunate enough to get severely chapped lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cherry brand is the only lip gloss I have been wearing everyday, all day, for decades.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and arrived a few days earlier than promised.</li>
            <li> Looked at a number of drugstores and other stores and just could not find this anywhere.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to find locally for some reason.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Chapped lips are never fun.  </li>
            <li> Keeps lips moist, and with a slight hint of color gloss.</li>
            <li> It has been difficult to find this particular product in retail stores.  </li>
            <li> Been using this for a long time but hard to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased this from Amazon because for some strange reason this roll-on format has been difficult to find locally.</li>
            <li> but i wish the expiration date was a little farther out.</li>
            <li> One of the big effects on your body if you live in an area that experiences very cold weather is chapped or cracked lips.  </li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with contact dermatitis from the very frequent use of chap stick products during this very cold, dry winter.</li>
            <li> Just not safe when you&#x27;re applying this to your lips.  </li>
            <li> everyday!  </li>

            <li> Getting hard to find cherry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently taking Accutane and it dries up my lips like crazy.</li>
            <li> Cherry flavor is subtle, but still noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes your lips and prevents the painful dry and cracked lips that you can get from being outside in the cold.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to chap stick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this lip therapy...</li>
            <li> Whenever I feel a cold sore coming on, I just apply a small amount of the Vaseline and the cold sore never develops.</li>
            <li> The tube was cut and dirty.</li>
            <li> So wrong!</li>
            <li> but it has become impossible to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed that expiration date is so soon.</li>

            <li> Almost all the lip balms I&#x27;ve tried have a re-bound effect. They feel great upon application but then leave your lips dryer than before. As a nurse, I know that petroleum jelly is the only product that won&#x27;t do this. Interestingly, I also heard this confirmed by Dr. Oz on one of his shows.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a glamorous product - no color - scent &amp; taste is minimal but it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased this from Amazon because for some strange reason this roll-on format has been difficult to find locally. They have really mini jars of Vaseline but who wants to get their fingers greasy putting it on ?</li>
            <li> Product arrived as individual items without any protective packaging. Very leary of using</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERY lip product. This stuff is the best. I have very dry skin and this product is the only one that will not only soften my lips but actually heals it almost instantly.</li>
            <li> amazon buyers&lt;br /&gt;Please check the expiration of the product  before ordering</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with contact dermatitis from the very frequent use of chap stick products during this very cold, dry winter. The dermatologist recommended Vaseline lip therapy and I have not had a problem since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Arrived as all separate tubes without packaging.  Just not safe when you&#x27;re applying this to your lips.  It&#x27;s going back.  Who knows what&#x27;s in this stuff?</li>
            <li> Just what you see is what you get.</li>
            <li> No one else had the lip therapy in cherry; was happy to find it</li>
            <li> I love Cherry Vaseline!I carry it everywhere! I use it throughout the day...everyday!  It is my Favorite lip application! Yeah! Yeah!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m order a pack of 12, one of them had been opended before. The tube was cut and dirty. It&#x27;s horrible.</li>
            <li> I live in high altitude and am menopausal. The cherry brand is the only lip gloss I have been wearing everyday, all day, for decades. Thank goodness for the inter-net because in the past I would beg in vain for the store managers to special order when they did not have this product in stock. I then would have to wear alternate brands as I seeked the store that would have it in stock.  The cherry flavor absorbs into your skin rather than just sit on top of your lips. It keeps your lips moist for hours with just one application.  Although I have purchased masculine packaged brands of lip protectants for my husband and son I have observed that they tend to sneak a tube from my supply and discretely use the product when ice fishing with their buddies. I have tried the other vaseline intensive care lip glosses, but they do not absorb the same as the cherry. The temporary alternate brands never follow my husband or son on their fishing trips either, so I am confident they feel the same as I do with the cherry flavor.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a long time but hard to find in the stores.  Found it on amazon and bought a bunch so I won&#x27;t run out for a while.</li>
            <li> Only kind I ever use.</li>
            <li> For those of us getting ready for the dry winter months, I cannot recommend this product enough.  It is a must-have when it comes to lip protection or lip repair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapped lips are never fun.  Smiling causes them to split and bleed, they peel, they are unsightly, I could go on and on but I&#x27;ll save us all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vaseline Cherry Lip Therapy is my favorite product because it provides instant moisture to your lips; much better than Chapstick or Burt&#x27;s Bees.  It&#x27;s petroleum jelly, not a hard wax-based lip product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cherry flavor is subtle, but still noticeable.  It&#x27;s not like tasting Cherry-flavored candy or anything too overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are what matter.  This product will help you cure your chapped lips in a matter of days and keep your lips healthy with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my friends complain to me about the dry weather destroying their mouth, I tell them this is the last product they will ever need to buy.  Hope this review was helpful!</li>
            <li> Best product ever-wonderful protection in any season</li>
            <li> It has been hard to find in the stores, so I bought as many as I think I can use.  They came on the day promised, perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Just what I wanted and arrived a few days earlier than promised.</li>
            <li> Vaseline Lip Therapy is the outstanding product in the field and no one else produces luscious, soft lips like the scientists at Vaseline.  This exciting cherry flavor is a delicious surprise and these harsh winters and blazing summers of late can&#x27;t make a dent in lips protected by Vaseline Therapy.  The small tube is both handy and efficient and can be used discreetly in the highest class circumstances.  Say goodbye to cracked and bleeding lips that repel and repulse by applying only the best.  The pack of 12 is a real value and will keep lips moist and seductive without fears of running out, making it possible to slather copiously that healing, protective cherry goodness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vaseline Lip Therapy, Cherry for many years. This is the only product I use on my lips - ever!!</li>
            <li> ... so I buy in bulk to have it around.  I have one in my purse, one in the bathroom, one at work, etc.  I&#x27;ve used this for years and found it works the best and has a pleasing flavor.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it all the time.  I cannot live without it.  Great prices on line. So glad I found it</li>
            <li> I love this lip product in the Cherry flavor.  I keep a tube in my pocket and purse and use it many times a day.  It has been difficult to find this particular product in retail stores.  I ordered twelve tubes from Amazon to have plenty on hand.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Vaseline Lip Therapy Cherry close to eight years.  I keep one in my pocketbook and on my person at all times.  I cannot go a day without this product.  I use to buy this Vaseline Lip Therapy  at Target but they discontinue it from there stores.  I almost had an anxiety attack  trying to figure out where would a find Vaseline Lip Therapy, because I was on my last tube. So I decided to look it up at Amazon. Thank God I did.  I love the fact it comes in packs of 12. My lips feel so soft. I hate chapped lips.</li>
            <li> This is the best chapstick!  It is hard to find the cherry flavor, so I was excited when I found it on Amazon!  I gave away several tubes to my friends who love it as much as me.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is the only thing I use because I do not were lipstick.</li>
            <li> Love the availability to purchase a gross quantity, always loosing them.  lol&lt;br /&gt;Good price, quality  product and for Xmas stockings.</li>
            <li> We have been buying this product for a lot of years. Recently, stores no longer carry it. We found it on your web site. Price was good. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Seems to be a thinner consistency than it used to be and the tubes feel greasy. Not sure what they changed but it wasn&#x27;t for the better,</li>
            <li> Getting hard to find cherry.  Good price.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry in my purse or pocket. I&#x27;m addicted to chap stick and I&#x27;m weaning myself off and trying to use the Vaseline instead. Working pretty good</li>
            <li> This is a great product so glad I could find them here.</li>
            <li> From the bottom of my lips (and top), thank you for a great product! I would not be as comfortable talking, or showing my face for that matter, without these magical lip therapy. Oh and did I mention the fresh, cherry scent?! It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> this stuff is soothing and i love it but i wish the expiration date was a little farther out. the date on these i bought is 6 of 2014</li>
            <li> My Hubby Love the cherry lip Therapy, walmart don&#x27;t sale this no more, and I believe it was a good price</li>
            <li> This lip care product isn&#x27;t amazing. My lips still felt chapped after using it for a week. I wish i didnt have 10 more to use.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t sell this at the stores near me, so I am happy again. Just as the picture shows, cherry Vaseline lip therapy packaged new. *Cherry Lips*</li>
            <li> Mmmmmm.... Finally, after years! My Cherry Vaseline. Oh, how I&#x27;ve missed you.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast receipt.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> The absolute best thing since sliced bread! Keeps lips moist, and with a slight hint of color gloss. I bought a 12pk; I leave one in my purse, one at work, and another one on my kitchen counter ready to use. It is perfection!</li>
            <li> my lips are happy and moist</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed. It was cheap, but great quality. Loved the fragrance too. No need to wear a gloss.  Recommend highly!</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for over 27 years now..... swear by it.</li>
            <li> Great product... really works on chapped lips</li>
            <li> Pure petroleum jelly with just a hint of tasty cherry flavor.  I like this simple pure product much better than all the other heavily medicated options available.  I need to protect my lips from high winds, dirt and grime. Not get them dependent on medication.  However finding the cherry variety in the store is nearly impossible, most places only carry the regular.</li>
            <li> This item is hard to come by in stores, so I was glad to order it in a pack of 12. Came on time, and was packed well.</li>
            <li> Horrible experience. Items not in original packaging and the expiration date had been cut off the end of the packaging. So wrong!</li>
            <li> You can never have enough chapstick, and it&#x27;s hard to find the cherry flavor Vaseline lip therapy (usually can only find the original), so this is a fantastic purchase if you are addicted to chapstick like me.</li>
            <li> Thank you thank you thank you!! I&#x27;ve checked over 10 different stores in both AZ and CA combined and none had the Cherry lip balm I have been looking for. It&#x27;s the only one that I use and so I finally just said screw it and purchased a 12 pack from yall. So THANK YOU and I got it pretty quickly too! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> i could no longer find this in stores so put a twelve pack here.  works better than chapstick and carmex burns my lips.  this moisturizes well.  i cant live without it!</li>
            <li> Great prise and great speedy service.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this product for lip moisture.  It&#x27;s the best and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li> Just what we wanted........whoopsie! !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but no color in it :(((((</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years and love the application ease and keeping my lips soft! I decided best to get a supply so I don&#x27;t run into &amp;#34;out of stock&amp;#34; when I need more! It&#x27;s so easy and so timely with Amazon!</li>
            <li> Disappointed that expiration date is so soon. When ordering 12 at a time, exp date of February would have altered my purchase.</li>
            <li> It is cherry flavored lip therapy..It is hard to find in the store and now I have enough tubes to last for twelve years.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as individual items without any protective packaging. Very leary of using</li>
            <li> Was a gift , They loved it! cant find them in the stores anymore.&lt;br /&gt;so they were extremely happy when they got these. from what i can tell works just like the regular vaseline lip therapy  but taste like cherry so you may end up biting your lips anyway.</li>
            <li> I have used the Cherry version of the Vaseline Lip Therapy for many years.  Whenever I feel a cold sore coming on, I just apply a small amount of the Vaseline and the cold sore never develops. Looked at a number of drugstores and other stores and just could not find this anywhere.  Amazon had it!!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, product was exactly as described! Couldn&#x27;t find the cherry flavor Vaseline anywhere, and was very excited to find it! Great product!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, fast shipping.  Just wish I could still buy it in stores.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this but it&#x27;s hard to find locally for some reason. So we buy a big quantity here. It&#x27;s actually cheaper in the long run anyway.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get this locally!  I&#x27;m an addict when it comes to Vaseline lip product...I have stashes everywhere!  Cherry is the best!</li>
            <li> One of the big effects on your body if you live in an area that experiences very cold weather is chapped or cracked lips.  There are multiple types of lip balm available and several are very good and provide a good protective layer to prevent lip damage from the cold and dry air. Some even promote fast healing and recovery if you are unfortunate enough to get severely chapped lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best that I have found is Vaseline Lip Therapy and the cherry flavor also is not bad.  I like that it provides long lasting lip protection and keeps me from having to reapply it over and over.  It moisturizes your lips and prevents the painful dry and cracked lips that you can get from being outside in the cold.  I have used it for years and it does an excellent job.  I recommend it to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have posted a photo for your reference.</li>
            <li> Expired 2 months after I ordered them</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever buy another lip balm ever again! I&#x27;m so in LOVE with this! There&#x27;s one in every corner of my apartment, one in my car, one in my purse, one in my office; I don&#x27;t think I can live without this anymore. I&#x27;m currently taking Accutane and it dries up my lips like crazy. Nothing has come even close to what this does for my lips. I&#x27;m sure once I&#x27;m off the medication I&#x27;ll continue to use this product since there&#x27;s no doubt it will give me amazing soft healthy lips. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this lip therapy...Keeps lips moist.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years...but it has become impossible to find in stores.  So glad to find the cherry flavor on Amazon.  Love buying it in bulk...have one in almost every possible place...purse(s), desk drawer at work, night stand by bed you name I have one.  I have it delivered through subscribe and save so I should never run out.</li>
            <li> Vaseline has been helping skin look beautiful and feel healthy , make my mouth moisturize and thick enough .</li>
            <li> will order again, when I run out.  so glad to be able to order in bulk (Pack of 12) Yay</li>
