            <li>For the price l am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I JUST LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>They were wonderful and sent a new product right away and apologized for their mistake.</li>
            <li>You get to test out all three powders and see what you are most comfortable with, which helps you determine what powder you prefer.</li>
            <li>early and great product</li>
            <li>easy to work with.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time, was what I was expecting, and seems to be easy to use.</li>
            <li>Good quality, decent price.  </li>
            <li>I received these and everything looks to be fine, except when I opened the package the powder was everywhere.</li>
            <li>I do not like but is fine.</li>
            <li>the others were fine.</li>
            <li>just fine</li>
            <li>it works fine</li>
            <li>Yes and really cheap  ty</li>
            <li>It just didnt go onto my nails smoothly at all.</li>
            <li>I had to use a lot of liquid to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>this works well with, and goes on smooth,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very upset because I needed this power to try out at my nail spa!!!</li>
            <li>Not what I expected, but works just as good!</li>
            <li>very high salon quality acrylic think formula that is easy to work with I will stick with this brand!</li>
            <li>Its okay the clear one works alot better then</li>
            <li>nothing too special about them.</li>
            <li>Had to wait a full month to get it in the mail, but that&#x27;s not the problem.</li>
            <li>For the price, I guess its not bad</li>
            <li>were super full</li>
            <li>and they fall of so quick.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like not the regular acrylic powder is more of a gel powder</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and as advertised.  </li>
            <li>but they came quick.</li>
            <li>Runs out too quick.</li>
            <li>I choose the five star rating due to the fact that all three colors are needed to complete the perfect manicure.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I neede!</li>
            <li>The bottles are very cheap and they do not look professional at all.</li>
            <li>I had bought this once before and the first time the package wasn&#x27;t as clean as this time and it didn&#x27;t state the color it.</li>
            <li>actually  showed the color and the acrylic is amazing</li>
            <li>The quality of the powder isn&#x27;t even worth the time waiting to receive this product.</li>
            <li>It is also quite a bit of product for the money, so well worth it.</li>
            <li>This powder drys far to fast to be able to adequately form the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; acrylic nail.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of funny, because the containers were full &amp; closed, yet somehow it was all over the inside of the package.</li>
            <li>I stick pretty much with clear or pink, but the quality of the product is very good.</li>
            <li>Once I became a little more skilled</li>
            <li>Just pay a little more for better quality.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and would probably order the UV gels from them next time instead of the powders.</li>
            <li>Like this product very much</li>
            <li>the white and pink are bright and the clear is perfect.the containers came 3/4 full and there was very little poder inside the package.these powders are best for beginning nail addicts or people who want to do their nails at home .</li>
            <li>I finally used it and it does not dry quick you most def need a UV light</li>
            <li>I gave what I had left to my daughter &amp; went to Sally&#x27;s &amp; bought a better quality acrylic.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>so I just wished they had more larger options</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Pretty bummed but what can I do.</li>
            <li>Not even if you are a first timer.</li>
            <li>I ended up browsing through a beauty supply store in my area to make sure the next powder that I would buy wouldn&#x27;t be a trick container.</li>
            <li>pretty upset.</li>
            <li>if u know how to do nails real fast and everything cuz it drys fast</li>
            <li>Ordered acrylic powders, but received uv gels instead, but I actually like the uv gels better</li>
            <li>They work amazing and dry fast</li>
            <li>Once I used it and figured out which is pink, white, or clear, I was able to write it on the jars so I still consider this a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, to be honest the containers are a whole lot smaller than I expected..</li>
            <li>They are great for beginners because of the  very small portions of all three powders.</li>
            <li>I used all of the clear powder up for one full set of nails, it should have been more because my nails are not all that long.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better of going to Sally&#x27;s and spending $10 for a bigger container which is also high quality.</li>
            <li>I did receive the product and it really works well.</li>
            <li>thanks alot</li>
            <li>Seems like the container lid don&#x27;t really close, and spilled all over the place, in the package..</li>
            <li>i will be trying them out very soon</li>
            <li>The powders worked very well when I used them.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t order this again, unless I really needed too.</li>
            <li>It went on very goopy and lumpy.</li>
            <li>But when I saw an area that needed fixing I used a store bought (kiss) powder with the same liquid and the application went on smoothly.</li>
            <li>FOR THE PRICE WAS VERY REASONBLY</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very deceiving.</li>
            <li>very unsatisfied customer</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying products from these ladies!</li>
            <li>so the acrylic does not clump very well.  </li>
            <li>Though I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, the containers are larger than I expected and it is a good brand.</li>
            <li>Better than the expensive kind</li>
            <li>so when I finally got the original order.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these powders.</li>
            <li>The Acrylic Isn&#x27;t High Quality</li>
            <li>In fact, I highly recommend not buying this product.</li>
            <li>These cases are really small, but it does have good acrylic powder, but you will definitely run out of powder quickly if you do both hands and like to do Japanese style nails.</li>
            <li>it clearly states that its acrylic powder, but after over a whole month of waiting for the order to arrive, i recieve UV GEL products.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just trying it out and are new to doing nails, then  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Which brings me to my 2nd point of since i knew the product would be very small containers why couldnt they try to package this up more securely</li>
            <li>I thought maybe it&#x27;s the liquid (i tried a new brand)</li>
            <li>love the pink and clear.the white</li>
            <li>When i applied the color to my nail, they ALL ended up clear  or at least not pink but good for clear</li>
            <li>The Seller did contact me about the mistake and let me know that the first set of what turned out to be the UV gels were a gift and that my actual order was being shipped.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look exactly like the picture, there actually a smaller.</li>
            <li>My items were clearly labeled, will use seller again.</li>
            <li>However I used the clear acrylic to give myself a fill in</li>
            <li>The clear isn&#x27;t AS clear as the professionals</li>
            <li>The clear lasted me for about 4 times of doing my nails.</li>
            <li>or maybe I&#x27;m just not working fast enough.</li>
            <li>This product is extremely tiny but you cant really complain because of the price.</li>
            <li>Just what I need to complete my set of nail care items.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, the containers I received were decent size and will probably last a while.</li>
            <li>The container looks like it is full of powder, but really, there&#x27;s a fake bottom that appears about 1/4 the way down the container (from the top).</li>
            <li>When working with the powder seem to dry to fast.</li>
            <li>It dried quickly and became clumpy.</li>
            <li>First to say, I compared these to a more expensive product and got very different results.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought this product I received an empty container but the ladies behind the scenes made sure to correct the problem.</li>
            <li>and  they white and clear</li>
            <li>I read in reviews of this seller,items were not labeled and you had to figure out which was clear and which was white.</li>
            <li>This acrylic is very sticky and does not last long.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend these for a private acrylic nail artist, but not for a professional salon.</li>
            <li>It came in extremely small sizes not to mention, they weren&#x27;t all the way full.</li>
            <li>they are more dusty than powdery</li>
            <li>First of all when I received my product one container was half full and the containers are small.</li>
            <li>I tried this today for the first time and did not like it for the fact that it took forever to dry literally took 45 minutes for my 10 fingers to dry.</li>
            <li>And after 15min its still not dry.</li>
            <li>I got one and a half manicures out of the clear, and they were normal acrylic fills.</li>
            <li>The pink turned out clear the white turned out clear.</li>
            <li>The white is super thick and chunky,and does not work well.</li>
            <li>Received 3 containers that were enough for touch ups, and l did get white, pink and clear.</li>

            <li> early and great product</li>
            <li> easy to work with.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, was what I was expecting, and seems to be easy to use.</li>
            <li> Good quality, decent price.  </li>
            <li> I received these and everything looks to be fine, except when I opened the package the powder was everywhere.</li>
            <li> I do not like but is fine.</li>
            <li> the others were fine.</li>
            <li> just fine</li>
            <li> it works fine</li>
            <li> Yes and really cheap  ty</li>
            <li> It just didnt go onto my nails smoothly at all.</li>
            <li> I had to use a lot of liquid to smooth it out.</li>
            <li> this works well with, and goes on smooth,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very upset because I needed this power to try out at my nail spa!!!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, but works just as good!</li>
            <li> very high salon quality acrylic think formula that is easy to work with I will stick with this brand!</li>
            <li> Its okay the clear one works alot better then</li>
            <li> nothing too special about them.</li>
            <li> Had to wait a full month to get it in the mail, but that&#x27;s not the problem.</li>
            <li> For the price, I guess its not bad</li>
            <li> were super full</li>
            <li> and they fall of so quick.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more like not the regular acrylic powder is more of a gel powder</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and as advertised.  </li>
            <li> but they came quick.</li>
            <li> Runs out too quick.</li>
            <li> I choose the five star rating due to the fact that all three colors are needed to complete the perfect manicure.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I neede!</li>
            <li> The bottles are very cheap and they do not look professional at all.</li>
            <li> I had bought this once before and the first time the package wasn&#x27;t as clean as this time and it didn&#x27;t state the color it.</li>
            <li> actually  showed the color and the acrylic is amazing</li>
            <li> The quality of the powder isn&#x27;t even worth the time waiting to receive this product.</li>
            <li> It is also quite a bit of product for the money, so well worth it.</li>
            <li> This powder drys far to fast to be able to adequately form the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; acrylic nail.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of funny, because the containers were full &amp; closed, yet somehow it was all over the inside of the package.</li>
            <li> I stick pretty much with clear or pink, but the quality of the product is very good.</li>
            <li> Once I became a little more skilled</li>
            <li> Just pay a little more for better quality.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and would probably order the UV gels from them next time instead of the powders.</li>
            <li> Like this product very much</li>
            <li> the white and pink are bright and the clear is perfect.the containers came 3/4 full and there was very little poder inside the package.these powders are best for beginning nail addicts or people who want to do their nails at home .</li>
            <li> I finally used it and it does not dry quick you most def need a UV light</li>
            <li> I gave what I had left to my daughter &amp; went to Sally&#x27;s &amp; bought a better quality acrylic.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> so I just wished they had more larger options</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Pretty bummed but what can I do.</li>
            <li> Not even if you are a first timer.</li>
            <li> I ended up browsing through a beauty supply store in my area to make sure the next powder that I would buy wouldn&#x27;t be a trick container.</li>
            <li> pretty upset.</li>
            <li> if u know how to do nails real fast and everything cuz it drys fast</li>
            <li> Ordered acrylic powders, but received uv gels instead, but I actually like the uv gels better</li>
            <li> They work amazing and dry fast</li>
            <li> Once I used it and figured out which is pink, white, or clear, I was able to write it on the jars so I still consider this a good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, to be honest the containers are a whole lot smaller than I expected..</li>
            <li> They are great for beginners because of the  very small portions of all three powders.</li>
            <li> I used all of the clear powder up for one full set of nails, it should have been more because my nails are not all that long.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better of going to Sally&#x27;s and spending $10 for a bigger container which is also high quality.</li>
            <li> I did receive the product and it really works well.</li>
            <li> thanks alot</li>
            <li> Seems like the container lid don&#x27;t really close, and spilled all over the place, in the package..</li>
            <li> i will be trying them out very soon</li>
            <li> The powders worked very well when I used them.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t order this again, unless I really needed too.</li>
            <li> It went on very goopy and lumpy.</li>
            <li> But when I saw an area that needed fixing I used a store bought (kiss) powder with the same liquid and the application went on smoothly.</li>
            <li> FOR THE PRICE WAS VERY REASONBLY</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very deceiving.</li>
            <li> very unsatisfied customer</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying products from these ladies!</li>
            <li> so the acrylic does not clump very well.  </li>
            <li> Though I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, the containers are larger than I expected and it is a good brand.</li>
            <li> Better than the expensive kind</li>
            <li> so when I finally got the original order.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these powders.</li>
            <li> The Acrylic Isn&#x27;t High Quality</li>
            <li> In fact, I highly recommend not buying this product.</li>
            <li> These cases are really small, but it does have good acrylic powder, but you will definitely run out of powder quickly if you do both hands and like to do Japanese style nails.</li>
            <li> it clearly states that its acrylic powder, but after over a whole month of waiting for the order to arrive, i recieve UV GEL products.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just trying it out and are new to doing nails, then  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Which brings me to my 2nd point of since i knew the product would be very small containers why couldnt they try to package this up more securely</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it&#x27;s the liquid (i tried a new brand)</li>
            <li> love the pink and clear.the white</li>
            <li> When i applied the color to my nail, they ALL ended up clear  or at least not pink but good for clear</li>
            <li> The Seller did contact me about the mistake and let me know that the first set of what turned out to be the UV gels were a gift and that my actual order was being shipped.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look exactly like the picture, there actually a smaller.</li>
            <li> My items were clearly labeled, will use seller again.</li>
            <li> However I used the clear acrylic to give myself a fill in</li>
            <li> The clear isn&#x27;t AS clear as the professionals</li>
            <li> The clear lasted me for about 4 times of doing my nails.</li>
            <li> or maybe I&#x27;m just not working fast enough.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely tiny but you cant really complain because of the price.</li>
            <li> Just what I need to complete my set of nail care items.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, the containers I received were decent size and will probably last a while.</li>
            <li> The container looks like it is full of powder, but really, there&#x27;s a fake bottom that appears about 1/4 the way down the container (from the top).</li>
            <li> When working with the powder seem to dry to fast.</li>
            <li> It dried quickly and became clumpy.</li>
            <li> First to say, I compared these to a more expensive product and got very different results.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this product I received an empty container but the ladies behind the scenes made sure to correct the problem.</li>
            <li> and  they white and clear</li>
            <li> I read in reviews of this seller,items were not labeled and you had to figure out which was clear and which was white.</li>
            <li> This acrylic is very sticky and does not last long.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend these for a private acrylic nail artist, but not for a professional salon.</li>
            <li> It came in extremely small sizes not to mention, they weren&#x27;t all the way full.</li>
            <li> they are more dusty than powdery</li>
            <li> First of all when I received my product one container was half full and the containers are small.</li>
            <li> I tried this today for the first time and did not like it for the fact that it took forever to dry literally took 45 minutes for my 10 fingers to dry.</li>
            <li> And after 15min its still not dry.</li>
            <li> I got one and a half manicures out of the clear, and they were normal acrylic fills.</li>
            <li> The pink turned out clear the white turned out clear.</li>
            <li> The white is super thick and chunky,and does not work well.</li>
            <li> Received 3 containers that were enough for touch ups, and l did get white, pink and clear.</li>
            <li> make the title, CLEAR WHITE PINK ACRYLIC POWDER when its clearly clear white pink UV GEL!</li>
            <li> The pink powder was extremely hard to open, and half of the powder puffed out when I was able to force it open...</li>
            <li> I received my shipment a week and a half early that was a big plus!</li>
            <li> Sets to fast hard to work with</li>
            <li> Be careful when you open.</li>
            <li> So beware it takes a really long time</li>
            <li> i was out of acrylic for a long time and didnt buy any from the stores because i had ordered this product and was going to wait.&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> This is the size I expected bigger but let&#x27;s see how they work .</li>
            <li> It came to me open and messy and barely had anything in it.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a very long way to travel just as an FYI mine was strickly in a plastic shipping bag not bubble wrapped or anything.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry, camparing with the one we bought from store.&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
            <li> then it hits bottom (or as I mentioned a fake bottom), which means most the container is air trapped by design and not powder.</li>
            <li> Got these in today (they took forever to come in) and was surprised at how small they were.</li>
            <li> 2 dry even with a dryer, Wich I used!</li>
            <li> While it was drying it became sticky rather than hard and took a while to dry completely.</li>
            <li> made my nails not look natural at all and was hard to polish</li>
            <li> the pink also they dont blend well together</li>
            <li> &amp; This Isn&#x27;t What I Expected</li>
            <li> The amount of powder received was not what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> It did not go on my nail the way expected.</li>
            <li> then i expected it came sooner</li>
            <li> IT SOONER THEN EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting to do a.couple of pink and white tips for a few girls</li>
            <li> Also came a week and a half earlier than expected!!</li>
            <li> When I received the product it was packaged very poorly and the acrylic powder was all over inside and quite the mess to try and clean up.</li>
            <li> So, the container stands a little over 1 inch tall on the outside, but on the inside it goes down about 1/4 maybe about 1/3 of an inch</li>
            <li> the pink and white I havnt used because I have no more plastic nails</li>
            <li> came they way they were supposed to except they pink was half empty</li>
            <li> I reduced the acrylic, but The pink acrylic was half empty..</li>
            <li> The jars are almost empty!  </li>
            <li> the pictures look medium sides but are small for personal use.</li>
            <li> When it finally does arrive the amount is small, you can&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> and I found the powder did not spread as smoothly as other powders I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Extremely upset.</li>
            <li> Would recommend other acrylic powders.</li>
            <li> Was open a little and  waste in bag</li>
            <li> Containers are a little small especially since I do nails out my house</li>
            <li> There is not a lot of powder inside this little contenner but for the price is ok&lt;</li>
            <li> It could be me, but when I used this it was a little grainy, not smoothe</li>
            <li> I have already lost 3 nails, and I just did my nails a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed because I got two clear and one white powders instead of the one of each color.</li>
            <li> my finger tips came away with a thick pink gel!!</li>
            <li> and I paid very little for it.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> the containers are so small i just wanted to cry after seeing them.</li>
            <li> im not sure how the products work</li>
            <li> it turned out that they actually sent the wrong items.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about two of those small containers that glitter comes in, in each jar.</li>
            <li> I think that is a small amount.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be bigger, and when they weren&#x27;t I was thinking at least they came with a bit, but I was wrong there too.</li>
            <li> but when i tried cutting it with the cutters the powder was like gum like..it wasnt as satisfying :(</li>
            <li> it is sooo sticky and hard to work with.</li>
            <li> There is hardly any powder in the container.</li>
            <li> The containers are small also the product amount in each container is pathetic, they barely come with enough powder to do your nails maybe 4 or 5 times.</li>
            <li> I hope I can do my nails at least three times with them.</li>
            <li> but I mean, it will get painted over anyways.</li>
            <li> very small jar of prduct.</li>
            <li> Very thick and hard to work.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed that the packages have no english on them.</li>
            <li> This this  product sucks!</li>
            <li> I was not happy with it at all.</li>
            <li> I hated the white and it seem like it lasted forever  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to w as she off!!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will not be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> It seems weird</li>
            <li> These acrylic powders a very poor in quality.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a waste of money, I wish I would have listened to the bad reviews.&lt;br /&gt;really bad quality.</li>
            <li> Bad product doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> I guess from shipping &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed and</li>
            <li> I was mad!</li>
            <li> This powder is crap.</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> This powder is very bad.</li>
            <li> and it is almost impossible to wash off!!!</li>
            <li> This product is awful!!!</li>
            <li> This is the worst thing I have ever received from Amazon!!</li>

            <li> Bad product doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> These powders are TINY! I hope I can do my nails at least three times with them. Crossing my fingers. But it works. For the price, I guess its not bad</li>
            <li> Love the bright color and consistency of these powders.  The colors are absolutely perfect and mix well and look great on.  Wish these were sold in larger sizes.  I highly recommend these powders.</li>
            <li> When working with the powder seem to dry to fast.</li>
            <li> this just came in today so shipping was good.And i love it the white and pink are bright and the clear is perfect.the containers came 3/4 full and there was very little poder inside the package.these powders are best for beginning nail addicts or people who want to do their nails at home . Great product</li>
            <li> Not the best but works</li>
            <li> I received these and everything looks to be fine, except when I opened the package the powder was everywhere. It&#x27;s kind of funny, because the containers were full &amp; closed, yet somehow it was all over the inside of the package. :/</li>
            <li> Its okay the clear one works alot better then the pink also they dont blend well together you can see where you add acrylic &amp; add more acrylic</li>
            <li> The Acrylic Isn&#x27;t High Quality As Stated By Seller. At One Point I Was Wondering What Was In The Jar. it Doesn&#x27;t Spread When Applying It Goes On Bulky. I&#x27;ve Been Getting My Nails Done &amp; Have Done My Own FOR YEARS. &amp; This Isn&#x27;t What I Expected</li>
            <li> This is good acrylic for beginners &amp; good for the price.  Once I became a little more skilled I gave what I had left to my daughter &amp; went to Sally&#x27;s &amp; bought a better quality acrylic.</li>
            <li> I ordered acrylic powder, I received gel.  Not what I ordered at all. It wouldn&#x27;t even pay to ship back, I would lose money.Needless to say, I will not be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> These are really good quality acrylic powders. These are close to salon quality which is amazing for the price. I would recommend these for a private acrylic nail artist, but not for a professional salon.</li>
            <li> came they way they were supposed to except they pink was half empty and  they white and clear were super full</li>
            <li> Good product great price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a product that lived up to its advertised value and more. It&#x27;s okay for the nails and looks good.</li>
            <li> very high salon quality acrylic think formula that is easy to work with I will stick with this brand! Only dislike is when it dries it has a glaze look but u buff that out when u do the nails so no biggie!</li>
            <li> I read in reviews of this seller,items were not labeled and you had to figure out which was clear and which was white. My items were clearly labeled, will use seller again. Great price.</li>
            <li> I reduced the acrylic, but The pink acrylic was half empty.. Seems like the container lid don&#x27;t really close, and spilled all over the place, in the package..</li>
            <li> the containers are so small i just wanted to cry after seeing them. i will never buy from them again. im not sure how the products work i will be trying them out very soon</li>
            <li> These acrylic powers are really great! They work amazing and dry fast which is what I was looking for. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I ordered the acrylic powders and I am beyond satisfied with the product. When I used the clear powder, the application was flawless. The price was a steal and I &amp;#34;WILL&amp;#34; be ordering more acrylic powder from this seller. Excellent.</li>
            <li> In the description it says it&#x27;s powder, but i received gel....it is sooo sticky and hard to work with. and it is almost impossible to wash off!!!</li>
            <li> When i applied the color to my nail, they ALL ended up clear  or at least not pink but good for clear</li>
            <li> great product. received when promised.</li>
            <li> I hated the white and it seem like it lasted forever  made my nails not look natural at all and was hard to polish</li>
            <li> this is the best acrylic builder around. its great and a must have for nail artist. buy buy buy this its the best</li>
            <li> First of all when I received my product one container was half full and the containers are small. I finally used it and it does not dry quick you most def need a UV light and they fall of so quick. Even stick on nails stay on longer. Do NOT buy this product.</li>
            <li> The jars are almost empty!  But is a great producti loved all 3 good to try for that price....</li>
            <li> I dont understand why they have it listed as a &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; its a GEL that spills everywhere, WILL NOT BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> very pleased with this product. easy to work with. does not clump up. plan to order more than one this time</li>
            <li> i dont like salons so I just wished they had more larger options the pictures look medium sides but are small for personal use.</li>
            <li> I like the size of the jars and the powder does work like it&#x27;s supposed to but I was disappointed that the packages have no english on them. I can&#x27;t tell the difference between any of these powders until it&#x27;s mixed and I go to use it. Once I used it and figured out which is pink, white, or clear, I was able to write it on the jars so I still consider this a good product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry, camparing with the one we bought from store.&lt;br /&gt;has it been tested before they go to the market</li>
            <li> There is not a lot of powder inside this little contenner but for the price is ok&lt;br /&gt;I love the pink and clear.the white I do not like but is fine.</li>
            <li> Product is as described. Arrived on time. Great!</li>
            <li> Took a while to get to me but I&#x27;m happy with the amount of powder I got; containers are marked and have a seal to prevent shipping spillage which I thought was great. Would buy again :)</li>
            <li> I tried this today for the first time and did not like it for the fact that it took forever to dry literally took 45 minutes for my 10 fingers to dry. I was mad! it&#x27;s more like not the regular acrylic powder is more of a gel powder would it does it state that in the listing. So beware it takes a really long time 2 dry even with a dryer, Wich I used!</li>
            <li> The powders worked very well when I used them. I didn&#x27;t have any problems at all with application or any aspect.</li>
            <li> I think the price is great of course, however you get what you pay for. It is nothing great about it. I used all of the clear powder up for one full set of nails, it should have been more because my nails are not all that long. I have already lost 3 nails, and I just did my nails a few days ago. I wouldn&#x27;t order this again, unless I really needed too.</li>
            <li> As I expected..love it.</li>
            <li> They are great for beginners because of the  very small portions of all three powders. If you&#x27;re just trying it out and are new to doing nails, then  I highly recommend it. You get to test out all three powders and see what you are most comfortable with, which helps you determine what powder you prefer. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I bought another type of acrylic powder one word (sucked) I got these and i have been using them bi-weekly regularly and they are great I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> Though I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, the containers are larger than I expected and it is a good brand. I can&#x27;t wait to put them to use :) Thanks!</li>
            <li> So my order was set to &amp;#34;Shipped&amp;#34; status and it turned out that they actually sent the wrong items. The Seller did contact me about the mistake and let me know that the first set of what turned out to be the UV gels were a gift and that my actual order was being shipped. I received the UV gels and loved it. Turns out the mistake was actually a good one üòÅ. But this review isn&#x27;t about those so when I finally got the original order. I was a little disappointed because I got two clear and one white powders instead of the one of each color. Containers are a little small especially since I do nails out my house but I figured they would be from the reviews. Overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and would probably order the UV gels from them next time instead of the powders. Five stars for customer service and quality, not quantity thou lol.</li>
            <li> Powder doesn&#x27;t work. Buyer Beware!!!&lt;br /&gt;This ships from china, takes forever. When it finally does arrive the amount is small, you can&#x27;t use it again. The quality of the powder isn&#x27;t even worth the time waiting to receive this product.</li>
            <li> First to say, I compared these to a more expensive product and got very different results. This powder drys far to fast to be able to adequately form the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; acrylic nail. It came in extremely small sizes not to mention, they weren&#x27;t all the way full. I would not recommend to anyone. Just pay a little more for better quality.</li>
            <li> It came to me open and messy and barely had anything in it. I was not happy with it at all.</li>
            <li> This powder is crap. I hate it. It just didnt go onto my nails smoothly at all. It went on very goopy and lumpy. Buyers beware.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, the containers I received were decent size and will probably last a while. However I used the clear acrylic to give myself a fill in and I found the powder did not spread as smoothly as other powders I&#x27;ve used. It dried quickly and became clumpy. I had to use a lot of liquid to smooth it out. While it was drying it became sticky rather than hard and took a while to dry completely. I thought maybe it&#x27;s the liquid (i tried a new brand) or maybe I&#x27;m just not working fast enough. But when I saw an area that needed fixing I used a store bought (kiss) powder with the same liquid and the application went on smoothly. Hm oh well guess I&#x27;ll just use it for 3D flowers or something.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved these acrylic powders they were perfect for a stocking stuffer and her schooling.  Arrived on time and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase!...they work great I will continue to buy these when I ran out of them!..I recommend</li>
            <li> Good quality, decent price.  It arrived quickly and as advertised.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This powder is very bad. Sets to fast hard to work with and I paid very little for it. bad</li>
            <li> should have ordered more of these.  my frenz all come over to do their nails...love the bonding time that we have doing nails.</li>
            <li> I received my shipment a week and a half early that was a big plus! I thought the containers were gonna be a lot bigger than they were. I ordered a total of 9, 3 of each color and a lot of the powder fell out I guess from shipping &#x3D;( Pretty bummed but what can I do.</li>
            <li> This product is awful!!! Had to wait a full month to get it in the mail, but that&#x27;s not the problem. The &amp;#34;acrylic&amp;#34; falls off the brush when trying to get a ball. And after 15min its still not dry. Don&#x27;t buy this product. Not even if you are a first timer. You&#x27;re better of going to Sally&#x27;s and spending $10 for a bigger container which is also high quality. And the inside of the container is smaller than the outside. Like you can stick your nail in it and touch the bottom without it gettingnon your cuticle.</li>
            <li> I ordered this power in September and I have not got it yet. I&#x27;m very upset because I needed this power to try out at my nail spa!!!</li>
            <li> The pink powder was extremely hard to open, and half of the powder puffed out when I was able to force it open...the others were fine. The clear isn&#x27;t AS clear as the professionals but I mean, it will get painted over anyways. the pink and white I havnt used because I have no more plastic nails</li>
            <li> The container looks like it is full of powder, but really, there&#x27;s a fake bottom that appears about 1/4 the way down the container (from the top). So, the container stands a little over 1 inch tall on the outside, but on the inside it goes down about 1/4 maybe about 1/3 of an inch then it hits bottom (or as I mentioned a fake bottom), which means most the container is air trapped by design and not powder. I got one and a half manicures out of the clear, and they were normal acrylic fills. There is hardly any powder in the container. The amount of powder received was not what I expected for the price. I would not suggest this product; I will not buy this product again. In fact, I highly recommend not buying this product. I&#x27;m not even suggesting another specific brand to buy instead -just purchase a different brand of acrylic powder! I ended up browsing through a beauty supply store in my area to make sure the next powder that I would buy wouldn&#x27;t be a trick container.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again, they were okay but nyou get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> i only gave it one star bc i havent used it yet.  when i use it i will edit my review.</li>
            <li> Like this product very much</li>
            <li> Very happy with this order. I think I can do more than six nails with these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not fond of the white, but that&#x27;s just me.  I stick pretty much with clear or pink, but the quality of the product is very good.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS EASY TO USE,HAD NO PROBLEM TO PUT ON MY OWN NAILS. WHAT THE SELLER SHOWED IS EXACTLEY WHAT I GOT.&lt;br /&gt;THE 3 FOR THE PRICE WAS VERY REASONBLY AND I WILL PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, was what I was expecting, and seems to be easy to use. I have not had any issues yey. It is also quite a bit of product for the money, so well worth it. Pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> it clearly states that its acrylic powder, but after over a whole month of waiting for the order to arrive, i recieve UV GEL products. and i have never used non acrylic powder products. so apprently now i have to but a uv lamp. pretty upset. i was out of acrylic for a long time and didnt buy any from the stores because i had ordered this product and was going to wait.&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t make the title, CLEAR WHITE PINK ACRYLIC POWDER when its clearly clear white pink UV GEL!</li>
            <li> Got these in today (they took forever to come in) and was surprised at how small they were. I opened it up and it has a smaller jar on the inside so it&#x27;s very deceiving. Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy these.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a waste of money, I wish I would have listened to the bad reviews.&lt;br /&gt;really bad quality.</li>
            <li> I had bought this once before and the first time the package wasn&#x27;t as clean as this time and it didn&#x27;t state the color it. Was so this time I bought it actually  showed the color and the acrylic is amazing I love it I will def buy the product over again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, to be honest the containers are a whole lot smaller than I expected.. They look bigger in the image.</li>
            <li> It could be me, but when I used this it was a little grainy, not smoothe like I wanted it</li>
            <li> smaller container then I thought it was going to be</li>
            <li> very unsatisfied customer</li>
            <li> I love the powders they work just fine i love them</li>
            <li> This is the worst thing I have ever received from Amazon!! I ordered POWDER!! I got freaking UV GEL!! I&#x27;ve been waiting to do a.couple of pink and white tips for a few girls now I have to wait even longer!! As soon as I took off the seal of protection my finger tips came away with a thick pink gel!! It seems weird and it&#x27;s hard to w as she off!! Totally disappointed and I will never ever buy from this company again!!</li>
            <li> Work really well just make sure you have great brushes.</li>
            <li> Very nice easier I can do my nails at home now I love it it works fine n very good</li>
            <li> Thank you! Exactly what I neede!</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this product I received an empty container but the ladies behind the scenes made sure to correct the problem. They were wonderful and sent a new product right away and apologized for their mistake. I highly recommend buying products from these ladies! They make sure to take the time to please their clients.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely tiny but you cant really complain because of the price. The clear lasted me for about 4 times of doing my nails. the acrylic doesn&#x27;t stick to your nails well even if you apply a primer</li>
            <li> This this  product sucks! The pink turned out clear the white turned out clear. It did not go on my nail the way expected.</li>
            <li> I guess its ok if u know how to do nails real fast and everything cuz it drys fast so no hueno for beginners and the containers are much smaller then i expected it came sooner then it said it would tho so that was good</li>
            <li> this works well with, and goes on smooth,</li>
            <li> I love this product, I will order again</li>
            <li> I received my purchase in the mail on time which was about the only plus to this purchase. When I received the product it was packaged very poorly and the acrylic powder was all over inside and quite the mess to try and clean up. Which brings me to my 2nd point of since i knew the product would be very small containers why couldnt they try to package this up more securely so I get the most bang for my buck. Let&#x27;s think for a minuet its getting shipped from China to the United States that&#x27;s a very long way to travel just as an FYI mine was strickly in a plastic shipping bag not bubble wrapped or anything. I would not buy this product again!!!</li>
            <li> The jars are TINY! They are way smaller than the pictures make them out to be.  These acrylic powders a very poor in quality.  they are more dusty than powdery so the acrylic does not clump very well.  It also does not spread well either.  This acrylic is very sticky and does not last long.  I would not recommend this acrylic to ANYONE not even beginners.  Invest the money into a good acrylic powder.</li>
            <li> These cases are really small, but it does have good acrylic powder, but you will definitely run out of powder quickly if you do both hands and like to do Japanese style nails.</li>
            <li> very small jar of prduct. but they came quick. its alright. nothing too special about them. i wish it was self leveling. would have been much more helpful</li>
            <li> I ordered these because it said acrylic.. but i received uv gel instead. Ughhhh</li>
            <li> Was open a little and  waste in bag</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff. it stays on dose not chip or break. It&#x27;s wonderful. I&#x27;m doing friends nails now cuz they love it as well.</li>
            <li> theyre really tiny but they do the job</li>
            <li> came in tact good delivery</li>
            <li> i ordered 2 packs of them, i got them before the time i was supposed to, but when i got it i opened the 6 pack and two of them were opened.</li>
            <li> Just what I need to complete my set of nail care items.</li>
            <li> I choose the five star rating due to the fact that all three colors are needed to complete the perfect manicure.  The product arrived just as it was advertise to be.  Although it took some time since being delivered frome China.  I have not use it as of yet, because I have already got a manicure the day the producet arrived.  I am soo looking forward to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Antoinette M. Oloko</li>
            <li> This is the size I expected bigger but let&#x27;s see how they work .</li>
            <li> I thought they would be bigger, and when they weren&#x27;t I was thinking at least they came with a bit, but I was wrong there too. There is a spacer in the jar so it isn&#x27;t as deep as it seems. It&#x27;s about two of those small containers that glitter comes in, in each jar. I think that is a small amount. I won&#x27;t be ordering powder here again.</li>
            <li> After reading others reviews l was leery about what l would receive. Received 3 containers that were enough for touch ups, and l did get white, pink and clear. For the price l am satisfied.</li>
            <li> When I receive demand</li>
            <li> Better than the expensive kind</li>
            <li> Very thick and hard to work.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look exactly like the picture, there actually a smaller.</li>
            <li> Runs out too quick. Wish they were bigger</li>
            <li> I got all 3 colors as i ordered them. The product works great, and i do my own nails and families and they r just as good as salon, i will definitely purchase this again. Also came a week and a half earlier than expected!!</li>
            <li> Extremely upset. I never received the acrylic powder</li>
            <li> Ordered acrylic powders, but received uv gels instead, but I actually like the uv gels better</li>
            <li> early and great product</li>
            <li> I CAN DO MY OWN NAILS.&lt;br /&gt;VERY AFFORDABLE&lt;br /&gt;GOT IT SOONER THEN EXPECTED. I JUST LOVE THIS PRODUCT THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. The bottles are very cheap and they do not look professional at all. Would recommend other acrylic powders.</li>
