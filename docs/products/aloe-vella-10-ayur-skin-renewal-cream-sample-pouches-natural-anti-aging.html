    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It may be awesome for wrinkles, in my opinion you can keep it....</li>
            <li>Good thing!  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the result on my face as well..</li>
            <li>but it does make ur skin look nice.</li>
            <li>Great product really does work!!!</li>
            <li>It smells like baby powder and is very strong.  </li>
            <li>Of course, most any lotion or cream will work just as well there.</li>
            <li>My wife ordered this after seeing something in a magazine indicating that you should use Aloe Vella Wrinkless Cream, and put this - Aloe Vella AYUR 5 Skin Renewal Cream - on top.</li>
            <li>Sure it must work for someone else.</li>
            <li>the fragrance was too strong for me to use.  </li>
            <li>I have an allergy to strong scents.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I ordered the $5 \\&quot;free\\&quot; trial and received 60 days worth (2 bottles each) of cream.</li>
            <li>Just ok, really not as advertised</li>
            <li>I did use it on my rough elbows and it worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>But not a quitter, my wife decided to use the creams on her left hand and arm, and did not use anything on the right hand and arm.</li>
            <li>If it works, you can live with the smell.  </li>
            <li>Wow, what fraud!</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;free trial\\&quot; was apparently for 15 days, after which I now own TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS worth of horrible face cream.</li>
            <li>The key ingredient according to the magazine of the Wrinkless Cream was allegedly the winter cherry extract, while the key ingredient mixed with this in the Ayur 5 is &amp;#34;gold water.&amp;#34; According to the article (ad is more like it), these two products used together were the key to anti-aging without surgery.</li>
            <li>As such, she discontinued use and went back to her old products.</li>

            <li> She is 52, spends a lot of time in the sun, and has quite a few sun spots.</li>

            <li> Oh, and the cream is awful, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This one was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> The odor is unpleasant, but of course, vanity must suffer.  </li>
            <li> It smells terrible as well.</li>
            <li> forgot the smell - it is awful.  </li>

            <li> It may be awesome for wrinkles, in my opinion you can keep it....the smell, yikes. I will keep my wrinkles!!!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice any differnece after using</li>
            <li> Smells like vitamins but it does make ur skin look nice.</li>
            <li> This company is totally fraudulent--do not be scammed!! I ordered the $5 \\&quot;free\\&quot; trial and received 60 days worth (2 bottles each) of cream. I was charged $10 on that credit card statement. However, on my following credit card bill I have charges for $100 and $139!!!!! The \\&quot;free trial\\&quot; was apparently for 15 days, after which I now own TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS worth of horrible face cream. Wow, what fraud! I was also automatically signed up for autoship, so if I had not called them I would have continued to receive charges on my credit card. Oh, and the cream is awful, don&#x27;t waste your money. I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks with zero benefit. It smells terrible as well.</li>
            <li> the fragrance was too strong for me to use.  I have an allergy to strong scents.</li>
            <li> This one was a disappointment.  I didn&#x27;t like the way it felt and it caused my makeup to feel tacky all day.  I did use it on my rough elbows and it worked just fine.  Of course, most any lotion or cream will work just as well there.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough.</li>
            <li> could see a big difference on my hands.Very satisfied with the result on my face as well..</li>
            <li> Great product really does work!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable differences.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this after seeing something in a magazine indicating that you should use Aloe Vella Wrinkless Cream, and put this - Aloe Vella AYUR 5 Skin Renewal Cream - on top. The key ingredient according to the magazine of the Wrinkless Cream was allegedly the winter cherry extract, while the key ingredient mixed with this in the Ayur 5 is &amp;#34;gold water.&amp;#34; According to the article (ad is more like it), these two products used together were the key to anti-aging without surgery. Thank goodness for trial samples! Even so, five sample packets of this and five packets of the Wrinkless Cream cost $8.95 shipping and handling. My wife used these on her face for a few days, and while it did not break out her sensitive skin, she noticed that her pores were looking somewhat larger and clogged. As such, she discontinued use and went back to her old products. But not a quitter, my wife decided to use the creams on her left hand and arm, and did not use anything on the right hand and arm. She is 52, spends a lot of time in the sun, and has quite a few sun spots. After using the products in this manner, she could not see any difference in the reduction of sun spots on the left arm. Not a miracle, at least for her.&lt;br /&gt;I forgot the smell - it is awful.  It smells like baby powder and is very strong.  The odor is unpleasant, but of course, vanity must suffer.  If it works, you can live with the smell.  But for what this did, it was not worth the unpleasant odor for my wife.</li>
            <li> They say to mix the two kinds together but don&#x27;t tell you if it is equal amounts or what</li>
            <li> I forgot there is fragrance in this stuff - that&#x27;s why I only tried it.  Good thing!  Sure it must work for someone else.</li>
            <li> Just ok, really not as advertised</li>
