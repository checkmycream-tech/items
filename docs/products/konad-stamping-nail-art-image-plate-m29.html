            <li> not sure cause I havent tried it yet, but just from looking at it.  </li>
            <li> and I can pick one up randomly when I have a mood to try a different color)</li>
            <li> Images are a bit small (that&#x27;s Konad)</li>
            <li> There is nothing negative that can be said about the quality of these plates.</li>
            <li> Although, I think Konad plates are ridiculously overpriced</li>

            <li> I am in love with these tropical designs. They always stamp cleanly and with amazing detail. I especially love the pineapple and use it frequently on my accent nail or big toenail. I love Konad brand!</li>
            <li> Although, I think Konad plates are ridiculously overpriced (Yes, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re laughing all the way to the bank w/my money), BUT I do think they&#x27;re better images (deeper for better transfer) than the generic plates... not sure cause I havent tried it yet, but just from looking at it.  This is the only Konad plate I&#x27;ve bought &amp; probably the last just cause I think they&#x27;re a rip off, but I love the images on this one.  This product was reasonably priced (compared to most) &amp; arrived faster than I expected &amp; in perfect condition w/good packaging!!  Thank you!!  ;)</li>
            <li> I use this plate the most out of my Konad plates, I love the Hawaii hibiscus, I use it with Sally Hansen Insta-Dri nail polish instead of Konad and press not roll (Sally Hansen offers more colors and I can pick one up randomly when I have a mood to try a different color) I also am very careful not to get polish in the word HAWAII I don&#x27;t care for the word etched underneath. Works wonderful and looks beautiful, I get tons of compliments! You gotta be real careful when applying top coat get a good one, I got Speed Demon and I very carefully apply a thin coat on top of my finished nails careful not to brush to hard or over the same area DO NOT GO OVER THE SAME AREA MORE THAN ONCE TILL THE CLEAR COAT IS DRY IT WILL SMUDGE THE DESIGN!

            <li> There is nothing negative that can be said about the quality of these plates. They are well made and will hold up well. The only complaint is the price and lack of a larger set. I dislike buying three or four of these for the price of another brands sets..... I will still keep purchasing these for my girlfriend though.</li>
