            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased these for organize my lipsticks...</li>
            <li>Ladies get them you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>I have so many tubes</li>
            <li>I love how I don&#x27;t have to search for the lipstick I want.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing two more.</li>
            <li>I love this and will probably buy another one for myself and another for my sister.</li>
            <li>All of my lipstick stayed in place, plus it looks cute on your vanity.</li>
            <li>Such a great price and quality!</li>
            <li>My regular MAC lipsticks fit in here perfectly, but the mineralize ones (in a thicker package) don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The color is unique and cute.</li>
            <li>Delivered VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>Super cute</li>
            <li>All of my Revlon and L&#x27;Oreal lipsticks fit in here just fine.</li>
            <li>Perfect, its sturdy quite on the heavy side.</li>
            <li>I thought it&#x27;d look cheap when I ordered it, but I needed something to organize my lipsticks ASAP.</li>
            <li>I love these, they are well made and the pink is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I honestly probably wouldn&#x27;t want the tube holes to be any bigger because the tray would take up more space, but the sides could be just a bit taller.</li>
            <li>True acrylic.</li>
            <li>anything very large won&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>Fun place to hold all my  lip sticks.</li>
            <li>The color is so different than any other organizers it&#x27;s perfect for any lady wanting to jazz up their make up area since purchasing this item I have bought several more items that match this one I recommend this in the products that match 100%</li>
            <li>It is thick and great quality and keeps my drawer organized.</li>
            <li>When I order this item I didn&#x27;t realize how pretty it was going to be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great quality, thick acrylic holder.</li>
            <li>It fits all of my lipstick brands nicely - Tarte, Wet</li>
            <li>I was hoping that some of my Nyx Butter Glosses would be able to go in here as well, but the sides aren&#x27;t really tall enough to hold a lipgloss tube up.</li>
            <li>It holds all my lipstick from the Maybelline Color Sensational lipsticks to my NYX round case to my Nars Audascious and MAC.  </li>
            <li>She said it would be nice if u can store the lipsticks upside down</li>
            <li>so u can easily see the lipstick label especially with MAC lipstick.</li>
            <li>Well, it does NOT look cheap, I ordered pink and I would buy again once it&#x27;s full.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using the acrylic lipstick holder in pink very much!  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t help to love it because its pink.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping(prime).</li>
            <li>It will fit standard sized lipsticks -</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and they came packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>It fits flat bottomed tubes just fine</li>
            <li>All of my lipsticks fit inside of it (Mac, elf, revlon, urban decay, etc) from drugstore to high end.</li>
            <li>I bought the pink and clear and I love them both.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Ordered this under my boyfriends account because he has Prime and let me just say they are BETTER THAN EXPECTED!!!</li>
            <li>The pink color is very pretty</li>
            <li>I recommend this for the acrylic material is thick, not thin, so it won&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li>My only wish is they made a large makeup case with drawers to match.  </li>
            <li>I needed something to clear off my makeup desk.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>I am a complete lipstick junkie.</li>
            <li>&#x27;n Wild, Too Faced, Sleek,</li>
            <li>I really like this and may get the compact holder that comes in in the same color.  </li>
            <li>I love how thick it is.</li>
            <li>I mean I couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything better to hold my lipsticks and lip gloss and for the price.....</li>
            <li>They fit the really big Square lipsticks from Maybelline and the small ones from mac !</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s a medium pink almost hot pink.  </li>
            <li>The only down point for me is it is a little pricey for all the tubes I have to fit.</li>
            <li>I got the pink color, its heavy and feels super sturdy</li>
            <li>If you want to put lipstick upside down and they have rounded tops like Mac so you can read or see the color, they look kind of sloppy and angled.  </li>

            <li> My only complaint is the price.</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;oreal Color Riche Liquid Lipsticks do not fit though, but I just turn them upside down anyways for the color label.  </li>
            <li> It holds 24 lipsticks as pictured and takes up just a small space on my vanity.  </li>
            <li> it is sort of ridiculous, so</li>
            <li> The acrylic is very hard and sturdy.</li>
            <li> but if you have a lot of lipsticks it could be slightly annoying.  </li>

            <li> Im just blown away by how good this product is, I mean I couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything better to hold my lipsticks and lip gloss and for the price.....wow. I bought the pink and clear and I love them both. They hold my mac, covergirl and nyx lipstick quite well. True acrylic. Absolutely amazing. Im ordering another pink. Ladies get them you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>

            <li> Perfect, perfect, perfect. I love these, they are well made and the pink is gorgeous. My only complaint is the price. eBay has them for way cheaper.</li>
            <li> Perfect, its sturdy quite on the heavy side. Fits all sizes of the lipsticks I have. Can&#x27;t help to love it because its pink. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am a complete lipstick junkie. I have so many tubes it is sort of ridiculous, so it was obvious I needed something to clear off my makeup desk. I bought this in the pink transparent color. It was beautiful. The acrylic is very hard and sturdy.

I love how I don&#x27;t have to search for the lipstick I want. My mac lipsticks look gorgeous in it. I will be purchasing two more. One in pink and another in purple.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my lipsticks!</li>
            <li> This pairs the compact organizer that I bought too. I recommend this for the acrylic material is thick, not thin, so it won&#x27;t break easily. The color is unique and cute.</li>
            <li> I just got my pink lipstick organizer in the mail today and I love it! It&#x27;s great quality, thick acrylic holder. My regular MAC lipsticks fit in here perfectly, but the mineralize ones (in a thicker package) don&#x27;t. All of my Revlon and L&#x27;Oreal lipsticks fit in here just fine. I was hoping that some of my Nyx Butter Glosses would be able to go in here as well, but the sides aren&#x27;t really tall enough to hold a lipgloss tube up. I honestly probably wouldn&#x27;t want the tube holes to be any bigger because the tray would take up more space, but the sides could be just a bit taller. I love this and will probably buy another one for myself and another for my sister. I would recommend these for sure!</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Delivered VERY quickly. Good price Good product. Can&#x27;t ask for more!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping(prime). My girl loved it so it does what it does. She said it would be nice if u can store the lipsticks upside down so u can easily see the lipstick label especially with MAC lipstick.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using the acrylic lipstick holder in pink very much!  It holds all my lipstick from the Maybelline Color Sensational lipsticks to my NYX round case to my Nars Audascious and MAC.  The L&#x27;oreal Color Riche Liquid Lipsticks do not fit though, but I just turn them upside down anyways for the color label.  No big deal.  I woudl recommend these holders to all the makeup junkies!</li>
            <li> Love it and very fast shipping , great seller , thank you</li>
            <li> This lipstick organizer is perfect. It fits all of my lipstick brands nicely - Tarte, Wet &#x27;n Wild, Too Faced, Sleek, etc.  It will fit standard sized lipsticks - anything very large won&#x27;t fit.  The pink color is very pretty - it&#x27;s a medium pink almost hot pink.  It holds 24 lipsticks as pictured and takes up just a small space on my vanity.  The sides come up about an inch so it&#x27;s not deep enough to store tall lip gloss.  It fits flat bottomed tubes just fine but that&#x27;s the key.  If you want to put lipstick upside down and they have rounded tops like Mac so you can read or see the color, they look kind of sloppy and angled.  My collection is small enough so it&#x27;s not a problem but if you have a lot of lipsticks it could be slightly annoying.  I really like this and may get the compact holder that comes in in the same color.  My only wish is they made a large makeup case with drawers to match.  Great products - I say get it.</li>
            <li> I brought it in pink! Super cute and I love it!</li>
            <li> Great Quality!! All of my lipstick stayed in place, plus it looks cute on your vanity. I sold!! Will be a repeat buyer</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful, the quality is obvious, and it feels as great as it looks. It fits everything include my Nars audacious lipsticks. Total lifesaver.</li>
            <li> Ordered this under my boyfriends account because he has Prime and let me just say they are BETTER THAN EXPECTED!!! Shipping was fast and they came packaged very well.  I got the pink color, its heavy and feels super sturdy, I&#x27;m in love and want to order more for sure!  Also got the lip gloss holder in pick and they look perfect in my bathroom!  So happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Fun place to hold all my  lip sticks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very high, so things you put in it tip .</li>
            <li> Great product!!! My daughter loved it!!!</li>
            <li> They fit the really big Square lipsticks from Maybelline and the small ones from mac ! PERFECT</li>
            <li> Holds all my lipsticks</li>
            <li> Such a great price and quality! Excellent for any makeup fan!</li>
            <li> I thought it&#x27;d look cheap when I ordered it, but I needed something to organize my lipsticks ASAP. Well, it does NOT look cheap, I ordered pink and I would buy again once it&#x27;s full.</li>
