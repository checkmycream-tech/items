            <li>This is a great little mirror for the purse.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;It is slim, fits well in makeup bag and is exactly as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the magnifier and the regular mirror choices it has.</li>

            <li>On a positive note, the mirror seems sturdy and well-constructed.</li>

            <li>I had another, much heavier one, and needed to lighten up my purse load.  </li>
            <li>Its very well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough to squeeze into any bag, yet very easy to use for styling the back of your hair in a hotel mirror, the case is nice and sturdy, and the mirrors are well made, very easy to open, but securely stays closed.</li>
            <li>I got purple, but I really love pink!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter to me that it&#x27;s \\&quot;soft touch\\&quot; plastic, but it seems pretty durable.  </li>
            <li>was pink and the second was lavender), but it doesn&#x27;t really matter since they are hidden away most of the time.</li>
            <li>It is quite small, but that&#x27;s fine for my purposes.</li>
            <li>This is compact, fits easily in a small purse and would also fit in a pocket.  </li>

            <li> The only bad is I got the blue instead of the purple. It&#x27;s a neat little mirror and for the price, I&#x27;m thinking of getting a second one .</li>
            <li> I like these very much, especially because I can close them to protect the glass; good for traveling.</li>
            <li> I love it! However I wish there was an option to choose color! I got purple, but I really love pink! Other than that, I would recommend!!</li>
            <li> Simple, cheap, looks nice. Great buy. I&#x27;d buy again if I needed to!</li>
            <li> This mirror is tiny.  This might be really great for your purse, but I found that the mirror was too small to be practical. On a positive note, the mirror seems sturdy and well-constructed.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my purse.  I had another, much heavier one, and needed to lighten up my purse load.  This one is perfect, cute, and very compact!!</li>

            <li> This is compact, fits easily in a small purse and would also fit in a pocket.  As described, includes one regular and one magnified view.  The viewing space is small, but acceptable.  It doesn&#x27;t matter to me that it&#x27;s \\&quot;soft touch\\&quot; plastic, but it seems pretty durable.  Probably could have found a cheaper-priced mirror if I&#x27;d shopped around in town, but that would have taken a lot longer.</li>
            <li> Health issues keep me in bed for long hours. I needed a mirror small enough to fit in bedside table, not easily breakable, that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank. This mirror fit on all counts. I use it mostly for tweezing  and flossing. One side is magnified, one side not. It closes to keep it safe and clean. I would guess it would be good to carry in a bag to check make up while out and about. I would buy it again.</li>

Maybe a little bigger than I expected, but it is absolutely what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is really small.  Too small to be usable.  The dimensions in the description are for the entire mirror opened up (both sides), not for the compact itself.</li>
            <li> cute putting in Easter bags</li>
