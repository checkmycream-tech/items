            <li>just smells like clean happiness in a bottle. :)</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves it even more then me: the guy never notices *</li>
            <li>I love blackberries and that is what this scent smells like.  </li>
            <li>I wish they&#x27;d come up with a better name however.</li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with this perfume.</li>
            <li>When I looked at the bottle, the shape is slightly more square than the rectangular bottle I&#x27;ve purchased in store before.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite fragrances.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love Philosophy spray fragrances, but this was crappy.  </li>
            <li>so I purchased more for her.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this scent.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>so glad she did.</li>
            <li>you will love this one.</li>
            <li>CEO of OVERSTOCK should keep better tabs on the people packaging their goods.</li>
            <li>The original perfume from Sephora smells incredible, lasts long, and comes in a nice box with directions.</li>
            <li>It smells very sweet and sugary, like cotton candy.</li>
            <li>Smells like sweet cotton candy to me with a hint of jasmine on top.</li>
            <li>this one and true love are one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light (seems like you need to use a lot).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and not overly fruity/floral or musky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit it, I&#x27;m cheap.</li>
            <li>Good if you have young kids, or just can&#x27;t handle over powering perfume.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased this product 3 years ago and have been sure to have some on hand ever since.</li>
            <li>This item was nothing like what my wife had originally purchased.  </li>
            <li>A clean scent that&#x27;s fun yet feminine, perfect for year round, day or night.</li>
            <li>but yet he always notices when I&#x27;m wearing this, and he requests me to wear it for special occasions.</li>
            <li>I can smell it on my clothes when I take them off, but a beautiful light scent for those of us who don&#x27;t like heavy perfumes.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>And the scent is not the same as an authentic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller insisted it was authentic, but the unprofessional email response I received convinced me this product is a scam.</li>
            <li>This is a very soft, feminine, floral perfume that fades over time into an extremely sexy lightened scent.</li>
            <li>If you love soft , vanilla with a fruity scent</li>
            <li>This is the original real deal.</li>
            <li>Love the sweet yet mysterious fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and natural smelling.  </li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;The first sign that something was &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; was the packaging -- a manila envelope taped over itself with a bubble-wrapped bottle inside.</li>
            <li>First I thought that maybe I needed to spray just my skin, so I did.  </li>
            <li>Though I don&#x27;t like the spray version as well as the solid, I am completely devoted to the clean, sweet-but-not-too-sweet scent of Falling in Love.  </li>
            <li>This is either not the original perfume, or it is years old.</li>
            <li>It is not too sweet but sweet enough for the &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; scent</li>
            <li>I get lots of positive comments.  </li>
            <li>This is not the real product .</li>
            <li>My boyfriends mother bought me the little bottle because she thought the name was so cute</li>
            <li>It has such a soft, clean smell.  </li>
            <li>There was no box, as the fragrance would come in if you purchased it new in store.</li>
            <li>Live the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents and get headaches if something is too chemical.  </li>
            <li>In reality, their prices are consistent with other higher end products.</li>
            <li>Maybe if the price would go down it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>At that time, they made a compact with solid perfume in it, and I bought one as a complete impulse buy.  </li>
            <li>and I still can barely smell it.</li>
            <li>I always felt that other vendors charged too much.</li>

            <li> Subtle and fresh.</li>
            <li> I will dabble in other scents from other companies, but I will always keep a steady flow of this gem.</li>
            <li> I sprayed myself about 5-7 times, on my shirt and neck area, I could barely smell it and after a half hour there was no smell at all.  </li>
            <li> Long retired BBW scents that I have searched for!</li>
            <li> Bottle looks different than all of my other bottled.</li>
            <li> I have never loved a perfume so much.  </li>
            <li> Be careful....</li>
            <li> I like it all by itself, or stacked with other scents.  </li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> I think for the price is not worth to buy.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for at least 6 years now and usually purchase through philosophy direct but opted to try from Amazon this time.  </li>
            <li> in the pull down menu under the concentrated oil, there is a \\&quot;2oz\\&quot; option, this is the spray perfume.  </li>
            <li> From cleansers, to moisturizers, to fragrances, Philosophy has never let me down in terms of quality.</li>
            <li> The price was slightly cheaper and didn&#x27;t have to pay for shipping.  </li>
            <li> Did not smell like the exact same one I bought at the department store:(</li>
            <li> Too expensive to only last on you for a few hours.</li>
            <li> There was no original box with the description of the perfume.</li>
            <li> It is a fake, like the guys who sell Louis Vuittons on the streets of D.C. FAKE and CHEAPLY made.</li>
            <li> I am sending it BACK right away and am very disappointed that people out there take advantage of others.</li>
            <li> At least that is what arrived.  </li>
            <li> I was never a perfume person until I tried this scent on while bored in a make-up store with my cosmetic-loving sister.  </li>
            <li> I am not a happy camper, but I cannot return it because I opened it!  </li>
            <li> The label on the bottle is wrong.</li>
            <li> Retail stores are too expensive.</li>
            <li> The bottle was dirty, had finger prints and sticky stuff all over it, had mold/mildew growing in the cap, and was dented.</li>
            <li> I wanted oil, because of allergies (sprays give me headaches), but this one isn&#x27;t so bad, so I kept it.</li>
            <li> Smells bad.</li>
            <li> Bottle was dirty and stained and perfume smelled horrible.  </li>
            <li> This was the worst item that I have ever bought online.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> This perfume smells so insanely delicious - I love it. Smells like sweet cotton candy to me with a hint of jasmine on top. A clean scent that&#x27;s fun yet feminine, perfect for year round, day or night. I just wish it lasted longer on my skin!</li>
            <li> The smell is amazinly beautiful but after about two hours or so the smell is gone.  I think for the price is not worth to buy.  Maybe if the price would go down it&#x27;s worth it.  Too expensive to only last on you for a few hours.</li>
            <li> This is a great starter fragrance.  I was never a perfume person until I tried this scent on while bored in a make-up store with my cosmetic-loving sister.  At that time, they made a compact with solid perfume in it, and I bought one as a complete impulse buy.  I have never looked back.  I&#x27;m now on my fourth purchase of this fragrance.  Though I don&#x27;t like the spray version as well as the solid, I am completely devoted to the clean, sweet-but-not-too-sweet scent of Falling in Love.  My boyfriend loves it even more then me: the guy never notices *anything* but yet he always notices when I&#x27;m wearing this, and he requests me to wear it for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I love blackberries and that is what this scent smells like.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents and get headaches if something is too chemical.  \\&quot;Falling in Love\\&quot; never affects me that way.  It&#x27;s light and natural smelling.  I wish they&#x27;d come up with a better name however. Despite the silly name this is a simple yet sophisticated scent.</li>
            <li> Love the sweet yet mysterious fragrance. It is not too sweet but sweet enough for the &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; scent</li>
            <li> Falling in Love perfume is a wonderful, feminine scent.  I read it described as having vanilla overtones and blackberry undertones.  I get lots of positive comments.  The scent is light (seems like you need to use a lot).  Be careful....in the pull down menu under the concentrated oil, there is a \\&quot;2oz\\&quot; option, this is the spray perfume.  At least that is what arrived.  I wanted oil, because of allergies (sprays give me headaches), but this one isn&#x27;t so bad, so I kept it. V- in Sheridan, WY USA</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with this perfume. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years now and I don&#x27;t see myself stopping anytime soon. It&#x27;s a clean scent, not powdery and it has the perfect level of sweetness without being overbearing.</li>
            <li> My favorite!  Quick shipping.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a counterfeit product.&lt;br /&gt;The first sign that something was &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; was the packaging -- a manila envelope taped over itself with a bubble-wrapped bottle inside. There was no box, as the fragrance would come in if you purchased it new in store. When I looked at the bottle, the shape is slightly more square than the rectangular bottle I&#x27;ve purchased in store before. Also, there is no trademark symbol on the label, as is shown in the product image. The bottle cap had scratches/dents on it. And the scent is not the same as an authentic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller insisted it was authentic, but the unprofessional email response I received convinced me this product is a scam. DO NOT BUY IT!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances.  I have been using it for at least 6 years now and usually purchase through philosophy direct but opted to try from Amazon this time.  The price was slightly cheaper and didn&#x27;t have to pay for shipping.  Great item great price.</li>
            <li> Did not smell like the exact same one I bought at the department store:(</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Philosophy spray fragrances, but this was crappy.  I sprayed myself about 5-7 times, on my shirt and neck area, I could barely smell it and after a half hour there was no smell at all.  First I thought that maybe I needed to spray just my skin, so I did.  Same thing happened.  I am not a happy camper, but I cannot return it because I opened it!  How are we supposed to try it, if we don&#x27;t open it and use it?  Guess we shouldn&#x27;t buy spray fragrances online huh!!</li>
            <li> My daughter has used this perfume before and just loves it, I had bought her some before and she had&lt;br /&gt;run out so I purchased more for her.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent. I picked it up on a whim one day at a store and have been wearing it ever since. It&#x27;s light and not overly fruity/floral or musky. I can&#x27;t pin point any once smell it just smells like clean happiness in a bottle. :)</li>
            <li> this one and true love are one of my favorites.  all of their fragrances are a hit with all the ladies in my family.</li>
            <li> Live the smell. Very easy on skin.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. The price was a great value.</li>
            <li> great price for Falling in Love!! I always felt that other vendors charged too much.</li>
            <li> Given as gift. Loved it</li>
            <li> I always have Philosophy&#x27;s &amp;#34;Falling in Love&amp;#34; fragrance on my dressing table... It is my go to without a doubt...</li>
            <li> I absolutley love this perfume! It smells very sweet and sugary, like cotton candy. The only drawback is, it stays for about 10mins, then it&#x27;s gone. I always have to constantly spray it over and over for it to finally stay longer.</li>
            <li> The best perfume! Subtle and fresh.</li>
            <li> This is not the real product . The label on the bottle is wrong.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.  It has such a soft, clean smell.  Good if you have young kids, or just can&#x27;t handle over powering perfume.  I wear it every day.</li>
            <li> I have to spray about 3-4 times and I still can barely smell it. I can smell it on my clothes when I take them off, but a beautiful light scent for those of us who don&#x27;t like heavy perfumes. Philosophy PLEASE make a purse size for in this scent for re-applying. You&#x27;ll like it, just spray liberally!</li>
            <li> I like it all by itself, or stacked with other scents.  I have also purchased this tem in a smaller size as a gift.</li>
            <li> Great gift for my sister. Arrived sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> Smells like sparkling snowflake and frosted snowdrop ... Long retired BBW scents that I have searched for! This is so close I just wish it lasted longer! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Have always worn this perfume. This is either not the original perfume, or it is years old. Smells bad. Bottle looks different than all of my other bottled.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. Retail stores are too expensive. This is the original real deal. I will order again soon.</li>
            <li> My boyfriends mother bought me the little bottle because she thought the name was so cute and im so glad she did. I have never loved a perfume so much.  I love the delicious, sparkling berry and vanilla smell and ive gotten nothing but complements when I wear it. If you love soft , vanilla with a fruity scent you will love this one.</li>
            <li> This is a very soft, feminine, floral perfume that fades over time into an extremely sexy lightened scent. I first purchased this product 3 years ago and have been sure to have some on hand ever since. It&#x27;s a great day-to-day fragrance that isn&#x27;t overpowering. Philosophy products are always above par. From cleansers, to moisturizers, to fragrances, Philosophy has never let me down in terms of quality. When it comes to price, I will always have a problem. I&#x27;ll admit it, I&#x27;m cheap. In reality, their prices are consistent with other higher end products. I will dabble in other scents from other companies, but I will always keep a steady flow of this gem.</li>
            <li> This was the worst item that I have ever bought online.  This item was nothing like what my wife had originally purchased.  Bottle was dirty and stained and perfume smelled horrible.  I will never purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> The original perfume from Sephora smells incredible, lasts long, and comes in a nice box with directions. THIS seller is obviously making COUNTERFEIT bottles of perfume. The bottle was dirty, had finger prints and sticky stuff all over it, had mold/mildew growing in the cap, and was dented. There was no original box with the description of the perfume. It is a fake, like the guys who sell Louis Vuittons on the streets of D.C. FAKE and CHEAPLY made. I am sending it BACK right away and am very disappointed that people out there take advantage of others. CEO of OVERSTOCK should keep better tabs on the people packaging their goods.</li>
            <li> my favorite perfume ever!!</li>
