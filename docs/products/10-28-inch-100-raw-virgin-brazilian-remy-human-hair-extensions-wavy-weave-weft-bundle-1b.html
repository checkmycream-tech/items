            <li>It could have been more durable .Overall</li>
            <li>loved it, super soft, beautiful and manageable hair.</li>
            <li>There were a couple of comments made about the smell of the hair and you better believe it had a strong smell.</li>

            <li>The hair is very soft and smooth and has a nice shine that&#x27;s there even after washing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to bundles being full from weft to ends</li>
            <li>:) successes thanks to you ............</li>
            <li>I received my package fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this hair its so soft and full had it for a week and no shedding, I will b ordering again</li>
            <li>but they were right.</li>
            <li>You have to use the right products on this hair.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and the hair surprisingly VERY decent for the price.</li>
            <li>The only thing good about this hair was that it was soft.</li>
            <li>Soft an easy to handle.</li>
            <li>This is a joke first</li>
            <li>This hair is the longer side of the bob which actually turned out cute.</li>
            <li>Even though I have some complaints the quality of the hair is a lot better than the hair that I&#x27;ve purchased at local beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li>dried it.it was still good</li>
            <li>First off I am glad I read other reviews before making my purchase.</li>
            <li>Responsible in all its aspect from america Venezuela grateful</li>
            <li>It was shipped fast though.</li>
            <li>The ends of the hair were really thin, the only ok thing about the hair is that it feels nice.</li>
            <li>And of course it sheds too not a lot but its a little more than I wanted.</li>
            <li>and I had to cut 7 inches off this hair and added it to some old bundles I had laying around to make a bob wig.</li>
            <li>Other than that the hair feels great have not experienced any tangles yet.</li>
            <li>Its just the hair starts to tangle period and to get it back to normal seems like you got to straighten it everyday, but if you just moisturize it every single day you will be ok</li>
            <li>I wash the hair and dry it and its not wavy anymore its practically straight.</li>
            <li>It was very soft initially when I received it</li>
            <li>On the plus side the hair is soft and is 100% Brazilian hair which is the only reason why I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars.</li>
            <li>so i was forced to take it out after i paid to get it done &amp; purchasing this cheap ass hair.</li>

            <li> and it just got worse.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the product, its frustrating</li>

            <li> it was beautiful hair at first, people were not lying about the smell of the hair either. Its just the hair starts to tangle period and to get it back to normal seems like you got to straighten it everyday, but if you just moisturize it every single day you will be ok</li>
            <li> The only thing good about this hair was that it was soft. Other than that it SHED like crazy, tangled easy, and when i tried to straighten it the wave didnt go away. I took care of it, wrapped it up every night and braided and washed it. Didnt do s*** but anger it and it just got worse. Chunks of hair came out with just a finger run through. Paid to get it done and took the crap down two weeks after. It got to the point to where it wasnt manageable anymore so i was forced to take it out after i paid to get it done &amp; purchasing this cheap ass hair. Thought everything would be all good &amp; peachy after I saw the reviews but nope. NEVER AGAIN!</li>
            <li> loved it, super soft, beautiful and manageable hair. looks great! I totally recommend it. Super long and excellent quality hair!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t put in my hair yet but. I think so far is good. I dye mine. Only thing I think they ripped me off with just one bundle.</li>
            <li> This hair was horrible! Terribly matted and tangled on the 2nd day installed. I washed my hair 3 days after installing and it turned into a ball of knots even after using Aragon oil shampoo /conditioner. Terrible choice to purchase! Waste of my money!</li>
            <li> I received my package fairly quickly. The bundles are processed even though it says &#x27;raw&#x27; in the headline. I co-washed it and it began feeling like plastic. I will never purchase this again. I decided not to listen to any of the other reviews but they were right.</li>
            <li> My lady is a hair dresser in Dominican Republic.&lt;br /&gt;this product do no accept color .&lt;br /&gt;So bad product.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this product any more</li>
            <li> I purchased this 24 inch bundle from the vendor &amp;#34;new hair&amp;#34;. I already have 3 bundles of Brazilian hair (20,22,24in) and needed a 4th for fullness but that was a fail. On the plus side the hair is soft and is 100% Brazilian hair which is the only reason why I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars. This hair is not virgin hair, the ends are way too thin and the shedding is terrible. Washed and conditioned then flat ironed the hair. This is a joke first this is not a 100g bundle and I had to cut 7 inches off this hair and added it to some old bundles I had laying around to make a bob wig. This hair is the longer side of the bob which actually turned out cute. As a stylist I try to find good quality hair at an affordable price and this is not it. I&#x27;m used to bundles being full from weft to ends I will not purchase this hair again. Had to buy another 24in bundle from another company and vendor.</li>
            <li> Great hair &amp; nice bundles I ordered 3  bundles and only used 2 1/2</li>
            <li> The inches of the hair is way off I order a 24&amp;#34; 18&amp;#34; and 16&amp;#34; (haven&#x27;t gotten the 18&amp;#34; yet) the 24&amp;#34; and the 16&amp;#34; were the same there was only a half of inch difference. The ends of the hair were really thin, the only ok thing about the hair is that it feels nice. If I had more time and didn&#x27;t need the hair right now I would send it back ask for a refund n never order it again.</li>
            <li> I love this hair its so soft and full had it for a week and no shedding, I will b ordering again</li>
            <li> Got my hair today And it was great until I washed it.it was very dirty but even after I washed and blow dried it.it was still good</li>
            <li> 1000% Satisfied with this Product. Delivery was quick and the hair surprisingly VERY decent for the price. I was surprised yet thrilled! Will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Responsible in all its aspect from america Venezuela grateful :) successes thanks to you ............ Good day gentlemen&lt;br /&gt;very responsabele</li>
            <li> I ordered this hair On May 7 and received it MAY 13 . I actually ordered a 24 inch but I was sent 26 inches. I purchased one bundle to add to hair I already had. This hair had a nice texture . Once I washed it , it was even better . You have to use the right products on this hair. I use cream of nature with argon oil. I installed it today , it blends perfectly with the other hair I have. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the design of the wefts. It could have been more durable .Overall the hair is nice for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to straighten and flexi rod the hair. Minimal shedding also .After a couple of weeks this hair was horrible It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the product, its frustrating and  it turned out to USPS saying it did and the reality of the situation is that i didnt get it, but Vivian working with me trying to resolved this situation did an outstanding job!! she is Excellent at customer service! just because she went 10 extra miles to solve the issue is give it a 5 star! Just for her excellence at customer service.</li>
            <li> This is some bad hair</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this garbage ass hair! This s*** was not 3.5-4 oz! Y&#x27;all Are theives!.  I&#x27;m so dissatisfied and I have over 2,000 followers on Instagram I will tell people how tall robbed me of my bundles!.</li>
            <li> I just got my hair it was supposed to be 24 in. But when I measured it it was not even 18 in. It&#x27;s also very thin and not much hair. It was shipped fast though.</li>
            <li> Soft an easy to handle. Love it!</li>
            <li> Hair was not from the company it was advertised it was coming from. It was very soft initially when I received it but as I started installing it, i seem that it was tangled and had fuzzys in it. Also, when I cowashed the hair I saw dye come off the hair. The hair wasn&#x27;t a good grade of hair. It tangled a lot. I would not buy it again or suggest anyone else to.</li>
            <li> Product does not come as posted. Packaging is very small. The hair is soft but they give you a very small amount of hair. Will never order again</li>
            <li> The hair is very soft and smooth and has a nice shine that&#x27;s there even after washing. First off I am glad I read other reviews before making my purchase. There were a couple of comments made about the smell of the hair and you better believe it had a strong smell. So I decided to give the hair a wash before applying it. When I removed the gold band from the hair I found a lot of fuzz and filth. So of course I am a little disappointed. I mean who wants dirty hair! Anyways here is were I really get disappointed. I wash the hair and dry it and its not wavy anymore its practically straight. I bought the hair for the wavy and the fact that its not suppose to shed. And of course it sheds too not a lot but its a little more than I wanted. Other than that the hair feels great have not experienced any tangles yet. My rating is based off the hair being dirty and the fact it lost its wave after one wash! Other than that I would I have give in it 5 stars! The hair really is great even though there&#x27;s no wave. Even though I have some complaints the quality of the hair is a lot better than the hair that I&#x27;ve purchased at local beauty supply stores. it looks great and very pleased with how fast I received it. I will buy from them again.</li>
