            <li>i could never find a good color to stay and let me tell you this is the one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved it.</li>
            <li>This bleach was very gentle on my hair, yet was very effective at getting my hair to the yellow-blonde that is best for this color.</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful color, but if you happen to want it to be more pink--like on the box--then add some conditioner to the dye BEFORE you apply it to your hair.</li>
            <li>Great hair dye, better than manic panic.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product in the beginning.  </li>

            <li>I LOVE Splat!</li>
            <li>I love Splat!</li>
            <li>A great (and cheap) alternative to going to a hair salon.</li>
            <li>is the AMAZING part of the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I had amazing color for 2-3 months.</li>
            <li>all this product is freaking amazing</li>
            <li>I was kind of upset, but</li>
            <li>oh well, it was nice</li>
            <li>I was kind of upset, but</li>
            <li>oh well, it was nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been coloring my own hair for 10 years now.</li>
            <li>It protected my clothing very well, even if it wasn&#x27;t the best fashion</li>
            <li>:) My color lasts for a good month before looking pinkish.</li>
            <li>product itself has a nice, gel-like consistency.</li>
            <li>but that was my own fault.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t come out super light, so I was worried, but the color stuck beautifully!</li>
            <li>spend a bit more money and buy the kind the pros get</li>
            <li>The bleach worked great the dye after about an hour of leaving it in came out pretty nice.</li>
            <li>I love love LOVE the color of my hair!</li>
            <li>Then used the red for the underneath part of my hair and it turned out bright and beautiful...</li>
            <li>This color is absolutely beautiful &amp; so vibrant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this color and bleach on and off for a year now, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Love this color..</li>
            <li>A shower cap helps lock in both heat and moisture so your hair will bleach more evenly</li>
            <li>Even with the shower cap on, the top will probably lighten faster than the tips.</li>
            <li>You can add more bleach if you need to, but you probably shouldn&#x27;t leave it on for more than an hour.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>follow the instructions and all will be ok.</li>
            <li>I have been dying my own hair for years and always used punky hair dye but decided to give this a try since it was on sale really cheap.</li>
            <li>I love splat.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this color.</li>
            <li>Hair came out better</li>
            <li>And will keep using. :)</li>
            <li>dye my hair a lot, so I feel fairly confident in my abilities</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more of an Ariana Grande look, but I got Rihanna</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the vibrancy.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite dye.  </li>
            <li>I guess you can tell, I love it :)</li>
            <li>so I could see how my superiors would react before settling on something a bit more</li>
            <li>so when it fades out I just add more splat color to it, let it sit for an hour then rinse.</li>
            <li>ya head had to put a diffrent color in my hair to make it look better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dyed my hair many different colors, and I think Splat is one of the best.</li>
            <li>Many areas did not take at all.</li>
            <li>The dye will fade, all dyes do, most people nowtell me</li>
            <li>i put protected even with that the dye sure didnt do anything on my hair but did wonders on my skin ....</li>
            <li>Okay, this product did not work for me</li>
            <li>As advised, I used the bleach on my hair first to ensure bright results.  </li>
            <li>this is the best product for a cheap price,but i do warn you this will fade quickly,i strongly suggest that you use SoftSheen Carson &amp;#34;Hi-rez&amp;#34; In the red color after splat luscious raspberry has been faded out thank you :)</li>
            <li>Got this for penny&#x27;s more than I would have at Walmart which is fine because all the stores I tried were out.</li>
            <li>Now, my mom had never used a dye this runny, so my scalp was a very bright red</li>
            <li>Raspberry is actually very true description, I think.</li>
            <li>It was still bright bright light red.</li>
            <li>Wish there were more colors available in the permenant line</li>
            <li>It did fade a bit into a brilliant pinkish red.</li>
            <li>Fades fast go pro and get the good stuff either by a Sassoon out Sassoon store.</li>
            <li>Very fun to mix with darker reds and purples to get a more burgundy color.</li>
            <li>It also fades very quickly.</li>
            <li>and i was AMAZED of how bright and vibrant the dye was.</li>
            <li>it comes with, strong bleach from a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>fact, I&#x27;m&#x27; going to be buying the lusty lavender soon and applying it on my unbleached darker brown hair to see if i can get a nice deep purple instead of the bright light purple you get from bleaching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fact, I&#x27;m&#x27; going to be buying the lusty lavender soon and applying it on my unbleached darker brown hair to see if i can get a nice deep purple instead of the bright light purple you get from bleaching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, you can put this stuff on unbleached hair and it is still pretty noticeable.</li>
            <li>Make sure to keep the color on the full amount of time and DON&#x27;T skimp on the dye.</li>
            <li>If you can catch the stain right after you spill the dye, it wipes very easily off of marble/tile/countertop.</li>
            <li>The color is rich and vibrant and it lasts for a good while.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product so much so far!</li>
            <li>For instance, Pink Fetish comes out a very bright fuschia.</li>
            <li>I have used splat for the last year, i tried different shades of the bright red(wanting my hair as bright and fire truck red as i could get it) out of all the brands i have used this was the best.</li>
            <li>When I dried it, I was very impressed.</li>
            <li>I did not bleach my hair before hand, but I am a fairly light ginger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT WAS ON SALE SO CHEAP.</li>
            <li>Now I have light spots on my forehead.</li>
            <li>Well, I decided to turn to Splat since it&#x27;s relatively cheap</li>
            <li>highly recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for something BRIGHT, LOUD, and FUNKY! :), and it wasn&#x27;t directly on top of my hair getting exposure to sunlight and water from the shower, so maybe that helped, too.</li>
            <li>The colours are very unique and bright, My daughter used the red.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve tried almost every brand and color available.</li>
            <li>and I got an awesome red/on the verge of hot pink color (which is what raspberry is by the way).</li>
            <li>But left my hair with a nice bown-red fade that still shimmered in the sun!</li>
            <li>do not bleach my hair anymore and this showed up beautifully with decent vibrancy on my naturally ginger hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the right light, it looks a great Elmo red.</li>
            <li>In the right light, it looks a great Elmo red.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for something BRIGHT, LOUD, and FUNKY! :)</li>
            <li>Protect every surface the best that you can, and be prepared to rinse out (maybe even wipe down) your tub after the first couple of washes.</li>
            <li>My nephew has as well&amp;it never wlrks right!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you are, in fact, looking to turn your hair bright red.</li>
            <li>looks like I was born with outrageously bright red hair!</li>
            <li>I bleached my already blonde hair, which I should not have done, because I didn&#x27;t realize how bright the color was.</li>
            <li>After quite some time, I just decided it was good enough.</li>
            <li>The reason you will need a shower cap is that the effects of the bleach are intensified by heat, so if you have longer hair, the heat from your scalp will cause the top of your head to lighten much faster than the tips.</li>
            <li>I love the color but its just too much work.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just got lucky, but 1.5 bottles of bleach was enough to get the job done surprisingly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would be more pleased with the product if the actual color lasted longer.</li>
            <li>and I assumed it would fade quickly</li>
            <li>But all in all, its the most fade-resistant and vibrant color I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Probably the best out there, other than professional.</li>
            <li>I always had good luck with it staying for a long time (over a month)  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gives a beautiful lift to very dark hair, I like the golden bronze color it gives.  </li>
            <li>I followed all directions exactly!</li>
            <li>as soon as the first time you wash your hair it the color washes out!</li>
            <li>The instructions tell you enough to get the job done, but they leave out some pretty useful tips that can make the difference between a good, even color and a splotchy disaster.</li>
            <li>To obtain a more RED color make sure to use the bleach to remove the color first.</li>
            <li>the color was the most vivid and stayed the longest.</li>
            <li>and then I flat ironed it and it looks pretty good.</li>
            <li>The bleach that comes with it isn&#x27;t great, but if you are just trying to lift a little color so the colored dye is brighter, it should do the trick.</li>
            <li>Make sure your hair is clean, dry, and free of products (including conditioner.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a very thorough, bright, fun dye.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Splat for 5 years (in all kinds of shades) and honestly, it&#x27;s one of the longest lasting I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>maybe you should use plastic hospital gloves instead but worth it.</li>
            <li>and I use it on my short hair and it blends in so nice</li>
            <li>I buy bleach from the beauty supply store, because the stuff that comes in drugstore kits rarely works out for me.</li>
            <li>The red sometimes rub off on light colors but the purple is my favorite</li>
            <li>Other than the pool incident, i love this color and will continue to use it until i find something better.</li>
            <li>and it is HANDS DOWN the best red hair dye I have ever used... and believe me, I&#x27;ve used most of the red dyes available.</li>
            <li>However, when I put the bleaching agent in my hair, it did not bleach my hair the right way.</li>
            <li>but it ate right through it.</li>
            <li>It lasts FOREVER, if you bleach it right.</li>
            <li>so I used Color Oops to remove it first before I bleached.</li>
            <li>I think i could have left it in for longer to get a better color, but 7 hours was sufficient.</li>
            <li>It faded drastically with the first wash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used it, I had never bleached my hair before.</li>
            <li>It probably won&#x27;t rinse out all the way for the first couple of washes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Leaving the dye in for longer will only make the color stay longer, it will not do more</li>
            <li>first time i use this product.</li>
            <li>Thankfully I went and got the Crimson Obsession one first and got home</li>
            <li>say it lastes for mounths but mine only lastes for a mounth b4 ihave to put more color in&lt;br</li>
            <li>bc iuse hot</li>
            <li>First of all, some people may not realize this, but this product is a hair STAIN.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t shampoo every time I take a shower, which probably helped it last, and it wasn&#x27;t directly on top of my hair getting exposure to sunlight and water from the shower, so maybe that helped, too.</li>
            <li>Never wash with hot water.</li>
            <li>It gave me the exact color I wanted without fading and</li>
            <li>the same mix could be used more than once if there was extra!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As advised, I bleached first for truer color results.  </li>
            <li>It never fails.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a bottle (which is better than a tube); but, I prefer tubs because you can get every last drop.&lt;br</li>
            <li>gets your hair the color for the first night after that bleeds out every chance it gets.</li>
            <li>Be sure to keep the dye off your skin as much as possible, even in the shower.</li>
            <li>first time was April 2011</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be redying it within the next day or so because I really love how it has turn</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s a good thing since you don&#x27;t have to re-bleach every time, you just have to wait a few weeks for it to all wash out.</li>
            <li>I found that most stains came out fine if I let them soak for a couple of minutes in a bleach cleaning spray plus a little bit of scrubbing with a paper towel.</li>
            <li>Splat luscious raspberry is amazing, a true deep red (exactly what I was looking for) and comes with bleach if you need to lighten your hair before the process.</li>
            <li>I was very careful and it came out amazing.</li>
            <li>A fantastic, cheap alternative to using costly high-end products with the same rich red advertised on the package (with or without the bleach!).</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect the water to run clear, and you might have to clean your tub.</li>
            <li>The color was very vibrant and exactly what I had wanted.</li>
            <li>I actually liked the bleach, it left my hair soft.</li>
            <li>It surprised me because I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the NAME of the color and just assumed it was some kind of candy apple red or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bleeds a lot for the first few days, but other than that it&#x27;s an awesome color.</li>
            <li>: The other reviewers are 100% correct when they say to leave the dye in for much longer than the instructions suggest.&lt;br /&gt;After 7-8 weeks, I can tell that my color is slowly fading out, but it&#x27;s still a very bright red as compared to the bright red/pink it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I left the bleach in about an hour, which gave me a golden blonde through most of my hair, and a bright blonde near my roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure your hair is covered if it starts raining, or you&#x27;ll have bright red streaks running down your face!!!</li>
            <li>I was able to bleach my naturally dark brown hair to a very light orange, not blonde, using the bleach in the box.</li>
            <li>my friend used this dye Her hair was very vibrant she told me she used splat</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more of a hot pink now.</li>
            <li>Its very vibrant.</li>
            <li>they love my hot pink hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who want their hair a very deep, bright red color.</li>
            <li>i used just the color on my hair last night and its very vibrant!!!</li>
            <li>and honestly it came out a little blotchy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not talking so much about the bleach because I did it with some burning but was overall fine.</li>
            <li>My only issue with Splat is that it fades relatively quickly but other than that, Splat is amazing.</li>
            <li>but it turns out much lighter than shown.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can leave the dye in your hair for much longer than you can with the bleach.</li>
            <li>mixed the bleach and put it in my hair for about 45 minutes, until it turned a light orange color, and then rinsed the bleach out.</li>
            <li>very dissapointing...</li>
            <li>and ilove the color so much</li>
            <li>is it washes out kinda fast alot of ppl</li>
            <li>after 6 months I was ready to cut it out.</li>
            <li>had some light spots) and the bleach made it orange of coarse.</li>
            <li>very gd</li>
            <li>It really helps.</li>
            <li>The color did stain my scalp purple (again operator error, I used way to much dye in that one spot) but the color faded from my skin in about 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li>When i washed it out it was BRIGHT PINK, and i was pretty horrified, thinking my hair was also this vibrant hot pink color.</li>
            <li>I ended up needing two bottles of dye, so after the first ran out my mom made a quick trip back to Walmart, my hair is about boob-length</li>
            <li>but I do love how the contrast and bright colors are so vibrant and pops out like crazy</li>
            <li>I have been trying to get my hair that bright Rihanna red for a while other products have not worked for me.</li>
            <li>The color is very deep, rich and intense.  </li>
            <li>So I get to the color and am freaking out because I was so excited and left it in for an hour (instructions say 30 minutes</li>
            <li>The color fades pretty quickly to a dullish pink-red but it still has places of vibrant red color</li>
            <li>It costs less than buying bleach and dye separately, and if you do it right, you can get some pretty cool</li>
            <li>: I have light brown, medium-thickness, long hair.</li>
            <li>the color is phenomenal and despite my roots being platinum vs my ends being dark orange</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of types of dye to get my hair a true red</li>
            <li>most important tip I have is that you will need to buy a shower cap, or at the very least, be prepared to tie a plastic bag over your head.</li>
            <li>I tried wildfire by manic panc and it ame out blood orange and faded to a gross orange really quickly.</li>
            <li>packaging is decent.</li>
            <li>So after it was safe I went to a local beauty supply store and got Loreal HiColor Hilights (Red) and got the results that I was looking for....</li>
            <li>You can still use this color if you have light/medium brown hair, it&#x27;s still VERY vibrant red, but it&#x27;s even brighter if you can get your hair to the yellowish blonde all over, which is easy to do with the bleach.    </li>
            <li>I used the shower cap for this as well, mostly to help with the mess.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Its a high maintenance color so I would recommend not using this if you dont want to touch up your hair on a weekly basis.</li>
            <li>dye well, goodness i didnt have high hopes</li>
            <li>Red hair fades very quickly and stripping your hair is very damaging, so I only washed my hair every 3 days.</li>
            <li>My roots and upper hair were no longer hot pink, they had darkened to the same elmo color the rest of my hair was, and it looked amazing.</li>
            <li>My roots and upper hair were no longer hot pink, they had darkened to the same elmo color the rest of my hair was, and it looked amazing.</li>
            <li>and I had light pink hair.</li>
            <li>Even now the water runs a light pink, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>You can also combine the color with your normal conditioner and leave it</li>
            <li>(most likely because I am not a professional).  </li>
            <li>Buy extra its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Buy two bottles if necessary, its worth it.</li>
            <li>Most &#x27;rebellious&#x27; hair dyes don&#x27;t last very long, but Splat stays put for weeks and weeks.</li>
            <li>the rest of their products are great the red just sucks!</li>
            <li>She has light blonde hair, and after putting the dye in, it turned hot pink.</li>
            <li>I was already a pretty light blonde at this point (minus my roots, which I didn&#x27;t care were darker)</li>
            <li>I will probably keep using this product until I decide to try something new</li>
            <li>I decided to go over it with the new crimson obsession by splat.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve just begun a new career as a nurse, so</li>
            <li>it stayed longer than the rest which i guess is good, but still trying to find something different that will stay for at least 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>The red is so pretty.</li>
            <li>I really like this brand in general though.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stain anything while dry, so just be sure to dry your hair thoroughly if you shower before bed (or, alternatively, just shower in the AM).&lt;br</li>
            <li>First off I have natural red hair</li>
            <li>I was expecting a bright red, but got a dark pink instead.</li>
            <li>It starts out a very vibrant red then fades to a really pretty light pink color, I&#x27;m not a fan of pink</li>
            <li>now i have black hair with red highlights and i love it.</li>
            <li>Oh and a tip to people who say it fades fast: After dying you hair with splat (or any crazy color of coarse) wash your hair with warm or cool water.</li>
            <li>Yet, i&#x27;m still trying to search for a better red hair dye that doesn&#x27;t do all this mess.</li>
            <li>Under certain lighting, it almost looked red, but it just missed the mark.  </li>
            <li>fantastic product, just is a little &amp;#34;pinker&amp;#34; than it looks on the box.</li>
            <li>, it is a huge waste of money and to never use it.</li>
            <li>well... except that when rinsing, the water never ran clear.</li>
            <li>Near the roots was blonde, but not the whole section.</li>
            <li>I think it took about a month before my showers ran clear again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color still hasn&#x27;t come close to running clear, and I don&#x27;t think it ever will.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will not stain your tub (or at least it didnt stain mine), but be sure to wash off the walls of your shower &amp; curtain so the color doesnt stick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been every natural color imaginable.</li>
            <li>(and some stretching the limits of the word natural)</li>
            <li>Well, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>but that maybe in a couple of years because I really like the red.</li>
            <li>I really hope it doesn&#x27;t last longer than a week.</li>
            <li>you accidentally mixed too much bleach, you can leave it in the bottle (with the cap off) just in case you check and find out you missed a spot or something.</li>
            <li>The only thing to be warned about is that it comes out a very pinky red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My natural hair color is Med. brown.</li>
            <li>the red came out very even.</li>
            <li>This product is fool proof, I don&#x27;t know anything about dyeing hair but each time I use this product, I feel like a professional.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as thick as most permanent hair dyes ive used, but it wasnt dripping everywhere.</li>
            <li>I have long hair I died the did both steps on the top half of my hair.</li>
            <li>After washing out the crimson obsession dye and drying it, my hair was a fairly light vibrant pink, not the deep red as advertised.  </li>
            <li>And clothes, so make sure black is in your wardrobe!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited a couple days, and to my surprise, the color set in and turned a vibrant red i wanted!</li>
            <li>I waited a couple days, and to my surprise, the color set in and turned a vibrant red i wanted!</li>
            <li>everyone&#x27;s hair is different and accepts bleach/dye differently don&#x27;t expect it to look EXACTLY like the</li>
            <li>my hair is black and it dyes it in to a light yellow color in 60mins</li>
            <li>Other than the pool incident, i love this color and will continue to use it until i find something better.my satisfaction (the water will never run clear, and 2 months later it is STILL coming out pink.)</li>
            <li>I ended up with hot neon pink.  </li>
            <li>Depending on how often you wash your hair, the color usually lasts a few weeks, but the dye and bleach is so cheap that it&#x27;s not even an issue, and like I said, the color transitions it goes through while it&#x27;s fading are all very pretty</li>
            <li>After reading every review of at-home hair color I could find, I decided to use Splat based on the face that I could buy it at my local CVS, as I was too impatient to order any other kind of hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I talked to a few of my friends who I consider hair masters based on everything they have done to their hair and they even confirmed the same thing</li>
            <li>Bottles are small, so if you have long hair, buy more than one.</li>
            <li>I did like the color in the end, but it wasn&#x27;t worth constantly worrying about my hair getting wet during summer</li>
            <li>The good news is that, messiness aside, the dyeing part isn&#x27;t as complicated as the initial bleaching.</li>
            <li>/&gt;HOWEVER, there is one major drawback to this hair dye:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>CAME OUT HOT FREAKING PINK!</li>
            <li>I am willing to try other colors from this brand.</li>
            <li>It flings everywhere, yes, but rinses off of hard surfaces with water just fine if you get to it</li>
            <li>You may need more than one kit if you plan on dying a whole head of thick, dark hair.</li>
            <li>This last time I cut my hair was a month and a half shy of A YEAR of it having been in my hair when I got the last inch or so of light bright red tips out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, so I was wary when I first tried bleaching my hair</li>
            <li>In general the color looked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, I realize the directions say to rinse it until the water is clear, but that doesn&#x27;t appear to be possible.</li>
            <li>That being said, I&#x27;d recommend this product for anyone who wants the color to stay in their hair as long as possible.</li>
            <li>I lightened my hair to a near white and, using 2 boxes because my hair falls just below my shoulder blades, followed the directions for the color...</li>
            <li>birthday at a water park because of how much my hair was bleeding when wet.</li>
            <li>It lasts FOREVER!!&lt;br /&gt;She totally freaked and took me around to all of the hair dressers showing my hair and telling them it was 6 months old.</li>
            <li>Apparently it has metallic dye in it or something.  </li>
            <li>The name should be changed to \\&quot;Cherry Red\\&quot;, because it&#x27;s not pink like raspberries as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>The bleach portion worked well, but the color barely took.</li>
            <li>I have hair a little past my shoulders so its not long and most definitely not thick.</li>
            <li>It stayed on and vibrant for a long time but make sure not to wash your hair within the first 48 hours of dying and when you do wash it, use cold water and add a quarter sized amount of dye to your shampoo when you wash so buy an extra bottle for washing.</li>
            <li>It does wash out a lot, just because it&#x27;s such a vibrant color and only semi-permanent, but if you change your hair color constantly like I do</li>
            <li>Make sure you purchase extra gloves to use for touch-up applications because this is very hard to remove from your skin.</li>
            <li>If you want a long lasting, vibrant color, keep it on for an hour.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only washed my hair twice so far, and the red is already fading.</li>
            <li>After an hour of the bleach, the pink had lightened but ultimately did not budge much.  </li>
            <li>The color, Luscious Raspberry, was supposed to be a vibrant dark red, but it came out hot pink.</li>
            <li>process is messy and time-consuming, but well worth the final product.</li>
            <li>but I get bored pretty quickly with my hair and</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted my color to last as long as possible, so I originally planned to leave the dye in for about 6 hours, but I got impatient and took it out after about 4 1/2.</li>
            <li>It is pretty messy and holds on like hell to skin to don&#x27;t skimp on the petroleum jelly and maybe even wear two sets of gloves.</li>
            <li>I used Splat Blue Envy, followed all the instructions, bleached it first, left the dye in my hair for 30 minutes, and it faded to silvery-grey in less than a week.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for years now, and as long as you&#x27;re not an idiot and bleach your hair thoroughly first, it will always result in very vibrant red colour for any hair type or competent brain that can read instructions.</li>
            <li>This color tends to fade quickly &amp; when it does at least on my hair it fades to a orange/pink color.</li>
            <li>I have used this product multiple times and each time it was relatively cheap, especially when compared to a few other alternatives I&#x27;ve tried which required volumizer and mixing.</li>
            <li>The only down fall is that it fades really quick and you need to be retouching it constantly just like any other red.</li>
            <li>It took forever to get it out enough to my satisfaction (the water will never run clear, and 2 months later it is STILL coming out pink.)</li>

            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved it.</li>
            <li> This bleach was very gentle on my hair, yet was very effective at getting my hair to the yellow-blonde that is best for this color.</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful color, but if you happen to want it to be more pink--like on the box--then add some conditioner to the dye BEFORE you apply it to your hair.</li>
            <li> Great hair dye, better than manic panic.</li>

            <li> oh well, it was nice</li>
            <li> I was kind of upset, but</li>
            <li> oh well, it was nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my own hair for 10 years now.</li>
            <li> It protected my clothing very well, even if it wasn&#x27;t the best fashion</li>
            <li> :) My color lasts for a good month before looking pinkish.</li>
            <li> product itself has a nice, gel-like consistency.</li>
            <li> but that was my own fault.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t come out super light, so I was worried, but the color stuck beautifully!</li>
            <li> spend a bit more money and buy the kind the pros get</li>
            <li> The bleach worked great the dye after about an hour of leaving it in came out pretty nice.</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE the color of my hair!</li>
            <li> Then used the red for the underneath part of my hair and it turned out bright and beautiful...</li>
            <li> This color is absolutely beautiful &amp; so vibrant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this color and bleach on and off for a year now, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Love this color..</li>
            <li> A shower cap helps lock in both heat and moisture so your hair will bleach more evenly</li>
            <li> Even with the shower cap on, the top will probably lighten faster than the tips.</li>
            <li> You can add more bleach if you need to, but you probably shouldn&#x27;t leave it on for more than an hour.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> follow the instructions and all will be ok.</li>
            <li> I have been dying my own hair for years and always used punky hair dye but decided to give this a try since it was on sale really cheap.</li>
            <li> I love splat.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this color.</li>
            <li> Hair came out better</li>
            <li> And will keep using. :)</li>
            <li> dye my hair a lot, so I feel fairly confident in my abilities</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more of an Ariana Grande look, but I got Rihanna</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the vibrancy.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dye.  </li>
            <li> I guess you can tell, I love it :)</li>
            <li> so I could see how my superiors would react before settling on something a bit more</li>
            <li> so when it fades out I just add more splat color to it, let it sit for an hour then rinse.</li>
            <li> ya head had to put a diffrent color in my hair to make it look better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dyed my hair many different colors, and I think Splat is one of the best.</li>
            <li> Many areas did not take at all.</li>
            <li> The dye will fade, all dyes do, most people nowtell me</li>
            <li> i put protected even with that the dye sure didnt do anything on my hair but did wonders on my skin ....</li>
            <li> Okay, this product did not work for me</li>
            <li> As advised, I used the bleach on my hair first to ensure bright results.  </li>
            <li> this is the best product for a cheap price,but i do warn you this will fade quickly,i strongly suggest that you use SoftSheen Carson &amp;#34;Hi-rez&amp;#34; In the red color after splat luscious raspberry has been faded out thank you :)</li>
            <li> Got this for penny&#x27;s more than I would have at Walmart which is fine because all the stores I tried were out.</li>
            <li> Now, my mom had never used a dye this runny, so my scalp was a very bright red</li>
            <li> Raspberry is actually very true description, I think.</li>
            <li> It was still bright bright light red.</li>
            <li> Wish there were more colors available in the permenant line</li>
            <li> It did fade a bit into a brilliant pinkish red.</li>
            <li> Fades fast go pro and get the good stuff either by a Sassoon out Sassoon store.</li>
            <li> Very fun to mix with darker reds and purples to get a more burgundy color.</li>
            <li> It also fades very quickly.</li>
            <li> and i was AMAZED of how bright and vibrant the dye was.</li>
            <li> it comes with, strong bleach from a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> fact, I&#x27;m&#x27; going to be buying the lusty lavender soon and applying it on my unbleached darker brown hair to see if i can get a nice deep purple instead of the bright light purple you get from bleaching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fact, I&#x27;m&#x27; going to be buying the lusty lavender soon and applying it on my unbleached darker brown hair to see if i can get a nice deep purple instead of the bright light purple you get from bleaching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, you can put this stuff on unbleached hair and it is still pretty noticeable.</li>
            <li> Make sure to keep the color on the full amount of time and DON&#x27;T skimp on the dye.</li>
            <li> If you can catch the stain right after you spill the dye, it wipes very easily off of marble/tile/countertop.</li>
            <li> The color is rich and vibrant and it lasts for a good while.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product so much so far!</li>
            <li> For instance, Pink Fetish comes out a very bright fuschia.</li>
            <li> I have used splat for the last year, i tried different shades of the bright red(wanting my hair as bright and fire truck red as i could get it) out of all the brands i have used this was the best.</li>
            <li> When I dried it, I was very impressed.</li>
            <li> I did not bleach my hair before hand, but I am a fairly light ginger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT WAS ON SALE SO CHEAP.</li>
            <li> Now I have light spots on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Well, I decided to turn to Splat since it&#x27;s relatively cheap</li>
            <li> highly recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for something BRIGHT, LOUD, and FUNKY! :), and it wasn&#x27;t directly on top of my hair getting exposure to sunlight and water from the shower, so maybe that helped, too.</li>
            <li> The colours are very unique and bright, My daughter used the red.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve tried almost every brand and color available.</li>
            <li> and I got an awesome red/on the verge of hot pink color (which is what raspberry is by the way).</li>
            <li> But left my hair with a nice bown-red fade that still shimmered in the sun!</li>
            <li> do not bleach my hair anymore and this showed up beautifully with decent vibrancy on my naturally ginger hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the right light, it looks a great Elmo red.</li>
            <li> In the right light, it looks a great Elmo red.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for something BRIGHT, LOUD, and FUNKY! :)</li>
            <li> Protect every surface the best that you can, and be prepared to rinse out (maybe even wipe down) your tub after the first couple of washes.</li>
            <li> My nephew has as well&amp;it never wlrks right!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you are, in fact, looking to turn your hair bright red.</li>
            <li> looks like I was born with outrageously bright red hair!</li>
            <li> I bleached my already blonde hair, which I should not have done, because I didn&#x27;t realize how bright the color was.</li>
            <li> After quite some time, I just decided it was good enough.</li>
            <li> The reason you will need a shower cap is that the effects of the bleach are intensified by heat, so if you have longer hair, the heat from your scalp will cause the top of your head to lighten much faster than the tips.</li>
            <li> I love the color but its just too much work.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got lucky, but 1.5 bottles of bleach was enough to get the job done surprisingly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would be more pleased with the product if the actual color lasted longer.</li>
            <li> and I assumed it would fade quickly</li>
            <li> But all in all, its the most fade-resistant and vibrant color I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Probably the best out there, other than professional.</li>
            <li> I always had good luck with it staying for a long time (over a month)  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gives a beautiful lift to very dark hair, I like the golden bronze color it gives.  </li>
            <li> I followed all directions exactly!</li>
            <li> as soon as the first time you wash your hair it the color washes out!</li>
            <li> The instructions tell you enough to get the job done, but they leave out some pretty useful tips that can make the difference between a good, even color and a splotchy disaster.</li>
            <li> To obtain a more RED color make sure to use the bleach to remove the color first.</li>
            <li> the color was the most vivid and stayed the longest.</li>
            <li> and then I flat ironed it and it looks pretty good.</li>
            <li> The bleach that comes with it isn&#x27;t great, but if you are just trying to lift a little color so the colored dye is brighter, it should do the trick.</li>
            <li> Make sure your hair is clean, dry, and free of products (including conditioner.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a very thorough, bright, fun dye.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Splat for 5 years (in all kinds of shades) and honestly, it&#x27;s one of the longest lasting I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> maybe you should use plastic hospital gloves instead but worth it.</li>
            <li> and I use it on my short hair and it blends in so nice</li>
            <li> I buy bleach from the beauty supply store, because the stuff that comes in drugstore kits rarely works out for me.</li>
            <li> The red sometimes rub off on light colors but the purple is my favorite</li>
            <li> Other than the pool incident, i love this color and will continue to use it until i find something better.</li>
            <li> and it is HANDS DOWN the best red hair dye I have ever used... and believe me, I&#x27;ve used most of the red dyes available.</li>
            <li> However, when I put the bleaching agent in my hair, it did not bleach my hair the right way.</li>
            <li> but it ate right through it.</li>
            <li> It lasts FOREVER, if you bleach it right.</li>
            <li> so I used Color Oops to remove it first before I bleached.</li>
            <li> I think i could have left it in for longer to get a better color, but 7 hours was sufficient.</li>
            <li> It faded drastically with the first wash.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used it, I had never bleached my hair before.</li>
            <li> It probably won&#x27;t rinse out all the way for the first couple of washes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Leaving the dye in for longer will only make the color stay longer, it will not do more</li>
            <li> first time i use this product.</li>
            <li> Thankfully I went and got the Crimson Obsession one first and got home</li>
            <li> say it lastes for mounths but mine only lastes for a mounth b4 ihave to put more color in&lt;br</li>
            <li> bc iuse hot</li>
            <li> First of all, some people may not realize this, but this product is a hair STAIN.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shampoo every time I take a shower, which probably helped it last, and it wasn&#x27;t directly on top of my hair getting exposure to sunlight and water from the shower, so maybe that helped, too.</li>
            <li> Never wash with hot water.</li>
            <li> It gave me the exact color I wanted without fading and</li>
            <li> the same mix could be used more than once if there was extra!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As advised, I bleached first for truer color results.  </li>
            <li> It never fails.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a bottle (which is better than a tube); but, I prefer tubs because you can get every last drop.&lt;br</li>
            <li> gets your hair the color for the first night after that bleeds out every chance it gets.</li>
            <li> Be sure to keep the dye off your skin as much as possible, even in the shower.</li>
            <li> first time was April 2011</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be redying it within the next day or so because I really love how it has turn</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s a good thing since you don&#x27;t have to re-bleach every time, you just have to wait a few weeks for it to all wash out.</li>
            <li> I found that most stains came out fine if I let them soak for a couple of minutes in a bleach cleaning spray plus a little bit of scrubbing with a paper towel.</li>
            <li> Splat luscious raspberry is amazing, a true deep red (exactly what I was looking for) and comes with bleach if you need to lighten your hair before the process.</li>
            <li> I was very careful and it came out amazing.</li>
            <li> A fantastic, cheap alternative to using costly high-end products with the same rich red advertised on the package (with or without the bleach!).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect the water to run clear, and you might have to clean your tub.</li>
            <li> The color was very vibrant and exactly what I had wanted.</li>
            <li> I actually liked the bleach, it left my hair soft.</li>
            <li> It surprised me because I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the NAME of the color and just assumed it was some kind of candy apple red or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bleeds a lot for the first few days, but other than that it&#x27;s an awesome color.</li>
            <li> : The other reviewers are 100% correct when they say to leave the dye in for much longer than the instructions suggest.&lt;br /&gt;After 7-8 weeks, I can tell that my color is slowly fading out, but it&#x27;s still a very bright red as compared to the bright red/pink it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I left the bleach in about an hour, which gave me a golden blonde through most of my hair, and a bright blonde near my roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure your hair is covered if it starts raining, or you&#x27;ll have bright red streaks running down your face!!!</li>
            <li> I was able to bleach my naturally dark brown hair to a very light orange, not blonde, using the bleach in the box.</li>
            <li> my friend used this dye Her hair was very vibrant she told me she used splat</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s more of a hot pink now.</li>
            <li> Its very vibrant.</li>
            <li> they love my hot pink hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who want their hair a very deep, bright red color.</li>
            <li> i used just the color on my hair last night and its very vibrant!!!</li>
            <li> and honestly it came out a little blotchy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talking so much about the bleach because I did it with some burning but was overall fine.</li>
            <li> My only issue with Splat is that it fades relatively quickly but other than that, Splat is amazing.</li>
            <li> but it turns out much lighter than shown.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can leave the dye in your hair for much longer than you can with the bleach.</li>
            <li> mixed the bleach and put it in my hair for about 45 minutes, until it turned a light orange color, and then rinsed the bleach out.</li>
            <li> very dissapointing...</li>
            <li> and ilove the color so much</li>
            <li> is it washes out kinda fast alot of ppl</li>
            <li> after 6 months I was ready to cut it out.</li>
            <li> had some light spots) and the bleach made it orange of coarse.</li>
            <li> very gd</li>
            <li> It really helps.</li>
            <li> The color did stain my scalp purple (again operator error, I used way to much dye in that one spot) but the color faded from my skin in about 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li> When i washed it out it was BRIGHT PINK, and i was pretty horrified, thinking my hair was also this vibrant hot pink color.</li>
            <li> I ended up needing two bottles of dye, so after the first ran out my mom made a quick trip back to Walmart, my hair is about boob-length</li>
            <li> but I do love how the contrast and bright colors are so vibrant and pops out like crazy</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get my hair that bright Rihanna red for a while other products have not worked for me.</li>
            <li> The color is very deep, rich and intense.  </li>
            <li> So I get to the color and am freaking out because I was so excited and left it in for an hour (instructions say 30 minutes</li>
            <li> The color fades pretty quickly to a dullish pink-red but it still has places of vibrant red color</li>
            <li> It costs less than buying bleach and dye separately, and if you do it right, you can get some pretty cool</li>
            <li> : I have light brown, medium-thickness, long hair.</li>
            <li> the color is phenomenal and despite my roots being platinum vs my ends being dark orange</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of types of dye to get my hair a true red</li>
            <li> most important tip I have is that you will need to buy a shower cap, or at the very least, be prepared to tie a plastic bag over your head.</li>
            <li> I tried wildfire by manic panc and it ame out blood orange and faded to a gross orange really quickly.</li>
            <li> packaging is decent.</li>
            <li> So after it was safe I went to a local beauty supply store and got Loreal HiColor Hilights (Red) and got the results that I was looking for....</li>
            <li> You can still use this color if you have light/medium brown hair, it&#x27;s still VERY vibrant red, but it&#x27;s even brighter if you can get your hair to the yellowish blonde all over, which is easy to do with the bleach.    </li>
            <li> I used the shower cap for this as well, mostly to help with the mess.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Its a high maintenance color so I would recommend not using this if you dont want to touch up your hair on a weekly basis.</li>
            <li> dye well, goodness i didnt have high hopes</li>
            <li> Red hair fades very quickly and stripping your hair is very damaging, so I only washed my hair every 3 days.</li>
            <li> My roots and upper hair were no longer hot pink, they had darkened to the same elmo color the rest of my hair was, and it looked amazing.</li>
            <li> My roots and upper hair were no longer hot pink, they had darkened to the same elmo color the rest of my hair was, and it looked amazing.</li>
            <li> and I had light pink hair.</li>
            <li> Even now the water runs a light pink, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> You can also combine the color with your normal conditioner and leave it</li>
            <li> (most likely because I am not a professional).  </li>
            <li> Buy extra its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Buy two bottles if necessary, its worth it.</li>
            <li> Most &#x27;rebellious&#x27; hair dyes don&#x27;t last very long, but Splat stays put for weeks and weeks.</li>
            <li> the rest of their products are great the red just sucks!</li>
            <li> She has light blonde hair, and after putting the dye in, it turned hot pink.</li>
            <li> I was already a pretty light blonde at this point (minus my roots, which I didn&#x27;t care were darker)</li>
            <li> I will probably keep using this product until I decide to try something new</li>
            <li> I decided to go over it with the new crimson obsession by splat.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve just begun a new career as a nurse, so</li>
            <li> it stayed longer than the rest which i guess is good, but still trying to find something different that will stay for at least 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> The red is so pretty.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand in general though.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stain anything while dry, so just be sure to dry your hair thoroughly if you shower before bed (or, alternatively, just shower in the AM).&lt;br</li>
            <li> First off I have natural red hair</li>
            <li> I was expecting a bright red, but got a dark pink instead.</li>
            <li> It starts out a very vibrant red then fades to a really pretty light pink color, I&#x27;m not a fan of pink</li>
            <li> now i have black hair with red highlights and i love it.</li>
            <li> Oh and a tip to people who say it fades fast: After dying you hair with splat (or any crazy color of coarse) wash your hair with warm or cool water.</li>
            <li> Yet, i&#x27;m still trying to search for a better red hair dye that doesn&#x27;t do all this mess.</li>
            <li> Under certain lighting, it almost looked red, but it just missed the mark.  </li>
            <li> fantastic product, just is a little &amp;#34;pinker&amp;#34; than it looks on the box.</li>
            <li> , it is a huge waste of money and to never use it.</li>
            <li> well... except that when rinsing, the water never ran clear.</li>
            <li> Near the roots was blonde, but not the whole section.</li>
            <li> I think it took about a month before my showers ran clear again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color still hasn&#x27;t come close to running clear, and I don&#x27;t think it ever will.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will not stain your tub (or at least it didnt stain mine), but be sure to wash off the walls of your shower &amp; curtain so the color doesnt stick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been every natural color imaginable.</li>
            <li> (and some stretching the limits of the word natural)</li>
            <li> Well, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> but that maybe in a couple of years because I really like the red.</li>
            <li> I really hope it doesn&#x27;t last longer than a week.</li>
            <li> you accidentally mixed too much bleach, you can leave it in the bottle (with the cap off) just in case you check and find out you missed a spot or something.</li>
            <li> The only thing to be warned about is that it comes out a very pinky red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is Med. brown.</li>
            <li> the red came out very even.</li>
            <li> This product is fool proof, I don&#x27;t know anything about dyeing hair but each time I use this product, I feel like a professional.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as most permanent hair dyes ive used, but it wasnt dripping everywhere.</li>
            <li> I have long hair I died the did both steps on the top half of my hair.</li>
            <li> After washing out the crimson obsession dye and drying it, my hair was a fairly light vibrant pink, not the deep red as advertised.  </li>
            <li> And clothes, so make sure black is in your wardrobe!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited a couple days, and to my surprise, the color set in and turned a vibrant red i wanted!</li>
            <li> I waited a couple days, and to my surprise, the color set in and turned a vibrant red i wanted!</li>
            <li> everyone&#x27;s hair is different and accepts bleach/dye differently don&#x27;t expect it to look EXACTLY like the</li>
            <li> my hair is black and it dyes it in to a light yellow color in 60mins</li>
            <li> Other than the pool incident, i love this color and will continue to use it until i find something better.my satisfaction (the water will never run clear, and 2 months later it is STILL coming out pink.)</li>
            <li> I ended up with hot neon pink.  </li>
            <li> Depending on how often you wash your hair, the color usually lasts a few weeks, but the dye and bleach is so cheap that it&#x27;s not even an issue, and like I said, the color transitions it goes through while it&#x27;s fading are all very pretty</li>
            <li> After reading every review of at-home hair color I could find, I decided to use Splat based on the face that I could buy it at my local CVS, as I was too impatient to order any other kind of hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I talked to a few of my friends who I consider hair masters based on everything they have done to their hair and they even confirmed the same thing</li>
            <li> Bottles are small, so if you have long hair, buy more than one.</li>
            <li> I did like the color in the end, but it wasn&#x27;t worth constantly worrying about my hair getting wet during summer</li>
            <li> The good news is that, messiness aside, the dyeing part isn&#x27;t as complicated as the initial bleaching.</li>
            <li> /&gt;HOWEVER, there is one major drawback to this hair dye:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> CAME OUT HOT FREAKING PINK!</li>
            <li> I am willing to try other colors from this brand.</li>
            <li> It flings everywhere, yes, but rinses off of hard surfaces with water just fine if you get to it</li>
            <li> You may need more than one kit if you plan on dying a whole head of thick, dark hair.</li>
            <li> This last time I cut my hair was a month and a half shy of A YEAR of it having been in my hair when I got the last inch or so of light bright red tips out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, so I was wary when I first tried bleaching my hair</li>
            <li> In general the color looked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, I realize the directions say to rinse it until the water is clear, but that doesn&#x27;t appear to be possible.</li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;d recommend this product for anyone who wants the color to stay in their hair as long as possible.</li>
            <li> I lightened my hair to a near white and, using 2 boxes because my hair falls just below my shoulder blades, followed the directions for the color...</li>
            <li> birthday at a water park because of how much my hair was bleeding when wet.</li>
            <li> It lasts FOREVER!!&lt;br /&gt;She totally freaked and took me around to all of the hair dressers showing my hair and telling them it was 6 months old.</li>
            <li> Apparently it has metallic dye in it or something.  </li>
            <li> The name should be changed to \\&quot;Cherry Red\\&quot;, because it&#x27;s not pink like raspberries as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> The bleach portion worked well, but the color barely took.</li>
            <li> I have hair a little past my shoulders so its not long and most definitely not thick.</li>
            <li> It stayed on and vibrant for a long time but make sure not to wash your hair within the first 48 hours of dying and when you do wash it, use cold water and add a quarter sized amount of dye to your shampoo when you wash so buy an extra bottle for washing.</li>
            <li> It does wash out a lot, just because it&#x27;s such a vibrant color and only semi-permanent, but if you change your hair color constantly like I do</li>
            <li> Make sure you purchase extra gloves to use for touch-up applications because this is very hard to remove from your skin.</li>
            <li> If you want a long lasting, vibrant color, keep it on for an hour.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only washed my hair twice so far, and the red is already fading.</li>
            <li> After an hour of the bleach, the pink had lightened but ultimately did not budge much.  </li>
            <li> The color, Luscious Raspberry, was supposed to be a vibrant dark red, but it came out hot pink.</li>
            <li> process is messy and time-consuming, but well worth the final product.</li>
            <li> but I get bored pretty quickly with my hair and</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted my color to last as long as possible, so I originally planned to leave the dye in for about 6 hours, but I got impatient and took it out after about 4 1/2.</li>
            <li> It is pretty messy and holds on like hell to skin to don&#x27;t skimp on the petroleum jelly and maybe even wear two sets of gloves.</li>
            <li> I used Splat Blue Envy, followed all the instructions, bleached it first, left the dye in my hair for 30 minutes, and it faded to silvery-grey in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years now, and as long as you&#x27;re not an idiot and bleach your hair thoroughly first, it will always result in very vibrant red colour for any hair type or competent brain that can read instructions.</li>
            <li> This color tends to fade quickly &amp; when it does at least on my hair it fades to a orange/pink color.</li>
            <li> I have used this product multiple times and each time it was relatively cheap, especially when compared to a few other alternatives I&#x27;ve tried which required volumizer and mixing.</li>
            <li> The only down fall is that it fades really quick and you need to be retouching it constantly just like any other red.</li>
            <li> It took forever to get it out enough to my satisfaction (the water will never run clear, and 2 months later it is STILL coming out pink.)</li>
            <li> So much so, that I&#x27;m considering going back to my natural black just to avoid the mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 2 months, and my hair color still looked amazing until yesterday, BE WARY OF CHLORINATED POOLS!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 2 months, and my hair color still looked amazing until yesterday, BE WARY OF CHLORINATED POOLS!</li>
            <li> I towel dried my hair and walked into the bedroom, to my surprise, it wasnt bright vibrant pink, but it was a pretty pinkish red, and I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I towel dried my hair and walked into the bedroom, to my surprise, it wasnt bright vibrant pink, but it was a pretty pinkish red, and I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> DO NOT wash daily especially if you bleached it because chances are, your hair is dry.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks it had faded out to a dull pink that I was not terribly fond of.  </li>
            <li> for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> Really long lasting.</li>
            <li> We decided to go over the pink with some pravana vivid since clearly the pink was there to stay unless I wanted to go dark, which I did not.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> hair still felt dead which is normal.</li>
            <li> Mine was got pink the day I did it…doesn&#x27;t sound bad right?</li>
            <li> Even after dyeing it twice it is still only got pink, not red.</li>
            <li> With other dyes I&#x27;ve had to stand next to an open window just to breathe.</li>
            <li> so I will be redoing it with a little orange mixed in later this week and will report back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, naturally I have very dark brown hair,</li>
            <li> I have had patchy red hair and pink hair</li>
            <li> I used an old towel and then blow dried my hair</li>
            <li> I have tried both purple and red, and my hair was pink after 2 or 3 washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was warned that this hair dye wouldn&#x27;t last quite a long time, but i tried it anyways since it was the only crazy color dye available at my drugstore.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have grey hair.)</li>
            <li> I had lots left) and Again left it in for an hour and a half.</li>
            <li> Ultimately the color will change and dull after a little bit of time, but it will be there to stay if you bleached first.  </li>
            <li> Yes, this dye lasts for a long time (months, even!)</li>
            <li> Obviously, I do recommend it, but I haven&#x27;t tried other bleaches or dyes for comparison.</li>
            <li> I it truly very different from other reds</li>
            <li> THIS COLOR LASTS FOR A VERY LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> (shower caps and dry shampoo are your friend)</li>
            <li> and it won&#x27;t get all crunchy from being too dry during the bleaching process.</li>
            <li> As long as you&#x27;re careful, read the instructions and leave it in your hair for a loooooong, long time...</li>
            <li> I Bleached my hair to a pale blonde and died it with this red...</li>
            <li> but it was supposed to be dark red!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Also, especially if your hair is wet, it can stain fabrics and other surfaces for about a week after you&#x27;ve dyed it.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a dark blonde</li>
            <li> Dont get this if you want a Dark red.</li>
            <li> It sucks only bleached strands of hair and there was not enough red dye do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Its a 2 step process though if you&#x27;re starting w dark hair because you have to bleach it 1st then</li>
            <li> foolishly dyed my hair in my very, very white bathroom and managed to stain just about everywhere, despite playing down plastic all over.</li>
            <li> Simply trying to bleach it out will not work, unless you enjoy having fried hair, if you get sick of it you&#x27;re going to have to dye over it with a different color.</li>
            <li> This past month, I finally decided to go cherry red.</li>
            <li> However I only needed about half the bottle</li>
            <li> ... Came out a different dark Pink....</li>
            <li> i bought a red and black one.</li>
            <li> I left the splat in for maybe an hour and a half since I had things to do and I wrapped it in plastic like always.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to dye it black.</li>
            <li> I left the bleach in for 1 1/2 hours (the instructions state an hour for black) and that was the end result.</li>
            <li> Made my hair red, faded after about a week and a half</li>
            <li> It worked find and it did minimal damage to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COLORING&lt;br /&gt;After researching the Splat hair color a little, I found out that there is no developer in the dye itself, meaning that the length of time you leave the dye in your hair will only determine how long the color stays in your hair before it fades, not the damage done to your hair.</li>
            <li> Overall they dye worked out well for me even though it was not true to color.</li>
            <li> The second day after coloring, the color washed completely out in a few areas, leaving me with blonde spots, and even though it&#x27;s fading at a ridiculous rate, it&#x27;s STILL running when it gets wet from sweat or water.</li>
            <li> When I put the color in, it looks blood red, and thats a little misleading.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used one of the little cups that you get with a bottle of cough syrup since it has fluid ounces labeled on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> while its hard to keep the red seperated from the blonde on your hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve left on under a shower cap as I&#x27;ve slept before and it will last for at least a month.</li>
            <li> There is NOT much bleach, as eveyone else has said.</li>
            <li> Maybe people just need to be careful.</li>
            <li> but I am a fan of the pink that this color fades to.</li>
            <li> hair is long, dark and thick, so I bought two boxes and used about 1.5 bottles of the bleach, but only one bottle of the dye was necessary.</li>
            <li> I just put a towel over my pillow if I&#x27;m sleeping with wet hair and it works</li>
            <li> ive never had this issue with their blue or green or even the purple....</li>
            <li> I even had to be careful of getting my hair wet at my friends</li>
            <li> I rinsed it out and the dye only stuck to a few strands of hair that were lighter.</li>
            <li> If you get wet, you&#x27;ll drip pink for awhile.</li>
            <li> BUT, if you aren&#x27;t up to scrubbing the pink out of your tub after every shower, I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> And be careful with towels.</li>
            <li> The bleaching part was somewhat of a pain because I&#x27;m always reluctant to bleach my long dark hair</li>
            <li> I wet my hair then wring it out before I add the shampoo/dye mix.</li>
            <li> and I used Pink Fetish to put two pink streaks in.  </li>
            <li> Pink</li>
            <li> After an hour of 40 volume bleach with green and blue shots, the pink was not going anywhere.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Later when i tried to bleach the \\&quot;RED\\&quot; out it turned my hair pale pink and yellow orange (never had this issues with dye before EVER!)</li>
            <li> hair is very dark brown/black (Asian) and it was completely unprocessed, but I still decided to bleach/dye my hair at home with the help of one other person.</li>
            <li> the bleach cause my hair was already red just not a bright red</li>
            <li> Take EXTREME care to not get this on your scalp.</li>
            <li> Now, for me, I can deal with that as long as I don&#x27;t have to waste my money on hair dye every other week.</li>
            <li> you dye your hair, if its pink like mine, be patient!</li>
            <li> When you dye your hair, if its pink like mine, be patient!</li>
            <li> If anyone has any tips about the staining other than petroleum jelly please let me know.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously, I do recommend it, but I haven&#x27;t tried other bleaches or dyes for comparison.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve never bleached my hair so I can&#x27;t compare it to other bleaches.&lt;br /&gt;Applied STAIN.&lt;br /&gt;Left</li>
            <li> Very minimal fading....</li>
            <li> And when it comes to red hair dye, it&#x27;s hard as hell to find one that doesn&#x27;t fade in two weeks.</li>
            <li> I have really dark brown hair and the bleach</li>
            <li> If you intend to get the color out you will have to go dark over it.  </li>
            <li> I used it to bleach my dark roots</li>
            <li> SO take your average amount of shampoo and add dye while washing and let it sit on your hair for about 5 minutes before washing.</li>
            <li> and when I sweat and work out it drips down the color I have in so yea...</li>
            <li> Never lets me down.</li>
            <li> It took THREE TIMES with hair bleach to get the pink out!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other semi/demi-permanent hair dyes and all the color washed out after I rinsed the dye out!</li>
            <li> Please do not get this for anyone with black or dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> Thats really the only bad part about this product, but they warn you not to do it</li>
            <li> almost black.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use a creme lightener; it&#x27;s less damaging to my hair.</li>
            <li> bleached the underside of my hair for probably half an hour or so.</li>
            <li> so just follow the typical precautions like avoiding excess sunlight and chemicals and heated styling tools.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for those who have shorter hair, I have the hair length of the girl on the box and the bottom half of my hair didn&#x27;t get bleached.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was NOT true to color.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to cut off my hair and color over the pink-purple-bleached mess with black!!!&lt;br /&gt;**Also</li>
            <li> If it doesnt come off, some dial soap and a little scrubbing fixes</li>
            <li> /&gt;I applied the splat as carefullly as i could, i used vaseline generously around my ears forehead and neck, and managed to get just a little on my visible scalp itself.</li>
            <li> a little washed it with with a neutralizing shampoo I also used infusium shampoo and cream of nature.</li>
            <li> The bleach was dripping down my face!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely weird and it makes me self conscious for about a week or two after dying my hair because it looks like I have a rash or an infection on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Once all of your hair is covered in the bleach mixture, try to get all of it underneath the shower cap, and check it every few minutes.</li>
            <li> they were, though slightly uneven</li>
            <li> There are a few things I wanna warn about though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> waste of money color did not come out as it say on da box came out</li>
            <li> dnt buy it waste of money</li>
            <li> This time, because I knew this would be messy, I plastic wrapped my counter, did the petroleum jelly thing, and got some latex gloves.</li>
            <li> it was just a waste of time for me and money when i could of just gotten Loreal from the start...</li>
            <li> unfortunately, for my thin dark brown hair after bleaching and dying my hair was somewhat dry which i fixed with oils and</li>
            <li> and I looked like the victim of a serious head injury.</li>
            <li> The color bled all over me when I sweat and bled a lot during showers even with cold water, but it managed to stay vibrant for about a month.</li>
            <li> I have to keep a pretty tame, professional appearance (boring).</li>
            <li> Be prepared for a long shower when you rinse it out, especially if you refuse to take cold showers like me.</li>
            <li> After four shampoos, it still runs, as badly as when I first rinsed</li>
            <li> I have just a few inches over shoulder length hair, its very choppy, and i didnt dye the bottom quarter of it.</li>
            <li> It stained my scalp a little and that sucks but</li>
            <li> I’m going to the store tomorrow and buying my usual punky hair dye.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s very messy during application.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It bleeds horribly, but that&#x27;s to be expected from a red, and especially a semi-perm dye.</li>
            <li> The color also stained my scalp being hard to work with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m clumsy with hair dye, so I always end up dying my scalp along with my hair.</li>
            <li> but i still needed a secondary bleach kit.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re common sense, if you&#x27;re using dye, it&#x27;s going to stain things.</li>
            <li> so I am not giving it a 1 star because i think the product sucks</li>
            <li> The only stains that still have not come out are those in my sink, which are still very very faint, but will fade eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For temporary color this was a ridiculous amount of work and cleanup.</li>
            <li> Too bad the red dye stains the sheets!</li>
            <li> /&gt;-rinse in COLD water, but expect your hair to bleed whenever wet.</li>
            <li> no matter how hard you scrub or pick at it with an alcohol-soaked Q-tip!</li>
            <li> this product sucks!</li>
            <li> I recommend cold showers, it makes it bleed less.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using something non-metallic based in the event you get tired of the color.</li>
            <li> Yes, dying your hair a crazy color is messy.</li>
            <li> They say to rinse till its clear but its impossible to get this crap off your scalp.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed about that.</li>
            <li> Oddly, the color I ended up with (considering the orange base) came out to a vivd fuchsia...</li>
            <li> , you don&#x27;t end up with a weird orange color</li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars reasons why are because the hair dye is very messy and stains bad :-(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair crazy colors for about 15 years now</li>
            <li> crazy</li>
            <li> and i was afraid it will than come out</li>
            <li> And it was in for a a hour it dont work like it says it should BAD BUY</li>
            <li> This is just a really bad, bad product.</li>
            <li> that that&#x27;s bad if it&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for</li>
            <li> in all, not too bad.</li>
            <li> And not the stupid bleach</li>
            <li> This crap sux it didnt even bleach his hair.</li>
            <li> No amount of rubbing, acetone, or isopropyl alcohol will get this crap off your skin.</li>
            <li> Within a week, it had faded out to an awful shade.    </li>
            <li> This stuff was nasty.</li>
            <li> But the hair color is awful.</li>
            <li> But after 2 washes, it faded to a disgusting orange color.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to get out!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> and it is HANDS DOWN the best red hair dye I have ever used... and believe me, I&#x27;ve used most of the red dyes available. It&#x27;s staying power is incredible. In fact the only time I even have to redye my hair is when my blonde roots start coming in. Very minimal fading.... in fact I have no fading at all, even when I don&#x27;t use shampoo &amp; conditioner for colored hair. And when it comes to red hair dye, it&#x27;s hard as hell to find one that doesn&#x27;t fade in two weeks. This doesn&#x27;t fade in two months. Also, the hair dye smells delicious. With other dyes I&#x27;ve had to stand next to an open window just to breathe. Not with Splat. It smells like berries!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, there is one major drawback to this hair dye:&lt;br /&gt;- Take EXTREME care to not get this on your scalp. I&#x27;m clumsy with hair dye, so I always end up dying my scalp along with my hair. But with Splat hair dye, the dye PEELS off of your skin over the course of several weeks. I am not kidding. The dye doesn&#x27;t fade away after a couple washes - IT PEELS OFF. Almost like paint. It&#x27;s extremely weird and it makes me self conscious for about a week or two after dying my hair because it looks like I have a rash or an infection on my scalp. Now, for me, I can deal with that as long as I don&#x27;t have to waste my money on hair dye every other week. But for others that probably isn&#x27;t the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used the bleach with the kit, so I can&#x27;t comment on that.</li>
            <li> So I read EVERY review i could find on this product before I decided to buy it. I caved because I couldnt find anything else that would give me the red I wanted in a permanent color, I have to just deal with a semi, and i didnt like manic panic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, naturally I have very dark brown hair, almost black. I had dyed my hair a month ago so I used Color Oops to remove it first before I bleached. There is NOT much bleach, as eveyone else has said. I have just a few inches over shoulder length hair, its very choppy, and i didnt dye the bottom quarter of it. but i still needed a secondary bleach kit. I bought 2 boxes of Splat, so I just snagged the second bleach kit and was set. I left the bleach in about an hour, which gave me a golden blonde through most of my hair, and a bright blonde near my roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Splat must have fixed their formula because it was not very runny at all. It&#x27;s not as thick as most permanent hair dyes ive used, but it wasnt dripping everywhere. Maybe people just need to be careful. BUT, it DOES stain, so if you drip it on something, wipe it off immidiately. If it doesnt come off, some dial soap and a little scrubbing fixes that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the splat as carefullly as i could, i used vaseline generously around my ears forehead and neck, and managed to get just a little on my visible scalp itself. I then covered it with a shower cap (or a plastic grocery bag works too) and i left it for 7 hours. YES, 7 HOURS. I think i could have left it in for longer to get a better color, but 7 hours was sufficient. When I put the color in, it looks blood red, and thats a little misleading.&lt;br /&gt;It will not stain your tub (or at least it didnt stain mine), but be sure to wash off the walls of your shower &amp; curtain so the color doesnt stick. I also recommend you keep the gloves on while washing it out.) When i washed it out it was BRIGHT PINK, and i was pretty horrified, thinking my hair was also this vibrant hot pink color. It took forever to get it out enough to my satisfaction (the water will never run clear, and 2 months later it is STILL coming out pink.) I towel dried my hair and walked into the bedroom, to my surprise, it wasnt bright vibrant pink, but it was a pretty pinkish red, and I was a little disappointed. In the right light, it looks a great Elmo red. I was kind of upset, but oh well, it was nice i guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited a couple days, and to my surprise, the color set in and turned a vibrant red i wanted! My roots and upper hair were no longer hot pink, they had darkened to the same elmo color the rest of my hair was, and it looked amazing. It&#x27;s been 2 months, and my hair color still looked amazing until yesterday, BE WARY OF CHLORINATED POOLS! I swam and then hung out in the sun not thinking about my hair, and when i looked, its not back to being a pinkish color, and parts of it have compeltely faded to an orange-ish color. No harm though, I&#x27;ll just go and redye it, since i know how wonderful my hair will look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you dye your hair, if its pink like mine, be patient! Mine turned red after a couple days of setting in and a wash or two. Other than the pool incident, i love this color and will continue to use it until i find something better.my satisfaction (the water will never run clear, and 2 months later it is STILL coming out pink.) I towel dried my hair and walked into the bedroom, to my surprise, it wasnt bright vibrant pink, but it was a pretty pinkish red, and I was a little disappointed. In the right light, it looks a great Elmo red. I was kind of upset, but oh well, it was nice i guess.    I waited a couple days, and to my surprise, the color set in and turned a vibrant red i wanted! My roots and upper hair were no longer hot pink, they had darkened to the same elmo color the rest of my hair was, and it looked amazing. It&#x27;s been 2 months, and my hair color still looked amazing until yesterday, BE WARY OF CHLORINATED POOLS! I swam and then hung out in the sun not thinking about my hair, and when i looked, its not back to being a pinkish color, and parts of it have compeltely faded to an orange-ish color. No harm though, I&#x27;ll just go and redye it, since i know how wonderful my hair will look.    When you dye your hair, if its pink like mine, be patient! Mine turned red after a couple days of setting in and a wash or two. Other than the pool incident, i love this color and will continue to use it until i find something better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my own hair for 10 years now. I&#x27;ve been every natural color imaginable. (and some stretching the limits of the word natural) This past month, I finally decided to go cherry red. I can&#x27;t attest to how the bleach works, as I didn&#x27;t use it. I prefer to use a creme lightener; it&#x27;s less damaging to my hair. I lightened my hair to a near white and, using 2 boxes because my hair falls just below my shoulder blades, followed the directions for the color... well... except that when rinsing, the water never ran clear. After quite some time, I just decided it was good enough. When I dried it, I was very impressed. The color was very vibrant and exactly what I had wanted. (the only reason this got 2 stars)    Red hair fades very quickly and stripping your hair is very damaging, so I only washed my hair every 3 days. (shower caps and dry shampoo are your friend) It faded drastically with the first wash. Within a week, it had faded out to an awful shade.    Another big downfall is that this color runs. Make sure your hair is covered if it starts raining, or you&#x27;ll have bright red streaks running down your face!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this color and bleach on and off for a year now, and I absolutely love it. I have fine hair, so I was wary when I first tried bleaching my hair, I didn&#x27;t want to burn it. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. This bleach was very gentle on my hair, yet was very effective at getting my hair to the yellow-blonde that is best for this color. You can still use this color if you have light/medium brown hair, it&#x27;s still VERY vibrant red, but it&#x27;s even brighter if you can get your hair to the yellowish blonde all over, which is easy to do with the bleach.    The red is so pretty. It does wash out a lot, just because it&#x27;s such a vibrant color and only semi-permanent, but if you change your hair color constantly like I do, that&#x27;s a good thing since you don&#x27;t have to re-bleach every time, you just have to wait a few weeks for it to all wash out. It starts out a very vibrant red then fades to a really pretty light pink color, I&#x27;m not a fan of pink but I am a fan of the pink that this color fades to. Depending on how often you wash your hair, the color usually lasts a few weeks, but the dye and bleach is so cheap that it&#x27;s not even an issue, and like I said, the color transitions it goes through while it&#x27;s fading are all very pretty, you don&#x27;t end up with a weird orange color thank god ahaha.    I highly recommend this to anyone who want their hair a very deep, bright red color. Very fun to mix with darker reds and purples to get a more burgundy color.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get my hair that bright Rihanna red for a while other products have not worked for me. I have had patchy red hair and pink hair and I almost gave up. I tried this product today after seeing pics on facebook  my friend used this dye Her hair was very vibrant she told me she used splat and I decided if it worked for her it will probably work for me. I have long hair I died the did both steps on the top half of my hair. The bleach worked great the dye after about an hour of leaving it in came out pretty nice. I rinsed it a little washed it with with a neutralizing shampoo I also used infusium shampoo and cream of nature. I shampooed and rinsed about 4-5 times I didn&#x27;t condition because I read on another review that it strips the color out. I like the color. It stained my scalp a little and that sucks but its no big deal I finally have my hair red. I used an old towel and then blow dried my hair and then I flat ironed it and it looks pretty good. I probably will not wash my hair for about a week. I paid $10 at walgreens and used 2 boxes on my hair. I will probably keep using this product until I decide to try something new but that maybe in a couple of years because I really like the red.If anyone has any tips about the staining other than petroleum jelly please let me know. I really hope it doesn&#x27;t last longer than a week.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!!! The color is rich and vibrant and it lasts for a good while. I add conditioner to mine to make the dye last loanger and to moisturize my hair at the same time</li>
            <li> this product sucks! I followed all directions exactly! My nephew has as well&amp;it never wlrks right! as soon as the first time you wash your hair it the color washes out! Mine was got pink the day I did it…doesn&#x27;t sound bad right? but it was supposed to be dark red!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this color..The only down fall is that it fades really quick and you need to be retouching it constantly just like any other red. Bleeds a lot for the first few days, but other than that it&#x27;s an awesome color.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, but it turns out much lighter than shown. I was expecting a bright red, but got a dark pink instead. It also fades very quickly. I&#x27;m not quite at two weeks and it&#x27;s more of a hot pink now.</li>
            <li> I have used splat before. I always had good luck with it staying for a long time (over a month)  i used just the color on my hair last night and its very vibrant!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product enough to have tried it 3 different times, so I decided to review it even though I bought it at Walgreen&#x27;s ($10) instead of amazon. It costs less than buying bleach and dye separately, and if you do it right, you can get some pretty cool results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I had never bleached my hair before. The instructions tell you enough to get the job done, but they leave out some pretty useful tips that can make the difference between a good, even color and a splotchy disaster. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned from experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; CHOOSING A COLOR:&lt;br /&gt;When choosing a dye, remember that it will fade in intensity over time, and also if the bleach has left your hair with a yellowish tint to it, it could combine with that to produce a different color. YOUR HAIR WILL PROBABLY NOT BE THE SAME COLOR AS THE PEOPLE ON THE BOX. Obviously, their hair is photoshopped. Yes, this dye lasts for a long time (months, even!) but the color will fade in intensity. I have tried both purple and red, and my hair was pink after 2 or 3 washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; SHOWER CAP FOR BLEACH:&lt;br /&gt;The most important tip I have is that you will need to buy a shower cap, or at the very least, be prepared to tie a plastic bag over your head. Plastic gloves are included, but they aren&#x27;t very good so I&#x27;d recommend buying extra. The reason you will need a shower cap is that the effects of the bleach are intensified by heat, so if you have longer hair, the heat from your scalp will cause the top of your head to lighten much faster than the tips. A shower cap helps lock in both heat and moisture so your hair will bleach more evenly and it won&#x27;t get all crunchy from being too dry during the bleaching process. You can use a hair dryer to speed up the process, but I didn&#x27;t try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PORTIONS:&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long, dark and thick, so I bought two boxes and used about 1.5 bottles of the bleach, but only one bottle of the dye was necessary. You cannot save the bleach once it&#x27;s been mixed, so I ended up wasting a lot of it. However, you can divide it into portions if you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll use it all at one time. Then if you do need all of it, you can just mix up the rest. If you divide it up before you mix it, remember that fluid ounces are not the same as regular ounces, so you might have to do some math. I used one of the little cups that you get with a bottle of cough syrup since it has fluid ounces labeled on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you accidentally mixed too much bleach, you can leave it in the bottle (with the cap off) just in case you check and find out you missed a spot or something. Once all of your hair is covered in the bleach mixture, try to get all of it underneath the shower cap, and check it every few minutes. Even with the shower cap on, the top will probably lighten faster than the tips. You can add more bleach if you need to, but you probably shouldn&#x27;t leave it on for more than an hour. Maybe I just got lucky, but 1.5 bottles of bleach was enough to get the job done surprisingly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE DYEING PROCESS:&lt;br /&gt;Like it warns, this dye will stain! Protect every surface the best that you can, and be prepared to rinse out (maybe even wipe down) your tub after the first couple of washes. Also, especially if your hair is wet, it can stain fabrics and other surfaces for about a week after you&#x27;ve dyed it. Both my pillowcases and my couch have permanent reminders of this. The good news is that, messiness aside, the dyeing part isn&#x27;t as complicated as the initial bleaching. Make sure your hair is clean, dry, and free of products (including conditioner.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can leave the dye in your hair for much longer than you can with the bleach. Several hours, even. I used the shower cap for this as well, mostly to help with the mess. Also, you can save any left over dye just by putting the cap back on the bottle, which you can&#x27;t do with the bleach. It probably won&#x27;t rinse out all the way for the first couple of washes. Don&#x27;t expect the water to run clear, and you might have to clean your tub. Like I said, the intensity of the color will probably fade during the next week or so, but after that, it will stay in your hair for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I do recommend it, but I haven&#x27;t tried other bleaches or dyes for comparison. Good luck!said, the intensity of the color will probably fade during the next week or so, but after that, it will stay in your hair for months.   Obviously, I do recommend it, but I haven&#x27;t tried other bleaches or dyes for comparison. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I did not bleach my hair before hand, but I am a fairly light ginger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also it didn&#x27;t color my virgin hair by my scalp at all. However I only needed about half the bottle so I will be redoing it with a little orange mixed in later this week and will report back.</li>
            <li> It all and all is a great product. The only thing to be warned about is that it comes out a very pinky red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Splat for 5 years (in all kinds of shades) and honestly, it&#x27;s one of the longest lasting I&#x27;ve used. A way to maintain the color is by leaving on the color (not the bleach!!!!) for as long as possible. I&#x27;ve left on under a shower cap as I&#x27;ve slept before and it will last for at least a month. You can also combine the color with your normal conditioner and leave it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again- fantastic product, just is a little &amp;#34;pinker&amp;#34; than it looks on the box.</li>
            <li> This stuff was nasty. We didn&#x27;t use the bleach as I felt it would be too damaging to the hair. The actual hair color product was like ink. It didn&#x27;t spread well, and dyed everything it touched, including areas on skin and would not wipe off.</li>
            <li> The color is very deep, rich and intense.  It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.  I highly recommend it.  To obtain a more RED color make sure to use the bleach to remove the color first.</li>
            <li> After reading every review of at-home hair color I could find, I decided to use Splat based on the face that I could buy it at my local CVS, as I was too impatient to order any other kind of hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very dark brown/black (Asian) and it was completely unprocessed, but I still decided to bleach/dye my hair at home with the help of one other person. I dyed a strip of my hair with the Luscious Raspberry dye about 7-8 weeks ago and I am still very happy with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BLEACHING&lt;br /&gt;I mixed the bleach and put it in my hair for about 45 minutes, until it turned a light orange color, and then rinsed the bleach out. It worked find and it did minimal damage to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COLORING&lt;br /&gt;After researching the Splat hair color a little, I found out that there is no developer in the dye itself, meaning that the length of time you leave the dye in your hair will only determine how long the color stays in your hair before it fades, not the damage done to your hair. Leaving the dye in for longer will only make the color stay longer, it will not do more damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted my color to last as long as possible, so I originally planned to leave the dye in for about 6 hours, but I got impatient and took it out after about 4 1/2. ****Note: The other reviewers are 100% correct when they say to leave the dye in for much longer than the instructions suggest.&lt;br /&gt;After 7-8 weeks, I can tell that my color is slowly fading out, but it&#x27;s still a very bright red as compared to the bright red/pink it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put petroleum jelly on my neck and wrapped my hair in lots of plastic wrap while the dye was in it, but I still ended up with plenty of dye all over my hands and neck as well as on the hands/arms of the person helping me. It wore off of my hands after about a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANING&lt;br /&gt;I foolishly dyed my hair in my very, very white bathroom and managed to stain just about everywhere, despite playing down plastic all over. If you can catch the stain right after you spill the dye, it wipes very easily off of marble/tile/countertop. I found that most stains came out fine if I let them soak for a couple of minutes in a bleach cleaning spray plus a little bit of scrubbing with a paper towel. The only stains that still have not come out are those in my sink, which are still very very faint, but will fade eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I (and my helper) wore a giant plastic garbage bag over my head with holes cut in it for my head and arms. It protected my clothing very well, even if it wasn&#x27;t the best fashion choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can, I would recommend considering dying your hair outside on grass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CARE&lt;br /&gt;I rinsed the dye out but didn&#x27;t shampoo the section of dyed hair for about 4 days after I dyed it, which seemed to work. Even now, when I take a shower the dye will stain my towel and pillowcase. I just put a towel over my pillow if I&#x27;m sleeping with wet hair and it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE&lt;br /&gt;The process is messy and time-consuming, but well worth the final product. A great (and cheap) alternative to going to a hair salon.</li>
            <li> Ive been dyeing my hair for 12 years and never in all the products that ive used been so dissapointed... i&#x27;m a dark blonde and ive used this colors two different times and neither worked well. Time 1 I Bleached my hair to a pale blonde and died it with this red... CAME OUT HOT FREAKING PINK! time 2 (after my hair had grown out) i tried again this time i Didnt bleach it ... Came out a different dark Pink.... very dissapointing... ive never had this issue with their blue or green or even the purple.... Dont get this if you want a Dark red. spend a bit more money and buy the kind the pros get (you can buy it online u dont need a liscence) you will be glad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later when i tried to bleach the \\&quot;RED\\&quot; out it turned my hair pale pink and yellow orange (never had this issues with dye before EVER!) dont get this red. the rest of their products are great the red just sucks!</li>
            <li> Great hair dye, better than manic panic. Really long lasting.</li>
            <li> first time i use this product. i love it. i could never find a good color to stay and let me tell you this is the one. i bought a red and black one. my hair was brown. now i have black hair with red highlights and i love it. follow the instructions and all will be ok. maybe you should use plastic hospital gloves instead but worth it.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this dye intending to turn her hair red. She has light blonde hair, and after putting the dye in, it turned hot pink. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you are, in fact, looking to turn your hair bright red.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this color! Thankfully I went and got the Crimson Obsession one first and got home and it didn&#x27;t have bleach so I got the Luscious Rasberry and it turned out wonderful. I have really dark brown hair and the bleach didn&#x27;t come out super light, so I was worried, but the color stuck beautifully!</li>
            <li> This review is from my daughter. I was warned that this hair dye wouldn&#x27;t last quite a long time, but i tried it anyways since it was the only crazy color dye available at my drugstore. After the bleaching process, i went into the color the next day and i was AMAZED of how bright and vibrant the dye was. BUT, there was non stop bleeding of pink/ red dye from my hair. I&#x27;ve only washed my hair twice so far, and the red is already fading. I even had to be careful of getting my hair wet at my friends birthday at a water park because of how much my hair was bleeding when wet. Yet, i&#x27;m still trying to search for a better red hair dye that doesn&#x27;t do all this mess.</li>
            <li> This doesn’t even deserve one star. I have been dying my own hair for years and always used punky hair dye but decided to give this a try since it was on sale really cheap. NO WONDER IT WAS ON SALE SO CHEAP. NOTHING ABOUT IT WORKED. First off I have natural red hair so I decided to just dye it without using the bleach. I left the splat in for maybe an hour and a half since I had things to do and I wrapped it in plastic like always. I rinsed it out and the dye only stuck to a few strands of hair that were lighter. So I decided I should bleach my hair and because of my red hair I know bleaching it can be a pain in the butt. I left that bleach in my hair for over an hour and nothing happened at all. I got jerome russel bleach and 30 minutes later I had white hair. I used what was left of the splat (since I have short hair I had lots left) and Again left it in for an hour and a half. Sinced it out and I had light pink hair. I’m done. I’m going to the store tomorrow and buying my usual punky hair dye. I talked to a few of my friends who I consider hair masters based on everything they have done to their hair and they even confirmed the same thing, it is a huge waste of money and to never use it.</li>
            <li> I have used splat for the last year, i tried different shades of the bright red(wanting my hair as bright and fire truck red as i could get it) out of all the brands i have used this was the best. the color was the most vivid and stayed the longest. unfortunately, for my thin dark brown hair after bleaching and dying my hair was somewhat dry which i fixed with oils and the color faded in about two-three weeks. it stayed longer than the rest which i guess is good, but still trying to find something different that will stay for at least 6 weeks. The color also stained my scalp being hard to work with. 3 stars</li>
            <li> I tried wildfire by manic panc and it ame out blood orange and faded to a gross orange really quickly. Splat luscious raspberry is amazing, a true deep red (exactly what I was looking for) and comes with bleach if you need to lighten your hair before the process. I will keep using this color until I no longer want red hair.</li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars reasons why are because the hair dye is very messy and stains bad :-( and when I sweat and work out it drips down the color I have in so yea... but I do love how the contrast and bright colors are so vibrant and pops out like crazy also I&#x27;m a male and I use it on my short hair and it blends in so nice so yea its 50/50 for me the results!! But overall I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love splat. I have used all the colors I can find.  Great product. Would use again. Wish there were more colors available in the permenant line</li>
            <li> It sucks only bleached strands of hair and there was not enough red dye do not recommend. Please do not get this for anyone with black or dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I like to dye my hair. My natural hair color is Med. brown. I finally decided to dye it black. I wanted back with red streaks. I fell in love with this color. However, when I put the bleaching agent in my hair, it did not bleach my hair the right way. Near the roots was blonde, but not the whole section. the tips were an red/brown color. I left the bleach in for 1 1/2 hours (the instructions state an hour for black) and that was the end result. I will be getting it done at a salon next time, but I will be taking the box with me, to show what color I am going for.</li>
            <li> Iv been using splat lusious raspberry sinse iwas 15 so about 2yrs now and ilove the color so much its so bright and pretty&lt;br /&gt;But the only thing ihate about it is it washes out kinda fast alot of ppl say it lastes for mounths but mine only lastes for a mounth b4 ihave to put more color in&lt;br /&gt;-probly bc iuse hot water-&lt;br /&gt;The bleach that comes along with it is great my hair is black and it dyes it in to a light yellow color in 60mins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall ilove splat and always will keep useing this product! &lt;3</li>
            <li> First of all, some people may not realize this, but this product is a hair STAIN. It is NOT a dye. It is a long-term deal. It will stain any and everything it touches!! This is what I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saran wrap on the sink.&lt;br /&gt;Old plastic table cloth on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;I bleached the underside of my hair for probably half an hour or so. I actually liked the bleach, it left my hair soft. But I&#x27;ve never bleached my hair so I can&#x27;t compare it to other bleaches.&lt;br /&gt;Applied STAIN.&lt;br /&gt;Left on hair for 2 HOURS+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your showers will be red for awhile. If you get wet, you&#x27;ll drip pink for awhile. I think it took about a month before my showers ran clear again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT amazing!! It did fade a bit into a brilliant pinkish red. Raspberry is actually very true description, I think. It surprised me because I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the NAME of the color and just assumed it was some kind of candy apple red or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the AMAZING part of the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 months later I went to the salon to get my hair cut. She seemed concerned about a lot of the red getting cut off and didn&#x27;t seem to understand my nonchalance to the idea. She asked, didn&#x27;t I like the red? I said yes, but I get bored pretty quickly with my hair and after 6 months I was ready to cut it out. BECAUSE THIS WILL NOT FADE AWAY. You must DYE OVER IT or let it grow out and CUT IT OUT. It lasts FOREVER!!&lt;br /&gt;She totally freaked and took me around to all of the hair dressers showing my hair and telling them it was 6 months old. No one believed it. It was still bright bright light red. This last time I cut my hair was a month and a half shy of A YEAR of it having been in my hair when I got the last inch or so of light bright red tips out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved it. As long as you&#x27;re careful, read the instructions and leave it in your hair for a loooooong, long time... it will last!! I don&#x27;t shampoo every time I take a shower, which probably helped it last, and it wasn&#x27;t directly on top of my hair getting exposure to sunlight and water from the shower, so maybe that helped, too. But THIS STUFF IS AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I&#x27;m&#x27; going to be buying the lusty lavender soon and applying it on my unbleached darker brown hair to see if i can get a nice deep purple instead of the bright light purple you get from bleaching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for something BRIGHT, LOUD, and FUNKY! :), and it wasn&#x27;t directly on top of my hair getting exposure to sunlight and water from the shower, so maybe that helped, too. But THIS STUFF IS AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I&#x27;m&#x27; going to be buying the lusty lavender soon and applying it on my unbleached darker brown hair to see if i can get a nice deep purple instead of the bright light purple you get from bleaching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for something BRIGHT, LOUD, and FUNKY! :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love splat! Never lets me down. Oh and a tip to people who say it fades fast: After dying you hair with splat (or any crazy color of coarse) wash your hair with warm or cool water. Never wash with hot water. It will strip the dye color from your hair. :) My color lasts for a good month before looking pinkish.</li>
            <li> A fantastic, cheap alternative to using costly high-end products with the same rich red advertised on the package (with or without the bleach!). I have used this product multiple times and each time it was relatively cheap, especially when compared to a few other alternatives I&#x27;ve tried which required volumizer and mixing. These lasted only about three weeks, whereas Splat Raspberry Red lasted about six. All this and I did NOT bleach my hair. Splat smells great and will not stain your tub or shower. It gave me the exact color I wanted without fading and the same mix could be used more than once if there was extra!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note: I have light brown, medium-thickness, long hair. You may need more than one kit if you plan on dying a whole head of thick, dark hair.</li>
            <li> As advised, I used the bleach on my hair first to ensure bright results.  Bright they were, though slightly uneven (most likely because I am not a professional).  After a few weeks it had faded out to a dull pink that I was not terribly fond of.  I decided to go over it with the new crimson obsession by splat.  As advised, I bleached first for truer color results.  After an hour of the bleach, the pink had lightened but ultimately did not budge much.  After washing out the crimson obsession dye and drying it, my hair was a fairly light vibrant pink, not the deep red as advertised.  6 weeks later I decided to have my hairstylist fix it.  After an hour of 40 volume bleach with green and blue shots, the pink was not going anywhere.  Apparently it has metallic dye in it or something.  We decided to go over the pink with some pravana vivid since clearly the pink was there to stay unless I wanted to go dark, which I did not.  This is an inexpensive way to have some bright haircolor, I recommened some help for even application.  Ultimately the color will change and dull after a little bit of time, but it will be there to stay if you bleached first.  If you intend to get the color out you will have to go dark over it.  I would recommend using something non-metallic based in the event you get tired of the color.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!! I used it to bleach my dark roots (came out perfect and I&#x27;m a platinum blonde). Then used the red for the underneath part of my hair and it turned out bright and beautiful... while its hard to keep the red seperated from the blonde on your hair I was very careful and it came out amazing. Will be using this instead of a $100 trip to the salon. Hair came out better then the salon did!!</li>
            <li> Now I didn&#x27;t buy this off line but I suggest going to Rit Aid or Walmart to buy this, I had amazing color for 2-3 months. I recommend cold showers, it makes it bleed less. I hope this helps because it&#x27;s truly beautiful.</li>
            <li> This crap sux it didnt even bleach his hair. And it was in for a a hour it dont work like it says it should BAD BUY</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Walgreens, I followed directions and bleached my hair within 30 minutes! The color is amazing! Love love love this product so much so far! And will keep using. :)</li>
            <li> The colours are very unique and bright, My daughter used the red. Everyone ask her what colour is it.I it truly very different from other reds</li>
            <li> Yes, dying your hair a crazy color is messy. Yes, it stains your pillow case. These things, I knew going in. They&#x27;re common sense, if you&#x27;re using dye, it&#x27;s going to stain things. It&#x27;s what dye is, it&#x27;s what it does. That&#x27;s not why I&#x27;m giving this one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to the bleach, I didn&#x27;t use it. I buy bleach from the beauty supply store, because the stuff that comes in drugstore kits rarely works out for me. But the hair color is awful. After and hour of rinsing and two shampoos, I still looked like Carrie at the prom. The color, Luscious Raspberry, was supposed to be a vibrant dark red, but it came out hot pink. The second day after coloring, the color washed completely out in a few areas, leaving me with blonde spots, and even though it&#x27;s fading at a ridiculous rate, it&#x27;s STILL running when it gets wet from sweat or water. Yes, I realize the directions say to rinse it until the water is clear, but that doesn&#x27;t appear to be possible. After four shampoos, it still runs, as badly as when I first rinsed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dye my hair a lot, so I feel fairly confident in my abilities and I don&#x27;t believe this is operator error. This is just a really bad, bad product.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product in the beginning.  It was bright and looked great!  But after 2 washes, it faded to a disgusting orange color.  I would be more pleased with the product if the actual color lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Got this for penny&#x27;s more than I would have at Walmart which is fine because all the stores I tried were out. I love love LOVE the color of my hair! I bleached out a darkish brown/ burgundy (burgundy faded had some light spots) and the bleach made it orange of coarse. So no biggie maybe the color will still hold. So I washed with shampoo AND CONDITIONER (which I didnt know you wernt supposed to do) hair still felt dead which is normal. So I get to the color and am freaking out because I was so excited and left it in for an hour (instructions say 30 minutes but i lost track of time) and it turned out FREAKING AMAZING! There are a few things I wanna warn about though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I need two boxes for bleach AND COLOR. I have hair a little past my shoulders so its not long and most definitely not thick. Buy extra its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The bleach was dripping down my face! I used Vaseline but it ate right through it. Now I have light spots on my forehead. Do as the instructions say and wear a shower cap (it makes the bleach go evenly too which is a mistake I am upset I made)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. THEY ARE NOT LYING ABOUT THE STAINING OF SKIN!!!!!! Once again I used the Vaseline but apparently not enough because 2 days later I am still covered in red all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 DO NOT COLOR YOUR ROOTS! I&#x27;m not talking so much about the bleach because I did it with some burning but was overall fine. But two days later I still have color CAKED on my scalp... They say to rinse till its clear but its impossible to get this crap off your scalp. (dont worry it will eventually) Thats really the only bad part about this product, but they warn you not to do it so I guess its my fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all this product is freaking amazing the color is phenomenal and despite my roots being platinum vs my ends being dark orange the red came out very even. looks like I was born with outrageously bright red hair! lol</li>
            <li> this is the best product for a cheap price,but i do warn you this will fade quickly,i strongly suggest that you use SoftSheen Carson &amp;#34;Hi-rez&amp;#34; In the red color after splat luscious raspberry has been faded out thank you :)</li>
            <li> The name should be changed to \\&quot;Cherry Red\\&quot;, because it&#x27;s not pink like raspberries as I had hoped. Bottles are small, so if you have long hair, buy more than one. I bleached my already blonde hair, which I should not have done, because I didn&#x27;t realize how bright the color was. I was hoping for more of an Ariana Grande look, but I got Rihanna instead(not that that&#x27;s bad if it&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for it&#x27;s definitely achievable). I am pleased with the vibrancy. I know it&#x27;ll last a long time. BUT, if you aren&#x27;t up to scrubbing the pink out of your tub after every shower, I don&#x27;t recommend this. The color still hasn&#x27;t come close to running clear, and I don&#x27;t think it ever will. A little disappointed about that. So much so, that I&#x27;m considering going back to my natural black just to avoid the mess. Overall, it&#x27;s a very thorough, bright, fun dye. Probably the best out there, other than professional.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dye.  It never fails.  Follow the directions and BAM, beautiful hair color.  The red sometimes rub off on light colors but the purple is my favorite it&#x27;s the best ever.  I will always use this brand.  I dyed my tracks and once I install them I&#x27;ll post a picture of how the look. This product is fool proof, I don&#x27;t know anything about dyeing hair but each time I use this product, I feel like a professional.  I&#x27;ve also just used the developer itself without the color and it&#x27;s gives a beautiful lift to very dark hair, I like the golden bronze color it gives.  I guess you can tell, I love it :)</li>
            <li> I bought luscious raspberries hoping it would be a vivd red like on the box. It was NOT true to color. I was able to bleach my naturally dark brown hair to a very light orange, not blonde, using the bleach in the box. Oddly, the color I ended up with (considering the orange base) came out to a vivd fuchsia... Like the color of bugenvelias. I left the color under a hair cap for about 8 hours and applied heat with a hair dryer every hour. The color bled all over me when I sweat and bled a lot during showers even with cold water, but it managed to stay vibrant for about a month. Overall they dye worked out well for me even though it was not true to color. I am willing to try other colors from this brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair crazy colors for about 15 years now and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve tried almost every brand and color available. My 27th birthday is just around the corner and I&#x27;ve just begun a new career as a nurse, so I have to keep a pretty tame, professional appearance (boring). Well, I decided to turn to Splat since it&#x27;s relatively cheap and I assumed it would fade quickly so I could see how my superiors would react before settling on something a bit more permanent.&lt;br /&gt;I do not bleach my hair anymore and this showed up beautifully with decent vibrancy on my naturally ginger hair.&lt;br /&gt;It bleeds horribly, but that&#x27;s to be expected from a red, and especially a semi-perm dye. It doesn&#x27;t stain anything while dry, so just be sure to dry your hair thoroughly if you shower before bed (or, alternatively, just shower in the AM).&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is decent. It comes in a bottle (which is better than a tube); but, I prefer tubs because you can get every last drop.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself has a nice, gel-like consistency. However, it&#x27;s very messy during application. Also, it WILL stain your skin. No amount of rubbing, acetone, or isopropyl alcohol will get this crap off your skin. If you get it on your scalp, it&#x27;ll be colored for, LITERALLY, a week ... no matter how hard you scrub or pick at it with an alcohol-soaked Q-tip! I found that it DID NOT, however, stain my shower tiles or sink, etc. It flings everywhere, yes, but rinses off of hard surfaces with water just fine if you get to it quickly.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, not too bad.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years now, and as long as you&#x27;re not an idiot and bleach your hair thoroughly first, it will always result in very vibrant red colour for any hair type or competent brain that can read instructions.</li>
            <li> This color is absolutely beautiful &amp; so vibrant. Its a 2 step process though if you&#x27;re starting w dark hair because you have to bleach it 1st then color it which is what I had to do. This color tends to fade quickly &amp; when it does at least on my hair it fades to a orange/pink color. I only colored the bottom layers of my hair so I was left w 1/2 a bottle of extra color so when it fades out I just add more splat color to it, let it sit for an hour then rinse. I&#x27;ve had to do this every wk to 2 wks. Its a high maintenance color so I would recommend not using this if you dont want to touch up your hair on a weekly basis. Its shame cause I love the color but its just too much work. Make sure you purchase extra gloves to use for touch-up applications because this is very hard to remove from your skin. Tip: use baking soda &amp; dish soap to help remove color stains from skin</li>
            <li> gets your hair the color for the first night after that bleeds out every chance it gets. Will stain everything your towels your bedding your face.  Fades fast go pro and get the good stuff either by a Sassoon out Sassoon store.</li>
            <li> Always a reliable hair source. Too bad the red dye stains the sheets! And clothes, so make sure black is in your wardrobe!!! And be careful with towels.</li>
            <li> waste of money color did not come out as it say on da box came out brown followed da instructions very gd it also makes ya head itch lik crazy even whn its out ya head had to put a diffrent color in my hair to make it look better dnt buy it waste of money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dyed my hair many different colors, and I think Splat is one of the best. Most &#x27;rebellious&#x27; hair dyes don&#x27;t last very long, but Splat stays put for weeks and weeks. The bleach that comes with it isn&#x27;t great, but if you are just trying to lift a little color so the colored dye is brighter, it should do the trick. Honestly, you can put this stuff on unbleached hair and it is still pretty noticeable. I could never do that with Manic Panic. There is a downside though. This stuff is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to get out!!! It took THREE TIMES with hair bleach to get the pink out!! And not the stupid bleach it comes with, strong bleach from a beauty supply store. I ended up having to cut off my hair and color over the pink-purple-bleached mess with black!!!&lt;br /&gt;**Also, don&#x27;t follow the directions on the box. If you want a long lasting, vibrant color, keep it on for an hour. The longer it os on your head, the brighter it will be. Just wrap your head in plastic wrap while the dye is on your head. The color on the box isn&#x27;t what it actually looks like on your head. For instance, Pink Fetish comes out a very bright fuschia. It is a beautiful color, but if you happen to want it to be more pink--like on the box--then add some conditioner to the dye BEFORE you apply it to your hair. That will lighten the color.</li>
            <li> I used Splat Blue Envy, followed all the instructions, bleached it first, left the dye in my hair for 30 minutes, and it faded to silvery-grey in less than a week. (I&#x27;m 20 and I don&#x27;t have grey hair.) I will probably not ever use this again.</li>
            <li> The color fades pretty quickly to a dullish pink-red but it still has places of vibrant red color and it&#x27;s great for at home dyers</li>
            <li> Especially in red. It lasts FOREVER, if you bleach it right. Its very vibrant. although this is the only brand I&#x27;ve used so i cannot compare.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Splat! It&#x27;s perfection in a bottle. I&#x27;ve tried other semi/demi-permanent hair dyes and all the color washed out after I rinsed the dye out! Splat is the only type of non-permanent dye that will stay in my hair and boy, does it have staying power. I still have traces of Splat in my hair from over two years ago! That being said, I&#x27;d recommend this product for anyone who wants the color to stay in their hair as long as possible. My only issue with Splat is that it fades relatively quickly but other than that, Splat is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this hair dye before and it worked well for me. But my box DIDNT come with a bleaching packet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of types of dye to get my hair a true red and I&#x27;ve got to say that Splat was the best for me. The bleaching part was somewhat of a pain because I&#x27;m always reluctant to bleach my long dark hair and honestly it came out a little blotchy but that was my own fault. Make sure to keep the color on the full amount of time and DON&#x27;T skimp on the dye. Buy two bottles if necessary, its worth it. It stayed on and vibrant for a long time but make sure not to wash your hair within the first 48 hours of dying and when you do wash it, use cold water and add a quarter sized amount of dye to your shampoo when you wash so buy an extra bottle for washing. SO take your average amount of shampoo and add dye while washing and let it sit on your hair for about 5 minutes before washing. It really helps. Be sure to keep the dye off your skin as much as possible, even in the shower. I wet my hair then wring it out before I add the shampoo/dye mix. DO NOT wash daily especially if you bleached it because chances are, your hair is dry. It is pretty messy and holds on like hell to skin to don&#x27;t skimp on the petroleum jelly and maybe even wear two sets of gloves. S***  stains like nothing else. But all in all, its the most fade-resistant and vibrant color I&#x27;ve used. Red is a pain so just follow the typical precautions like avoiding excess sunlight and chemicals and heated styling tools.</li>
            <li> The bleach portion worked well, but the color barely took. Even after dyeing it twice it is still only got pink, not red. Many areas did not take at all. Left the color in longer than the recommended 30 minutes both times.</li>
            <li> Made my hair red, faded after about a week and a half but I&#x27;m in the ocean every day to so that probably sped it up. But left my hair with a nice bown-red fade that still shimmered in the sun!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for those who have shorter hair, I have the hair length of the girl on the box and the bottom half of my hair didn&#x27;t get bleached.&lt;br /&gt;I like the bleach that was added but once again; shorter hair.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts for quite a while until your roots begin to show.</li>
            <li> I ultimately ended up liking this color after it faded at bit, but I did NOT get a red color like on the box.  I ended up with hot neon pink.  Under certain lighting, it almost looked red, but it just missed the mark.  I really like this brand in general though.</li>
            <li> I love Splat! I&#x27;ve used it two separate times with different colors and amounts.&lt;br /&gt;The first time was April 2011 and I used Pink Fetish to put two pink streaks in.  Now, when I used this color I did use both the bleach and the color, and it was also the first item I was coloring my hair by myself (usually my mom helps me out). The bleach worked well, especially when I really had no clue what I was doing, it was uneven and orange in some places (I figure that was operator error, plus my hair refuses to accept color and bleach evenly). The color did stain my scalp purple (again operator error, I used way to much dye in that one spot) but the color faded from my skin in about 1-2 weeks. THIS COLOR LASTS FOR A VERY LONG TIME. Simply trying to bleach it out will not work, unless you enjoy having fried hair, if you get sick of it you&#x27;re going to have to dye over it with a different color. In general the color looked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used Splat was about 5-6 weeks ago, I used Luscious Raspberry and I dyed my entire head. I was already a pretty light blonde at this point (minus my roots, which I didn&#x27;t care were darker) so I did not use the bleach.This time, because I knew this would be messy, I plastic wrapped my counter, did the petroleum jelly thing, and got some latex gloves. And with the trusty help of my mom and best friend, began to dye my hair. Now, my mom had never used a dye this runny, so my scalp was a very bright red and I looked like the victim of a serious head injury. I ended up needing two bottles of dye, so after the first ran out my mom made a quick trip back to Walmart, my hair is about boob-length and I should have known I&#x27;d need another bottle. I left the dye in for about four hours and I got an awesome red/on the verge of hot pink color (which is what raspberry is by the way). Be prepared for a long shower when you rinse it out, especially if you refuse to take cold showers like me. The dye will fade, all dyes do, most people nowtell me they love my hot pink hair. Even now the water runs a light pink, but I don&#x27;t mind. I&#x27;ll be redying it within the next day or so because I really love how it has turn out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THINGS TO REMEMBER:&lt;br /&gt;- everyone&#x27;s hair is different and accepts bleach/dye differently don&#x27;t expect it to look EXACTLY like the box.&lt;br /&gt;-leave it in for 1-6 hours&lt;br /&gt;- plastic wrap your counters (also try to prevent the bottle front getting too slippery, it slipped out of my mom&#x27;s hand and out bathroom still looks like a murder scene)&lt;br /&gt;-rinse in COLD water, but expect your hair to bleed whenever wet.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dye with low expectations since i have never used semi-permanent dye well, goodness i didnt have high hopes cause it didnt work for me however, even with vaseline all over my face and neck and shoulders you name it i put protected even with that the dye sure didnt do anything on my hair but did wonders on my skin .... I am grateful i am a stay home mom with no need to go out cause it allowed for try every home remedy to remove the stains. So after it was safe I went to a local beauty supply store and got Loreal HiColor Hilights (Red) and got the results that I was looking for.... Okay, this product did not work for me but I didnt the bleach cause my hair was already red just not a bright red and i was afraid it will than come out Pink so I am not giving it a 1 star because i think the product sucks it was just a waste of time for me and money when i could of just gotten Loreal from the start...&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck</li>
            <li> The box says that it is concentrated and will basically stain anything it touches and that is no exaggeration. I tried not to get it on anything but even the slightest dampness of hair will leak the color on EVERYTHING. And it made a lot of my hair fall out even though I only left it on for 10 minutes. For temporary color this was a ridiculous amount of work and cleanup. Just use permanent dye. I did like the color in the end, but it wasn&#x27;t worth constantly worrying about my hair getting wet during summer becasue I could stain my clothes, car, couch etc.</li>
