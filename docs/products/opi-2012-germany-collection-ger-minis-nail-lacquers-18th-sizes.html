            <li>Another perfect color to compliment a winter</li>
            <li>This is the best nail polish known to man!</li>
            <li>Very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>OPI put out a great sample collection!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s that perfect fall purple shade.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for a close friend and she absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li>great colors and very good selection.  </li>
            <li>the colors are great and of course&lt;br /&gt;its OPI</li>
            <li>My sister has a darker complexion and it looks great on her.</li>
            <li>The colors are great for work and weekend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;Unfor-greta-bly Blue&amp;#34; is another wonderful color with a captivating shimmer.</li>
            <li>I really do love all four of these shades - this was a great purchase!</li>
            <li>Absolutely loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are perfect to carry with you in case you need a quick touch up.  </li>
            <li>Great choice of colors :)</li>
            <li>Four out of Four awesome colors is rare when buying a collection.  </li>
            <li>I love the OPI Germany Collection and this provided me with a great sampling of the set.  </li>
            <li>It has a wonderful matte finish (so does Nien Nien Nien to be fair) that has great coverage with only one coat.</li>
            <li>Omitting a top coat will result in cracking and peeling of the polish within two days of application (if not sooner!)</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love these nail polishes!</li>
            <li>The colors are so cute!</li>
            <li>These are great colors, they are so fun.</li>
            <li>; in contrast is a great, neutral shade that is perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, all of these mini&#x27;s are at their best when given a clear bottom and top coat.</li>
            <li>Fine!</li>
            <li>Okay fine!</li>
            <li>Nein, nein, nein, ok fine!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t imagine you could get much more than 3 or 4 applications from each bottle.</li>
            <li>I love the colors but you&#x27;ll need to apply more polish to get a cleaner result.</li>
            <li>I love all of them and will use all of them.  </li>
            <li>I love OPI minis.  </li>
            <li>customers Love this so much!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I really love this collection.  </li>
            <li>I love the names of the polishes.</li>
            <li>I love this set even though I am 56..</li>
            <li>I love, love,</li>
            <li>love Suzi &amp; the 7 Dusseldorfs  </li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>Super cute mini bottles!</li>
            <li>Very cool.</li>
            <li>a favorite - each is unique.  </li>
            <li>Quick dry, Opi is the best nail polish anyhow, no matter in what shape or size!</li>
            <li>The blue is pretty, but the purple is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>The four colors from the German collection in this set are really great.  </li>
            <li>my Buttons is a great neutral, especially for work.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re miniature definitely, so be sure you&#x27;re aware.</li>
            <li>Fun colors!</li>
            <li>I love these little mini sizes because they&#x27;re great for trying out shades and for travel.  </li>
            <li>The polish also stays on a long time without chipping which is very nice.  </li>
            <li>while a full manicure keeps it for about a week.</li>
            <li>Colors were fantastic, mini bottles, not so much, I have since repurchased these in full size!</li>
            <li>is a deep charcoal-y grey that is perfect for that fall and</li>
            <li>You get just the right amount of 4 of the season&#x27;s newest colors.  </li>
            <li>The Germany collection was particularly fantastic with a nice balance of a neutral shade, a dark shade, and two jewel-toned shades.</li>
            <li>I have pretty pale skin, so the cream colored one doesn&#x27;t look great on me.  </li>
            <li>be buying more next time.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>My Buttons is so pretty</li>
            <li>Still, it is a fun color that compliments tanner skin tones better than true black or blue-blacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(the grey) is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>The colors are fantastic, but sometimes it is really hard to coat the whole nail without the dreaded lines because the brush doesn&#x27;t glide as smooth as the full size OPI products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color itself is reminiscent of sand with more gold tones than pink and is very much a true beige.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A rich, wintery blue this color brings to mind renditions of the Snow Queen while it&#x27;s sparkle adds a festive feel.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy the gray and purple in the full size bottles</li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s so vibrant</li>
            <li>Love these little polishes.  </li>
            <li>I chose these minis because I wanted to experiment with the new blues and purples and grays.  </li>
            <li>Far from the sophisticated  sort of green</li>
            <li>But the colors are so vivid.</li>
            <li>Unfor-greta-bly Blue is such a stunning blue shade.  </li>
            <li>I had average sized fingers and had to dip the brush twice for most of nails (unless I&#x27;m just bad at polishing my nails lol).</li>
            <li>Outside of direct sunlight, the green is barely notable.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these minis to someone who wants to try out the smaller versions in order to update their color palatte.  </li>
            <li>If you like dark colors this is a nice little set.</li>
            <li>They dry fast</li>
            <li>It is not so &amp;#34;goth&amp;#34; as the pure black nail polish, but it has the feel of being modern and traditional at the same time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not quite plum, not quite fuschia, &amp;#34;Suzi &amp; the 7 Dusseldorfs&amp;#34; is a rather unique shade in the purple family with a delicate shimmer.</li>
            <li>Rather watery in comparison to the previous two, this shade like &amp;#34;Suzi &amp; the 7 Dusseldorfs&amp;#34; requires two coats to really show off it&#x27;s color.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to wait a long time to dry it.</li>
            <li> I have always stuck to pink, mauve, and coral in the past, and everyone is wearing these new colors.  </li>
            <li> I like the purple and dark blue one!</li>
            <li> grey is to die for!!</li>
            <li> That isn&#x27;t too bad given I was completely disappointed by &amp;#34;Nien Nien Nien, Okay, Fine!&amp;#34; which is a shame, because I thought that it was the spectacular grey-green that had been promoted a while back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; is really a deep, dark green that approximates black (especially in two coats!)</li>
            <li> I hope that my experience with this help other people in making decisions on this matter.</li>
            <li> I used a base coat (O.P.I. Nail Envy), two coats of the color, and a top coat (can&#x27;t remember the name)</li>
            <li> In one coat it is thin and slightly closer to a polished, purple tourmaline while in two coats it adds a richness and depth that brings it closer to a dark amythest or a sunlit wine.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect them to be so small.</li>
            <li> But it sp small that the brush does not work well</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is the bottles are so small it is hard to&lt;br /&gt;get</li>
            <li> Keep in mind they are very small.</li>
            <li> they mean it!</li>
            <li> you might find the little polish tip annoying as you would have to repeatedly coat the tip to polish each tip.  </li>
            <li> I just feel that it is too expensive</li>

            <li> I bought this as a gift for a close friend and she absolutely loved it! Great choice of colors :)</li>
            <li> I like the product. I just feel that it is too expensive and I feel that I got ripped off. I know that amazon doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the pricing but I feel that the beauty supply store should not be ripping off consumers the way that they do. I hope that my experience with this help other people in making decisions on this matter.</li>
            <li> When they say mini they mean it! The bottles are positively tiny and I don&#x27;t imagine you could get much more than 3 or 4 applications from each bottle. That isn&#x27;t too bad given I was completely disappointed by &amp;#34;Nien Nien Nien, Okay, Fine!&amp;#34; which is a shame, because I thought that it was the spectacular grey-green that had been promoted a while back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Nien, Nien, Nien&amp;#34; appears for all purposes as a grey-green in pictures online and even in the bottle. The reality is completely different. Far from the sophisticated  sort of green I had hoped for &amp;#34;Nien, Nien, Nien&amp;#34; is really a deep, dark green that approximates black (especially in two coats!) that is reminiscent of nori. Outside of direct sunlight, the green is barely notable. Still, it is a fun color that compliments tanner skin tones better than true black or blue-blacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Don&#x27;t Pretzel My Buttons&amp;#34; in contrast is a great, neutral shade that is perfect for everyday use. It has a wonderful matte finish (so does Nien Nien Nien to be fair) that has great coverage with only one coat. The color itself is reminiscent of sand with more gold tones than pink and is very much a true beige.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Unfor-greta-bly Blue&amp;#34; is another wonderful color with a captivating shimmer.

In one coat it is thin and slightly closer to a polished, purple tourmaline while in two coats it adds a richness and depth that brings it closer to a dark amythest or a sunlit wine. Another perfect color to compliment a winter wardrobe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, all of these mini&#x27;s are at their best when given a clear bottom and top coat. Omitting a top coat will result in cracking and peeling of the polish within two days of application (if not sooner!) while a full manicure keeps it for about a week.</li>
            <li> Love these little polishes.  They are perfect to carry with you in case you need a quick touch up.  The polish also stays on a long time without chipping which is very nice.

            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect them to be so small. I must not have read the title. They&#x27;re miniature definitely, so be sure you&#x27;re aware.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is the bottles are so small it is hard to&lt;br /&gt;get the polish out of them but the colors are great and of course&lt;br /&gt;its OPI</li>
            <li> This is the best nail polish known to man! The bottles are very tiny, you may only get 4-5 uses. But the colors are so vivid.</li>
            <li> Super cute mini bottles! I love the colors but you&#x27;ll need to apply more polish to get a cleaner result.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.  Well done, and a quality product.  great colors and very good selection.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t know what would do without it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I knew that these were mini&#x27;s when I ordered them, but didn&#x27;t expect the brushes to be so tiny!  The colors are fantastic, but sometimes it is really hard to coat the whole nail without the dreaded lines because the brush doesn&#x27;t glide as smooth as the full size OPI products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This grey is to die for!!</li>

            <li> Four out of Four awesome colors is rare when buying a collection.  I love all of them and will use all of them.  I don&#x27;t have a favorite - each is unique.  OPI put out a great sample collection!</li>

I would recommend these minis to someone who wants to try out the smaller versions in order to update their color palatte.  I would definitely buy the gray and purple in the full size bottles</li>
            <li> 。☆。。☆ 。&lt;br /&gt;★。＼\｜/／。★&lt;br /&gt;  I used this for my nail Spa. customers Love this so much!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying more next time.&lt;br /&gt;★。／/｜\＼。★&lt;br /&gt;。☆。。☆</li>
            <li> I really love this collection.  Nein! Nein! Okay fine! (the grey) is my absolute favorite.  I have pretty pale skin, so the cream colored one doesn&#x27;t look great on me.  My sister has a darker complexion and it looks great on her.</li>
            <li> I love the OPI Germany Collection and this provided me with a great sampling of the set.  The collection is OPI quality.</li>
            <li> Love these nail polishes! The colors are so cute! Don&#x27;t Pretzel My Buttons is so pretty cant wait to use it.</li>
            <li> Colors were fantastic, mini bottles, not so much, I have since repurchased these in full size!</li>
            <li> If you like dark colors this is a nice little set. Keep in mind they are very small. I would recommend it just to try the different colors.</li>
            <li> I like the purple and dark blue one! They dry fast and I don&#x27;t have to wait a long time to dry it. But it sp small that the brush does not work well</li>
            <li> These are great colors, they are so fun. I love the names of the polishes. Nein, nein, nein, ok fine!</li>
            <li> I love this set even though I am 56.. You get to experience the line through the 4 colors. Even though the bottles are very tiny there&#x27;s enough for 4 or 5 uses of each color. The colors are great for work and weekend. Very cool.</li>
            <li> I love these little mini sizes because they&#x27;re great for trying out shades and for travel.  The four colors from the German collection in this set are really great.  I love, love, love Suzi &amp; the 7 Dusseldorfs  because it&#x27;s so vibrant and it&#x27;s that perfect fall purple shade.  Don&#x27;t Pretzel my Buttons is a great neutral, especially for work.  Nein! Nein! Nein! OK Fine! is a deep charcoal-y grey that is perfect for that fall and Unfor-greta-bly Blue is such a stunning blue shade.  I really do love all four of these shades - this was a great purchase!</li>
