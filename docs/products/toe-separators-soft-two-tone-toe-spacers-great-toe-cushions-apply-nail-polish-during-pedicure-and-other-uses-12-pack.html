            <li>And they aren&#x27;t too bulky, making it easy to polish my toes.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable and keep my toes apart.</li>

            <li>they are nice ,hard to find.</li>
            <li>I bought them because of another set I got that spread my toes far too much</li>
            <li>These were okay, but I found them to a bit small and flimsy.</li>
            <li>The spacers aren&#x27;t far enough apart to really separate the toes</li>

            <li>I ended up returning these because they were very flimsy and low quality.  </li>
            <li>My wife says they are too soft.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> simply like it, separate toes well</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these locally and am so glad I found these.  Had been using paper between my toes that would never stay put.  These solve my pedicure problems.</li>
            <li> Good mixture of colors and above average quality.</li>
            <li> I use these to store my sewing machine bobbins.  Unlike my other bobbin storage case these toe separators keep the threads neatly on the spool.  No more bobbins thread &#x27;nests&#x27; to slow me down.</li>
            <li> These will make manicures easy.They are comfortable and keep my toes apart.</li>
            <li> They dont hold your toes far enough. They should be thicker. For reference, I&#x27;m petite and I wear size 5. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Better than nothing. The spacers aren&#x27;t far enough apart to really separate the toes but I didn&#x27;t have any issues with polish smudging. I liked the color selections.</li>
            <li> Very thin, very cheap, but they get the job done. You sure get a lot! Would be perfect for those little girl glamour parties!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Fine quality and seem like I will be able to use the same set over and over and will be able to gift the other sets to other people.</li>
            <li> I like the colors that the toe separators came in. They seem like they could be used for multiple uses. They are soft and spongy which is what I was hoping for as I&#x27;ve never bought this type of product. I was trying to find items for a birthday basket for a teenage girl who is currently into doing her nails. The only thing that I would have preferred is that the toe separators be a thicker and come in a small quantity. The 12 pack would be great as party favors. I ended up splitting the package up for the birthday basket.</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Plenty of them for the price :)</li>
            <li> I ended up returning these because they were very flimsy and low quality.  I was able to find much nicer ones for a reasonable price in a store.</li>
            <li> They do the job they are supposed too, but a little thin.</li>
            <li> My wife says they are too soft.  Not really strong.</li>
            <li> Cute toe separaters. I ordered them to go along with the nail polish, nail files &amp; nail polish remover I got for party favors. They make a nice addition. I would&#x27;ve like them to be a tiny bit thicker, but other than that they work. They also came in cute colors which is a plus. They all came in great condition &amp; at a good price.</li>
            <li> Using these to store bobbins for sewing machine!!</li>
            <li> very flimsy. would not buy again</li>
            <li> they are nice ,hard to find.</li>
            <li> These were okay, but I found them to a bit small and flimsy.</li>
            <li> These were perfect for the mason jar pedicure favors I hade made up for my bridal shower.  All the girls loved them!</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m using these at home I can get several uses (clean feet!) out of one pair.  I have big feet  (11m) and these work fine.</li>
            <li> They work but, oddly, an extra spot for a 6th toe?</li>
            <li> This were great!  Worked perfectly for my mason jar gifts for teachers.</li>
            <li> A little thin but adequate! The number you receive &amp; the price are great. I would buy again!</li>
            <li> These are better than the last ones from China, but still not as sturdy as the ones my salon uses. Good value, though.</li>
            <li> great value, affordable</li>
            <li> love..Bought for goody bags for my daughters 10th b-day party..Huge hit!!</li>
            <li> separates my crooked toes well enough to make painting them a joy again</li>
            <li> A lot of toe separators for the money. And they aren&#x27;t too bulky, making it easy to polish my toes.</li>
            <li> Love these, they are so soft and do not hurt my toes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not quite as stiff as I expected, they&#x27;re very bendable, but they still work great. I bought them because of another set I got that spread my toes far too much and it hurt; these don&#x27;t do that at all. I love that there are so many; even if I lose any, I still have plenty.</li>
            <li> I use them to organize thread bobbins in my sewing supplies. They work great for that.The material is thin and floppy, but they hold bobbins securely, even if the case get tossed about a bit.</li>
            <li> These are exactly as I hoped they would be. Fit toes well and stay on. I can walk all around the house while toes dry and would buy again!!</li>
            <li> Inexpensive but took too long to arrive</li>
