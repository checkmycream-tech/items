            <li>and she really liked it.</li>
            <li>She likes that it comes in a nice case as well.</li>

            <li>My husband is quite pleased with this set...</li>
            <li>she is pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>It was one of my husband&#x27;s favorite gifts.</li>
            <li>Think a cheap pair of TRIM clippers was better  </li>
            <li>Great set of clippers so far wife seems 2 like them</li>
            <li>She loves the case and how easy the tools are to use.</li>
            <li>Quality is fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a small manicure set with a leather case and this was a perfect gift to myself :).  </li>
            <li>It really looks nice</li>
            <li>The case is not user friendly.  </li>
            <li>Has all the essential thing in it that one uses for a good manicure or pedicure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s at the very low end of the price range for German-made manicure sets, but the tools are surprisingly well made.</li>
            <li>Very nice tools, sharp and cut well.  </li>
            <li>but I thought it might be nice to actually have all the &#x27;stuff&#x27; if I ever wanted it.</li>
            <li>If it was the right one, she&#x27;d give it 4 or 5 stars.</li>
            <li>when you use the leading edge of the &#x27;blades&#x27; -- but only if you do not try to cut more than a smidgen at a time.</li>
            <li>This manufacturer has some larger kits (more pieces)</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t really use the cuticle tools, the tweezers are fine as far as tweezers go.  </li>
            <li>Just the right ones for normal nail needs.  </li>
            <li>The strips inside the case that hold the items can break easily and that is the only drawback.</li>
            <li>a quality product, well-made of fine German steel.</li>
            <li>Even the little case is nice.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>All of the instruments are very high-quality and the packaging is compact and first-rate.  </li>
            <li>I would order the set again because I really like the scissors and clippers.</li>
            <li>I like the quality of the utensils but don&#x27;t find much use for the two clippers.</li>
            <li>This says alot about the company They do read the reviews and make good on their products wish some of the other companies would do the same</li>
            <li>She is very knowledgeable of professional manicure tools and she loves this kit!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my selection after reviewing numerous other kits which offered other items, but not the essential ones I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The company read my review and was surprised that they sent me a new set of clippers to replace the ones that came with the set that I brought   </li>
            <li>Anyway quality seems to be pretty good and 2 stars are only for sending a wrong product.</li>
            <li>They was not as good as they claim, Clippers was very dull left jigged edge on finger nails</li>
            <li>The nail clippers (which was really the only reason we bought this) work well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have professional manicures or pedicures, but prefer to do myself in the convenience of my home.  </li>
            <li>It was a gift for my adult  daughter.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad little travel kit.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>The manicure scissors could be a little sharper and have a little better point on them</li>
            <li>I was looking for a moderately priced, German made manicure set for my adult daughter for Christmas.  </li>

            <li> Very nice nail clipper set. One of the best that I have ever used. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this 8 piece kit (white) but got completely different one instead of it - 6 piece (red). Anyway quality seems to be pretty good and 2 stars are only for sending a wrong product. If it was the right one, she&#x27;d give it 4 or 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Have it had the set for weeks (months) but just used it recently. Really only wanted/needed finger nail clippers but I thought it might be nice to actually have all the &#x27;stuff&#x27; if I ever wanted it. Only used the finger nail clippers. Based on that single use alone, I think this is tremendously over priced (which makes me tremendously stupid and the seller outrageously intelligent?). The finger nail clippers do not clip....they cut....when you use the leading edge of the &#x27;blades&#x27; -- but only if you do not try to cut more than a smidgen at a time. VERY poor quality. Save your money.</li>
            <li> They was not as good as they claim, Clippers was very dull left jigged edge on finger nails Think a cheap pair of TRIM clippers was better  The company read my review and was surprised that they sent me a new set of clippers to replace the ones that came with the set that I brought   This says alot about the company They do read the reviews and make good on their products wish some of the other companies would do the same</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.  The case is compact.  The variety of tools is more than you could ever use.  Cutting tools are sharp.  The file actually works.  Good value.</li>
            <li> This was a present for my mother and she really liked it. Has all the essential thing in it that one uses for a good manicure or pedicure.</li>
            <li> Great quality.  Perfect size</li>
            <li> I gave this as a small gift to my wife when she was going on a weekend retreat with our church. She loves it. All of the instruments are very high-quality and the packaging is compact and first-rate.  This manufacturer has some larger kits (more pieces) but I wanted it to be compact, and my wife says this 8-piece has everything she needs. This is a quality product and I recommend without reservations.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a moderately priced, German made manicure set for my adult daughter for Christmas.  It really looks nice and I think she will like it.</li>
            <li> They loved it and a great product! Wunderbar!</li>
            <li> I got this for my partner and she says the tools inside are very nice and great quality. She is very knowledgeable of professional manicure tools and she loves this kit! She uses it just about every day. She likes that it comes in a nice case as well.</li>
            <li> Not a bad little travel kit.  The nail clippers (which was really the only reason we bought this) work well.  The manicure scissors could be a little sharper and have a little better point on them but since it&#x27;s meant to be for travel, I&#x27;m o.k. with that.  We don&#x27;t really use the cuticle tools, the tweezers are fine as far as tweezers go.  All in all, I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she absolutely love it. She loves the case and how easy the tools are to use. They fit her hands well and give her great control.</li>
            <li> a quality product, well-made of fine German steel. Compact and good looking.</li>
            <li> I specifically ordered this kit because it contains the essential nail and toenail tools I required to maintain my hands and feet.  I don&#x27;t have professional manicures or pedicures, but prefer to do myself in the convenience of my home.  These tools are very high quality and the case is small enough to carry in your purse if necessary.  I&#x27;m very happy with my selection after reviewing numerous other kits which offered other items, but not the essential ones I was looking for.</li>

            <li> Every item worked according to expectation. The strips inside the case that hold the items can break easily and that is the only drawback. The cutting edges are sharp but not extremely so and that works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a small manicure set with a leather case and this was a perfect gift to myself :).  I like the quality of the utensils but don&#x27;t find much use for the two clippers.</li>
