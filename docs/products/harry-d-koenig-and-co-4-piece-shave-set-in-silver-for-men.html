            <li>GOOD SHAVE</li>
            <li>GOOD CHOICE</li>
            <li>The item is a good value and comes with soap which some others do not.</li>
            <li>Nicely made and looks great.</li>
            <li>delivery was good and came on time.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li>If you are exploring it, though, this is a good way to start.</li>
            <li>Good quality all around.</li>
            <li>stand itself is good for the bowl and the brush.</li>
            <li>Beautiful set up and works fantastic as well as looks great on my countertop.</li>
            <li>Nice looking and good quality.</li>
            <li>and still love it!</li>
            <li>I think the quality is nice for the price.</li>
            <li>The man who I gave it to seems to think it was nice.</li>
            <li>Got it for my husbands Birthday, he really liked it.</li>
            <li>B001TSL664 Van Der Hagen Deluxe Shave Soap]]</li>
            <li>The razor is nice</li>
            <li>He liked it</li>
            <li>Would have been a nice item</li>
            <li>Its a nice shaving kit but the replaceable head won&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li>All the pieces are quality and look quality nice sitting my bathroom.</li>
            <li>sturdy and stays looking nice, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>Using this product is the equivalent of drawing a nice bath, lighting some candles, drizzling some rose pedals, and having some Enya whispering in the background.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice qualiTy set</li>
            <li>Excellent, polite customer service and very speedy processing.</li>
            <li>Will order again from these nice people.</li>
            <li>razor handle is (was) very nice, though, and it accepts Gillette Mach 3 heads just fine.</li>
            <li>and I think I love it more than he does!</li>
            <li>The shaving brush is actually fairly nice, but should have bought another 4 piece kit from a better supplier.</li>
            <li>, should the owner own a better razor already or wish to upgrade as they gain experience.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful set, it really ties the room together and functions as it should.</li>
            <li>Razor very light weight, would suggest another..  </li>
            <li>Good, safe &amp; quick shipping.</li>
            <li>And he loves using this to shave! :)</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift, but purchased a better safety razor to replace the one in the set.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, this set&#x27;s best feature is likely its modular stand.  </li>
            <li>Love the stand and the brush...</li>
            <li>This was one of my husband’s favorite presents I have given him.</li>
            <li>A HANDSOME SET</li>
            <li>Comes with shave soap, which I was unaware of, but am happy about nonetheless!</li>
            <li>What I love is</li>
            <li>Another part is I love the smell and feel of [[ASIN:B001OMVB38 Col. Conk Bay Rum Shaving Soap]]</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am pleased with this set and am actually enjoying shaving each morning.</li>
            <li>That makes it worthwhile and a value.</li>
            <li>I was planning on ditching Gillette, so the loss of the handle isn&#x27;t a huge blow to me, but it is (was) a nice handle</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap they send seems okay.</li>
            <li>, it builds lather okay, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My brother-jin-law is going to love this.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased.</li>
            <li>For the price, I was expecting better quality.</li>
            <li>and this set was a perfect excuse to ditch the gel I had been using and switch to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As Gillette no longer fully controls the patent on the TracII razor blade cartridges, generic replacement blades are readily available for the razor, making it an excellent budget option.  </li>
            <li>The brush is not as soft a one that is made from softer animal hair, but it foams up great as well as the soap that comes with it.</li>
            <li>It does a good job applying lather and not irritating my face, though, and that&#x27;s all</li>
            <li>The brush is weighted and fits well in the hand, shaver nice and long and the bowl is great and easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, everything in this is kind of &amp;#34;meh,&amp;#34; but I wanted a quick, cheap, and easy way to try wet shaving and this product did everything perfectly for that.</li>
            <li>Still, it fits the soap and is easy to hold and build up a lather</li>
            <li>is actually quite nice and has a good weight and feel to it.</li>
            <li>I ended up having to use an older one that is in good condition.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a surprise for my husband since he had just invested in new shaving cream, pre shave, &amp; after shave, &amp; he loved it.</li>
            <li>While the rest of the set is fine, I&#x27;m now stuck trying to get the company to send me a replacement shaver.  </li>
            <li>and they all fit.</li>
            <li>(The metal suspension bar could also be bent somewhat out of line to fit for razors with wider</li>
            <li>It doesn’t rust if you take proper care of it and is a great set.</li>
            <li>Fusion cartridges don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>it fit my razor?&amp;#34; rest assured: it will.  </li>
            <li>but the handle doesn&#x27;t fit my blades</li>
            <li>It is very well made &amp; looks nice on the counter.</li>
            <li>Again, if the owner would like to substitute a higher quality badger brush with softer bristles and better water-retaining quality, it should fit easily in the brush stand.  </li>
            <li>I will be replacing the original brush with a nicer one, as it continues to fall apart.</li>
            <li>I had looked at other inexpensive sets on the market and this is the best of them (some were pure junk.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied and this is going to make a great gift for my father as he used to have something very similar to this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and pretty!</li>
            <li>Vintage look with modern convenience of fitting the mach 3 razor blade heads.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad starter set.  </li>
            <li>First wetshaving soap for me, but it&#x27;s smell isn&#x27;t too strong</li>
            <li>Being able to hang the soap cup on the stand reduced the total counter space allotment by about half - brilliant!  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a problem with the razor, so I tried another Mach III that I had, but it too didn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>It came super fast!!</li>
            <li>I was generally satisfied with the quality of the stand, brush, and soap--however, when I opened up the razor (advertised as NEW) there was a HAIR stuck in between the blades.     </li>
            <li>Overall the set, which includes a bar of shaving soap, a bowl, a stand, a brush, a shaver, and a Mach III razor, looks pretty good.  </li>
            <li>WE love the style as it&#x27;s appearance is Vintage looking and the brush is super soft.</li>
            <li>To answer a frequently asked question: yes, safety razors fit the stand fine.  </li>
            <li>Fun times.</li>
            <li>My suggestion is to save your money for a set that will be worth it, because this one isn&#x27;t a quality set.</li>
            <li>it lathers up really well and smells so fresh!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made and has no rust, the razor itself is heavy and the whole set is very good quality.</li>
            <li>Maybe I haven&#x27;t really figured it out, but i just place hot water in the included bowl to clean the razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would probably recommend investing a little more in a better brush and a separate bowl as opposed to this all-in-one set</li>
            <li>when it didn&#x27;t fit in the razor we assumed it was broken.after spending $25.00 on new refills</li>
            <li>Single Blade works amazing.</li>
            <li>The stand should easily hold a single-blade safety razor such as a vintage Gillette Super Speed or [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This item is exactly as represented, but I think there is one missed feature, and that is the brush holder could swivel over the soap holder so it drips into the soap.    </li>
            <li>Nice, the brush is rough.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Be sure to buy replacement razors, it only comes with one.</li>
            <li>Well worth purchasing, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>At first I thought I&#x27;d been ripped off.</li>
            <li>Then you will have a pretty and wonderfully hefty handle that is useless, just like I do.</li>
            <li>It lost a lot of bristles the first two usages, but that seems to have evened out.</li>
            <li>This product received is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy and looks good.  </li>
            <li>Also the shave soap that it came with looked a little cheap, so I added a better quality on in the gift bag.</li>
            <li>It looks classy and unique.</li>
            <li>razor is good for the beginning wetshaver to start with, a simple, fairly inexpensive double blade razor is preferred in traditional wetshaving as opposed to the newer cartridge razor designs with 3+ blades currently in the market.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The little metal cup is great (what more can you say about a little metal cup?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice set, but razor itself is less than desirable.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman Pure Badger Shaving Brush]] as a starter badger brush)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this set with intentions to eventually replace some of the pieces for my husband and bought a Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor (ideal for those that have larger hands or prefer a longer handle) for him to switch between regular shaving using the razor that the set came with and the safety razor.</li>
            <li>This set is made of very high quality metal.</li>
            <li>Nice, heavy feel to the razor, very high quality brush</li>
            <li>It fits well with its original pieces, however the bar that holds the brush and razor are fairly standard sized and thus will fairly easily hold different brush and razor sets.  </li>
            <li>no nicks,cuts, etc, and the blades last for ever because of the soap and the light ease of use razor handle, well, almost for ever.  </li>
            <li>I am only giving it 4 because the box that it comes in makes it look really  cheap .</li>
            <li>I really wish it came with a safety razor though...</li>
            <li>The included razor seems to be a generic Gillette-type Trac II head with one blade included to fit, and the brush is a boar bristle brush with a dyed stripe across the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He likes it so much that he doesn&#x27;t want to use it.</li>
            <li>I really like this mini barber set....</li>
            <li>He likes it but the razor refill that it came with was very cheap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a touch of the vintage with modern convenience (I use a Mach 3 razor and did not want to give up shaving that that style</li>
            <li>I really</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>Great holder, Bad brush and rusts easy.</li>
            <li>The brush bristles aren&#x27;t as full as my regular brush</li>
            <li>I can get a razor to stay in it if I position it so that it is pointing away from the stand (as opposed to towards it like it is in the picture of the product) and make sure it isn&#x27;t wiggling or moving when I put it down.</li>
            <li>The only thing that could have been better is that he uses a Schick razor and not a Gillette, but it was no big deal.</li>
            <li>B000LY2AKI Merkur Hefty Classic]]</li>
            <li>The brush also fell out of the handle portion, so we had to super glue it back on.  </li>
            <li>I will probably replace the brush, which is adequate, but frankly detracts from the overall experience.</li>
            <li>Is it going to help remind yourself that you too can be a knightly high society gentleman?</li>
            <li>essentially threw away my money on this; an elegant-looking shave set that actually makes it more difficult to get a good DE shave.</li>
            <li>Picked one up a brand new Harry D Koenig &amp; Co</li>
            <li>and it still looks brand new.</li>
            <li>After returning, she apologized for my problem, saying I&#x27;m going to send you a new one.</li>
            <li>And - the soap that came with the set - seriously STINKY :P  Smelled like K-Mart bathroom toilet deodorizer cakes.</li>
            <li>About a year after buying this, the set in general has held up very well with one exception.  </li>
            <li>If you like the hot lather that a traditional wet-shave promises, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have 100 year old vintages and brand new ones</li>
            <li>The brush isn&#x27;t very comfortable, but I will use both thee brush and the soap on very special occasions or when I am very bored.</li>
            <li>Well, aside from the brush... Used it three times and the bristles just completely separated from the handle.</li>
            <li>The bowl does not attach at all and is a completely separate piece.</li>
            <li>B0007MAFT2 Taylor of Old Bond Street Avocado Shaving Cream Jar]], or [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>He has used several different types of razors and they all fit in the same holder on the stand.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was the only reasonably priced set that included the brush, cup, razor and stand</li>
            <li>But the bottom line is this set was a relatively inexpensive way to get me back into wet shaving without giving up my favorite razor, and for that I&#x27;ll overlook the warts and give it five stars.</li>
            <li>Hence gravity wont allow that soap to stay in the bowl, i place the soap in a separate old spice shave soap bowl.</li>
            <li>(often available locally), either of these soaps will readily provide a dense, slick, cushioning lather.  </li>
            <li>boar brush is of decent quality, the steel handle is elegent and feels very solid in the hand.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>but I prefer the old fashioned safety razor to the newer type of razor, that&#x27;s why the 4 stars and not 5 ...just a personal preference</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a classy kit</li>
            <li>But who wants to use a a rough, frayed out brush?</li>
            <li>If the razor falls far enough, the plastic bit that attaches the razor heads will break.</li>
            <li>I am not happy with the fact that it will be taking up more space on my counter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really happy with the brush, but it&#x27;s ok otherwise.</li>
            <li>AND it all fit together in a very small footprint</li>
            <li>Other high quality traditional shaving creams can be used with this setup, such as [[ASIN:B0007M11XQ Proraso Eucalyptus Shaving Cream Tube]], [[ASIN:B0006O4NCQ Trumper Limes Soft Shaving Cream]], [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Great disappointment!</li>
            <li>The brush quality is no good, other than that its a rather charming little set to look at.</li>

            <li> GOOD SHAVE</li>
            <li> GOOD CHOICE</li>
            <li> The item is a good value and comes with soap which some others do not.</li>
            <li> Nicely made and looks great.</li>
            <li> delivery was good and came on time.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li> If you are exploring it, though, this is a good way to start.</li>
            <li> Good quality all around.</li>
            <li> stand itself is good for the bowl and the brush.</li>
            <li> Beautiful set up and works fantastic as well as looks great on my countertop.</li>
            <li> Nice looking and good quality.</li>
            <li> and still love it!</li>
            <li> I think the quality is nice for the price.</li>
            <li> The man who I gave it to seems to think it was nice.</li>
            <li> Got it for my husbands Birthday, he really liked it.</li>
            <li> B001TSL664 Van Der Hagen Deluxe Shave Soap]]</li>
            <li> The razor is nice</li>
            <li> He liked it</li>
            <li> Would have been a nice item</li>
            <li> Its a nice shaving kit but the replaceable head won&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> All the pieces are quality and look quality nice sitting my bathroom.</li>
            <li> sturdy and stays looking nice, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Using this product is the equivalent of drawing a nice bath, lighting some candles, drizzling some rose pedals, and having some Enya whispering in the background.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice qualiTy set</li>
            <li> Excellent, polite customer service and very speedy processing.</li>
            <li> Will order again from these nice people.</li>
            <li> razor handle is (was) very nice, though, and it accepts Gillette Mach 3 heads just fine.</li>
            <li> and I think I love it more than he does!</li>
            <li> The shaving brush is actually fairly nice, but should have bought another 4 piece kit from a better supplier.</li>
            <li> , should the owner own a better razor already or wish to upgrade as they gain experience.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful set, it really ties the room together and functions as it should.</li>
            <li> Razor very light weight, would suggest another..  </li>
            <li> Good, safe &amp; quick shipping.</li>
            <li> And he loves using this to shave! :)</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift, but purchased a better safety razor to replace the one in the set.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, this set&#x27;s best feature is likely its modular stand.  </li>
            <li> Love the stand and the brush...</li>
            <li> This was one of my husband’s favorite presents I have given him.</li>
            <li> A HANDSOME SET</li>
            <li> Comes with shave soap, which I was unaware of, but am happy about nonetheless!</li>
            <li> What I love is</li>
            <li> Another part is I love the smell and feel of [[ASIN:B001OMVB38 Col. Conk Bay Rum Shaving Soap]]</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am pleased with this set and am actually enjoying shaving each morning.</li>
            <li> That makes it worthwhile and a value.</li>
            <li> I was planning on ditching Gillette, so the loss of the handle isn&#x27;t a huge blow to me, but it is (was) a nice handle</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap they send seems okay.</li>
            <li> , it builds lather okay, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My brother-jin-law is going to love this.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased.</li>
            <li> For the price, I was expecting better quality.</li>
            <li> and this set was a perfect excuse to ditch the gel I had been using and switch to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As Gillette no longer fully controls the patent on the TracII razor blade cartridges, generic replacement blades are readily available for the razor, making it an excellent budget option.  </li>
            <li> The brush is not as soft a one that is made from softer animal hair, but it foams up great as well as the soap that comes with it.</li>
            <li> It does a good job applying lather and not irritating my face, though, and that&#x27;s all</li>
            <li> The brush is weighted and fits well in the hand, shaver nice and long and the bowl is great and easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, everything in this is kind of &amp;#34;meh,&amp;#34; but I wanted a quick, cheap, and easy way to try wet shaving and this product did everything perfectly for that.</li>
            <li> Still, it fits the soap and is easy to hold and build up a lather</li>
            <li> is actually quite nice and has a good weight and feel to it.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to use an older one that is in good condition.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a surprise for my husband since he had just invested in new shaving cream, pre shave, &amp; after shave, &amp; he loved it.</li>
            <li> While the rest of the set is fine, I&#x27;m now stuck trying to get the company to send me a replacement shaver.  </li>
            <li> and they all fit.</li>
            <li> (The metal suspension bar could also be bent somewhat out of line to fit for razors with wider</li>
            <li> It doesn’t rust if you take proper care of it and is a great set.</li>
            <li> Fusion cartridges don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> it fit my razor?&amp;#34; rest assured: it will.  </li>
            <li> but the handle doesn&#x27;t fit my blades</li>
            <li> It is very well made &amp; looks nice on the counter.</li>
            <li> Again, if the owner would like to substitute a higher quality badger brush with softer bristles and better water-retaining quality, it should fit easily in the brush stand.  </li>
            <li> I will be replacing the original brush with a nicer one, as it continues to fall apart.</li>
            <li> I had looked at other inexpensive sets on the market and this is the best of them (some were pure junk.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I am very satisfied and this is going to make a great gift for my father as he used to have something very similar to this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and pretty!</li>
            <li> Vintage look with modern convenience of fitting the mach 3 razor blade heads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad starter set.  </li>
            <li> First wetshaving soap for me, but it&#x27;s smell isn&#x27;t too strong</li>
            <li> Being able to hang the soap cup on the stand reduced the total counter space allotment by about half - brilliant!  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a problem with the razor, so I tried another Mach III that I had, but it too didn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li> It came super fast!!</li>
            <li> I was generally satisfied with the quality of the stand, brush, and soap--however, when I opened up the razor (advertised as NEW) there was a HAIR stuck in between the blades.     </li>
            <li> Overall the set, which includes a bar of shaving soap, a bowl, a stand, a brush, a shaver, and a Mach III razor, looks pretty good.  </li>
            <li> WE love the style as it&#x27;s appearance is Vintage looking and the brush is super soft.</li>
            <li> To answer a frequently asked question: yes, safety razors fit the stand fine.  </li>
            <li> Fun times.</li>
            <li> My suggestion is to save your money for a set that will be worth it, because this one isn&#x27;t a quality set.</li>
            <li> it lathers up really well and smells so fresh!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well made and has no rust, the razor itself is heavy and the whole set is very good quality.</li>
            <li> Maybe I haven&#x27;t really figured it out, but i just place hot water in the included bowl to clean the razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would probably recommend investing a little more in a better brush and a separate bowl as opposed to this all-in-one set</li>
            <li> when it didn&#x27;t fit in the razor we assumed it was broken.after spending $25.00 on new refills</li>
            <li> Single Blade works amazing.</li>
            <li> The stand should easily hold a single-blade safety razor such as a vintage Gillette Super Speed or [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This item is exactly as represented, but I think there is one missed feature, and that is the brush holder could swivel over the soap holder so it drips into the soap.    </li>
            <li> Nice, the brush is rough.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Be sure to buy replacement razors, it only comes with one.</li>
            <li> Well worth purchasing, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> At first I thought I&#x27;d been ripped off.</li>
            <li> Then you will have a pretty and wonderfully hefty handle that is useless, just like I do.</li>
            <li> It lost a lot of bristles the first two usages, but that seems to have evened out.</li>
            <li> This product received is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and looks good.  </li>
            <li> Also the shave soap that it came with looked a little cheap, so I added a better quality on in the gift bag.</li>
            <li> It looks classy and unique.</li>
            <li> razor is good for the beginning wetshaver to start with, a simple, fairly inexpensive double blade razor is preferred in traditional wetshaving as opposed to the newer cartridge razor designs with 3+ blades currently in the market.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The little metal cup is great (what more can you say about a little metal cup?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice set, but razor itself is less than desirable.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman Pure Badger Shaving Brush]] as a starter badger brush)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this set with intentions to eventually replace some of the pieces for my husband and bought a Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor (ideal for those that have larger hands or prefer a longer handle) for him to switch between regular shaving using the razor that the set came with and the safety razor.</li>
            <li> This set is made of very high quality metal.</li>
            <li> Nice, heavy feel to the razor, very high quality brush</li>
            <li> It fits well with its original pieces, however the bar that holds the brush and razor are fairly standard sized and thus will fairly easily hold different brush and razor sets.  </li>
            <li> no nicks,cuts, etc, and the blades last for ever because of the soap and the light ease of use razor handle, well, almost for ever.  </li>
            <li> I am only giving it 4 because the box that it comes in makes it look really  cheap .</li>
            <li> I really wish it came with a safety razor though...</li>
            <li> The included razor seems to be a generic Gillette-type Trac II head with one blade included to fit, and the brush is a boar bristle brush with a dyed stripe across the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He likes it so much that he doesn&#x27;t want to use it.</li>
            <li> I really like this mini barber set....</li>
            <li> He likes it but the razor refill that it came with was very cheap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a touch of the vintage with modern convenience (I use a Mach 3 razor and did not want to give up shaving that that style</li>
            <li> I really</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Great holder, Bad brush and rusts easy.</li>
            <li> The brush bristles aren&#x27;t as full as my regular brush</li>
            <li> I can get a razor to stay in it if I position it so that it is pointing away from the stand (as opposed to towards it like it is in the picture of the product) and make sure it isn&#x27;t wiggling or moving when I put it down.</li>
            <li> The only thing that could have been better is that he uses a Schick razor and not a Gillette, but it was no big deal.</li>
            <li> B000LY2AKI Merkur Hefty Classic]]</li>
            <li> The brush also fell out of the handle portion, so we had to super glue it back on.  </li>
            <li> I will probably replace the brush, which is adequate, but frankly detracts from the overall experience.</li>
            <li> Is it going to help remind yourself that you too can be a knightly high society gentleman?</li>
            <li> essentially threw away my money on this; an elegant-looking shave set that actually makes it more difficult to get a good DE shave.</li>
            <li> Picked one up a brand new Harry D Koenig &amp; Co</li>
            <li> and it still looks brand new.</li>
            <li> After returning, she apologized for my problem, saying I&#x27;m going to send you a new one.</li>
            <li> And - the soap that came with the set - seriously STINKY :P  Smelled like K-Mart bathroom toilet deodorizer cakes.</li>
            <li> About a year after buying this, the set in general has held up very well with one exception.  </li>
            <li> If you like the hot lather that a traditional wet-shave promises, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have 100 year old vintages and brand new ones</li>
            <li> The brush isn&#x27;t very comfortable, but I will use both thee brush and the soap on very special occasions or when I am very bored.</li>
            <li> Well, aside from the brush... Used it three times and the bristles just completely separated from the handle.</li>
            <li> The bowl does not attach at all and is a completely separate piece.</li>
            <li> B0007MAFT2 Taylor of Old Bond Street Avocado Shaving Cream Jar]], or [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> He has used several different types of razors and they all fit in the same holder on the stand.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was the only reasonably priced set that included the brush, cup, razor and stand</li>
            <li> But the bottom line is this set was a relatively inexpensive way to get me back into wet shaving without giving up my favorite razor, and for that I&#x27;ll overlook the warts and give it five stars.</li>
            <li> Hence gravity wont allow that soap to stay in the bowl, i place the soap in a separate old spice shave soap bowl.</li>
            <li> (often available locally), either of these soaps will readily provide a dense, slick, cushioning lather.  </li>
            <li> boar brush is of decent quality, the steel handle is elegent and feels very solid in the hand.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> but I prefer the old fashioned safety razor to the newer type of razor, that&#x27;s why the 4 stars and not 5 ...just a personal preference</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a classy kit</li>
            <li> But who wants to use a a rough, frayed out brush?</li>
            <li> If the razor falls far enough, the plastic bit that attaches the razor heads will break.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the fact that it will be taking up more space on my counter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really happy with the brush, but it&#x27;s ok otherwise.</li>
            <li> AND it all fit together in a very small footprint</li>
            <li> Other high quality traditional shaving creams can be used with this setup, such as [[ASIN:B0007M11XQ Proraso Eucalyptus Shaving Cream Tube]], [[ASIN:B0006O4NCQ Trumper Limes Soft Shaving Cream]], [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Great disappointment!</li>
            <li> The brush quality is no good, other than that its a rather charming little set to look at.</li>
            <li> no mistake: this is a low end set that will introduce you to the joys of wet shaving or as a part of a daily ritual.</li>
            <li> It is not a high quality product that can cost hundreds, it is a product my husband has used occasionally without it rusting or falling apart and is without defects.</li>
            <li> I would kill to have the brush I owned in the 1960s, but that is long lost.</li>
            <li> I plan to continue using the brush,stand, and bowl for a while yet, and the soap for as long as it lasts me.</li>
            <li> So long as your razor looks like a capital-T and it isn&#x27;t a foot long or something, the stand will hold it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not even a long hair from someone&#x27;s head that might have fallen into the packaging--a FACIAL hair that suggests that the blade was previously used before it was sent to me.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t particularly like shallow shaving mugs</li>
            <li> Though I traded out the razor for one that does not require cartridges, this was half of what others were charging for similar products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a year and a half later: I don&#x27;t use anything but the razor.</li>
            <li> This little set made it all possible by keeping everything in a tight little package and keeping my counter space clear.</li>
            <li> If you like a cold or lukewarm lather, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> (my sink space is very limited).</li>
            <li> The bowls intended use is for the included shave soap, though once the soap is placed in the bowl it is no longer possible to hang on the little hook.</li>
            <li> The soap and the shaver are great but the shave brush is horrible.  </li>
            <li> Way better than using a messy cold can of shaving creme.</li>
            <li> It had a separate hook where the bowl hangs when it&#x27;s empty, but what am I supposed to do when it has soap in it?</li>
            <li> If you are already a wet shaver pass this one by.</li>
            <li> Once I ran out of the Mach 3 razor blades that came with it I replaced the razor with a Dorco six blade razor (half the cost, twice the blades!), and still intend to replace the Dorco with a safety razor soon to reduce my cost/carbon footprint even further.  </li>
            <li> one major complaint with this set is the included soap, a Taiwanese-made shaving soap under the brand name \\&quot;Kingsley\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Overall, not sure I recommend using that part of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Razor blade detached from razor half way through first shave and was rendered useless.</li>
            <li> Not worth the $.</li>
            <li> Every time I have used it for the last two weeks it has lost at least 10 to 15 hairs each time.</li>
            <li> hanging a soap dish with wet soap in it , messy idea.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for the latter use because I am retired and wanted to slow things down, including my morning shave.</li>
            <li> I mean, I use it as a soap bowl, I think it&#x27;s actually just supposed to be a lather bowl (hence the ability to hang it from the stand), but the soap they send with it is a puck soap, and where the heck else are you going to keep it if this is your starter set?</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I purchased this product, the other day I noticed on the brush hook some rust.</li>
            <li> The bowl has already turned black.  </li>
            <li> This shaving set falls under a budget category, and while that isn&#x27;t bad it isn&#x27;t on the same level as the high-quality Merkur razor/brush/stand sets you can find from high end shaving</li>
            <li> Well, we&#x27;ve had two other problems as well lately with shipping dates; when we paid extra to get an item delivered anytime for someone&#x27;s birthday it always comes a day or two late.</li>
            <li> , rack arrangement is functional and takes little space.</li>
            <li> The brush also feels a little softer after a few uses.</li>
            <li> the image showed a soap dish with soap sitting in a round shaving bowl holder.  </li>
            <li> the razor included in the set does not fit the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Upon closer examination, it appears that the shaver head (the part that fits the razor) has some defect because it does not properly fit any razor.  </li>
            <li> The razor and brush are heavy.</li>
            <li> but it was missing the shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Brush broke after a few months.</li>
            <li> critique is the base of the holder doesn&#x27;t leave room for the cup to fit under the brush as it&#x27;s drip-drying.</li>
            <li> it takes up very little space too...</li>
            <li> Not satisfied at all</li>
            <li> Amazon, please delete this item of such poor quality!</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, I gave it as a gift for someone&#x27;s birthday, by the time they opened it the return window was closed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sad that it met its end by simply falling off my counter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> brush seems to definitely be mediocre, but it&#x27;s definitely enough to get me started.</li>
            <li> I did not expect this product to feel very heavy and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> The brush is a little subpar and the bowl is a bit shallow.  </li>
            <li> The razor is designed all wrong and will not even hold the blade that came with it, making this whole kit completely useless.</li>
            <li> Would never have paid this much for the set if I&#x27;d noticed it was not a safety razor :(  </li>
            <li> but I was pretty disappointed because the razor was broken when we opened it.</li>
            <li> For this mug, I placed the shaving soap in the mug in a pan on my stove with about 1/2&amp;#34; of water and SLOWLY brought it to temp until it melted.</li>
            <li> The razor is broken...</li>
            <li> The base of the brush fell off and the bristles constantly sheds.</li>
            <li> So annoyed.</li>
            <li> That one was broken also.......</li>
            <li> Razor was broken upon delivery</li>
            <li> It seems to me that the part where the blade attaches is to thin compared to the razor head.</li>
            <li> Thin metal that does not retain heat.</li>
            <li> Bought as gift and was a little disappointed with the quality.  </li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for a little over 4 months and it has started to rust at the base.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate because the brush handle itself</li>
            <li> The twin blade was the purpose of my order &#x3D; wanted to get away from expensive mach 3 blades.   </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there is a problem with the silver plated shaver in my set --</li>
            <li> The razor that comes with it is silly, but I couldn&#x27;t get the set without the razor, so it is what it is.  </li>
            <li> The cartridge razor was never used, since the purpose of buying this stuff was to get away from buying expensive cartridges every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is very poor for the money.  </li>
            <li> The razor is bad quality.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe i got a faulty one, but it was a gift, so over it was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you get a completely worthless piece of junk like this razor that will not even hold a blade, and you can&#x27;t even return it for a refund...</li>
            <li> but the base makes it awkward.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I was incredibly shocked and disgusted when I found it; it made me feel like the blade was unsanitary and unsafe for use.     </li>
            <li> Very disappointed it was a Father&#x27;s Day gift for my husband.</li>
            <li> Seriously bad package!!</li>
            <li> They look so awful!</li>

            <li> I bought this set with intentions to eventually replace some of the pieces for my husband and bought a Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor (ideal for those that have larger hands or prefer a longer handle) for him to switch between regular shaving using the razor that the set came with and the safety razor. He loves it! I will be replacing the original brush with a nicer one, as it continues to fall apart. It&#x27;s unfortunate because the brush handle itself is actually quite nice and has a good weight and feel to it. I would recommend replacing the soap as well; it is not the highest of quality. Try D.R. Harris Arlington shaving soaps...it lathers up really well and smells so fresh!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and I think I love it more than he does! It is the PERFECT vintage-chic accessory to our master bathroom! And he loves using this to shave! :)</li>
            <li> The brush is a little subpar and the bowl is a bit shallow.  I have a Harry&#x27;s razor and it fits well in the razor area.&lt;br /&gt;Would probably recommend investing a little more in a better brush and a separate bowl as opposed to this all-in-one set</li>
            <li> Received 4 piece [[ASIN:B0007L44SG Silver Plated 4 Piece Shave Set]] . Was supposed to have a twin blade trac 2 type razor - came with a mach 3 razor. Different stand,hanger for soap dish. No soap  The twin blade was the purpose of my order &#x3D; wanted to get away from expensive mach 3 blades.   hanging a soap dish with wet soap in it , messy idea. the image showed a soap dish with soap sitting in a round shaving bowl holder.  Razor very light weight, would suggest another..  The shaving brush is actually fairly nice, but should have bought another 4 piece kit from a better supplier.</li>
            <li> It looks classy and unique. my bf loves it. he doesn&#x27;t use the razor but it completes the set. happy</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my dad and he likes it. Looks very nice and good quality.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it. The only thing that could have been better is that he uses a Schick razor and not a Gillette, but it was no big deal. We plan on buying another for my father.</li>
            <li> Beautiful set, it really ties the room together and functions as it should. Well, aside from the brush... Used it three times and the bristles just completely separated from the handle.</li>
            <li> Nice set, but razor itself is less than desirable. Bought this as a gift, but purchased a better safety razor to replace the one in the set.</li>
            <li> bought this for my husband,,, He loves it....</li>
            <li> dish and stand are great!&lt;br /&gt;Brush sucks!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Razor is slippery</li>
            <li> This item is exactly as represented, but I think there is one missed feature, and that is the brush holder could swivel over the soap holder so it drips into the soap.    That&#x27;s it!  Everything else is perfect, and the soap is excellent as well.  The razor is a twin blade, and the handle acts like a tuning fork while shaving!  perfect for close shaves, no nicks,cuts, etc, and the blades last for ever because of the soap and the light ease of use razor handle, well, almost for ever.  Excellent purchse.</li>
            <li> Was a cheaper set but I guess you get what you pay for. Also the brush didn&#x27;t come as advertised. Amazon did give me a 15% return</li>
            <li> Beautiful set up and works fantastic as well as looks great on my countertop. However, I got a different razor for it, Dorco Prime: Single Blade works amazing.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering what is shown in the image but the item I received was quite different. The bowl does not attach at all and is a completely separate piece. I am not happy with the fact that it will be taking up more space on my counter. It had a separate hook where the bowl hangs when it&#x27;s empty, but what am I supposed to do when it has soap in it? Not satisfied at all but I don&#x27;t trust that if I return it I will get anything different. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I think the quality is nice for the price. I am only giving it 4 because the box that it comes in makes it look really  cheap . I had to take everything out of the box and wrap it all in tissue paper so that I could present it as a gift. Seriously bad package!! Also the shave soap that it came with looked a little cheap, so I added a better quality on in the gift bag. The man who I gave it to seems to think it was nice.</li>
            <li> The razor is broken...</li>
            <li> Very nice. Bought as a gift. I really wish it came with a safety razor though...</li>
            <li> Nice, the brush is rough.</li>
            <li> Got it for my husbands Birthday, he really liked it. The only thing I wished for was something at this price and quality but a 4 blade cartridge.</li>
            <li> Great product, my father loved it.</li>
            <li> Picked one up a brand new Harry D Koenig &amp; Co 4 Piece Shave Set today at a garage sale for $5.  It&#x27;s not a bad starter set.  The brush bristles aren&#x27;t as full as my regular brush and I don&#x27;t particularly like shallow shaving mugs but I bought this to be used as a traveling set at an unbeatable price so I have no complaints.  BTW, I found that a Merkt&#x27;s spreading cheese lid fits the shaving mug perfectly for travel. Personally I don&#x27;t like metal shaving mugs because I microwave the soap to conform to the mug. For this mug, I placed the shaving soap in the mug in a pan on my stove with about 1/2&amp;#34; of water and SLOWLY brought it to temp until it melted. To answer a frequently asked question: yes, safety razors fit the stand fine.  I have 100 year old vintages and brand new ones and they all fit. My regular brush fits this stand as well.</li>
            <li> Great holder, Bad brush and rusts easy. Well, Where to start 3 weeks in and there is rust. The brush separated from the metal holder and overtime you touch it hairs fall out. If you just want a holder for your blade and brush look elsewhere. If you want a holder for your bowl, just be prepared...</li>
            <li> Great gift set but the boar brush fell apart after two uses. The base of the brush fell off and the bristles constantly sheds. I ended up having to use an older one that is in good condition.</li>
            <li> Always used my hands to lather my face, this product is great and looks nice in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Overall the set, which includes a bar of shaving soap, a bowl, a stand, a brush, a shaver, and a Mach III razor, looks pretty good.  Unfortunately, there is a problem with the silver plated shaver in my set -- the razor included in the set does not fit the shaver.  At first I thought it was a problem with the razor, so I tried another Mach III that I had, but it too didn&#x27;t fit.  Upon closer examination, it appears that the shaver head (the part that fits the razor) has some defect because it does not properly fit any razor.  While the rest of the set is fine, I&#x27;m now stuck trying to get the company to send me a replacement shaver.  Fun times.</li>
            <li> This shaving set falls under a budget category, and while that isn&#x27;t bad it isn&#x27;t on the same level as the high-quality Merkur razor/brush/stand sets you can find from high end shaving resellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this set&#x27;s best feature is likely its modular stand.  It fits well with its original pieces, however the bar that holds the brush and razor are fairly standard sized and thus will fairly easily hold different brush and razor sets.  The included razor seems to be a generic Gillette-type Trac II head with one blade included to fit, and the brush is a boar bristle brush with a dyed stripe across the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is good for the beginning wetshaver to start with, a simple, fairly inexpensive double blade razor is preferred in traditional wetshaving as opposed to the newer cartridge razor designs with 3+ blades currently in the market.  As Gillette no longer fully controls the patent on the TracII razor blade cartridges, generic replacement blades are readily available for the razor, making it an excellent budget option.  The stand should easily hold a single-blade safety razor such as a vintage Gillette Super Speed or [[ASIN:B000LY2AKI Merkur Hefty Classic]], should the owner own a better razor already or wish to upgrade as they gain experience.  (The metal suspension bar could also be bent somewhat out of line to fit for razors with wider handles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boar brush is of decent quality, the steel handle is elegent and feels very solid in the hand.  The brush could be a bit longer and wider, but it&#x27;s enough to get the job done.  Again, if the owner would like to substitute a higher quality badger brush with softer bristles and better water-retaining quality, it should fit easily in the brush stand.  (Recommend [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman Pure Badger Shaving Brush]] as a starter badger brush)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one major complaint with this set is the included soap, a Taiwanese-made shaving soap under the brand name \\&quot;Kingsley\\&quot;.  Whilesufficent, I would recommend a glycerin shaving soap such as [[ASIN:B000RJWPZC Col. Conks Glycerin]] or [[ASIN:B001TSL664 Van Der Hagen Deluxe Shave Soap]] (often available locally), either of these soaps will readily provide a dense, slick, cushioning lather.  Other high quality traditional shaving creams can be used with this setup, such as [[ASIN:B0007M11XQ Proraso Eucalyptus Shaving Cream Tube]], [[ASIN:B0006O4NCQ Trumper Limes Soft Shaving Cream]], [[ASIN:B0007MAFT2 Taylor of Old Bond Street Avocado Shaving Cream Jar]], or [[ASIN:B00154W2KQ Truefitt &amp; Hill Ultimate Comfort Shave Cream]].</li>
            <li> Love the stand and the brush... The razor is nice but I prefer the old fashioned safety razor to the newer type of razor, that&#x27;s why the 4 stars and not 5 ...just a personal preference</li>
            <li> Nice and matching perfectly with the description</li>
            <li> It came super fast!! It was open inside of the box and the razor head was just floating around inside the shipping box. Its a gift so I hope he likes it. It looks nice!</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift to my husband and he loves it. He likes it so much that he doesn&#x27;t want to use it. Nice looking and good quality. Shipping on time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband. He liked it but I was pretty disappointed because the razor was broken when we opened it. It&#x27;s cheap and pretty! I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again or recommend it to anyone else.</li>
            <li> Great product , go for it</li>
            <li> This was one of my husband’s favorite presents I have given him. It doesn’t rust if you take proper care of it and is a great set. He has used several different types of razors and they all fit in the same holder on the stand. He has had this stand for over 5 months now, uses it daily and it still looks brand new. Great gift for the husband!</li>
            <li> A HANDSOME SET I WAS PROUD TO GIVE AS A GIFT....GOOD SHAVE I HEARD FROM THE RECIPIENT...  GOOD CHOICE ON MY PART</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for. It was a Christmas present for my husband who is somewhat into facial hair care. The brush is not as soft a one that is made from softer animal hair, but it foams up great as well as the soap that comes with it. It is not a high quality product that can cost hundreds, it is a product my husband has used occasionally without it rusting or falling apart and is without defects. It looks good and is compact and I am extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This seems to be well-made product but it isn&#x27;t. The initial shipment included a faulty razor handle and blade which didn&#x27;t snap on the handle. Upon further inspection, we found out none of our blades attached tothe raze handle. We then reached out to the seller to replace our razor handle. Which they did. After a month of use, rusty spots started to form on the stand.  They look so awful! Quite embarrassed to have given this as a Christmas gift to my husband. Not worth the $. Amazon, please delete this item of such poor quality!</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for a little over 4 months and it has started to rust at the base.  The brush also fell out of the handle portion, so we had to super glue it back on.  Still using it now &amp; no complaints.</li>
            <li> Though I traded out the razor for one that does not require cartridges, this was half of what others were charging for similar products. That it came with soap was a plus as well.</li>
            <li> The brush that comes with this is not of the highest quality.  I already had a 100% badger brush and there is no comparison between the two.  I am guess because its bores fur rather than badger.</li>
            <li> What a piece of junk! The razor is designed all wrong and will not even hold the blade that came with it, making this whole kit completely useless. To make matters worse, I gave it as a gift for someone&#x27;s birthday, by the time they opened it the return window was closed. This is the problem with purchasesing on Amazon. Sometimes you get a completely worthless piece of junk like this razor that will not even hold a blade, and you can&#x27;t even return it for a refund... Well, we&#x27;ve had two other problems as well lately with shipping dates; when we paid extra to get an item delivered anytime for someone&#x27;s birthday it always comes a day or two late. Amazon needs to keep their promises, and also needs to not buy junk from suppliers who manufacture the stuff that does not work!</li>
            <li> Gave a set of these to each of my sons as Christmas gifts. The item is a good value and comes with soap which some others do not. Good, safe &amp; quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my groomsmen&#x27;s wedding gifts.  Comes with shave soap, which I was unaware of, but am happy about nonetheless!</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my brother in law who is a barber and he loves it! He uses it almost every day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a classy kit it makes you feel like you have a closer shave...it takes up very little space too...</li>
            <li> I really like this mini barber set....</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was the only reasonably priced set that included the brush, cup, razor and stand AND it all fit together in a very small footprint (my sink space is very limited). Being able to hang the soap cup on the stand reduced the total counter space allotment by about half - brilliant!  Once I ran out of the Mach 3 razor blades that came with it I replaced the razor with a Dorco six blade razor (half the cost, twice the blades!), and still intend to replace the Dorco with a safety razor soon to reduce my cost/carbon footprint even further.  This little set made it all possible by keeping everything in a tight little package and keeping my counter space clear.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift and the person that received it seems to like it...</li>
            <li> Bought it for my son for Christmas....he loves it. works for him just as he hoped it would, and looks great on our bathroom counter!!</li>
            <li> good great good great it is very good and great and cheap and good looking and priced correctly with great service included</li>
            <li> This set is made of very high quality metal. The razor and brush are heavy. Be sure to buy replacement razors, it only comes with one. You can use Gillette Mach 3 razor cartridges and it fits perfectly on the handle and they are cheaper than Fusion. Fusion cartridges don&#x27;t fit. I purchased a shave cream warmer and that along with this set makes me feel like I get a barber shop quality shave every day. Well worth purchasing, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I was generally satisfied with the quality of the stand, brush, and soap--however, when I opened up the razor (advertised as NEW) there was a HAIR stuck in between the blades.     Not even a long hair from someone&#x27;s head that might have fallen into the packaging--a FACIAL hair that suggests that the blade was previously used before it was sent to me. I was incredibly shocked and disgusted when I found it; it made me feel like the blade was unsanitary and unsafe for use.     Just a word of caution for those thinking about buying this item. I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything from them again.</li>
            <li> start getting  rusty  as soon as get in contact with water</li>
            <li> Would have been a nice item but it was missing the shaving brush. Very disappointed it was a Father&#x27;s Day gift for my husband. Not purchasing again. So annoyed.</li>
            <li> great Father of the Bride &amp; Groom gift!  we gave one to each of our fathers for our wedding and they both loved it!</li>
            <li> Nicely made and looks great. Hubby not a fan of the soap. He prefers cream.</li>
            <li> Razor broke and won&#x27;t hold a blade anymore.</li>
            <li> It look nice! Didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it because the blade wouldn&#x27;t stay on. I returned it  for another..... That one was broken also....... Got hassled about wanting to return. Great disappointment!</li>
            <li> The brush quality is no good, other than that its a rather charming little set to look at. But who wants to use a a rough, frayed out brush?</li>
            <li> I purchased this set for my boyfriend. He likes it but the razor refill that it came with was very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;So when it didn&#x27;t fit in the razor we assumed it was broken.after spending $25.00 on new refills&lt;br /&gt;we discovered the razor itself is broke.</li>
            <li> Bough this recently for my boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;Still deciding if i&#x27;ll return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was good and came on time.&lt;br /&gt;However the brush was broke and i had to glue it back together.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly the blade doesn&#x27;t stay on the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe i got a faulty one, but it was a gift, so over it was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  I wish it came with the merkur razor instead of the Mach three so I didn&#x27;t have to purchase separately.</li>
            <li> I purchased my set from eBay, but it&#x27;s identical to this one. What I love is I have a touch of the vintage with modern convenience (I use a Mach 3 razor and did not want to give up shaving that that style instrument.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make no mistake: this is a low end set that will introduce you to the joys of wet shaving or as a part of a daily ritual. I purchased it for the latter use because I am retired and wanted to slow things down, including my morning shave. Another part is I love the smell and feel of [[ASIN:B001OMVB38 Col. Conk Bay Rum Shaving Soap]] and this set was a perfect excuse to ditch the gel I had been using and switch to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At some point I will probably replace the brush, which is adequate, but frankly detracts from the overall experience. I would kill to have the brush I owned in the 1960s, but that is long lost. But the bottom line is this set was a relatively inexpensive way to get me back into wet shaving without giving up my favorite razor, and for that I&#x27;ll overlook the warts and give it five stars. If you are already a wet shaver pass this one by. If you are exploring it, though, this is a good way to start. I had looked at other inexpensive sets on the market and this is the best of them (some were pure junk.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am pleased with this set and am actually enjoying shaving each morning. That makes it worthwhile and a value.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. My mom got this for me for my birthday, and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. The soap smells good, and the set looks very nice. It&#x27;s a year and a half later: I don&#x27;t use anything but the razor. I can&#x27;t put the dish on the stand because as soon as the soap dries, it falls out of the dish. The brush isn&#x27;t very comfortable, but I will use both thee brush and the soap on very special occasions or when I am very bored. My suggestion is to save your money for a set that will be worth it, because this one isn&#x27;t a quality set.</li>
            <li> This product looks and works great. I finally figured out what the bowl is for. The bowls intended use is for the included shave soap, though once the soap is placed in the bowl it is no longer possible to hang on the little hook. Hence gravity wont allow that soap to stay in the bowl, i place the soap in a separate old spice shave soap bowl. Maybe I haven&#x27;t really figured it out, but i just place hot water in the included bowl to clean the razor. If you don&#x27;t have a another bowl to use for the soap just use cream and pretend to be fancy.</li>
            <li> I must compliment the Koenig Company. A few weeks ago I purchased this product, the other day I noticed on the brush hook some rust. At first I thought I&#x27;d been ripped off. Yesterday I called the company. And explained my problem with their product, The customer service women asked if she could put me on hold for a minute. After returning, she apologized for my problem, saying I&#x27;m going to send you a new one. I was amazed at the Customer Service response.</li>
            <li> I am so amazed at the quality of this product. I did not expect this product to feel very heavy and sturdy.  Overall I am very satisfied and this is going to make a great gift for my father as he used to have something very similar to this.</li>
            <li> Good quality all around. Nice, heavy feel to the razor, very high quality brush, rack arrangement is functional and takes little space. A very good unit all around - very pleased.</li>
            <li> The soap and the shaver are great but the shave brush is horrible.  Every time I have used it for the last two weeks it has lost at least 10 to 15 hairs each time.</li>
            <li> The brush already broke!  The bowl has already turned black.  The razor is bad quality.  This product is very poor for the money.  I would not recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> The razor hanger will definitely drop the razor. If the razor falls far enough, the plastic bit that attaches the razor heads will break. Then you will have a pretty and wonderfully hefty handle that is useless, just like I do. Regardless, I like this product as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor handle is (was) very nice, though, and it accepts Gillette Mach 3 heads just fine. I was planning on ditching Gillette, so the loss of the handle isn&#x27;t a huge blow to me, but it is (was) a nice handle and I&#x27;m sad that it met its end by simply falling off my counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush seems to definitely be mediocre, but it&#x27;s definitely enough to get me started. It lost a lot of bristles the first two usages, but that seems to have evened out. The brush also feels a little softer after a few uses. It does a good job applying lather and not irritating my face, though, and that&#x27;s all I really need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap bowl would be nicer if it had a cap. I mean, I use it as a soap bowl, I think it&#x27;s actually just supposed to be a lather bowl (hence the ability to hang it from the stand), but the soap they send with it is a puck soap, and where the heck else are you going to keep it if this is your starter set? Still, it fits the soap and is easy to hold and build up a lather in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand itself is good for the bowl and the brush. I can get a razor to stay in it if I position it so that it is pointing away from the stand (as opposed to towards it like it is in the picture of the product) and make sure it isn&#x27;t wiggling or moving when I put it down. Overall, not sure I recommend using that part of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap they send seems okay. First wetshaving soap for me, but it&#x27;s smell isn&#x27;t too strong, it builds lather okay, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, everything in this is kind of &amp;#34;meh,&amp;#34; but I wanted a quick, cheap, and easy way to try wet shaving and this product did everything perfectly for that. I plan to continue using the brush,stand, and bowl for a while yet, and the soap for as long as it lasts me. Eventually I may replace it all, but for now, I do like it.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Way better than using a messy cold can of shaving creme.</li>
            <li> Brush broke after a few months. Bowl shows rust.</li>
            <li> Shave brush fell apart after 2 week of use.  Razor was broken upon delivery</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas to go with his Merkur.  It&#x27;s heavy and looks good.  The razor that comes with it is silly, but I couldn&#x27;t get the set without the razor, so it is what it is.  UPDATE:   About a year after buying this, the set in general has held up very well with one exception.  The shave brush bristles don&#x27;t stay in.  We have since had to order a different brush.</li>
            <li> My brother-jin-law is going to love this.  Can&#x27;t wait to give it to him for Christmas.</li>
            <li> The stand is staind and rusted but still works</li>
            <li> Thought I was purchasing a safety razor set - not a disposable razor set. Would never have paid this much for the set if I&#x27;d noticed it was not a safety razor :(  And - the soap that came with the set - seriously STINKY :P  Smelled like K-Mart bathroom toilet deodorizer cakes.</li>
            <li> I like it however I did think it was sterling silver and not silver plated which I did not see in the advertisement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really happy with the brush, but it&#x27;s ok otherwise.</li>
            <li> Its a nice shaving kit but the replaceable head won&#x27;t stay on. I have tried, even went and purchased replacement blades and they won&#x27;t stay on either. It seems to me that the part where the blade attaches is to thin compared to the razor head. Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> For those of you wondering, &amp;#34;will it fit my razor?&amp;#34; rest assured: it will.  So long as your razor looks like a capital-T and it isn&#x27;t a foot long or something, the stand will hold it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little metal cup is great (what more can you say about a little metal cup?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are holding up after about 20 or so shaves, feels great on the face, doesn&#x27;t explode or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great set!</li>
            <li> All the pieces are quality and look quality nice sitting my bathroom. The blade it comes with is a legit mach 3 blade so no complaints there.</li>
            <li> looks good and works great. Soap stays in bowl went soaked in water.Had for 2 mos. and still love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my fiancee. He absolutely loves it. WE love the style as it&#x27;s appearance is Vintage looking and the brush is super soft. We use Mach III razors. It&#x27;s very well made and has no rust, the razor itself is heavy and the whole set is very good quality. I would definitely recommend this for any man in your life.</li>
            <li> It works, the bowl doesn&#x27;t hold heat</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected. The brush is weighted and fits well in the hand, shaver nice and long and the bowl is great and easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;Love it&lt;br /&gt;would recomend it</li>
            <li> Razor blade detached from razor half way through first shave and was rendered useless. Returning products.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery but the handle doesn&#x27;t fit my blades</li>
            <li> Great for starters, I don&#x27;t know about pros. I actually purchased him a fancy razor too but he prefers this one. Loves the brush!&lt;br /&gt;Only critique is the base of the holder doesn&#x27;t leave room for the cup to fit under the brush as it&#x27;s drip-drying. If you use the cup for soap you aren&#x27;t going to hang it, you&#x27;ll want it sitting under the brush but the base makes it awkward.&lt;br /&gt;Very sturdy and stays looking nice, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the shave set, But after a month it started to turn. I think it should be made with a material that will not tarnish, no rust. I like the fact that the razor can be changed to something sold in the store, like gillette.</li>
            <li> Using this product is the equivalent of drawing a nice bath, lighting some candles, drizzling some rose pedals, and having some Enya whispering in the background.  Are you going to get a closer, smoother shave?  Probably not. Is it going to help remind yourself that you too can be a knightly high society gentleman? It&#x27;s a start.</li>
            <li> This review is in reference to the brush and shave mug included in the set. The cartridge razor was never used, since the purpose of buying this stuff was to get away from buying expensive cartridges every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave mug: Thin metal that does not retain heat. If you like a cold or lukewarm lather, you&#x27;ll be fine. If you like the hot lather that a traditional wet-shave promises, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush: knot separated from the handle within  shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I essentially threw away my money on this; an elegant-looking shave set that actually makes it more difficult to get a good DE shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a surprise for my husband since he had just invested in new shaving cream, pre shave, &amp; after shave, &amp; he loved it. It&#x27;s the perfect organizer &amp; helps to de-clutter his side. It is very well made &amp; looks nice on the counter.</li>
            <li> excellent quality - allyour shaving needs in one convenient stand</li>
            <li> Vintage look with modern convenience of fitting the mach 3 razor blade heads. Wanted metal because ceramic or glass cups chip or break. This is a nice qualiTy set</li>
            <li> Excellent, polite customer service and very speedy processing. This product received is exactly as pictured. I am pleased. Will order again from these nice people.</li>
            <li> Bought as gift and was a little disappointed with the quality.  For the price, I was expecting better quality. Plan to get it engraved unless I can find a nicer set.</li>
