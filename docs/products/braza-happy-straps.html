            <li>These straps have been absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>They work perfectly for keeping my bra straps together so that they don&#x27;t show  when wearing a tank top.</li>
            <li>This is so wonderful and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>GOOD</li>
            <li>The idea is good</li>
            <li>The idea is a good one, but needs the mechanics tweeked a bit.</li>
            <li>Perfect fit.</li>

            <li>Very satisfied customer</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>The product does a very good job, once it is on, but if I didn&#x27;t have help to put in on initially, I would not be very happy.  </li>
            <li>I love these!  </li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>Love these straps!  </li>
            <li>This is comfortable, works perfectly and a much more cost effective solution than buying a bunch of racerback bras (my alternative).  </li>
            <li>It would also be nice if one could purchase, say,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product is nice and was delivered as promised.</li>
            <li>As an older and heavier person, the  plastic bra strap holders did not work,but these are perfect.  </li>
            <li>bra straps very easy.  </li>
            <li>Excellent service and a great little product!</li>
            <li>They feel very comfortable when being used too.</li>
            <li>But if you have a helper, I definitely recommend Happy Straps!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than my straps falling.</li>
            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>These are very inexpensive and work great.</li>
            <li>Be sure to put them below the length adjuster on your bra.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>They are laundry safe too.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>one problem with this product, I cannot close this strap myself, I either have to tell my husband to hook my bra or have to wear it from the top.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>Will purchase more.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Stays in place all day and you won&#x27;t even feel like you have it on :)</li>
            <li>Received on time and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found these!&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Works ok.  </li>
            <li>I love it that they keep your straps from falling off your shoulders.</li>
            <li>the greatest invention of all time for people with low shoulders.  </li>
            <li>but it takes a bit of fitting to figure that out.  </li>
            <li>but, it needs a better way to clip.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re ok but weren&#x27;t what I needed.</li>
            <li>No need for special fitting bra&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>Colors are very good covering major colors of bras.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s VERY comfortable and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on, very comfortable, they stay hooked, and they keep my straps in place.</li>
            <li>So, in regard to putting on the bra with the Happy Straps, I set the bra on the bed face down unhooked, add the Happy Straps (higher on the bra straps), lift it up by the top of the bra straps, put my arms through the bra straps, and slide the bra over my head like I&#x27;m putting on a t-shirt, then hook the bra.  </li>
            <li>know some people struggled with getting the bra and strap on, but it&#x27;s easy once you know how.  </li>
            <li>Affixes easily.</li>
            <li>You do NOT need another person to help you (though that&#x27;s fine, too).</li>
            <li>I very much recommend these!!</li>
            <li>It seemed to make my bra fit better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quite comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The process went smoothly.  </li>
            <li>so they can fit wider bra straps.</li>
            <li>Comfortable.  </li>
            <li>They were cheap and they did not work.  </li>
            <li>Works but doesn&#x27;t leave a smooth line underneath your blouse or shirt.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit any bra I have.</li>
            <li>they are comfortable.</li>
            <li>but it is comfortable.</li>
            <li>The strap holders hold bra straps in place and are comfortable.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try these.</li>
            <li>For smaller people it is most likely perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend much on these straps!</li>
            <li>Not sure I like the Happy Straps!  </li>
            <li>You do have to get use to putting your bra on over your head, but well worth it!</li>
            <li>This is a great idea, but they are very hard to put on by yourself, and they pop off real easily.</li>
            <li>This is a great idea for slipping straps.  </li>
            <li>so I got the large, and they fit just right without pulling my straps too close together that they would show through the top neckline of my blouses.</li>
            <li>If you use them the correct way they will stay on whole day:)</li>
            <li>And I needed a quick fix for the bras I was wearing.</li>
            <li>The Happy Strap wraps around the bra strap instead of clipping to it - so it slides up and down instead of staying in place</li>
            <li>Braza Happy Straps keep my bra straps from falling down.</li>
            <li>Very simple but yet effective.</li>
            <li>Completely worth it</li>
            <li>Finally a good answer to my slipping bra straps.  </li>
            <li>So simple and yet so effective.</li>
            <li>but when it stays connected it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>After years of trying to casually &amp;#34;fix myself&amp;#34; reaching into my shirt to pull up my bra straps, I am thrilled to say I am not doing that any more!!  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just not working them right.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re exactly what I ordered, and it&#x27;s so nice not to have to keep pulling my bra straps back in place.</li>
            <li>Took me a few days to figure out the best way to put bra on after these were in place, but finally got it.  </li>
            <li>What a great invention and a terrific bargain for the low price.</li>
            <li>Only con is that i really thought i was grtting two packages to that would have been nice.</li>
            <li>You do have to strap it on first before putting on the bras</li>
            <li>I can not believe that no one left a review that stated the fact that when this is attached to your bra strap it bunches up the bra strap and you can a lump sticking out under the fabric of your top dress, t-shirt or</li>
            <li>/&gt;Keeps my bra straps exactly where they should be!&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>MUCH better than constantly having the straps fall over my arms.  </li>
            <li>FYI, I am a 34C and purchased the large.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s within reach, and once my bra is on, slide it up to where it&#x27;s comfortable on my back</li>
            <li>These really work.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend. !</li>
            <li>Thanks to you for having this online.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>This thing is supposed to wrap around your bra strap and clip onto itself, so the clip only need to fit the width of itself, not your bra straps.</li>
            <li>These work really well for hiding straps.</li>
            <li>Too much hassle to get the bra on.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>These straps work really well.</li>
            <li>I hesitated about buying this item, thought maybe it would be bothersome  but much to my surprise</li>
            <li>I had no idea whether it would really &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; or not, but it did and does, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>It would cost as much to return them as I paid for them, so I will not be returning the order.</li>
            <li>The ones made from elastic works better than the clear one made from a different material.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I was looking for...work so great on keeping my bra straps from slipping down all the time...</li>
            <li>My bra straps finally stay in place the whole day!!!</li>
            <li>I love the straps, I just don&#x27;t understand why the made the clear one twice as long.  </li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly after ordered, and was pleasantly surprised that the order included 2 clear strap holders.  </li>
            <li>they do tend to slide up the straps closer to the neck rather than down between the shoulders, so they&#x27;d show in a tank top.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great idea, but because the little catch is open and the top and by design under tension, it&#x27;s hard to put the bra on with them in place without one side popping off.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;:</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I love this little thing.</li>
            <li>Using a little snap might work better.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re fine under other shirts.  </li>
            <li>if you live alone or do not want to ask help getting dressed in the morning these are not for you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without these</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t recommend this solution unless you can&#x27;t afford new bras.</li>
            <li>and i cant afford to just go buy new bras.  </li>
            <li>Other reviews have mentioned that it&#x27;s hard to hook up, but I just put it on the bra straps, put my arms through the straps, and flip the Happy Strap over my head.</li>
            <li>Being a clear color you probably won&#x27;t find it!</li>
            <li>However, since I am over 50, am married and need extra support I think my front fasten days are over.</li>
            <li>but it has a clear one you can use.</li>
            <li>Came with a bonus clear strap in addition to the three colors.  </li>
            <li>The clear strap&#x27;s adjustment sides also.  </li>
            <li>Will try to figure it out soon, but so far nothing but a struggle.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for any ladies with large breasts and slipping straps!</li>
            <li>It would be a two-person performance to attach them, if a person had a bra with very narrow straps to fit the holders.</li>
            <li>As a bigger girl I had read reviews for other straps like this where woman had to hook two straps together, but I only need one of these to comfortably hold my straps in place.</li>
            <li>I have looked high and low for this product in stores, unable to find anything that I liked.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s guarantee no slipping bra strap.</li>
            <li>No slipping or sliding straps anymore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having the annoying wondering bra stap issue for years, I tried other products before but this one is by far the best one in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend the large if you are large breasted (I&#x27;m a 34DD) even if your upper torso is otherwise small.</li>
            <li>That being said, I do love them except for the useless clear plastic strap included in the package,..  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big woman, and I can reach back far enough to adjust the strap</li>
            <li>but they are still not long enough to work well.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> So, in regard to putting on the bra with the Happy Straps, I set the bra on the bed face down unhooked, add the Happy Straps (higher on the bra straps), lift it up by the top of the bra straps, put my arms through the bra straps, and slide the bra over my head like I&#x27;m putting on a t-shirt, then hook the bra.  </li>
            <li> know some people struggled with getting the bra and strap on, but it&#x27;s easy once you know how.  </li>
            <li> Affixes easily.</li>
            <li> You do NOT need another person to help you (though that&#x27;s fine, too).</li>
            <li> I very much recommend these!!</li>
            <li> It seemed to make my bra fit better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quite comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The process went smoothly.  </li>
            <li> so they can fit wider bra straps.</li>
            <li> Comfortable.  </li>
            <li> They were cheap and they did not work.  </li>
            <li> Works but doesn&#x27;t leave a smooth line underneath your blouse or shirt.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit any bra I have.</li>
            <li> they are comfortable.</li>
            <li> but it is comfortable.</li>
            <li> The strap holders hold bra straps in place and are comfortable.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try these.</li>
            <li> For smaller people it is most likely perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend much on these straps!</li>
            <li> Not sure I like the Happy Straps!  </li>
            <li> You do have to get use to putting your bra on over your head, but well worth it!</li>
            <li> This is a great idea, but they are very hard to put on by yourself, and they pop off real easily.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea for slipping straps.  </li>
            <li> so I got the large, and they fit just right without pulling my straps too close together that they would show through the top neckline of my blouses.</li>
            <li> If you use them the correct way they will stay on whole day:)</li>
            <li> And I needed a quick fix for the bras I was wearing.</li>
            <li> The Happy Strap wraps around the bra strap instead of clipping to it - so it slides up and down instead of staying in place</li>
            <li> Braza Happy Straps keep my bra straps from falling down.</li>
            <li> Very simple but yet effective.</li>
            <li> Completely worth it</li>
            <li> Finally a good answer to my slipping bra straps.  </li>
            <li> So simple and yet so effective.</li>
            <li> but when it stays connected it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> After years of trying to casually &amp;#34;fix myself&amp;#34; reaching into my shirt to pull up my bra straps, I am thrilled to say I am not doing that any more!!  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just not working them right.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re exactly what I ordered, and it&#x27;s so nice not to have to keep pulling my bra straps back in place.</li>
            <li> Took me a few days to figure out the best way to put bra on after these were in place, but finally got it.  </li>
            <li> What a great invention and a terrific bargain for the low price.</li>
            <li> Only con is that i really thought i was grtting two packages to that would have been nice.</li>
            <li> You do have to strap it on first before putting on the bras</li>
            <li> I can not believe that no one left a review that stated the fact that when this is attached to your bra strap it bunches up the bra strap and you can a lump sticking out under the fabric of your top dress, t-shirt or</li>
            <li> /&gt;Keeps my bra straps exactly where they should be!&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> MUCH better than constantly having the straps fall over my arms.  </li>
            <li> FYI, I am a 34C and purchased the large.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s within reach, and once my bra is on, slide it up to where it&#x27;s comfortable on my back</li>
            <li> These really work.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend. !</li>
            <li> Thanks to you for having this online.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> This thing is supposed to wrap around your bra strap and clip onto itself, so the clip only need to fit the width of itself, not your bra straps.</li>
            <li> These work really well for hiding straps.</li>
            <li> Too much hassle to get the bra on.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> These straps work really well.</li>
            <li> I hesitated about buying this item, thought maybe it would be bothersome  but much to my surprise</li>
            <li> I had no idea whether it would really &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; or not, but it did and does, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> It would cost as much to return them as I paid for them, so I will not be returning the order.</li>
            <li> The ones made from elastic works better than the clear one made from a different material.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I was looking for...work so great on keeping my bra straps from slipping down all the time...</li>
            <li> My bra straps finally stay in place the whole day!!!</li>
            <li> I love the straps, I just don&#x27;t understand why the made the clear one twice as long.  </li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly after ordered, and was pleasantly surprised that the order included 2 clear strap holders.  </li>
            <li> they do tend to slide up the straps closer to the neck rather than down between the shoulders, so they&#x27;d show in a tank top.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea, but because the little catch is open and the top and by design under tension, it&#x27;s hard to put the bra on with them in place without one side popping off.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;:</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing.</li>
            <li> Using a little snap might work better.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re fine under other shirts.  </li>
            <li> if you live alone or do not want to ask help getting dressed in the morning these are not for you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without these</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t recommend this solution unless you can&#x27;t afford new bras.</li>
            <li> and i cant afford to just go buy new bras.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews have mentioned that it&#x27;s hard to hook up, but I just put it on the bra straps, put my arms through the straps, and flip the Happy Strap over my head.</li>
            <li> Being a clear color you probably won&#x27;t find it!</li>
            <li> However, since I am over 50, am married and need extra support I think my front fasten days are over.</li>
            <li> but it has a clear one you can use.</li>
            <li> Came with a bonus clear strap in addition to the three colors.  </li>
            <li> The clear strap&#x27;s adjustment sides also.  </li>
            <li> Will try to figure it out soon, but so far nothing but a struggle.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for any ladies with large breasts and slipping straps!</li>
            <li> It would be a two-person performance to attach them, if a person had a bra with very narrow straps to fit the holders.</li>
            <li> As a bigger girl I had read reviews for other straps like this where woman had to hook two straps together, but I only need one of these to comfortably hold my straps in place.</li>
            <li> I have looked high and low for this product in stores, unable to find anything that I liked.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s guarantee no slipping bra strap.</li>
            <li> No slipping or sliding straps anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having the annoying wondering bra stap issue for years, I tried other products before but this one is by far the best one in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend the large if you are large breasted (I&#x27;m a 34DD) even if your upper torso is otherwise small.</li>
            <li> That being said, I do love them except for the useless clear plastic strap included in the package,..  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big woman, and I can reach back far enough to adjust the strap</li>
            <li> but they are still not long enough to work well.  </li>
            <li> I have wide straps on my bras and these do not fit right.</li>
            <li> First of all if you do decide to buy this get the large because the small is way too small for anyone.  </li>
            <li> It pops off, if your not careful you will loose it.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t lay flat.  </li>
            <li> Once on, it does the job of holding my shoulder straps in, with no apparent discomfort.</li>
            <li> Saves you from having to toss out PERFECTLY good (expensive) bras when you loose a little weight and the straps start falling every hour!</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that they come loose from you</li>
            <li> This product is made for a very small bra with a narrow strap,It did not even come close to fitting my strap,I just threw them away was not worth my time to try to return it.</li>
            <li> The straps on my bras are wide so when these go on it causes the strap to &amp;#34;fold&amp;#34; and makes my back look like I have two lumps.</li>
            <li> Finally I have found a way to keep my bra straps from slipping off my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> I always had straps falling down, constantly pulling them back up!</li>
            <li> Finally, a solution for my slipping straps!  </li>
            <li> Also once a while you&#x27;ll feel the strap on your back but not too bad, definitely better than have to put up you bra strap repeatedly throughout the day and feel embarrassed</li>
            <li> 2 white, 3 tan, and 2 black instead of the pre-packaged set.  </li>
            <li> I bought those bra strap racerback clips and they are super uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> The only down side is they are a little awkward to attach, but I do love how they work.</li>
            <li> They were less substantial than I expected especially since these were the L-XL.</li>
            <li> those reviews that said the clip of this thing is too narrow to fit their bra straps, you are using it wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did have a picture but no real instructions.</li>
            <li> I have always struggled with my bra straps slipping off my rounded shoulders.</li>
            <li> They were what I expected them to be, period.</li>
            <li> I just threw those bras with slipping straps away.  </li>
            <li> These straps keep my bra straps from slipping.  </li>
            <li> I have narrow shoulders and my bra straps constantly fall off my shoulder.</li>
            <li> Solved my slipping bra strap problem!  </li>
            <li> So, unless you have someone there to help you when you&#x27;re putting on your bra in the morning, these straps are NOT very convenient!  </li>
            <li> They should have stuck with the design they made for all of the other straps.</li>
            <li> One thing I noticed is that due to the way they clip the bunch up your bra strap because they slide and tighten around it.</li>
            <li> my bra straps kept slipping down off my shoulders no matter how i adjusted them.  </li>
            <li> What I found was that the clips were unusable; i.e., impossible to secure.  </li>
            <li> I purchase all my bras from Victoria secret and i was having a problem constantly with my left strap always falling off my shoulder.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble all my life with bra straps slipping.  </li>
            <li> Slide the Braza strap up or down as you</li>
            <li> I even wear them  now  sometimes just to keep my bra straps from sliding down my arms.</li>
            <li> Once done, it does work- didn&#x27;t feel odd to me either.  </li>
            <li> I am pregnant and was struggling with horrible tension headaches on and off for weeks, I finally started wondering if the extra weight on my chest was adding to the problem.</li>
            <li> No more slipping straps.</li>
            <li> I am tall and I needed them a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little wider</li>
            <li> I regret not hunting them down sooner!  </li>
            <li> I have narrow shoulders and my straps</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money</li>
            <li> I have all size straps and even on the smallest one they do not fit.</li>
            <li> and  is too narrow for some bras.</li>
            <li> One of the past reviews indicated that the product had been previously made with snaps rather than clips and that she prefered the snaps.  </li>
            <li> After reading some other reviews I was hesitant to purchase these because people kept saying they were hard to keep connected to the straps....</li>
            <li> I have tried the hard plastic clips to hold my Bra is a raceback position, and they are either too tight, or end up breaking after one or two uses.</li>
            <li> Of course, they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do, which is keep your bra straps from slipping off your shoulders, but unless someone is there to help you adjust them, they&#x27;re pretty awkward, and often uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> They are too small for any of our bra straps.  </li>
            <li> Where the strap lies across your back is also uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> The hooks were too small for my bra straps.</li>
            <li> I have very narrow shoulders and small frame but need a DDD bra.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with keeping my straps from falling and some of the other items I have tried, seem to choke my neck and be uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to attach and does roll the bra strap</li>
            <li> Hard to put on by yourself.</li>
            <li> No More!</li>
            <li> They are not too tight that would make me uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to use them, due to the fact that I can&#x27;t reach behind myself.</li>
            <li> but the lumps were not good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about these, but was just desperate enough to try them.</li>
            <li> I have a very hard time keeping my bra straps in place.</li>
            <li> Very hard to get into.  </li>
            <li> Once you have your bra on, they are very hard to adjust.  </li>
            <li> Not attractive.</li>
            <li> Frustrating when you&#x27;re trying to dress in the morning.</li>
            <li> I was going insane every day having to constantly retrieve my bra straps from my arms over and over again.</li>
            <li> Way too difficult to use.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel uncomfortable from wearing them.</li>
            <li> Makes it a tad lumpy and uncomfortable but, it&#x27;s the plastic hook that is causing irritation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to put your bra on with it on, and very difficult to attach afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The straps work but they are too thin and the clips are annoying and impossible to adjust alone once the bra is on.</li>
            <li> Just when i was on the verge of throwing off all my bras coz of the falling straps which is quite annoying and uncomfortable, my husband found this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> One can ride up on one strap, causing it to be very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> It is very difficult make these work correctly.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay on as the clips have just slippery plastic to catch on to, and they can be very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> and I was looking forward to getting these but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the size of the straps.</li>
            <li> I hate when my bra strap falls off my shoulder.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was so excited to try these. I have very narrow shoulders and small frame but need a DDD bra. I have a very hard time keeping my bra straps in place. I saw these and it looked simple enough. WRONG&lt;br /&gt;It did have a picture but no real instructions. But I did figure it out. The problem is you can not get them on yourself. I did get my husband to hook it for me. I wore them to work. I have to admit my straps did not slip one time. It seemed to make my bra fit better.&lt;br /&gt;So the product does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;But if you live alone or do not want to ask help getting dressed in the morning these are not for you.&lt;br /&gt;I guess if you wear a front fasten bra it would work. However, since I am over 50, am married and need extra support I think my front fasten days are over. ;(</li>
            <li> The straps on my bras are wide so when these go on it causes the strap to &amp;#34;fold&amp;#34; and makes my back look like I have two lumps. Not attractive. They do hold up the straps but the lumps were not good.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about these, but was just desperate enough to try them. These straps have been absolutely amazing! I was going insane every day having to constantly retrieve my bra straps from my arms over and over again. The happy strap keeps my bra straps in place and I don&#x27;t even realize I&#x27;m wearing it. In the morning I simply slide it all the way to the bottom of the straps so it&#x27;s within reach, and once my bra is on, slide it up to where it&#x27;s comfortable on my back and it stays in place all day. Love these!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having the annoying wondering bra stap issue for years, I tried other products before but this one is by far the best one in my opinion. Very simple but yet effective. You do have to strap it on first before putting on the bras but once it&#x27;s on it&#x27;s guarantee no slipping bra strap. It does show on your back when wearing a low back cut shirt but it has a clear one you can use. Also once a while you&#x27;ll feel the strap on your back but not too bad, definitely better than have to put up you bra strap repeatedly throughout the day and feel embarrassed</li>
            <li> Works great!  Straps do not slip at all now.  The only problem is I can&#x27;t attach it by myself.  I have to enlist my husband&#x27;s help.  But if you have a helper, I definitely recommend Happy Straps!</li>
            <li> Finally found something to keep straps in place.  Quite comfortable.  Took me a few days to figure out the best way to put bra on after these were in place, but finally got it.  They&#x27;re exactly what I ordered, and it&#x27;s so nice not to have to keep pulling my bra straps back in place.</li>
            <li> These work. I am tall and I needed them a little bit longer. If it wasn&#x27;t for the length I would give perfect score. For smaller people it is most likely perfect. So because they are a tad too short there is a lump at each strap where it gathers. However I am wearing them. It&#x27;s better than my straps falling.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for any ladies with large breasts and slipping straps! I am pregnant and was struggling with horrible tension headaches on and off for weeks, I finally started wondering if the extra weight on my chest was adding to the problem. I ordered Happy Strap and I have been pain free! Never having to think about my bra straps again, and feeling a ton of extra support from this tiny strap. Can&#x27;t recommend this product enough.</li>
            <li> These really work. I am not fishing for my straps anymore!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I can&#x27;t imagine why bra&#x27;s aren&#x27;t automatically sold with them. No slipping or sliding straps anymore. Love them</li>
            <li> The process went smoothly.  This product is wonderful!  I have had such a problem with any and all bra straps falling.  No More!</li>
            <li> I love this little thing. Other reviews have mentioned that it&#x27;s hard to hook up, but I just put it on the bra straps, put my arms through the straps, and flip the Happy Strap over my head. I have narrow shoulders and my straps were constantly falling off, but now I don&#x27;t have that problem. What a great invention and a terrific bargain for the low price.</li>
            <li> These are very inexpensive and work great. P</li>
            <li> Braza has changed my entire work day. I used to be miserable, pulling up that one bra strap that always fell.  There were entire brands of bra that I could not wear.  I tried clips, and shoulder grips, and pins and you name it. This works and it&#x27;s VERY comfortable and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some people struggled with getting the bra and strap on, but it&#x27;s easy once you know how.  You do NOT need another person to help you (though that&#x27;s fine, too). Here&#x27; show to do it on your own:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Put the Braza straps on as indicated by the packaging. Be sure to put them below the length adjuster on your bra.&lt;br /&gt;2. With the bra *unclasped* put your arms and head through.&lt;br /&gt;3. Lean forward and clasp your bra&lt;br /&gt;4. To adjust where the brass strap sits on your back, reach over your shoulder, using your bra strap as a guide.  Put your finger into the circle created by the Braza strap.&lt;br /&gt;5. Slide the Braza strap up or down as you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will take some practice. I got the hang of it in 5 minutes. *Completely worth it*. I&#x27;m a big woman, and I can reach back far enough to adjust the strap easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear a (40G), and the L/XL worked just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added note:  this strap is not designed to give you cleavage. It keeps your bra straps in place, and it does its job well.</li>
            <li> GOOD AT KEEPING THE BRA STRAPS IN PLACE.  I wish it was a little wider so they can fit wider bra straps.</li>
            <li> Falling bra straps have been an annoyance my entire life. I haven&#x27;t had to constantly pull up my straps since these came in. Perfect.</li>
            <li> I hate when my bra strap falls off my shoulder. Now I don&#x27;t even worry about it!</li>
            <li> These work great. No need for special fitting bra&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Best straps out there for the price!  Saves you from having to toss out PERFECTLY good (expensive) bras when you loose a little weight and the straps start falling every hour!</li>
            <li> Way too difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I love these!  Finally a good answer to my slipping bra straps.  Highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;:</li>
            <li> Perfect !!! Very satisfied customer</li>
            <li> I was unable to use them, due to the fact that I can&#x27;t reach behind myself.</li>
            <li> It is hard to attach and does roll the bra strap so it doesn&#x27;t lay flat.  It does keep the straps up though.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without these</li>
            <li> I am a 38 DD that has had to deal with bra straps that either fall or dig into my shoulders. This is so wonderful and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you thank you</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. For me this is a bra saver. I purchase all my bras from Victoria secret and i was having a problem constantly with my left strap always falling off my shoulder. Just when i was on the verge of throwing off all my bras coz of the falling straps which is quite annoying and uncomfortable, my husband found this on Amazon. Colors are very good covering major colors of bras. I ordered 2 packs of this product already. They are laundry safe too.&lt;br /&gt;Just one problem with this product, I cannot close this strap myself, I either have to tell my husband to hook my bra or have to wear it from the top. Wish there was an easier solution.</li>
            <li> So simple and yet so effective.Comfortable.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more. I wish I&#x27;d had these all summer. Highly recommend. !</li>
            <li> This product worked relatively well. You do need to connect it before you put the bra on. I did find that it disconnected with one bra but when it stays connected it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have always struggled with my bra straps slipping off my rounded shoulders. These are perfect. They keep my straps up all night long, and after the first few minutes I don&#x27;t even feel them on my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As a bigger girl I had read reviews for other straps like this where woman had to hook two straps together, but I only need one of these to comfortably hold my straps in place.</li>
            <li> These bra strap holders do not work.  They are too small for any of our bra straps.  It would be a two-person performance to attach them, if a person had a bra with very narrow straps to fit the holders.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Will purchase more.</li>
            <li> The straps work but they are too thin and the clips are annoying and impossible to adjust alone once the bra is on. Wider width and some way of padding the clips would help. I am just going to sew elastic binding onto my bras.</li>
            <li> I rate this item an A+++++.  I have always had trouble with keeping my straps from falling and some of the other items I have tried, seem to choke my neck and be uncomfortable.  Not with the Braza Happy Straps.  I am completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these things!</li>
            <li> Perfect. Just what I needed. In three colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good-quality elastic. Affixes easily. Stays in place.</li>
            <li> Solved my slipping bra strap problem!  Love them!</li>
            <li> Product works well. Only con is that i really thought i was grtting two packages to that would have been nice.</li>
            <li> Best invention. Very comfortable and easy to put on. Stays in place all day and you won&#x27;t even feel like you have it on :)</li>
            <li> One of the past reviews indicated that the product had been previously made with snaps rather than clips and that she prefered the snaps.  What I found was that the clips were unusable; i.e., impossible to secure.  I&#x27;m sorry I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Love these straps!  I&#x27;ve ordered them several times!</li>
            <li> These are great straps.  Easy to put on, very comfortable, they stay hooked, and they keep my straps in place. I&#x27;m a 38 so I got the large, and they fit just right without pulling my straps too close together that they would show through the top neckline of my blouses. Came with a bonus clear strap in addition to the three colors.  Very happy with this product.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> Received on time and I love it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> They serve their purpose to keep bra straps on the shoulders. They were what I expected them to be, period.</li>
            <li> I have looked high and low for this product in stores, unable to find anything that I liked.  Thanks to you for having this online.</li>
            <li> These work well to keep your bra straps from falling off of the shoulders.  I put it on before I put on the bra.  I put the bra on like it is a sports bra and this works great.  The ones made from elastic works better than the clear one made from a different material.</li>
            <li> My bra straps finally stay in place the whole day!!! It works really well and I don&#x27;t feel uncomfortable from wearing them. I bought those bra strap racerback clips and they are super uncomfortable to wear. Glad I found these!&lt;br /&gt;For those reviews that said the clip of this thing is too narrow to fit their bra straps, you are using it wrong. This thing is supposed to wrap around your bra strap and clip onto itself, so the clip only need to fit the width of itself, not your bra straps. If you use them the correct way they will stay on whole day:)</li>
            <li> Did not do what I thought it would. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> These work really well for hiding straps.</li>
            <li> They were cheap and they did not work.  Very hard to get into.  I think I tried them once and threw them away.</li>
            <li> I have wide straps on my bras and these do not fit right.</li>
            <li> First of all if you do decide to buy this get the large because the small is way too small for anyone.  I can not believe that no one left a review that stated the fact that when this is attached to your bra strap it bunches up the bra strap and you can a lump sticking out under the fabric of your top dress, t-shirt or whatever you are wearing.  Where the strap lies across your back is also uncomfortable.  The idea is good but it does not work well.  Would not buy these again.</li>
            <li> They were less substantial than I expected especially since these were the L-XL. Save your money and buy some 1/4&amp;#34; elastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to put your bra on with it on, and very difficult to attach afterwards.  It was a waste of money</li>
            <li> Finally, a solution for my slipping straps!  Definitely recommend the large if you are large breasted (I&#x27;m a 34DD) even if your upper torso is otherwise small.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and a great little product!</li>
            <li> Very happy with these. Worked great.</li>
            <li> forget about it.  Too much hassle to get the bra on.  I just threw those bras with slipping straps away.  Can&#x27;t recommend this solution unless you can&#x27;t afford new bras.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Once you have your bra on, they are very hard to adjust.  One can ride up on one strap, causing it to be very uncomfortable.  So, unless you have someone there to help you when you&#x27;re putting on your bra in the morning, these straps are NOT very convenient!  Of course, they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do, which is keep your bra straps from slipping off your shoulders, but unless someone is there to help you adjust them, they&#x27;re pretty awkward, and often uncomfortable.  I&#x27;m not sending them back, but I am going to try something else (like the silicone pads that hold your strap in place.)  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend much on these straps!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it wish it she saw them sooner</li>
            <li> Works ok.  Hard to put on by yourself.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea, but they are very hard to put on by yourself, and they pop off real easily.</li>
            <li> They work perfectly for keeping my bra straps together so that they don&#x27;t show  when wearing a tank top. I even wear them  now  sometimes just to keep my bra straps from sliding down my arms. They feel very comfortable when being used too.</li>
            <li> Not sure I like the Happy Straps!  Haven&#x27;t figured out how to put them on and put the bra on with them !  Will try to figure it out soon, but so far nothing but a struggle.</li>
            <li> I always had straps falling down, constantly pulling them back up! This product has saved me! You do have to get use to putting your bra on over your head, but well worth it!</li>
            <li> Works but doesn&#x27;t leave a smooth line underneath your blouse or shirt.  The idea is a good one, but needs the mechanics tweeked a bit.</li>
            <li> These straps do what they are intended to do - keep the bra straps up.  The only downfall is that they come loose from you bra straps very easy.  Maybe I&#x27;m just not working them right.</li>
            <li> I love the straps, I just don&#x27;t understand why the made the clear one twice as long.  The clear strap&#x27;s adjustment sides also.  They should have stuck with the design they made for all of the other straps.</li>
            <li> The product does a very good job, once it is on, but if I didn&#x27;t have help to put in on initially, I would not be very happy.  Once on, it does the job of holding my shoulder straps in, with no apparent discomfort.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Great packaging. Great product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> These straps work great! I love it that they keep your straps from falling off your shoulders. I haven&#x27;t had one come off since I put these on. Yay!</li>
            <li> It is very difficult make these work correctly.  Sorry that I did not read more of the reviews.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I was looking for...work so great on keeping my bra straps from slipping down all the time...a great solution to a problem...works like a dream...excellent.</li>
            <li> my bra straps kept slipping down off my shoulders no matter how i adjusted them.  endlessly annoying!  and i cant afford to just go buy new bras.  these strap holders prevent the straps from sliding off my shoulders anymore.  they do tend to slide up the straps closer to the neck rather than down between the shoulders, so they&#x27;d show in a tank top.  but they&#x27;re fine under other shirts.  i dont feel them at all when i wear them.</li>
            <li> it so helps y bra strap stay  in place !!!!!</li>
            <li> Why I didn&#x27;t order these a year ago, I don&#x27;t know!!!&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my bra straps exactly where they should be!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you and pass the ammunition.</li>
            <li> This product is made for a very small bra with a narrow strap,It did not even come close to fitting my strap,I just threw them away was not worth my time to try to return it.</li>
            <li> Finally I have found a way to keep my bra straps from slipping off my shoulders.  These straps work really well. The only down side is they are a little awkward to attach, but I do love how they work.</li>
            <li> This is comfortable, works perfectly and a much more cost effective solution than buying a bunch of racerback bras (my alternative).  FYI, I am a 34C and purchased the large.  Perfect fit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea and I was looking forward to getting these but was disappointed.They don&#x27;t fit any bra I have.I have all size straps and even on the smallest one they do not fit.</li>
            <li> I hesitated about buying this item, thought maybe it would be bothersome  but much to my surprise they are comfortable.</li>
            <li> the greatest invention of all time for people with low shoulders.  I have had trouble all my life with bra straps slipping.  These cure that. You may have to lengthen the straps on the bra as the strap tightens them in the back but it takes a bit of fitting to figure that out.  It&#x27;s also a bit different putting them on as you have to adjust the strap to the back and put the bra on over your head.  That being said, I do love them except for the useless clear plastic strap included in the package,..  They don&#x27;t stay on as the clips have just slippery plastic to catch on to, and they can be very uncomfortable.  I throw them out.  It would also be nice if one could purchase, say, 2 white, 3 tan, and 2 black instead of the pre-packaged set.  If your straps slip try this it works</li>
            <li> This solved my problem of &amp;#34;slipping bra straps&amp;#34;.  They are not too tight that would make me uncomfortable.  Actually I forget I am wearing them.</li>
            <li> It pops off, if your not careful you will loose it.  Being a clear color you probably won&#x27;t find it!</li>
            <li> I gained weight - a lot of it, and suddenly. And I needed a quick fix for the bras I was wearing. I had to add a couple of links to the width around the chest. But then, the straps began to drop off my shoulders. Imagine my delight when I found the Braza Happy Strap. I had no idea whether it would really &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; or not, but it did and does, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Not only that, but it is comfortable. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> These straps keep my bra straps from slipping.  I wish I had found them years earlier.  As an older and heavier person, the  plastic bra strap holders did not work,but these are perfect.  Having them come in two sizes worked well.  I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> The hooks were too small for my bra straps. It would cost as much to return them as I paid for them, so I will not be returning the order. I was disappointed in the size of the straps.</li>
            <li> These things are awesome!!!  I would tell everyone who complains about straps to buy this product from you!</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly after ordered, and was pleasantly surprised that the order included 2 clear strap holders.  The strap holders hold bra straps in place and are comfortable.</li>
            <li> The Happy Strap wraps around the bra strap instead of clipping to it - so it slides up and down instead of staying in place and  is too narrow for some bras.</li>
            <li> This thing works!  While they should give instructions on how to place the straps on your bra, I do like the results.  I read the reviews here and several gave &amp;#34;tips&amp;#34; on how to put the straps on, and then put your bra on.  Once done, it does work- didn&#x27;t feel odd to me either.  MUCH better than constantly having the straps fall over my arms.  It&#x27;s a keeper- recommended.</li>
            <li> These help but, the plastic hooks actually started to scratch and irritate my skin. One thing I noticed is that due to the way they clip the bunch up your bra strap because they slide and tighten around it. Makes it a tad lumpy and uncomfortable but, it&#x27;s the plastic hook that is causing irritation. Good idea but, it needs a better way to clip. I&#x27;ve tried to hook it two different ways but, both end up with the hooks scratching the skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea for slipping straps.  I ordered L but they are still not long enough to work well.  I would buy them again if you offered an XL or even XXL (up to 12 * anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is nice and was delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> Serves the purpose.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> These are GREAT!  WONDERFUL!  I regret not hunting them down sooner!  After years of trying to casually &amp;#34;fix myself&amp;#34; reaching into my shirt to pull up my bra straps, I am thrilled to say I am not doing that any more!!  My one thought was, &amp;#34;How am I going to get my bra on by myself??&amp;#34;  So, in regard to putting on the bra with the Happy Straps, I set the bra on the bed face down unhooked, add the Happy Straps (higher on the bra straps), lift it up by the top of the bra straps, put my arms through the bra straps, and slide the bra over my head like I&#x27;m putting on a t-shirt, then hook the bra.  Works great, and I can do it all by myself!  To remove, I unhook the bra, then reach across over my shoulder and unhook one side of the Happy Straps, no problem!  I very much recommend these!!</li>
            <li> These Happy Straps have been a life saver. I have narrow shoulders and my bra straps constantly fall off my shoulder. I have tried the hard plastic clips to hold my Bra is a raceback position, and they are either too tight, or end up breaking after one or two uses. However, these straps are flexible, discrete and actually keep my bra on my shoulders. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Braza Happy Straps keep my bra straps from falling down.</li>
            <li> hate them, where they loop around, it digs into my shoulder</li>
            <li> After reading some other reviews I was hesitant to purchase these because people kept saying they were hard to keep connected to the straps.... Then I got them and realized people probably weren&#x27;t hooking them properly as they are suppose to go around your bra strap and hook onto itself.  Once done like that, they work perfectly!  No more slipping straps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea, but because the little catch is open and the top and by design under tension, it&#x27;s hard to put the bra on with them in place without one side popping off. Frustrating when you&#x27;re trying to dress in the morning. Using a little snap might work better.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok but weren&#x27;t what I needed.</li>
