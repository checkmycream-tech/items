            <li>Hey Good Stuff from me in Texas and works like a charm and price is great too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good lotion and tried this after all the great reviews it got on amazon.</li>
            <li>It will leave your skin feeling refreshed and nice!</li>
            <li>Good value, good moisturizer, scent...</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good smelling lotion but very overwhelmingly patchouli.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge!!</li>
            <li>I find the vanilla scent of this lotion more relaxing than my Aveen lavender sleep lotion!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li>The smell is also amazing.</li>
            <li>Great price and huge bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be honest -</li>
            <li>The lotion is nice.  </li>
            <li>Once again the scent is really nice.</li>
            <li>The lotion was fine &amp; it felt good on my skin</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s more effective than you would think based on the feel of it.  </li>
            <li>As far as my husband is concerned, this is the best lotion ever made!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m now 30 and LOVED the ORIGINAL formula.</li>
            <li>The vanilla was my favorite smell which is no longer available for a good price here.</li>
            <li>It is very light, dries well, and smells lovely.</li>
            <li>stuff smells amazing and the bottle is huge.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is great, moisturizes very well..</li>
            <li>Love the feel</li>
            <li>I love the vanilla, leaves no oily residue.</li>
            <li>I used 2-3 pea-sized drops on each of my arms, and was able to apply it shoulder to wrist without feeling as if I&#x27;d skimped any areas.</li>
            <li>i have gotten more compliments on how i smell (sexy) and that is with no perfume, just this product.</li>
            <li>I have been buying this for several of years and it is a great value!</li>
            <li>Many reviewers love the scent.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the Vanilla</li>
            <li>I love the smell as well..</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a creamy vanilla scented body lotion to complement my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I wish it were creamier and more emollient.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>This is the best smelling vanilla scented lotion I have purchased in a long time.</li>
            <li>but it is pretty good for its think consistency.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other scents are still available here for a great &#x27;add on item&#x27; price of $6.99- great deal if you like the other smells.</li>
            <li>My skin is gaining the ability to hold moisture, feet are amazingly smooth, hands are more radiant and youthful, and I can&#x27;t wait to see my skin after using this a month.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this brand because their products work really well</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s cruelty free and works really well: good moisture, absorbs well, and not greasy.</li>
            <li>This lotion is very light,  absorbs quickly and hydrates the skin all day.</li>
            <li>a little watery but awesome scent</li>
            <li>A cosmetic store because I was looking for cruelty free and affordable.</li>
            <li>Light and soaks in well, moisturizing and exfoliating</li>
            <li>Supposedly free 2 day shipping,but turned into 3 days.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a fantastic deal for the volume.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting married in 33 days (yay!!)</li>
            <li>I normally wait a while longer to write a review but this stuff is so amazing</li>
            <li>Be aware, though, that the Vanilla scent is mostly Patchouli, not Vanilla.  </li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant - not as buttery as I wanted but still very much a solid vanilla.</li>
            <li>I was able to smell the different scents: they are all strong but interesting</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years and would most certainly recommend.</li>
            <li>This lotion leaves your skin super soft and amazingly moisturized.</li>
            <li>The scent is not offensive but very strong and I am only comfortable applying before bedtime as I feel I smell like a stripper.</li>
            <li>I find it much too strong.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to anyone who uses lotion!!!</li>
            <li>Smells so good and hydrates my very dry skin on 1st use lasted all day I subscribe for a delivery every 2 months</li>
            <li>The bottle is HUGE and I think it smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I will say though, that the bottle is HUGE and only about a dollar more than another vanilla lotion I tried that was about a quarter of the size.</li>
            <li>Although I love the fact they are taking a health conscious approach to their products ..</li>
            <li>If you have problem skin or are looking for a nice moisturizer that actually lasts, I suggest trying this.</li>
            <li>smells like a soft vanilla, not overly noticeable or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>and my skin is still soft and healthy feeling, and I can still smell the vanilla fragrance (which is noticeable but not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>but this is the first one that makes putting lotion on worth it.</li>
            <li>The new formula says: &#x27;free of sulfates, mineral oil, silicone&#x27; on the front label.</li>
            <li>Great smell and thick but quick absorbing lotion.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to give 5 stars, but could not due to the fact that I really would have liked a much stronger vanilla fragrance.</li>
            <li>I first discovered this at</li>
            <li>so you may want to smell first.</li>
            <li>I will be trying more of the Booth products in the future!!</li>
            <li>but though the vanilla butter scent lasts it is faint within an hour and smells heavenly rich like I have the money to not going around smelling like skin and human anymore, lol, but not over the top with some lingering perfum.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion</li>
            <li>Very hydrating lotion.</li>
            <li>The photo of the product here shows the original formula bottle - I&#x27;m curious if this company is still selling the original or the new formula.</li>
            <li>What I found was that the apricot scent was more dominant than any other.</li>
            <li>I have been using Aveeno for years because it isn&#x27;t oily and doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; on my skin like many other lotions do.</li>
            <li>Loved the smell and lasts a long time not only after application but the bottle in general.</li>
            <li>I did not like this particular vanilla scent, because instead of a food smell which I wanted</li>
            <li>This lotion may work great, but it is NOT healthy as the label saying \\&quot;simple, natural, trusted\\&quot; leads you to believe.  </li>
            <li>So far I really like it.</li>
            <li>In fact, this is on of the only lotions that doesn&#x27;t have my hands itching right after I apply it.</li>
            <li>but the fragrance was a little strong for me.</li>
            <li>Can you clarify if this product is the new or old formula?</li>
            <li>Clearly a matter of taste.</li>
            <li>If so-  I would buy 10 bottles of the &#x27;old&#x27; formula.</li>
            <li>I am really sensitive to scent</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and non greasy.</li>
            <li>My skin is well moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>It is not thick or greasy, and a little goes pretty far.</li>
            <li>I was paying the same price for Aveeno for little bottles (8oz) as I did for this huge bottle, and I wish I had found this sooner.</li>
            <li>However the company recently reformulated their product to be free of sulfates, mineral oil, and other potentially harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>Also, I have been told the vanilla is a good base scent for most perfumes so it won&#x27;t compete or clash with other scents.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an ingredient junkie and like to balance natural ingredients with what actually works.</li>
            <li>, it smells more like a Victoria&#x27;s Secret lotion with a perfume-y plum smell.</li>
            <li>It really is a multi-tasker, and has replaced all of my other Shea/cocoa butter body lotions.</li>
            <li>It has major exfoliants that promote cell turnover such as glycolic, lactic, malic.</li>

            <li> He uses it daily on his hands, and feet, that are rough, and dry from working all day in the arid climate we live in.</li>
            <li> It has a thick consistency; however, it goes on very light and DOES NOT clog your skin and leave a thick coat like some lotions do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottle is big and lasts a long time in Dry Climates!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t too heavy or thick.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lotion containing caffeine and this was much larger and cheaper than any other alternatives.</li>
            <li> I recently bought  the C. Booth body lotion along with two other products.</li>
            <li> Smells like a cupcake and has squashed my dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> the smell is really artificial and strong.</li>
            <li> I always keep this on hand and use it daily, year round.  </li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim after reading other comments, and I can tell you I do NOT regret it one single little bit.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since I was 15 and I&#x27;m now 30 and LOVED the ORIGINAL formula. However the company recently reformulated their product to be free of sulfates, mineral oil, and other potentially harmful ingredients. Although I love the fact they are taking a health conscious approach to their products .. Unfortunately I can no longer use this lotion as it dries out my skin like crazy. I look like I have matte scaly skin after an hour. The photo of the product here shows the original formula bottle - I&#x27;m curious if this company is still selling the original or the new formula. If so-  I would buy 10 bottles of the &#x27;old&#x27; formula. Can you clarify if this product is the new or old formula? The new formula says: &#x27;free of sulfates, mineral oil, silicone&#x27; on the front label. Thx</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be honest - I have terrible skin. Stress caused me to break out EVERYWHERE and I have scarring on my legs from that. I&#x27;m getting married in 33 days (yay!!) and about two months ago I purchased this product to start fixing my skin. I did a regimen of exfoliation at night and then applying the lotion about once a week, plus applying the lotion regularly (every day, especially before bed). This stuff is amazing. Not only does my skin stay moisturized all day (and actually, the next day, too) but my scars are definitely fading a LOT. A lot a lot. If you have problem skin or are looking for a nice moisturizer that actually lasts, I suggest trying this. The bottle is HUGE and I think it smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;Note: do not put it on your face. Yea, I tried that thinking \\&quot;I wonder\\&quot;... and I broke out. I&#x27;ve always loved this brand because their products work really well and I&#x27;m now going to try their eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Veronica @ Decorate Your Desk</li>
            <li> This lotion leaves your skin super soft and amazingly moisturized. It has a thick consistency; however, it goes on very light and DOES NOT clog your skin and leave a thick coat like some lotions do. I believe it does firm and smooths the skin&#x27;s texture...have purchased again and again and again...</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion hoping for the vanilla scent (hence the name on the bottle). What I found was that the apricot scent was more dominant than any other. This may just be my body chemistry, but I was pretty disappointed still. The lotion itself is great, moisturizes very well..the scent is very faint after about an hour of application. I really wanted to give 5 stars, but could not due to the fact that I really would have liked a much stronger vanilla fragrance. I will say though, that the bottle is HUGE and only about a dollar more than another vanilla lotion I tried that was about a quarter of the size. Good value, good moisturizer, scent...eh.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and hydrates my very dry skin on 1st use lasted all day I subscribe for a delivery every 2 months so I will never be out it I would recommend this 1</li>
            <li> I always keep this on hand and use it daily, year round.  Love the feel and my husband loves the smell.</li>
            <li> smells like a soft vanilla, not overly noticeable or overwhelming. Absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t too heavy or thick. for the price its a great deal.</li>
            <li> I love the vanilla, leaves no oily residue. 👍</li>
            <li> The lotion was fine &amp; it felt good on my skin but the fragrance was a little strong for me.</li>
            <li> I normally wait a while longer to write a review but this stuff is so amazing I had to share now. I&#x27;m an ingredient junkie and like to balance natural ingredients with what actually works. This stuff is like a miracle in a bottle for hydrating and smoothing your skin. It has major exfoliants that promote cell turnover such as glycolic, lactic, malic. It has great nurishment that your skin uses for plumping and building like almond oil, coconut oil, etc. It has caffeine that helps the appearance of cellulite and it absorbs well into the skin. On day one I thought it might not be as moisturizing as a greasy alba lotion I&#x27;d been using but bu day 5 I realized this was transforming my skin. My skin is gaining the ability to hold moisture, feet are amazingly smooth, hands are more radiant and youthful, and I can&#x27;t wait to see my skin after using this a month. I am really sensitive to scent but though the vanilla butter scent lasts it is faint within an hour and smells heavenly rich like I have the money to not going around smelling like skin and human anymore, lol, but not over the top with some lingering perfum. I have been through a lot of products expensive and not but this is the first one that makes putting lotion on worth it. I am going to buy the lemon one for the kitchen.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion: it&#x27;s cruelty free and works really well: good moisture, absorbs well, and not greasy. I first discovered this at&lt;br /&gt;U L T A cosmetic store because I was looking for cruelty free and affordable. I was able to smell the different scents: they are all strong but interesting so you may want to smell first. The vanilla was my favorite smell which is no longer available for a good price here. At $15 it&#x27;s too expensive in comparison for the 32oz. If you can, I suggest going to your closest U L T A and buying there ($9-10 for the 32oz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other scents are still available here for a great &#x27;add on item&#x27; price of $6.99- great deal if you like the other smells. I will be sticking with vanilla so I can&#x27;t order from here anymore.</li>
            <li> I have been using Aveeno for years because it isn&#x27;t oily and doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; on my skin like many other lotions do. I bought this on a whim after reading other comments, and I can tell you I do NOT regret it one single little bit. This lotion is amazing. It&#x27;s been over 12 hours since I applied it to my arms/hands and my skin is still soft and healthy feeling, and I can still smell the vanilla fragrance (which is noticeable but not overpowering at all. It&#x27;s very pleasant). I was paying the same price for Aveeno for little bottles (8oz) as I did for this huge bottle, and I wish I had found this sooner. I will never purchase anything else ever again. I should note: it takes very little to do the job! I used 2-3 pea-sized drops on each of my arms, and was able to apply it shoulder to wrist without feeling as if I&#x27;d skimped any areas. Shipping was also prompt and it was packaged well. I find the vanilla scent of this lotion more relaxing than my Aveen lavender sleep lotion! Highly recommend this to anyone who uses lotion!!!</li>
            <li> The lotion is nice.  Light and soaks in well, moisturizing and exfoliating so it&#x27;s more effective than you would think based on the feel of it.  Be aware, though, that the Vanilla scent is mostly Patchouli, not Vanilla.  It&#x27;s a good smelling lotion but very overwhelmingly patchouli.</li>
            <li> As far as my husband is concerned, this is the best lotion ever made! He uses it daily on his hands, and feet, that are rough, and dry from working all day in the arid climate we live in.</li>
            <li> Good product.Supposedly free 2 day shipping,but turned into 3 days.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing! It really is a multi-tasker, and has replaced all of my other Shea/cocoa butter body lotions. It does everything it says it does over time. It is not thick or greasy, and a little goes pretty far. I did not like this particular vanilla scent, because instead of a food smell which I wanted, it smells more like a Victoria&#x27;s Secret lotion with a perfume-y plum smell. Next time I am going to try the coconut fig, or lemon one!</li>
            <li> Wife happy with purchase!</li>
            <li> It is very light, dries well, and smells lovely. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and would most certainly recommend.</li>
            <li> Hey Good Stuff from me in Texas and works like a charm and price is great too.&lt;br /&gt;Bottle is big and lasts a long time in Dry Climates!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ron in Texas on August 23, 2015</li>
            <li> Had to return this product. It smelled nothing like vanilla..</li>
            <li> The smell is addictive, but the lotion is literally designed to suck the moisture out of your skin like the product sucks the money out of my wallet. If I wanted to dry out my skin this bad in exchange for a sweet smell, I would just dump vanilla extract all over my body.</li>
            <li> This lotion may work great, but it is NOT healthy as the label saying \\&quot;simple, natural, trusted\\&quot; leads you to believe.  PLEASE, read the ingredients!  Polyparaben? Retinyl acetate?  BHT?  Methylparaben?  Look this product up on [...].  It contains highly toxic ingredients, it is NOT good for you, or the environment, and shame on c. Booth for misleading people who are concerned about their health!</li>
            <li> I use this on my arms and legs after a shower. i have gotten more compliments on how i smell (sexy) and that is with no perfume, just this product. it also has healed my cuts on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for several of years and it is a great value! Great smell and thick but quick absorbing lotion.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating lotion. Loved the smell and lasts a long time not only after application but the bottle in general.</li>
            <li> Clearly a matter of taste. Many reviewers love the scent. I find it much too strong. Heavily perfumed.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday...I have eczema and this works wonderfully and isn&#x27;t greasy and also it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing. The smell is also amazing.</li>
            <li> a little watery but awesome scent</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  Smells awesome!</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the texture. It leaves my skin soft and non greasy.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lotion containing caffeine and this was much larger and cheaper than any other alternatives. The lotion is great and works as I hoped. I just wish they offered a non-scented option. The scent is not offensive but very strong and I am only comfortable applying before bedtime as I feel I smell like a stripper.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the Vanilla and I am a vanilla snob! I have been looking for a good lotion and tried this after all the great reviews it got on amazon. I will be trying more of the Booth products in the future!!</li>
            <li> smells horrible..couldn&#x27;t even use</li>
            <li> the smell is really artificial and strong. my mom walked by after i put it on and asked what that horrible smell was and suggested i never use it again, especially if i&#x27;m going to be around other people. enough said.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It smells really good and feels great on the skin! I&#x27;ve been using this for almost two years now. I definitely recommend it. It will leave your skin feeling refreshed and nice!</li>
            <li> I recently bought  the C. Booth body lotion along with two other products. So far I really like it. My skin is well moisturized and soft. I love the smell as well..</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling vanilla scented lotion I have purchased in a long time. I only wish it was thicker but it is pretty good for its think consistency. Once again the scent is really nice.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very light,  absorbs quickly and hydrates the skin all day. The bottle is huge!! It is well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a creamy vanilla scented body lotion to complement my favorite perfume. Also, I have been told the vanilla is a good base scent for most perfumes so it won&#x27;t compete or clash with other scents. I thought this was a fantastic deal for the volume.  The scent is pleasant - not as buttery as I wanted but still very much a solid vanilla. The texture is a bit thin to me. I wish it were creamier and more emollient. I use it as an every day body lotion.</li>
            <li> Smells like a cupcake and has squashed my dry winter skin. Great price and huge bottle. I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells amazing and the bottle is huge. I was afraid that because I have eczema on my hands this would cause them to itch and get worse but it doesn&#x27;t! In fact, this is on of the only lotions that doesn&#x27;t have my hands itching right after I apply it.</li>
