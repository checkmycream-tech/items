            <li>The best skin treatment out there.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s excellent moisturizer and delivery</li>
            <li>and this lotion does a great job of sealing in the moisture.  </li>
            <li>My lil boys skin is looking great.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to get this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Having tried so many creams this gel is by far the best.</li>
            <li>but it sits on top of the skin and never seems to sink in and moisturize.  </li>
            <li>We have been using it for more than two years now and it just does what it claims.</li>
            <li>Lovely to use too.</li>
            <li>In my opinion it works better than coconut oil.</li>

            <li>and since I loved it so much, I ordered it for my mom who&#x27;s sensative chemo-wracked skin needed something with oomph</li>
            <li>I love it most right after the shower when my skin id still damp.  </li>
            <li>It is very good for dry skin</li>
            <li>It is worth the price!</li>
            <li>I ordered this stuff first for myself as I suffer eczema</li>
            <li>In the winter, I apply a moisturizer first, and then put a layer of doublebase gel over top and it lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li>was much faster than ETA</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick</li>
            <li>It works better than any lotion I have ever used, contains no alcohol and does not dry out the skin like some other lotions do.  </li>
            <li>I have super dry skin</li>
            <li>I finally did stop singing the Super Bass song after each pump though, much to my husband&#x27;s relief.</li>
            <li>My hands were just as dry after using it a week and they were when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>Very Good,&lt;br /&gt;I am African American, I use it on my twin girls.</li>

            <li> I ordered this stuff because it was highly recommended.  However, I am disappointed in it.  It&#x27;s nice and thick and I assumed it would work well but it sits on top of the skin and never seems to sink in and moisturize.  I slathered it on at night and when I washed my hands in the morning it all washed off, never moisturized the skin at all.  Very strange, just sits on the skin like a glove.  My hands were just as dry after using it a week and they were when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> I love it -it&#x27;s fantastic thank you</li>
            <li> My husband had a rash behind his ear that we&#x27;ve been trying to treat for over a year. He used this product for a week and it disappeared.</li>
            <li> WIFE&#x27;S REVIEW: My husband was totally skeptical cause this stuff looked kinda like cream cheese in a bottle. It really is strange looking. But I use it for my mild eczema and so far, it works great! It&#x27;s thick but not greasy (I&#x27;d say silky), and leaves my skin really soft. I use it mainly after washing my hands and at night before bed. I finally did stop singing the Super Bass song after each pump though, much to my husband&#x27;s relief.</li>
            <li> The best skin treatment out there. We have been using it for more than two years now and it just does what it claims.</li>
            <li> I have very fragile skin on my legs often injured and needing the attention of the district nurse who always used double base resulting in great results. Would recommend it to everyone . Lovely to use too.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I have super dry skin and this lotion does a great job of sealing in the moisture.  I love it most right after the shower when my skin id still damp.  In the winter, I apply a moisturizer first, and then put a layer of doublebase gel over top and it lasts all day long.  I always keep a few extras on hand because shipping to the USA does take a week or two and I can&#x27;t imagine going as long with out it!</li>
            <li> Works extremely well on preventing and healing extremely dry skin - I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it was for sale in the USA.</li>
            <li> I have the worst dry skin ever and this stuff works!  My sister visited me last year from England and had me try it and I got hooked.  She left her bottle with me and I have just run out.  I was thrilled to get this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very Good,&lt;br /&gt;I am African American, I use it on my twin girls. Does wonders b their skin.</li>
            <li> Helps my neurological itching due to Postherpetic Neuralgia (Shingles).</li>
            <li> I been using double base over 10 plus years. , it&#x27;s excellent moisturizer and delivery was much faster than ETA</li>
            <li> My lil boy had eczema from a week or so after birth. I was heartbroken as I knew how uncomfortable the condition can be. I was chatting with my brother recommended Doublebase gel as it has helped his wife and daughter so much &amp;#34;in fact the whole family uses it&amp;#34;. I moved from UK and couldn&#x27;t find double base in US. Very grateful for Amazon and the seller as it meant I got it quicker than expected. Having tried so many creams this gel is by far the best. My lil boys skin is looking great. I am a believer and would hight recomend it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this stuff first for myself as I suffer eczema and since I loved it so much, I ordered it for my mom who&#x27;s sensative chemo-wracked skin needed something with oomph and now SHE loves it. HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> I have reordered this product over and over again.  It works better than any lotion I have ever used, contains no alcohol and does not dry out the skin like some other lotions do.  It is worth the price!</li>
            <li> It is very good for dry skin</li>
            <li> When my baby was 1-3 months, he had eczema on his face. We tried vaseline, aquaphor, A&amp;D but none of them worked, this is the only product that healed my baby&#x27;s rashes on his face. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> If you have eczema or dry skin this product works wonders. In my opinion it works better than coconut oil.</li>
