            <li>im impressed.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful lipstick.</li>
            <li>It smells great.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have a problem with makeup changing color on you (an ongoing problem for me), this lipstick really is a great deal.</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>Smells really nice too!</li>
            <li>I prefer the color sensational lipsticks.</li>
            <li>It was just what I wanted very pleased with this product</li>
            <li>I got this in \\&quot;Never Ending Nude\\&quot; and it&#x27;s a nice color for fair skinned ladies.</li>
            <li>My favorite color ever !</li>
            <li>and it does stay on longer than most lipstick.  </li>
            <li>Okay... I like Maybelline products.</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>I used to use Lorac&#x27;s Nude moisturizing lipstick, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it.  </li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>I wear it as a day shade with a more smokey eye and loads of mascara.</li>
            <li>I have bought this lipstick, But I never used it, ok?</li>
            <li>I love how neutral it is</li>
            <li>I originally bought this shade at a CVS by my house and love it.</li>
            <li>Even love the Super Stay 24 hour lip product.</li>
            <li>Its darker than nude w some light reddish coral thing going on.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product.</li>
            <li>I try these long-lasting lipsticks whenever a new version comes out, and although this one is better than most I have used in terms of the feel of the lipstick, they still don&#x27;t quite have it when it comes to the formula.  </li>
            <li>Super moisturising lipstck.</li>
            <li>nice fruity smell, last long, good product/ quality</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned with pink undertones and darker brown hair.</li>
            <li>but this one the color wasn&#x27;t my skin tone shade, but other than that good product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice color, but on dry lips looks brighter and darker (and ages me).</li>
            <li>really lasts 8 hours!</li>
            <li>and I love that it actually stays on my lips</li>
            <li>I also love that it actually matches the color of my lips.</li>
            <li>It provides just enough color to perk up your lips but nothing overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I received it exactly when I was supposed to.</li>
            <li>kind of does that flaky thing after a few hours if you don&#x27;t have a good chapstick to &#x27;wet&#x27; it again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s somewhat drying, so I have to put clear moisturizer over it, but the color is actually \\&quot;Nude\\&quot; and it&#x27;s a nice, inexpensive lipstick.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming they did this to give the illusion of moistness, but I found it to be too much for me.  </li>
            <li>And with dryer lips, the \\&quot;Nude\\&quot; color isn&#x27;t really nude.</li>
            <li>I am a real man.</li>
            <li>I would recommend highly.</li>
            <li>Great color natural lite blush pink glossy but dosent last long have to put lip gloss under it to stay on longer</li>
            <li>It looks brand new</li>
            <li>But if things turn bright pink, red, or purple on you, be careful!</li>
            <li>This shade has some glitter in it and is just a wee a bit gritty, but doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li>I have to reapply frequently throughout the day and the shimmer is not my thing.</li>
            <li>This lipstick really does last 14 hours, and it does not dry my lips out like some others have done.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very pretty subtle shade to wear daily.</li>
            <li> A little darker than I expected, but I still really like the color</li>
            <li> I am still waiting for a truly moist and non-drying long wearing lip color that is not too sparkly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on as long as I would like...</li>
            <li> Even when you eat or drink it will not come off, plus it doesn&#x27;t dry on your lips like the other long lasting lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I am only curious about it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lipstick for two weeks now and my lips have gotten somewhat dry.</li>
            <li> so i add moisture occasionally which cuts down on its staying power.</li>
            <li> and if you let it set, it stays on for a very long time!</li>
            <li> but I doubt I&#x27;ll go out of my way to purchase other shades.</li>
            <li> Scene\\&quot; lipsticks and paid a pretty price for them, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> My lips feel a little dry.  </li>
            <li> it was a little too sparkly for me to give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> it is a little drying</li>
            <li> Epic fail Maybelline...</li>
            <li> I never did believe the 14 hour name, but I would think it would make it past 5 hours.  </li>
            <li> It has a weird cherry scent that drives me nuts, although it fades after about fifteen minutes -- not a big issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cold and dry here</li>
            <li> has a little glitter in it that isnt too annoying.</li>
            <li> sorry.</li>
            <li> The color does not stay on for 14 hours, however, the glitter in the lipstick does which is annoying.</li>
            <li> This is a very ugly color with sparkles.</li>
            <li> I tried four others (including an awful stick-lipstick by Lorac) before coming across this.  </li>

            <li> Great color natural lite blush pink glossy but dosent last long have to put lip gloss under it to stay on longer</li>
            <li> I try these long-lasting lipsticks whenever a new version comes out, and although this one is better than most I have used in terms of the feel of the lipstick, they still don&#x27;t quite have it when it comes to the formula.  I put this on this morning at 8:00.  It is now 12:30 and there is almost none of the color left on my lips.  I did not eat and only drank tea.  My lips feel a little dry.  I never did believe the 14 hour name, but I would think it would make it past 5 hours.  I think the biggest problem I have with the product is that they have put quite a bit of \\&quot;frosted flakes\\&quot; in the color.  I&#x27;m assuming they did this to give the illusion of moistness, but I found it to be too much for me.  I am still waiting for a truly moist and non-drying long wearing lip color that is not too sparkly.</li>
            <li> nice fruity smell, last long, good product/ quality I would definitely order another one hopefully the color that i&#x27;m looking for</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on as long as I would like...kind of does that flaky thing after a few hours if you don&#x27;t have a good chapstick to &#x27;wet&#x27; it again.</li>
            <li> A little darker than I expected, but I still really like the color and it does stay on longer than most lipstick.  The only way I could see it lasting 14 hours, however, is if you didn&#x27;t eat all day!</li>
            <li> It smells great. The color does not stay on for 14 hours, however, the glitter in the lipstick does which is annoying. I can do without the glitter.</li>
            <li> I got this in \\&quot;Never Ending Nude\\&quot; and it&#x27;s a nice color for fair skinned ladies. It doesn&#x27;t wash out my complexion like some nudes do. This shade has some glitter in it and is just a wee a bit gritty, but doesn&#x27;t really bother me. I usually apply lip balm first. It is a matte finish and it doesn&#x27;t bleed. It does stay on for a while, but of course not for 14 hours. I like it but I doubt I&#x27;ll go out of my way to purchase other shades. I prefer the color sensational lipsticks.</li>
            <li> To glittery and does not have staying power. I have to reapply frequently throughout the day and the shimmer is not my thing.</li>
            <li> It looks brand new but I wonder why it wasn&#x27;t sealed around the cap</li>
            <li> Okay... I like Maybelline products. Even love the Super Stay 24 hour lip product. But this lipstick? It comes off on everything... there is no \\&quot;stay\\&quot; to it. 14 hours? Not even 30 minutes. Epic fail Maybelline... sorry.</li>
            <li> My favorite color ever !</li>
            <li> I love it!! I love the color and I love that it actually stays on my lips, I just wish it wouldn&#x27;t stain a cup every time I&#x27;m drinking something. I also love that it actually matches the color of my lips. No one could tell whether I&#x27;m wearing it or not and I like that.</li>
            <li> I used to use Lorac&#x27;s Nude moisturizing lipstick, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it.  I tried four others (including an awful stick-lipstick by Lorac) before coming across this.  It&#x27;s somewhat drying, so I have to put clear moisturizer over it, but the color is actually \\&quot;Nude\\&quot; and it&#x27;s a nice, inexpensive lipstick.  One thing:  It has a weird cherry scent that drives me nuts, although it fades after about fifteen minutes -- not a big issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve used this lipstick for two weeks now and my lips have gotten somewhat dry. This isn&#x27;t the fault of the lipstick ... it&#x27;s cold and dry here and this happens to me every year. And with dryer lips, the \\&quot;Nude\\&quot; color isn&#x27;t really nude. It&#x27;s a nice color, but on dry lips looks brighter and darker (and ages me). I&#x27;ve searched the web and found three Lorac \\&quot;Nude Scene\\&quot; lipsticks and paid a pretty price for them, unfortunately. If you don&#x27;t have a problem with makeup changing color on you (an ongoing problem for me), this lipstick really is a great deal. But if things turn bright pink, red, or purple on you, be careful! (I hope this helps someone.)</li>
            <li> Super moisturising lipstck. Love the color.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this shade at a CVS by my house and love it. I am fair skinned with pink undertones and darker brown hair. It provides just enough color to perk up your lips but nothing overwhelming. I wear it as a day shade with a more smokey eye and loads of mascara. Will be purchasing my replacements from amazon from now on as it is the cheapest I have found.</li>
            <li> This lipstick really does last 14 hours, and it does not dry my lips out like some others have done.  I like the color, too.</li>
            <li> Im giving up on ordering makeup through Amazon. There&#x27;s just no way this color should be called nude. Its darker than nude w some light reddish coral thing going on. Thats not nude to me. I already had a color like this that I didnt like on me. So sucky that we have an idea of what the color nude is to us and the manufacturer has different ideas.</li>
            <li> I have bought this lipstick, But I never used it, ok? I am a real man. A macho man! I am only curious about it!</li>
            <li> This is such a great product. I love how neutral it is and if you let it set, it stays on for a very long time!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy! This is a very ugly color with sparkles. Eewwh!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful lipstick. I received it exactly when I was supposed to. It was just what I wanted very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> Very pretty subtle shade to wear daily. Smells really nice too!</li>
