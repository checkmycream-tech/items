            <li>But i ended up loving it.</li>

            <li>The touch of spice looks nothing like the picture, waaayyy darker but its cute</li>
            <li>I love the color and the texture.</li>
            <li>also I think its a type of Marsala color, which is the color of the year 2015 &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>and I LOVE this lipstick.  </li>
            <li>I just wish there were more to choose from.</li>
            <li>So since I loved the first lipstick that I got &amp;#34;touch of spice&amp;#34;, I decided to buy another color in &amp;#34;lust for blush&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Perfect shade of pink.</li>
            <li>The colors slide easily onto the lips.</li>
            <li>Came home in a huge box for a lipstick.</li>
            <li>I love this color as well, its a very beautiful pink color, it kind of has a romantic look to it.  </li>
            <li>Full color coverage, very mildly drying, long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>Great pigmentation and lasts long time.</li>
            <li>The formula is great for long wear.</li>
            <li>But it looks so beautiful, not too dark not too light.  </li>
            <li>I came back and ordered 4 more, as I loved this color so much to share with my family and backup for myself.</li>
            <li>Make sure that your lips are very moisturized and exfoliated before wearing.</li>
            <li>Again, great lipstick but not true to color.</li>
            <li>As I expected I love this product, some much that it is one of my favorite lipstick now!</li>
            <li>Such an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Only thing is it kind of,</li>
            <li>This lipstick has a very rich yet natural color.</li>
            <li>They are my first experiences with matte colors</li>
            <li>This is actually my first Maybelline product</li>
            <li>The color is very pigmented, the texture is very smooth, it does not leave my lips dry</li>
            <li>Does not tend to dry out my lips over the course of a day like many of them do.</li>
            <li>Color is not what I expected, much more intense than online photo.</li>
            <li>I really like the consistency of this lipstick a lot - it goes on creamy and leaves lips feeling silky without being sticky.</li>
            <li>and I found I really like them.</li>
            <li>This lipstick can be applied to your face very well.</li>
            <li>All of them wear well and are very creamy.</li>
            <li>It is rich, creamy smooth with a matte appearance, but that&#x27;s where any similarity to a traditional dry, lips are flaking and parched, matte end.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally buy drugstore brand cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>I took off one star for being mildly drying and the darker than expected color.</li>
            <li>Soft matte.</li>
            <li>And definitely you can&#x27;t beat the price in Amazon so much cheaper than in stores.</li>
            <li>This lipstick is satin to matte but blots completely matte.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very matte, and does last all day.</li>
            <li>I have to say I am extremely surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars if it was all natural and if it was not tasted on animals.  </li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>I recommend wearing with a lipliner and adding powder for a great matte lip which I&#x27;m obsessed with!</li>
            <li>At first i thought touch of spice would be a color too dark for me.</li>
            <li>It stays for hours and it does not dry out my lips, which was the biggest surprise of all.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> To think I was gonna spend $19 on Gerard cosmetics 1995 lipstick. *rolls eyes* This is a great dupe for that! I recommend wearing with a lipliner and adding powder for a great matte lip which I&#x27;m obsessed with! It reminds me of the popular lip color that kylie Jenner wears. It&#x27;s also great for all skin tones! So glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love woth this. It is amazing. Only thing is it kind of, i dunno, balls up or something</li>
            <li> Creamy texture is good. Color is not what I expected, much more intense than online photo.</li>
            <li> Very nice color. Came intact. My go to lipstick. And not drying.</li>
            <li> Perfect shade of pink. Soft matte. Not too dry.</li>
            <li> The title of my review is the truth of it. This formula is not a matte that I have ever encountered. It is rich, creamy smooth with a matte appearance, but that&#x27;s where any similarity to a traditional dry, lips are flaking and parched, matte end. The color I chose is a Touch of Spice. it wears fairly well, and I don&#x27;t dread reapplying, since its texture is so lovely. I came back and ordered 4 more, as I loved this color so much to share with my family and backup for myself. And definitely you can&#x27;t beat the price in Amazon so much cheaper than in stores.</li>
            <li> I loved it but the lipstick was damaged :(</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick hence ordered one for my sister as well! :)</li>
            <li> Total dupe for Gerard cosmetics 1995. But I actually prefer this over it. Much better deal IMO!</li>
            <li> This lipstick has a very rich yet natural color. I use it on a day to day basis. It is a matte lipstick, yet it moisturizes your lips to prevent them from being chapped.</li>
            <li> Full color coverage, very mildly drying, long-lasting.  This lipstick is satin to matte but blots completely matte.  I like to blot my lipstick to prevent it getting to my teeth and feathering.  It applies very smoothly.  I took off one star for being mildly drying and the darker than expected color.</li>
            <li> Love it!!, the color was a bit stronger than espected, but beautiful, I applied an even when is vanish my lips are still pinkish and I love that!,</li>
            <li> Great lipstick, great color.</li>
            <li> Touch of spice goes with anything.  Great pigmentation and lasts long time.</li>
            <li> At first i thought touch of spice would be a color too dark for me. But i ended up loving it. Honestly a great product, its very smooth &amp; all.</li>
            <li> I really like the consistency of this lipstick a lot - it goes on creamy and leaves lips feeling silky without being sticky. Does not tend to dry out my lips over the course of a day like many of them do. BUT, this is the second color I have ordered, and I have to say that the colors are WAY darker than they appear online. But the product itself is great, and luckily I have liked the colors on me even though they are not what I thought I was ordering. They are my first experiences with matte colors and I found I really like them. Again, great lipstick but not true to color.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best lipsticks I&#x27;ve ever used! I love it!!! The matte finish is really pretty on everyone and it stays in place amazingly well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this ! Use it everyday !</li>
            <li> Shame on you Maybelline for not selling this collection here in France, I had to order this product from the US because I was hearing amazing reviews about it ! The color is very pigmented, the texture is very smooth, it does not leave my lips dry and it&#x27;s a beautiful color all together. I will buy again !</li>
            <li> beautiful color. good staying power</li>
            <li> The touch of spice looks nothing like the picture, waaayyy darker but its cute so that&#x27;s why I gave 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I love the color and the texture. I bought it coz I had already tried it before. Will buy it again when it ends. I just wish it had been delivered in a proper sized box by amazon. Came home in a huge box for a lipstick.</li>
            <li> Great color for fall/winter!</li>
            <li> I loved the color and the product! Very satisfied! :)</li>
            <li> This is a perfect color for right now, the trend is this kylie jenner lip color, it lasts all day also I think its a type of Marsala color, which is the color of the year 2015 &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Great color and applies smoothly.</li>
            <li> Touch of Spice is quite a deep and dark color. It&#x27;s very matte, and does last all day. Though, it is rather drying. Make sure that your lips are very moisturized and exfoliated before wearing. Sometimes I use a lip brush, and use this color just for lining my lips. The formula is great for long wear. It has a slight fragrance, which might be irritating to sensitive groups.</li>
            <li> This lipstick can be applied to your face very well.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and moisturizing finish but I only rated it a 4 because I have to keep reapplying. I&#x27;m afraid I am addicted to lip stains and long lasting formulas even though they can be drying.</li>
            <li> Such an amazing product. I have the shades: Touch of Spice, Divine Wine, Daringly Nude, and Lust For Blush. All of them wear well and are very creamy. The colors slide easily onto the lips. Best matte lipstick line that I have tried. The best part is that it is from the drugstore!</li>
            <li> As I expected I love this product, some much that it is one of my favorite lipstick now!</li>
            <li> I have to say I am extremely surprised by this product.  I don&#x27;t normally buy drugstore brand cosmetics.  This is actually my first Maybelline product and I LOVE this lipstick.  I got &amp;#34;touch of spice&amp;#34; shade, it is darker then it looks on the picture.  But it looks so beautiful, not too dark not too light.  It stays for hours and it does not dry out my lips, which was the biggest surprise of all.  I might even try a different color.  I would give it 5 stars if it was all natural and if it was not tasted on animals.  UPDATE.  So since I loved the first lipstick that I got &amp;#34;touch of spice&amp;#34;, I decided to buy another color in &amp;#34;lust for blush&amp;#34;.  WOW I love this color as well, its a very beautiful pink color, it kind of has a romantic look to it.  So happy I found out about these lipsticks.  Very likely I would get another color.  I just wish there were more to choose from.</li>
