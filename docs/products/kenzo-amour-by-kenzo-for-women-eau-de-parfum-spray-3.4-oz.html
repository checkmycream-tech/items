            <li>I love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>Unlike many out there that would knock me out of my socks just to get a wind</li>
            <li>I LOVE this scent.</li>
            <li>Favorite.</li>
            <li>Love ,love ,love this fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>For some reason I cannot wear most perfumes.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume but this was not my perfume, I got a refund.</li>
            <li>and he never comments on my perfume :)&lt;</li>
            <li>I bought this based on the reviews and was not disappointed !  </li>
            <li>all in good condition , thanks</li>
            <li>I love the clean smell and spray</li>
            <li>It leans more towards a fun and flirty aroma--as opposed to a musky-scented fancy dinner party one.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, it smells good but warning it seems to fade out mid- day</li>
            <li>It is a really light, and just right!</li>
            <li>The product has an unique scent which people stop and ask my wife what does she have on.</li>
            <li>She wants more, I buy it so she can wear it</li>
            <li>The scent is very positive and I enjoy it on my wife.</li>
            <li>I been using this for the past 2 years and still loving it!!</li>
            <li>These guys not only have a great price they ship fast as well.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice, feminine, not bold or very strong.</li>
            <li>It has a nice lasting power.   </li>
            <li>Nonetheless, the scent is amazing and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>As personal and individual perfume choice is, I can say that this one is great.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted-warm vanilla scent</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to more of this scent, and to a big orange bottle.</li>
            <li>Ever since I&#x27;ve got the first one as a gift, I&#x27;ve kept buying it again and again.</li>
            <li>Other then that love it!</li>
            <li>For those who are not into too much floral scent, but want a bit of mystic, this is a right choice.</li>
            <li>It has a soft sweet smell mixed with kind of a classy elegance.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance and it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>I love the soft, dreamy scent and its just strong enough to last all day.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for a chilly fall day.</li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>My wife has been wearing this cologne for over 5 years now and continue to love it due to its subtlety and freshness-like scent.  </li>
            <li>This is my fav perfume, is soft, elegant and stays all day long.</li>
            <li>(my least favorite color) too!</li>
            <li>I enjoy one other perfume which my wife enjoys wearing.</li>
            <li>My husband noticed I was wearing something new</li>
            <li>Love the way it smells , but could not fine in the major department stores.</li>
            <li>The real one I can still get a hint of the smell on my wrist hours later.  </li>
            <li>The engraved words at the bottom of the bottle are a lot blurrier than those seen on my old bottles.  </li>
            <li>Ever since Carol&#x27;s Daughter got rid of their Almond Cookie spray, I have been looking for another scent that was soft and smelled powdery.</li>
            <li>Soft.</li>
            <li>The smell fades much faster than that of the real product I have used in the past years.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is one of my favorites.  I love the fragrance and it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery</li>
            <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen this edition in stores. Good deal on Amazon. I smelled this on a girl once and had to have some for my sweetheart. This is one of my favorite scents that my girl wears. It has a soft sweet smell mixed with kind of a classy elegance. Definitely a more youthful smell. I see this on someone in their early-mid twenties for an out-on-the-town date night.  It leans more towards a fun and flirty aroma--as opposed to a musky-scented fancy dinner party one.</li>
            <li> She love&#x27;s it, I love it. She wears it, I get to smell it. She wants more, I buy it so she can wear it and I can smell it.</li>
            <li> The product has an unique scent which people stop and ask my wife what does she have on. Kenzo Amour is very romantic product.</li>
            <li> It is a woodsy, musky scent with understones of vanilla. It has a nice lasting power.   I just love this fragrance</li>
            <li> This perfume it&#x27;s the perfect combination of sweetness. It&#x27;s has the perfect smells of vanilla and cherry blossom, it last all day on and I have got many complements with it from guys and girls. This is my favorite scent for fall and winter. and have been using it for many years now and it is still my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will re buy it again while it is still available!</li>
            <li> Good product by Kenzo</li>
            <li> Have been using Kenzo for years.  Should have listened to reviewers who complained about the product being fake.  Not sure where it&#x27;s made.  There are Chinese words printed on the box, which is one red flag.  The smell fades much faster than that of the real product I have used in the past years.  The real one I can still get a hint of the smell on my wrist hours later.  The engraved words at the bottom of the bottle are a lot blurrier than those seen on my old bottles.  It went in the trash can.  Stupid me.</li>
            <li> I usually get headaches from the scent of perfumes; however, this one isn&#x27;t overpowering and doesn&#x27;t affect me adversely. It&#x27;s subtle with a soft fragrance.</li>
            <li> Kenzo Amour by Kenzo is a wonderful parfum spary. I love the clean smell and spray makes me feel beauty.</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume I wear.  I get asked all the time what I&#x27;m wearing</li>
            <li> My co worker from Brazil wears this scent. Love the way it smells , but could not fine in the major department stores.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume . I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years.</li>
            <li> the scent has changed, not as fragrant.  very disappointing.</li>
            <li> The scent is very positive and I enjoy it on my wife. I enjoy one other perfume which my wife enjoys wearing.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted-warm vanilla scent</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of Kenzo Amour. I previously owned (and used all of) the 1.5 oz fuschia bottle. I was looking forward to more of this scent, and to a big orange bottle. I was so disappointed that this bottle was pink (my least favorite color) too! Nonetheless, the scent is amazing and lasts all day long. Perfect for a chilly fall day. I even wear it to sleep since it&#x27;s so powdery and comforting.</li>
            <li> The perfume itself was wonderful, my wife of 43 years adores it and so do I. What I didn&#x27;t like was due to a CC malfunction I was billed and sent double the order. When Amazon sent me the message that my purchase hadn&#x27;t gone I figured I try another CC. My second purchase was approved and so was my 1st refused CC purchase, why? Be careful folks, it&#x27;s all about the money to Amazon!</li>
            <li> My husband picked this one out. It is the only scent I wear. I&#x27;ve had men follow me in the grocery store and comment on how good I smell. Very nice.</li>
            <li> As personal and individual perfume choice is, I can say that this one is great. Ever since I&#x27;ve got the first one as a gift, I&#x27;ve kept buying it again and again. Like any Kenzo, it is gentle yet edgy, and with a twist in the end. For those who are not into too much floral scent, but want a bit of mystic, this is a right choice.</li>
            <li> These guys not only have a great price they ship fast as well.  The wife was very happy with her Birthday Present...Thanks again</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance can only get the best prices on Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell.... Last long Totaly recomand this product</li>
            <li> Smells so good!!!! I love this perfume.  I get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it smells good but warning it seems to fade out mid- day so you&#x27;ll need to reapply. Other then that love it!</li>
            <li> My wife has been wearing this cologne for over 5 years now and continue to love it due to its subtlety and freshness-like scent.  Unlike many out there that would knock me out of my socks just to get a wind o it from a passerby.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent. Ever since Carol&#x27;s Daughter got rid of their Almond Cookie spray, I have been looking for another scent that was soft and smelled powdery. This is it! I tried it on at Century 21 (they have the smaller bottle) and found the bigger size here. On me, with my body chemistry, it smells powder-y with a touch of vanilla.</li>
            <li> Favorite. Soft. Smells beautiful. Halle the price.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing!  Love this perfume!</li>
            <li> Love ,love ,love this fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to purchase for quite some time to come.&lt;br /&gt;Kenzo never disappoints for me.....</li>
            <li> I am still using it and this is my go to perfume to any place. I wear it some times even at home or when I am in a bad mood. Lightens me up every single time. Love it</li>
            <li> all in good condition , thanks</li>
            <li> For some reason I cannot wear most perfumes. This is the only one I can wear without smelling like a litter box...It is the only place I can find this size. Very happy to find it..</li>
            <li> the smell is completely different the one I had in store. it fades away in 10mins. Iam disappointed they sent me a fake one.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find this product in stores for the past year. Every time I wear it, I get compliments. The scent is nice, feminine, not bold or very strong. It is a really light, and just right!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume but this was not my perfume, I got a refund. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I love Kenzo Amour, it&#x27;s one of my favs!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews and was not disappointed !  I love the soft, dreamy scent and its just strong enough to last all day.  My husband noticed I was wearing something new and he never comments on my perfume :)&lt;br /&gt;A great buy!</li>
