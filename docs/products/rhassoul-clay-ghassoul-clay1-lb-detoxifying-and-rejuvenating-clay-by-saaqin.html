            <li>I love this clay as a mud wash, It cleanses my hair without the buildup and fits my diy lifestyle perfectly!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t make your own hair wash you should!</li>
            <li>Great for making my own HEALTHY non-chemicalized beauty products!</li>
            <li>, this will help define curls and coils, provide great moisture and basically remove and prevent tangles for the most part.</li>
            <li>I love the rhassoul clay!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff for washing my hair!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I really liked this clay.</li>
            <li>I mix it with warm coconut milk, coconut oil, and honey</li>
            <li>This clay was delivered promptly and is nice, but I like Bentonite clay better for cleansing both my hair and for facials.  </li>
            <li>Very fine powder.</li>
            <li>I used this to make Naptural85&#x27;s DIY Mud Wash for my hair and my hair was extremely easy to detangle and soft and just all around wonderful!</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt better.</li>
            <li>I now use it monthly, but I still love the results.</li>
            <li>My skin looks outstanding since I began using this.  </li>
            <li>I love with this clay..</li>
            <li>ok product, dries up hair.</li>
            <li>Great value fast delivery</li>
            <li>Skin is tighter and smoother with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>Use with just water or fancy it up with your favorite oils.</li>
            <li>This is the best facial mud to use.</li>
            <li>I just mixed with aloe vera juice, olive oil, and grapeseed oil and worked perfect.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>The product was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>It may not be as strong of a detox clay as Bentonite, but it has a lower pH.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was available on the ground.</li>
            <li>But I use it multiple times and it works great.</li>
            <li>I used this for my 4c natural hair and I loved the way it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Wow this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>okay, thanks a lot</li>
            <li>Very simple and easy to make the clay that could be used on hair and face, I hadn&#x27;t used on my face yet but on my hair was amazing.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s wonderful for cleansing and deep conditioning, even a facial mask if you want!</li>
            <li>so its best for using for shampoo or other cosmetics...not smooth enough for a face mask.</li>
            <li>I love how my curls were clumped and my hair was soft.</li>
            <li>Used it to make my own facial mask.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t mind because the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>It leaves both my skin and hair feeling very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>And you can use it for so many different things including hair care, chronic skin disorders, etch.</li>
            <li>Was only able to get about 7 washes out the pound.</li>
            <li>This is the first time buying the clay.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time ever tonight and was blown away by the results.</li>
            <li>This was the first time using Rhassoul Clay.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and my natural combination type 4 hair has NEVER felt better.</li>
            <li>Great product I would definitely recommend it to other&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It is too gritty and it does not wash out easily.</li>
            <li>It must not be as pure as what Lagona USA used to sell.</li>
            <li>It really revives the curl definition without drying out my hair like shampoo does.</li>
            <li>wants to buy</li>
            <li>Works really well on my hair.</li>
            <li>This product has made my hair much easier to manage.</li>
            <li>If you have curl pattern, generally really dry hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling very soft and my skin felt smooth.</li>
            <li>High quality powder.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing for detoxing and deep conditioning dry curly natural hair.</li>
            <li>It is pure and natural.</li>
            <li>Did take a while to wash out longer time in the shower than I normally am when washing</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, less frizzy and more manageable than with any toxic or non toxic shampoo out there.</li>
            <li>It was what I wanted and expected and came quickly</li>
            <li>Made my skin soft and feel really soft!</li>
            <li>This product is also great because of its&#x27; chelation properties if you live in area with hard water consisting of heavy metals.</li>
            <li>I like it so far.  </li>
            <li>I mix with water and use it as a replacement for shampoo when washing my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I use it to cleanse and condition my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I use this on my hair and face, leaves them both soft and feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>when i use it on my face, it itches and is gritty and feels like there is sandpaper on my face  when i use it as shampoo, it dries out my hair and makes it very wiry  </li>
            <li>My hair was soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I purchased this rhassoul clay for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>In the morning when I wash it out, my hair feels sooooo soft and detangled.</li>
            <li>Safely packaged in a thick zip lock bag.</li>
            <li>just make sure you make enough for only one use, because it will dry out if you make extra</li>
            <li>It left my skin soft, smooth and tight with no visible pores.</li>
            <li>I am excited about trying out other recipes in the future and definitely will continue to buy this stuff.</li>
            <li>the spelling was wrong in thismproduct, kind of make me want to judge if it is reall.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and definitely would recommend it to anyone with thick, coarse hair like me.</li>

            <li> My hair is moisturized less tangled than normal and my scalp is no longer itchy.</li>
            <li> The mud steam combination should have been introduced into my life a long time ago!</li>
            <li> A little expensive and can be a little messy when mixed, but so so good.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4b/4c hair very thick and kinky and this stuff made my hair like butter, never have my hair felt this soft or been this manageable.</li>
            <li> ( I have dry kinky coily hair)</li>
            <li> After reading a few blogs about various clays, I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> thinking i would get a good deal buying it wholesale without fancy packaging, i bought this item  however, the quality of this clay is very bad:  </li>
            <li> mix a small amount of clay with just enough water to make mud then apply to face as a mask.</li>
            <li> I have to say I have never tried any other clay</li>
            <li> Other than that, I have no problem with this product.</li>
            <li> I used a clay-based hair wash that was a little pricey</li>
            <li> Used it as a mask with a few drops of rosehip seed oil,almond oil,aloe vera gel and distilled water.</li>
            <li> i had to throw out the whole thing because it was basically unusable, VERY BAD QUALITY!</li>
            <li> Sadly it&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> Before using this product, my hair was difficult to detangle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed!</li>
            <li> I know it sounds crazy!</li>
            <li> and I bought this Clay as the base for my homemade recipe.</li>

            <li> After reading a few blogs about various clays, I decided to give this a try. I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and my natural combination type 4 hair has NEVER felt better. I put this on my hair as a mask and then sit under the steamer for 30 minutes and my hair feels like butter when I&#x27;m done. The mud steam combination should have been introduced into my life a long time ago!</li>
            <li> I like it so far.  I mix with water and use it as a replacement for shampoo when washing my natural hair.  It really revives the curl definition without drying out my hair like shampoo does.</li>
            <li> I use the clay to wash my hair. It gives my gray hair a yellow cast. It must not be as pure as what Lagona USA used to sell.</li>
            <li> A little expensive and can be a little messy when mixed, but so so good. I use it to cleanse and condition my natural hair. My hair has never felt better. I also use it on my face sometimes. It leaves both my skin and hair feeling very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really liked this clay. I started off using it in the Max Hydration Method in place of Bentonite Clay. I love how my curls were clumped and my hair was soft. I now use it monthly, but I still love the results. I wish it was available on the ground. It may not be as strong of a detox clay as Bentonite, but it has a lower pH.  I would definitely repurchase and recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair and face, leaves them both soft and feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! My skin looks outstanding since I began using this.  And you can use it for so many different things including hair care, chronic skin disorders, etch.</li>
            <li> I love with this clay.. It keeps my hair soft and clean. I recommend this product to anyone wants to buy</li>

            <li> Great product. Works really well on my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the rhassoul clay! It left my skin soft, smooth and tight with no visible pores. I also used it on my hair. My hair was soft and moisturized. I could tell the difference immediately. Great product I would definitely recommend it to other&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> ok product, dries up hair.</li>
            <li> Great value fast delivery</li>
            <li> I love this clay as a mud wash, It cleanses my hair without the buildup and fits my diy lifestyle perfectly! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> this clay by this brand is not ground the finest..so its best for using for shampoo or other cosmetics...not smooth enough for a face mask.</li>
            <li> Wow this is an amazing product. mix a small amount of clay with just enough water to make mud then apply to face as a mask. leave on about 30 minutes. Notice a difference in skin after one treatment. Skin is tighter and smoother with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Works great in a variety of products!</li>
            <li> I used this for my 4c natural hair and I loved the way it made my hair feel. Was only able to get about 7 washes out the pound.</li>

            <li> Safely packaged in a thick zip lock bag.This is the first time buying the clay.Usd it in a facial mask and it worked well.Made my skin soft and feel really soft! Will use it in a hair product too.I plan to repurchase.Thanks!</li>
            <li> If you have curl pattern, generally really dry hair that tangles easily, this will help define curls and coils, provide great moisture and basically remove and prevent tangles for the most part. I just follow  instruction from a you tube channel to make a mix for my hair. This product is also great because of its&#x27; chelation properties if you live in area with hard water consisting of heavy metals.( I have dry kinky coily hair)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for washing my hair! Sadly it&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side. But it&#x27;s wonderful for cleansing and deep conditioning, even a facial mask if you want!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use as a deep conditioner for my hair. It works wonderfully for my hair. Before using this product, my hair was difficult to detangle. This product has made my hair much easier to manage. I use it as a deep conditioner once a month.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Used it to make my own facial mask.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for detoxing and deep conditioning dry curly natural hair. Use with just water or fancy it up with your favorite oils. Can also be used as a face mask.</li>
            <li> the spelling was wrong in thismproduct, kind of make me want to judge if it is reall. But I use it multiple times and it works great.</li>
            <li> the stuff works! just make sure you make enough for only one use, because it will dry out if you make extra</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed! I have I used this twice and I am smitten. Used it as a mask with a few drops of rosehip seed oil,almond oil,aloe vera gel and distilled water. Absolutely amazing, will purchase again!</li>
            <li> This is the best facial mud to use. It is pure and natural. Don&#x27;t use anything else on your face but Rhassoul mud</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time ever tonight and was blown away by the results. I have natural 4b/4c hair very thick and kinky and this stuff made my hair like butter, never have my hair felt this soft or been this manageable. Did take a while to wash out longer time in the shower than I normally am when washing but I don&#x27;t mind because the results are worth it. Very simple and easy to make the clay that could be used on hair and face, I hadn&#x27;t used on my face yet but on my hair was amazing. I just mixed with aloe vera juice, olive oil, and grapeseed oil and worked perfect. I am excited about trying out other recipes in the future and definitely will continue to buy this stuff.</li>
            <li> Second time buying it,love it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t clumped. High quality powder. Pricier than I wished.</li>
            <li> Very fine powder. Great for masks.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my hair and face. The product was shipped very quickly. The packaging of the product is not the fanciest...it comes in a plastic bag with the name of the product on a label. This was the first time using Rhassoul Clay. It left my hair feeling very soft and my skin felt smooth. Will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> Soooooooo amazing!! I used this to make Naptural85&#x27;s DIY Mud Wash for my hair and my hair was extremely easy to detangle and soft and just all around wonderful!</li>
            <li> I have been using this clay to wash my hair with. I know it sounds crazy! But it works. My hair is soft, less frizzy and more manageable than with any toxic or non toxic shampoo out there. Haven&#x27;t tried using it yet for homemade make up but will be soon</li>
            <li> This clay works WONDERS on my hair!! I love it!</li>
            <li> Clay was recommended by a YouTube blogger and I love it.  I have to say I have never tried any other clay but this clay is one that I ahve not had problems with so I will be using this again</li>
            <li> Great for making my own HEALTHY non-chemicalized beauty products!</li>
            <li> everything okay, thanks a lot</li>
            <li> Wonderful product it really workes ,..!!!!!</li>
            <li> This clay was delivered promptly and is nice, but I like Bentonite clay better for cleansing both my hair and for facials.  Just my personal preference.</li>
            <li> I purchased this rhassoul clay for my natural hair. I mix it with warm coconut milk, coconut oil, and honey then I sleep with it in my hair overnight. In the morning when I wash it out, my hair feels sooooo soft and detangled. I absolutely love this product and definitely would recommend it to anyone with thick, coarse hair like me. The only con I have is the packaging. When USPS delivered it to my home, it came in the shipping box then when I opened the box the product itself was in a plastic bag with a label saying what it is. I transferred it to a plastic container for manageability. Other than that, I have no problem with this product.</li>
            <li> I used a clay-based hair wash that was a little pricey and I bought this Clay as the base for my homemade recipe. It works great. My hair is moisturized less tangled than normal and my scalp is no longer itchy. There are recipes on YouTube if you would like to try it out for yourself.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be like my mud wash but it was not. It is too gritty and it does not wash out easily. I would not recommend this product.</li>
