            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great!  </li>
            <li>Best deoderant I&#x27;ve used in a while.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>but this stuff is awesome.  </li>
            <li>I have to say, this product is great!  </li>
            <li>you smell great after using this.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works great, doesn&#x27;t ruin your t-shirts like the stick stuff.</li>
            <li>It works great thought.</li>
            <li>Dove soaps for men are a great buy though üòê</li>
            <li>This one by Dove is a great place to start.</li>
            <li>He tried this one and he had no adverse reaction and likes it a great deal.  </li>
            <li>and I thought he would be a great product tester for this.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy they are coming out with a men&#x27;s line.  </li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>Great scent but didn&#x27;t expect it to an aerosol spray.</li>
            <li>And the spray is a nice change of pace from roll on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend!</li>
            <li>pricey than roll-on or stick, this spray-on Dove antiperspirant works and it has a pleasant scent that my guys don&#x27;t object to.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;d think something called &amp;#34;clean comfort&amp;#34; would have a pleasant odor, but not so in this case.</li>
            <li>If you find that scent pleasant, this product might not be a problem for you.</li>
            <li>Great anti-perspirant protection and an amazing scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely a good product, and I&#x27;m eager to see what Dove continues to come out with for their men line.</li>
            <li>This bodyspray does a good job.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about a year with good results.</li>
            <li>smells good and lasts</li>
            <li>He loved it.</li>
            <li>The Clean Comfort scent is absolutely perfect!</li>
            <li>worth noting is that the smell is great!  </li>
            <li>About 3 years ago I switched from Gillette Right Guard to Brut Antiperspirant Deodorant and have been very happy wth the Brut product.  </li>
            <li>I love this deodorant!</li>
            <li>Enthusiastic thumbs up from me.</li>
            <li>Spray\\&quot; is a bit of a novelty, but according to my husband, it is effective, even though it takes some time to get used to the method of delivery.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, another nice product from this line.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not the kind of thing I can write about now as I just started using this about two weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice.</li>
            <li>, I think that 48hours would be best for someone who&#x27;s been partying all night, sweated a whole lot and</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>I have to agree with him that it smells nice</li>

            <li>I LIKED:</li>
            <li>The bottle design is absolutely the best of the three.</li>
            <li>A nice pop-up button, with a twist can.</li>
            <li>The scents are &#x27;good&#x27; but they&#x27;re overwhelming in the quantities desired to get effectiveness out of this product.</li>
            <li>It is effective, pleasant, and economical.  </li>
            <li>a life saver!&lt;br /&gt;Works a full day for me, smells pleasant and isn&#x27;t too strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are great products to pick up if you&#x27;re the kind of guy who really doesn&#x27;t want to spend an hour picking out a scent of aftershave or choice of shampoo.</li>
            <li>This had a nice milder scent that I liked, not overpowering but instead a &#x27;clean&#x27; scent to it.  </li>
            <li>Sprays on very smooth and works well in preventing perspiration.  </li>
            <li>This worked much better.  </li>
            <li>Get a better scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s closer to neutral for this set of olfactory sensors.  :)</li>
            <li>meh, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Nausia and headaches soon follow any smell like this for too many of us.&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all, i&#x27;m enjoying it for now.</li>
            <li>i use it daily , best one i try .</li>
            <li>does most of it for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this product.</li>
            <li>I love Dove products for myself</li>
            <li>pleased I did.</li>
            <li>They worked for the most part.</li>
            <li>My favorite stick based antiperspirant was Arm &amp; Hammer Men&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It seems to be more refined and comes out in a lighter, more controllable stream.</li>
            <li>so I bought more bottles and put it on my Subscribe and Save list.</li>
            <li>Smell is lovely and got people commenting</li>
            <li>on dry, smells great and works effectively for my hubby!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty good tester for anti-perspirants/deodrants because I work in a warehouse</li>
            <li>And on top of that, it&#x27;s too strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a big fan of the Dove Men+Care products, so was quite happy to see they&#x27;d come out with their own version.</li>
            <li>I love this product smells really good thanks.</li>
            <li>We both workout and a nice strong antiperspirant is crucial and this worked great.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, it works.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to stand out that much to me, but still good.</li>
            <li>fast Delivery Good product</li>
            <li>I wish they&#x27;d make the bottle a little more design-oriented, but it gets the job done the best of the three</li>

            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m just happy that it does not irritate, as many others he&#x27;s tried have, leaving a red rash.</li>
            <li>Dove goes on easily without hurting my eyes or sinuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The odor from this is just WAY too strong.</li>
            <li>I am a long term Dove user.. and this product is very good.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent from this brand is the &#x27;Cool Metal&#x27;</li>
            <li>The bottle design is nice, but I feel it could be improved to make it more clear whether the nozzle is locked or unlocked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does have an odor, it&#x27;s not truly odor free, but it&#x27;s not pungent or anything along those lines.  </li>
            <li>Since I go running twice a week, it&#x27;s important that I don&#x27;t stick up the office when I come into work afterwards.</li>
            <li>in all great deodorant/anti-perspirant, just give me a different scent.</li>
            <li>It is just enough to make him smell great.</li>
            <li>spray container fits comfortably in your hand and should fit almost any toiletry or gym bag.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, all three products are worth buying but the Dove is clearly my favorite.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, all three products are worth buying but the Dove is clearly my favorite.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free from Walmart.  </li>
            <li>In other words, this spray would be perfect for New Year&#x27;s!! :)</li>
            <li>As economical as Axe is, you have to apply their products sparingly, so you become a chick-magnet, rather than a chick-repellent!)  </li>
            <li>They had a promotion where you basically get the full size product for free as a sample/</li>
            <li>This is a nice deodorant with a light but masculine scent.</li>
            <li>Since it is a spray, it doesn&#x27;t have any of that, and goes on clean.  </li>
            <li>Care Deodorant Clean Comfort 3 oz]]</li>
            <li>I mistook the name Clean Comfort for an insinuation of lack of perfume.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve given him this DOVE ANTIPERSPIRANT in Clean Comfort to try.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the &#x27;clean&#x27; scent.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, though, the removable plastic top does make it nice and obvious whether you&#x27;re about to spray or not.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, just right.</li>
            <li>The Dove Men+Care Dry Spray Antiperspirant, Clean Comfort 3.8 Oz is great for those quick trips to the gym</li>
            <li>Although, I think I prefer the Axe scent over the Dove version (my wife feels the exact opposite), I was quite happy with the Dove product as well.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of the  antiperspirant and the nice light ( fresh ? )</li>
            <li>This product is still worth buying because it smells great and works decently (especially when applied heavily), but I much prefer the Dove or Degree in preference, even though their canisters aren&#x27;t quite as beautiful!</li>

            <li>Light but fresh scent,&lt;br /&gt;Not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;Effective wetness protection</li>
            <li>The Axe also has a cool lid that you turn to enable you to spray.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good product that does what it is supposed to do for about the same price as the competition.</li>
            <li>It comes out of the bottle nice and easily and does not spray tons of extra product into the air to be inhaled.</li>
            <li>This Dove men+Care Antiperspirant/Deodorant spray works great like all the other from the Antiperspirant/Deodorants Unilever company.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it works great</li>
            <li>the next two cans were better, because I seem to get more of the product out now.</li>
            <li>It applies evenly and quickly and keeps you going throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t dislike the Clean Comfort scent, but it is much too strong</li>
            <li>Has a good clean smell, is dry when it hits skin, and wears well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satisfying.</li>
            <li>There is no powdery deposits and best of all, a gentle baby powder smell for few seconds that goes away.</li>
            <li>It has a pronounced but not unpleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved Dove soaps for years(I&#x27;m old enough to have used bar soap most of my life), bu</li>
            <li>Clean comfort smells way too much to me like a women&#x27;s &amp;#34;Powder Fresh&amp;#34;.. It&#x27;s not really bad</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently tried out the Axe version of the antiperspirant spray, and liked the product.</li>
            <li>As I said, I&#x27;m not crazy about sprays because (a) they can clog up (b)  </li>
            <li>(I love Axe products too, but you have to be more careful with them:  </li>
            <li>I timed it and it did a pretty good job of keeping my underarm dry for almost 24 hours</li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t smell like \\&quot;clean comfort\\&quot; when you apply it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong, but just strong enough to be noticeable.  </li>
            <li>The Extra Fresh is okay; I haven&#x27;t tried the Cool Silver or Unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Right now, for example, I can&#x27;t get him to use a roll on.  </li>
            <li>I finally figured out that I kind of had to shake the can to get more of the product out at the same time.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a plus too, but I generally try to shower more often than that, which of course would negate a 48 hour deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about sprays only because they can clog up, whereas I always feel I can get the most out of stick deodorants and</li>
            <li>He said it went on DRY, smelled nice and did the job.  </li>
            <li>I love this deodorant the only kind that keeps me dry</li>
            <li>This was my first time using a spray antiperspirant, and now it will be my product of choice.</li>
            <li>However, it does fade over time, and eventually you do end up with a pretty well performing deodorant.</li>
            <li>The Dove simply has a removable top, and then you spray.</li>
            <li>First, I want to note that I sweat a lot</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware they were doing antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite for several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>although I&#x27;ve tried most of the scents from the entire product line and they&#x27;re all good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the most innovative of the three bottle designs, but unfortunately, that&#x27;s where most of this product&#x27;s shine wears off.</li>
            <li>Great product, long lasting freshness.</li>
            <li>Adventure reminded me of a Hollister/Abercrombie boy&#x27;s scent; It was very powerful and had that young men&#x27;s smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that the Degree Dry spray is most often the cheapest product of this type in any given</li>
            <li>That is a positive for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That would require more long term research.  </li>
            <li>The product was quite effective and would last me throughout the day - Keeping me dry and feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I find the push-button release on this product to be softer, more controllable, and overall better than the other two products.&lt;br /&gt;4.8 STARS</li>
            <li>The new dry spray deodorant from Dove is nice entry into a very crowded field.  </li>
            <li>The Dove Men+ Dry Spray had a much better dispersion method.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong, but not overpowering, and it does last.</li>
            <li>Perhaps some consider this scent \\&quot;subtle\\&quot; compared to current Axe products, but unless you prefer your body and your bedroom / bathroom to smell (strongly) like your antiperspirant, I cannot recommended this</li>
            <li>It certainly does the job it&#x27;s advertised to do.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t over powering like a certain brand of body spray for guys.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using stick deodorants pretty much all my life so using a spray is very new to me.  </li>
            <li>The degree had a decently powerful scent but the adventure was a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get it to spray at all, but my husband did, just requires too much effort to hold the button down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the whole</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really have any skin sensitivities.</li>
            <li>- I really don&#x27;t want to be noticing it hours after putting it on.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the scent, but fortunately it fades away after you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I saw this product offered through the Amazon Vine program I selected it because I was almost out of my Brut deodorant, but was not expecting much competition for the Brut antiperspirant deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>To me, it smells medicinally and too much like a baby powder type</li>
            <li>If you use too much, you become a walking room deodorizer.  </li>
            <li>My husband really lives the Dove Men line.  </li>
            <li>I didn‚Äôt really want to test the claims of 48 hours.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried &#x27;Forrest&#x27; and &#x27;Island&#x27; and I like them both, but I tend to sweat easier when wearing this product, so I really have to cake it on when I</li>
            <li>, so I really have to cake it on when I</li>
            <li>As someone who absolutely hates that scent, I couldn&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t actually timed it out to do the &amp;#34;smell test&amp;#34; to see how it is still working, but it is nice to have that in my back pocket</li>
            <li>My favorite scent was actually Extreme, even though I didn&#x27;t care for it as much in the store.</li>
            <li>- The bottle does state these are used for underarm purposes only, but I have used them in several other areas to smell good and reduce perspiration significantly.</li>
            <li>- The bottle does state these are used for underarm purposes only, but I have used them in several other areas to smell good and reduce perspiration significantly.</li>
            <li>really, just buy a bottle of Clean Comfort and never look back!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I am sure that I will not be using this product again due to the scent.  </li>
            <li>and I believe it lasts longer due to better application.</li>
            <li>and I believe it lasts longer due to better application.</li>
            <li>When actually on my body, Extreme is a little less overwhelming and more pleasant.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell, it goes on cool, and it leaves underarms dry for at least 12 hours.  </li>
            <li>He has used the facial soap, body soap, and the shampoo/conditioner and was excited to try this new spray Antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>One noticeable difference compared to other spray deodorants was how fast it dried after spraying on your skin, a great convenience that I like.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the Axe, you get 0.4 oz more, in a slightly taller container.</li>
            <li>It keeps the skin dry yet comfortable.</li>
            <li>scent is way too overpowering and that&#x27;s the main issue with this Antiperspirant/Deodorant.</li>
            <li>sure about 48 hours of protection but definitely lasts all day for moderate activity.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I was attracted to the advertiser&#x27;s claim that this particular spray lasts 48 hours.</li>
            <li>Of course, smell is a highly subjective thing, and while what I say about smell probably has no bearing for what your nose will make of it...  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Dove Men + Care Dry Spray Anti-Perspirant Clean Comfort Scent</li>
            <li>you waste more because it&#x27;s harder to be accurate in spraying a body area as opposing to rolling the sticky stuff on and</li>
            <li>The Dove Men+Care Dry Spray Antiperspirant, Clean Comfort 3.8 Oz appears to work well.</li>
            <li>Normally, reserve my reviews for electronics....</li>
            <li>had been using Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s Extra Fresh powder bar deodorant</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth noting firstly, that Dove Mens+ Is often the most expensive of the three brands I have tried in any given market.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is subtle, but nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have actually tried three brands of dry sprays (and multiple scents) and these have become my go-to&#x27;s, but I&#x27;d like to let you know what I liked and didn&#x27;t like about each brand.</li>
            <li>As someone allergic to many perfumes I usually use Mennen Unscented Gel.</li>
            <li>I actually like the smell of it more than the other one.</li>
            <li>Personal care products are potential contributors to the body burden in aluminium and newer evidence has shown that more aluminium is deposited in the outer regions than the inner regions of the breast.</li>
            <li>Afterall, men like to have soft skin too !  </li>
            <li>found that the scent is strongest for the first hour and then starts to ease off over about 4 hours but is subtly present even after 8 hours.</li>
            <li>The bottle is nice, but you have very little control over the flow, and I can only describe the output as &#x27;like a fire extinguisher&#x27;.</li>
            <li>The bottle is nice, but you have very little control over the flow, and I can only describe the output as &#x27;like a fire extinguisher&#x27;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I can&#x27;t wait that long to test it, however, I used this right after I did my six mile run.</li>
            <li>He is glad to find a second choice as sometimes it is hard to find his normal brand - plus he really likes the scent of the Dove products.</li>
            <li>I believe I will continue to purchase the Dove Men+Care Dry Spray Antiperspirant after the free trial is used up, but will still consider Brut as an alternate choice.</li>
            <li>Generally, I buy whichever is on sale, but I always reach for the Dove if it&#x27;s not ridiculously</li>
            <li>Generally, I buy whichever is on sale, but I always reach for the Dove if it&#x27;s not ridiculously</li>
            <li>Clearly a product we will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>While I generally prefer to use a solid stick over an antiperspirant spray, I find Dove&#x27;s antiperspirant for men stellar for its fragrance, longevity, and effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I really didn&#x27;t like was the scent.</li>
            <li>The Dove size is smaller Than my normal Brut deodorant can and the price is slightly higher, but with my satisfaction level factored in, I consider them about equal.  </li>
            <li>They both work very well in stopping  sweat and preventing any odor from it for the entire time I work, about 8 hours.</li>
            <li>a guy who isn&#x27;t fashion conscious</li>
            <li>I believe these scents are meant to be unisex, as there is no men&#x27;s/women&#x27;s branded products on the market as far as I&#x27;m aware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really wish they made these with a different scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Degree Men&#x27;s dry spray was the first spray I had tried.</li>
            <li>From some initial testing Dove Men+Care Dry Spray Antiperspirant seems to do an adequate job as an antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>I love the subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li>overall it does a decent job of keeping my underarm from sticking up the office -</li>
            <li>But whether differences in the distribution of aluminium are related to higher incidence of tumours in the outer upper region of the breast remains</li>
            <li>For many years spray deoderants were wet and sticky and the smell would fade just after a few hours.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many antiperspirant and even though I still use a typical mans stick deodorant, whenever I want to switch to a spray, it will definitely be Dove Men+ Care Dry Spray Antiperspirant!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Several other reviews and the official press for this talk about it working up to two days, which is far more than the stick usually does.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m generally a fan of Dove&#x27;s Men+Care products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a really long time and since most of us shower at least once a day</li>
            <li>It *IS* more expensive than sticks, though - so I&#x27;d have to quantify the cost of a higher product vs how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li>This one says don&#x27;t use it when you&#x27;re smoking or near an open</li>
            <li>It has a rounded cap under which you have a similarly shaped nozzle with a soft rubber</li>
            <li>I tried the Degree NCAA edition spray deodorant but the spray is so caustic that it&#x27;s more of a mace/pepper-spray than it is a deodorant.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried a dry aerosol yet, then I highly recommend checking them out.</li>
            <li>Moreover, while it&#x27;s scented, the fragrance is much less overpowering than the standard stick deodorant, and even diminishes throughout the day while still keeping you fresh.</li>
            <li>Just remember that the places you apply them do get a slight slippery texture at first.</li>
            <li>Just remember that the places you apply them do get a slight slippery texture at first.</li>
            <li>It goes on dry, room temp (not cold like other aerosols), and leaves no deodorant stains.</li>
            <li>(If there&#x27;s a possible drawback, it is the use of the ingredient &amp;#34;aluminum chlorohydrate,&amp;#34; a common antiperspirant ingredient, but, while the connections to Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease and free metals is yet to be established, the effectiveness of Tom&#x27;s brand deodorant has some effectiveness limitations.)  </li>
            <li>The scent is STRONG and not particularly pleasant.</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s no dry time that is required with stick deodorants.</li>
            <li>But boy was that stuff hard to scrub off in the shower and it made you feel kind of &#x27;dirty&#x27; after first putting it on until it really set</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to giving this a try because I&#x27;m kind of getting sick of using stick deodorant.</li>
            <li>Care Dry Spray Antiperpirant is a refreshing deoderant that isn&#x27;t heavily perfumed, isn&#x27;t wet and sticky and still keeps the underarms dry.  </li>

            <li> Best deoderant I&#x27;ve used in a while.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff!</li>
            <li> but this stuff is awesome.  </li>
            <li> I have to say, this product is great!  </li>
            <li> you smell great after using this.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works great, doesn&#x27;t ruin your t-shirts like the stick stuff.</li>
            <li> It works great thought.</li>
            <li> Dove soaps for men are a great buy though üòê</li>
            <li> This one by Dove is a great place to start.</li>
            <li> He tried this one and he had no adverse reaction and likes it a great deal.  </li>
            <li> and I thought he would be a great product tester for this.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m happy they are coming out with a men&#x27;s line.  </li>
            <li> Great product</li>
            <li> Great scent but didn&#x27;t expect it to an aerosol spray.</li>
            <li> And the spray is a nice change of pace from roll on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend!</li>
            <li> pricey than roll-on or stick, this spray-on Dove antiperspirant works and it has a pleasant scent that my guys don&#x27;t object to.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think something called &amp;#34;clean comfort&amp;#34; would have a pleasant odor, but not so in this case.</li>
            <li> If you find that scent pleasant, this product might not be a problem for you.</li>
            <li> Great anti-perspirant protection and an amazing scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely a good product, and I&#x27;m eager to see what Dove continues to come out with for their men line.</li>
            <li> This bodyspray does a good job.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a year with good results.</li>
            <li> smells good and lasts</li>
            <li> He loved it.</li>
            <li> The Clean Comfort scent is absolutely perfect!</li>
            <li> worth noting is that the smell is great!  </li>
            <li> About 3 years ago I switched from Gillette Right Guard to Brut Antiperspirant Deodorant and have been very happy wth the Brut product.  </li>
            <li> I love this deodorant!</li>
            <li> Enthusiastic thumbs up from me.</li>
            <li> Spray\\&quot; is a bit of a novelty, but according to my husband, it is effective, even though it takes some time to get used to the method of delivery.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, another nice product from this line.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not the kind of thing I can write about now as I just started using this about two weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice.</li>
            <li> , I think that 48hours would be best for someone who&#x27;s been partying all night, sweated a whole lot and</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell.</li>

            <li> The bottle design is absolutely the best of the three.</li>
            <li> A nice pop-up button, with a twist can.</li>
            <li> The scents are &#x27;good&#x27; but they&#x27;re overwhelming in the quantities desired to get effectiveness out of this product.</li>
            <li> It is effective, pleasant, and economical.  </li>
            <li> a life saver!&lt;br /&gt;Works a full day for me, smells pleasant and isn&#x27;t too strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are great products to pick up if you&#x27;re the kind of guy who really doesn&#x27;t want to spend an hour picking out a scent of aftershave or choice of shampoo.</li>
            <li> This had a nice milder scent that I liked, not overpowering but instead a &#x27;clean&#x27; scent to it.  </li>
            <li> Sprays on very smooth and works well in preventing perspiration.  </li>
            <li> This worked much better.  </li>
            <li> Get a better scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s closer to neutral for this set of olfactory sensors.  :)</li>
            <li> meh, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Nausia and headaches soon follow any smell like this for too many of us.&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all, i&#x27;m enjoying it for now.</li>
            <li> i use it daily , best one i try .</li>

            <li> I love Dove products for myself</li>
            <li> pleased I did.</li>
            <li> They worked for the most part.</li>
            <li> My favorite stick based antiperspirant was Arm &amp; Hammer Men&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It seems to be more refined and comes out in a lighter, more controllable stream.</li>
            <li> so I bought more bottles and put it on my Subscribe and Save list.</li>
            <li> Smell is lovely and got people commenting</li>
            <li> on dry, smells great and works effectively for my hubby!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty good tester for anti-perspirants/deodrants because I work in a warehouse</li>
            <li> And on top of that, it&#x27;s too strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a big fan of the Dove Men+Care products, so was quite happy to see they&#x27;d come out with their own version.</li>
            <li> I love this product smells really good thanks.</li>
            <li> We both workout and a nice strong antiperspirant is crucial and this worked great.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, it works.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to stand out that much to me, but still good.</li>
            <li> fast Delivery Good product</li>
            <li> I wish they&#x27;d make the bottle a little more design-oriented, but it gets the job done the best of the three</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m just happy that it does not irritate, as many others he&#x27;s tried have, leaving a red rash.</li>
            <li> Dove goes on easily without hurting my eyes or sinuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The odor from this is just WAY too strong.</li>
            <li> I am a long term Dove user.. and this product is very good.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent from this brand is the &#x27;Cool Metal&#x27;</li>
            <li> The bottle design is nice, but I feel it could be improved to make it more clear whether the nozzle is locked or unlocked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have an odor, it&#x27;s not truly odor free, but it&#x27;s not pungent or anything along those lines.  </li>
            <li> Since I go running twice a week, it&#x27;s important that I don&#x27;t stick up the office when I come into work afterwards.</li>
            <li> in all great deodorant/anti-perspirant, just give me a different scent.</li>
            <li> It is just enough to make him smell great.</li>
            <li> spray container fits comfortably in your hand and should fit almost any toiletry or gym bag.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, all three products are worth buying but the Dove is clearly my favorite.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, all three products are worth buying but the Dove is clearly my favorite.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free from Walmart.  </li>
            <li> In other words, this spray would be perfect for New Year&#x27;s!! :)</li>
            <li> As economical as Axe is, you have to apply their products sparingly, so you become a chick-magnet, rather than a chick-repellent!)  </li>
            <li> They had a promotion where you basically get the full size product for free as a sample/</li>
            <li> This is a nice deodorant with a light but masculine scent.</li>
            <li> Since it is a spray, it doesn&#x27;t have any of that, and goes on clean.  </li>
            <li> Care Deodorant Clean Comfort 3 oz]]</li>
            <li> I mistook the name Clean Comfort for an insinuation of lack of perfume.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve given him this DOVE ANTIPERSPIRANT in Clean Comfort to try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the &#x27;clean&#x27; scent.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, though, the removable plastic top does make it nice and obvious whether you&#x27;re about to spray or not.</li>
            <li> Not too strong, just right.</li>
            <li> The Dove Men+Care Dry Spray Antiperspirant, Clean Comfort 3.8 Oz is great for those quick trips to the gym</li>
            <li> Although, I think I prefer the Axe scent over the Dove version (my wife feels the exact opposite), I was quite happy with the Dove product as well.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of the  antiperspirant and the nice light ( fresh ? )</li>
            <li> This product is still worth buying because it smells great and works decently (especially when applied heavily), but I much prefer the Dove or Degree in preference, even though their canisters aren&#x27;t quite as beautiful!</li>
            <li> This product is still worth buying because it smells great and works decently (especially when applied heavily), but I much prefer the Dove or Degree in preference, even though their canisters aren&#x27;t quite as beautiful!</li>
            <li> Light but fresh scent,&lt;br /&gt;Not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;Effective wetness protection</li>
            <li> The Axe also has a cool lid that you turn to enable you to spray.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a good product that does what it is supposed to do for about the same price as the competition.</li>
            <li> It comes out of the bottle nice and easily and does not spray tons of extra product into the air to be inhaled.</li>
            <li> This Dove men+Care Antiperspirant/Deodorant spray works great like all the other from the Antiperspirant/Deodorants Unilever company.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works great</li>
            <li> the next two cans were better, because I seem to get more of the product out now.</li>
            <li> It applies evenly and quickly and keeps you going throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dislike the Clean Comfort scent, but it is much too strong</li>
            <li> Has a good clean smell, is dry when it hits skin, and wears well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satisfying.</li>
            <li> There is no powdery deposits and best of all, a gentle baby powder smell for few seconds that goes away.</li>
            <li> It has a pronounced but not unpleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved Dove soaps for years(I&#x27;m old enough to have used bar soap most of my life), bu</li>
            <li> Clean comfort smells way too much to me like a women&#x27;s &amp;#34;Powder Fresh&amp;#34;.. It&#x27;s not really bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently tried out the Axe version of the antiperspirant spray, and liked the product.</li>
            <li> As I said, I&#x27;m not crazy about sprays because (a) they can clog up (b)  </li>
            <li> (I love Axe products too, but you have to be more careful with them:  </li>
            <li> I timed it and it did a pretty good job of keeping my underarm dry for almost 24 hours</li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t smell like \\&quot;clean comfort\\&quot; when you apply it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong, but just strong enough to be noticeable.  </li>
            <li> The Extra Fresh is okay; I haven&#x27;t tried the Cool Silver or Unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Right now, for example, I can&#x27;t get him to use a roll on.  </li>
            <li> I finally figured out that I kind of had to shake the can to get more of the product out at the same time.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a plus too, but I generally try to shower more often than that, which of course would negate a 48 hour deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about sprays only because they can clog up, whereas I always feel I can get the most out of stick deodorants and</li>
            <li> He said it went on DRY, smelled nice and did the job.  </li>
            <li> I love this deodorant the only kind that keeps me dry</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a spray antiperspirant, and now it will be my product of choice.</li>
            <li> However, it does fade over time, and eventually you do end up with a pretty well performing deodorant.</li>
            <li> The Dove simply has a removable top, and then you spray.</li>
            <li> First, I want to note that I sweat a lot</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware they were doing antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite for several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> although I&#x27;ve tried most of the scents from the entire product line and they&#x27;re all good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the most innovative of the three bottle designs, but unfortunately, that&#x27;s where most of this product&#x27;s shine wears off.</li>
            <li> Great product, long lasting freshness.</li>
            <li> Adventure reminded me of a Hollister/Abercrombie boy&#x27;s scent; It was very powerful and had that young men&#x27;s smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that the Degree Dry spray is most often the cheapest product of this type in any given</li>
            <li> That is a positive for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That would require more long term research.  </li>
            <li> The product was quite effective and would last me throughout the day - Keeping me dry and feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I find the push-button release on this product to be softer, more controllable, and overall better than the other two products.&lt;br /&gt;4.8 STARS</li>
            <li> The new dry spray deodorant from Dove is nice entry into a very crowded field.  </li>
            <li> The Dove Men+ Dry Spray had a much better dispersion method.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong, but not overpowering, and it does last.</li>
            <li> Perhaps some consider this scent \\&quot;subtle\\&quot; compared to current Axe products, but unless you prefer your body and your bedroom / bathroom to smell (strongly) like your antiperspirant, I cannot recommended this</li>
            <li> It certainly does the job it&#x27;s advertised to do.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t over powering like a certain brand of body spray for guys.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using stick deodorants pretty much all my life so using a spray is very new to me.  </li>
            <li> The degree had a decently powerful scent but the adventure was a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it to spray at all, but my husband did, just requires too much effort to hold the button down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the whole</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really have any skin sensitivities.</li>
            <li> - I really don&#x27;t want to be noticing it hours after putting it on.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the scent, but fortunately it fades away after you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I saw this product offered through the Amazon Vine program I selected it because I was almost out of my Brut deodorant, but was not expecting much competition for the Brut antiperspirant deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> To me, it smells medicinally and too much like a baby powder type</li>
            <li> If you use too much, you become a walking room deodorizer.  </li>
            <li> My husband really lives the Dove Men line.  </li>
            <li> I didn‚Äôt really want to test the claims of 48 hours.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried &#x27;Forrest&#x27; and &#x27;Island&#x27; and I like them both, but I tend to sweat easier when wearing this product, so I really have to cake it on when I</li>
            <li> , so I really have to cake it on when I</li>
            <li> As someone who absolutely hates that scent, I couldn&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t actually timed it out to do the &amp;#34;smell test&amp;#34; to see how it is still working, but it is nice to have that in my back pocket</li>
            <li> My favorite scent was actually Extreme, even though I didn&#x27;t care for it as much in the store.</li>
            <li> - The bottle does state these are used for underarm purposes only, but I have used them in several other areas to smell good and reduce perspiration significantly.</li>

            <li> really, just buy a bottle of Clean Comfort and never look back!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I am sure that I will not be using this product again due to the scent.  </li>
            <li> and I believe it lasts longer due to better application.</li>
            <li> and I believe it lasts longer due to better application.</li>
            <li> When actually on my body, Extreme is a little less overwhelming and more pleasant.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell, it goes on cool, and it leaves underarms dry for at least 12 hours.  </li>
            <li> He has used the facial soap, body soap, and the shampoo/conditioner and was excited to try this new spray Antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> One noticeable difference compared to other spray deodorants was how fast it dried after spraying on your skin, a great convenience that I like.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the Axe, you get 0.4 oz more, in a slightly taller container.</li>
            <li> It keeps the skin dry yet comfortable.</li>
            <li> scent is way too overpowering and that&#x27;s the main issue with this Antiperspirant/Deodorant.</li>
            <li> sure about 48 hours of protection but definitely lasts all day for moderate activity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I was attracted to the advertiser&#x27;s claim that this particular spray lasts 48 hours.</li>
            <li> Of course, smell is a highly subjective thing, and while what I say about smell probably has no bearing for what your nose will make of it...  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Dove Men + Care Dry Spray Anti-Perspirant Clean Comfort Scent</li>
            <li> you waste more because it&#x27;s harder to be accurate in spraying a body area as opposing to rolling the sticky stuff on and</li>
            <li> The Dove Men+Care Dry Spray Antiperspirant, Clean Comfort 3.8 Oz appears to work well.</li>
            <li> Normally, reserve my reviews for electronics....</li>
            <li> had been using Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s Extra Fresh powder bar deodorant</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth noting firstly, that Dove Mens+ Is often the most expensive of the three brands I have tried in any given market.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is subtle, but nice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have actually tried three brands of dry sprays (and multiple scents) and these have become my go-to&#x27;s, but I&#x27;d like to let you know what I liked and didn&#x27;t like about each brand.</li>
            <li> As someone allergic to many perfumes I usually use Mennen Unscented Gel.</li>
            <li> I actually like the smell of it more than the other one.</li>
            <li> Personal care products are potential contributors to the body burden in aluminium and newer evidence has shown that more aluminium is deposited in the outer regions than the inner regions of the breast.</li>
            <li> Afterall, men like to have soft skin too !  </li>
            <li> found that the scent is strongest for the first hour and then starts to ease off over about 4 hours but is subtly present even after 8 hours.</li>
            <li> The bottle is nice, but you have very little control over the flow, and I can only describe the output as &#x27;like a fire extinguisher&#x27;.</li>
            <li> The bottle is nice, but you have very little control over the flow, and I can only describe the output as &#x27;like a fire extinguisher&#x27;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I can&#x27;t wait that long to test it, however, I used this right after I did my six mile run.</li>
            <li> He is glad to find a second choice as sometimes it is hard to find his normal brand - plus he really likes the scent of the Dove products.</li>
            <li> I believe I will continue to purchase the Dove Men+Care Dry Spray Antiperspirant after the free trial is used up, but will still consider Brut as an alternate choice.</li>
            <li> Generally, I buy whichever is on sale, but I always reach for the Dove if it&#x27;s not ridiculously</li>
            <li> Generally, I buy whichever is on sale, but I always reach for the Dove if it&#x27;s not ridiculously</li>
            <li> Clearly a product we will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> While I generally prefer to use a solid stick over an antiperspirant spray, I find Dove&#x27;s antiperspirant for men stellar for its fragrance, longevity, and effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I really didn&#x27;t like was the scent.</li>
            <li> The Dove size is smaller Than my normal Brut deodorant can and the price is slightly higher, but with my satisfaction level factored in, I consider them about equal.  </li>
            <li> They both work very well in stopping  sweat and preventing any odor from it for the entire time I work, about 8 hours.</li>
            <li> a guy who isn&#x27;t fashion conscious</li>
            <li> I believe these scents are meant to be unisex, as there is no men&#x27;s/women&#x27;s branded products on the market as far as I&#x27;m aware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really wish they made these with a different scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Degree Men&#x27;s dry spray was the first spray I had tried.</li>
            <li> From some initial testing Dove Men+Care Dry Spray Antiperspirant seems to do an adequate job as an antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> I love the subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li> overall it does a decent job of keeping my underarm from sticking up the office -</li>
            <li> But whether differences in the distribution of aluminium are related to higher incidence of tumours in the outer upper region of the breast remains</li>
            <li> For many years spray deoderants were wet and sticky and the smell would fade just after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many antiperspirant and even though I still use a typical mans stick deodorant, whenever I want to switch to a spray, it will definitely be Dove Men+ Care Dry Spray Antiperspirant!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Several other reviews and the official press for this talk about it working up to two days, which is far more than the stick usually does.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally a fan of Dove&#x27;s Men+Care products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a really long time and since most of us shower at least once a day</li>
            <li> It *IS* more expensive than sticks, though - so I&#x27;d have to quantify the cost of a higher product vs how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> This one says don&#x27;t use it when you&#x27;re smoking or near an open</li>
            <li> It has a rounded cap under which you have a similarly shaped nozzle with a soft rubber</li>
            <li> I tried the Degree NCAA edition spray deodorant but the spray is so caustic that it&#x27;s more of a mace/pepper-spray than it is a deodorant.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried a dry aerosol yet, then I highly recommend checking them out.</li>
            <li> Moreover, while it&#x27;s scented, the fragrance is much less overpowering than the standard stick deodorant, and even diminishes throughout the day while still keeping you fresh.</li>
            <li> Just remember that the places you apply them do get a slight slippery texture at first.</li>
            <li> Just remember that the places you apply them do get a slight slippery texture at first.</li>
            <li> It goes on dry, room temp (not cold like other aerosols), and leaves no deodorant stains.</li>
            <li> (If there&#x27;s a possible drawback, it is the use of the ingredient &amp;#34;aluminum chlorohydrate,&amp;#34; a common antiperspirant ingredient, but, while the connections to Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease and free metals is yet to be established, the effectiveness of Tom&#x27;s brand deodorant has some effectiveness limitations.)  </li>
            <li> The scent is STRONG and not particularly pleasant.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s no dry time that is required with stick deodorants.</li>
            <li> But boy was that stuff hard to scrub off in the shower and it made you feel kind of &#x27;dirty&#x27; after first putting it on until it really set</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to giving this a try because I&#x27;m kind of getting sick of using stick deodorant.</li>
            <li> Care Dry Spray Antiperpirant is a refreshing deoderant that isn&#x27;t heavily perfumed, isn&#x27;t wet and sticky and still keeps the underarms dry.  </li>
            <li> This spray is my favorite so far, as it avoids all of my usual negatives with deodorants: the feel of greasiness or the residue left behind on your shirts.</li>
            <li> So far I have tried &#x27;Extreme&#x27; and &#x27;Adventure&#x27; scents.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient is 20 percent Aluminum Chlorhydrate, which it has in common with many other sprays.</li>
            <li> There are no social consequences to use this Dove Men&#x27;s products:  </li>
            <li> He usually uses a specific solid antiperspirant because he is very sensitive to every brand and scent he has tried in the last ten years.  </li>
            <li> last product I have tried is Axe White Label Dry Spray.</li>
            <li> Might be enough to get this life long stick guy over to the spray.</li>
            <li> Dove dry spray is different.</li>
            <li> I discovered Dry Spray antiperspirants just about 3 months ago, and I only decided to try them at the recommendation of my wife.</li>
            <li> next product I tried was Dove Men+ Dry Spray.</li>
            <li> I also somewhat appreciated the bottle design, although, it&#x27;s hard to know whether the bottle is open or closed without giving it a second look.</li>
            <li> I‚Äôm not really that fond of spray deodorants and was initially reluctant to give this one a try</li>
            <li> When you spray there is no sudden chill and it doesn‚Äôt feel wet.</li>
            <li> Leaving some product in the air which will likely be accidentally inhaled if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> And worse, due to the aerosol spray used to deliver the product, after using this my bedroom smelled like Clean Comfort for a long time afterward (unacceptable).  </li>
            <li> Only thing you need to be careful the active ingredient is a potential carcinogen.</li>
            <li> note - this uses Aluminum Chlorohydrate which is different from the other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Also, because of this, it seems the Dove bottles (of the same size) tend to last me a little longer.</li>
            <li> Also, the bottle design is very basic and unimaginative compared to the other two brands I am reviewing.</li>
            <li> Use your imagination on other areas; But again, the bottle does only recommend the underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> It goes on dry.</li>
            <li> Men+Care dry antiperspirant goes on dry so you won&#x27;t have your body spray soaked up by your clothes</li>
            <li> but it dissipates and leaves me dry for the day w/o any underarm marks from the deoderant.</li>
            <li> My son loves this Dove Dry Antiperspirant spray.</li>
            <li> And the \\&quot;Dry</li>
            <li> Goes on dry, does work for 48 hours but is too scented.</li>

            <li> It goes on dry</li>
            <li> Prefer Degree&#x27;s dry antiperspirants than this one!</li>
            <li> It still feels slightly damp but that disappears almost instantly leaving no discomfort at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used these on my feet when paired with black leather dress shoes and thick black socks to help keep them fresh throughout the day, and it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used these on my feet when paired with black leather dress shoes and thick black socks to help keep them fresh throughout the day, and it works.</li>
            <li> The only drawback: It leaves little powder crystals, so apply before dressing and wait a minute or two.</li>
            <li> last 6 months i&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands spending at least 6 bucks on each one.</li>
            <li> It works sort of like spraying from an empty bottle - just air, no liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No, really, it does.</li>
            <li> not much sweat</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband who HATES gel or wet deodorants</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m using this product in a closed bathroom, I have to hold my breath when applying to underarms as to not inhale.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m using this product in a closed bathroom, I have to hold my breath when applying to underarms as to not inhale.</li>
            <li> My first can was weird</li>
            <li> usually use a stick deodorant / antiperspirant, so I might be likely be happier with the stick version of this product.  </li>
            <li> Compared to some of the other sprays I have tried, this one disperses quite a bit -</li>
            <li> The antiperspirant part of the deodorant also seems to last longer than the usual stick</li>
            <li> Goes on dry and doesn&#x27;t destroy my undershirts.  </li>
            <li> Not quite the harsh scent you get from other spray one.</li>
            <li> About a year and a half ago I noticed that the antiperspirants I was using started giving me severe irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the spray for a week and half</li>
            <li> It feels slightly cool‚Äî</li>
            <li> It seems the scent is slightly stronger than stick deodorants and the smell lasts longer.  </li>
            <li> This dry spray deodorant is terrible, its kind of weak , different of that ones that I bought before.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> You know, the first time I pressed the button, I thought something was wrong!</li>
            <li> but I got annoyed by white residue on all my clothes.</li>
            <li> or if you are sweat excessively, you will find this anti-perspirant spray knocks down the odor and sweat with ease.  </li>
            <li> An antiperspirant spray seemed like a very useful thing, but alas I found this product a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Can is a little small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However I tested it in December, not sure how it will hold up in outdoor activities in the summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure where that is coming from.  </li>
            <li> A small snippet:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;\\&quot;\\</li>
            <li> I only used it once and can&#x27;t see myself using it again, and the main culprit is that awful smell.</li>
            <li> The one negative is that you have to push REALLY hard to get it to spray out.</li>
            <li> My biggest gripe about spray deodrants is the chilly wet spray that comes out.</li>
            <li> I am not the only person who gets sick smelling it.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave marks that badly and seemed to keep me relatively dry throughout the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED: The Axe product is the absolute worst application method.</li>
            <li> /&gt;WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED: The Axe product is the absolute worst application method.</li>
            <li> The whole day after applying this I kept wondering &amp;#34;what is that awful smell?&amp;#34; and it turned out to be me!</li>
            <li> or so if you have to shab yourself together without a shower at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few reviews here that talk about a bad smell with this product.  </li>
            <li> I had always used Stick-based antiperspirants, and, while they were never ideal due to leaving marks, feeling cruddy, etc...</li>
            <li> but they all failed for me.</li>
            <li> Was I wrong.</li>
            <li> How can these manufacturers continue to think that Musk is anything other than the worst smell ever a man could use.  </li>
            <li> This stuff stinks.  </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t smell bad by the end of my shift, it&#x27;s doing</li>
            <li> The scent to me seems like spicy flowers and isn‚Äôt bad at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wonder why some people wrote bad reviews on this product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The fragrance is subtle, but nice.  I&#x27;m on my third can of this.  My first can was weird and I felt like I was often just shooting myself with compressed air.  I finally figured out that I kind of had to shake the can to get more of the product out at the same time.  This worked much better.  Then either I got used to it or the next two cans were better, because I seem to get more of the product out now.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a spray antiperspirant, and now it will be my product of choice. I&#x27;ve been using Dove products almost exclusively (deodorant, shaving gel, aftershave, body wash, etc.) for a while now, so I was already a big fan of the Men+Care line. This spray is my favorite so far, as it avoids all of my usual negatives with deodorants: the feel of greasiness or the residue left behind on your shirts. Moreover, while it&#x27;s scented, the fragrance is much less overpowering than the standard stick deodorant, and even diminishes throughout the day while still keeping you fresh. Enthusiastic thumbs up from me.</li>
            <li> This Dove men+Care Antiperspirant/Deodorant spray works great like all the other from the Antiperspirant/Deodorants Unilever company. However, there is just one problem - it&#x27;s scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Clean comfort smells way too much to me like a women&#x27;s &amp;#34;Powder Fresh&amp;#34;.. It&#x27;s not really bad but it&#x27;s not something that strikes me as a men&#x27;s scent. And on top of that, it&#x27;s too strong. as I write this review, it&#x27;s been 6 hours since I applied it after my shower. I smell like I just put it on 5 minutes ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is way too overpowering and that&#x27;s the main issue with this Antiperspirant/Deodorant. Other than that, it works great</li>
            <li> Light but fresh scent,&lt;br /&gt;Not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;Effective wetness protection&lt;br /&gt;Not sure about 48 hours of protection but definitely lasts all day for moderate activity.&lt;br /&gt;However I tested it in December, not sure how it will hold up in outdoor activities in the summer.</li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t smell like \\&quot;clean comfort\\&quot; when you apply it. The scent is STRONG and not particularly pleasant. However, it does fade over time, and eventually you do end up with a pretty well performing deodorant. \\&quot;Dry Spray\\&quot; is a bit of a novelty, but according to my husband, it is effective, even though it takes some time to get used to the method of delivery. It works sort of like spraying from an empty bottle - just air, no liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else will they come up with next?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally a fan of Dove&#x27;s Men+Care products and this is no exception. These are great products to pick up if you&#x27;re the kind of guy who really doesn&#x27;t want to spend an hour picking out a scent of aftershave or choice of shampoo. This is a nice deodorant with a light but masculine scent. It&#x27;s strong, but not overpowering, and it does last. The only drawback: It leaves little powder crystals, so apply before dressing and wait a minute or two. Otherwise, another nice product from this line.</li>
            <li> Dove Men + Care Dry Spray Anti-Perspirant Clean Comfort Scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes on dry, smells great and works effectively for my hubby! 5/5 stars. Great product!</li>
            <li> The product itself deserves 5 stars. This is why: It goes on dry, not drippy, does not irritate under the arm  and it works well. The one negative is that you have to push REALLY hard to get it to spray out. This is the reason for deducting one star from the rating. Maybe we got a defective one, we don&#x27;t know, but we both tried it. I couldn&#x27;t get it to spray at all, but my husband did, just requires too much effort to hold the button down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just happy that it does not irritate, as many others he&#x27;s tried have, leaving a red rash. We may try another one and see if it&#x27;s any easier to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently tried out the Axe version of the antiperspirant spray, and liked the product. I&#x27;ve been a big fan of the Dove Men+Care products, so was quite happy to see they&#x27;d come out with their own version. Although, I think I prefer the Axe scent over the Dove version (my wife feels the exact opposite), I was quite happy with the Dove product as well. It certainly does the job it&#x27;s advertised to do. although, I do with it had a deodorant as well built-in. Compared to the Axe, you get 0.4 oz more, in a slightly taller container. The Axe also has a cool lid that you turn to enable you to spray. The Dove simply has a removable top, and then you spray. Both indicate to spray 6 inches from the underarm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good product, and I&#x27;m eager to see what Dove continues to come out with for their men line.</li>
            <li> You know, the first time I pressed the button, I thought something was wrong! I couldn&#x27;t feel anything on my skin. That&#x27;s the point! It goes on dry. No, really, it does. It feels like air hitting your underarm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove Men+Care dry antiperspirant goes on dry so you won&#x27;t have your body spray soaked up by your clothes and you won&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;wet armpit&amp;#34; feeling as you dress. I&#x27;m a pretty good tester for anti-perspirants/deodrants because I work in a warehouse and I sweat a lot. This bodyspray does a good job. If I don&#x27;t smell bad by the end of my shift, it&#x27;s doing its job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a 3.8 oz size which is roughly equivalent to the Old Spice or Axe bodysprays. The only thing I really didn&#x27;t like was the scent. I know their name is Dove, but a man&#x27;s anti-perspirant/bodyspray should not smell like baby powder! Get a better scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, it&#x27;s a good product that does what it is supposed to do for about the same price as the competition. It&#x27;s a solid four-star product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to stick deodorants.  I&#x27;ve used them all my life, so an underarm spray deodorant is something different/new to me.  The one thing I don&#x27;t like about stick is that you (initially anyway) get that &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; feel in your pits from using it.  They work well, but I&#x27;ve never been fond of that initial feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product I&#x27;m reviewing doesn&#x27;t have any of that.  Since it is a spray, it doesn&#x27;t have any of that, and goes on clean.  That is a positive for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several other reviews and the official press for this talk about it working up to two days, which is far more than the stick usually does.  That&#x27;s a plus too, but I generally try to shower more often than that, which of course would negate a 48 hour deodorant.  Still, that&#x27;s a selling point.  Haven&#x27;t actually timed it out to do the &amp;#34;smell test&amp;#34; to see how it is still working, but it is nice to have that in my back pocket or so if you have to shab yourself together without a shower at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few reviews here that talk about a bad smell with this product.  I&#x27;m not sure where that is coming from.  Of course, smell is a highly subjective thing, and while what I say about smell probably has no bearing for what your nose will make of it...  I didn&#x27;t have a problem with this.  It does have an odor, it&#x27;s not truly odor free, but it&#x27;s not pungent or anything along those lines.  It&#x27;s closer to neutral for this set of olfactory sensors.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is it seems to work well enough.  It *IS* more expensive than sticks, though - so I&#x27;d have to quantify the cost of a higher product vs how long it lasts.  That&#x27;s not the kind of thing I can write about now as I just started using this about two weeks ago.  That would require more long term research.  Still, it seems to do its job well enough.  Might be enough to get this life long stick guy over to the spray.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I bought it for my husband who works out a lot.  I wanted to ensure he had a deodorant spray that could handle his work out routine and this definitely does the job.  It smells nice.</li>
            <li> Best deoderant I&#x27;ve used in a while.  Smells a bit like Axe for 5-10 minutes but it dissipates and leaves me dry for the day w/o any underarm marks from the deoderant.</li>
            <li> My son loves this Dove Dry Antiperspirant spray. It is now the only product he will use. Clearly a product we will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant the only kind that keeps me dry</li>
            <li> The Dove Men+Care Dry Spray Antiperspirant, Clean Comfort 3.8 Oz is great for those quick trips to the gym and you don&#x27;t want to stink up the office or if you are sweat excessively, you will find this anti-perspirant spray knocks down the odor and sweat with ease.  The bonus is...you smell great after using this.  It applies evenly and quickly and keeps you going throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, doesn&#x27;t ruin your t-shirts like the stick stuff. 1 can lasts for 3 months. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> meh, it&#x27;s ok. it does &amp;#34;go on dry&amp;#34; as advertised unless you spray it profusely. I wish there was a non antiperspirant option.</li>
            <li> I love the subtle fragrance. Not too strong, just right.</li>
            <li> Just as described A++++++</li>
            <li> Normally, reserve my reviews for electronics....but this stuff is awesome.  Goes on dry and doesn&#x27;t destroy my undershirts.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. It&#x27;s was rated the highest by readers of Details magazine. Doesn&#x27;t seem to stand out that much to me, but still good.</li>
            <li> Can is a little small. Seems to last a while though. Not quite the harsh scent you get from other spray one. It works great thought.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks.  How can these manufacturers continue to think that Musk is anything other than the worst smell ever a man could use.  I am not the only person who gets sick smelling it.  Nausia and headaches soon follow any smell like this for too many of us.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like something in the nether regions of an orangutan!  What minds keep thinking women like this horrid smell?</li>
            <li> First, I want to note that I sweat a lot and I don&#x27;t really have any skin sensitivities. About a year and a half ago I noticed that the antiperspirants I was using started giving me severe irritation. I was scratching my armpits non stop and when you&#x27;re on a date, it&#x27;s definitely not something that&#x27;ll help you get a second one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last 6 months i&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands spending at least 6 bucks on each one. I&#x27;m not going to name all of them but they all failed for me. I was about to give up when my friend had mentioned he was having the same problem and mentioned Dove Men+Care. I looked on amazon and saw that it was under 5 bucks so I figured why not? I&#x27;ve been using the spray for a week and half now and NO irritation AT ALL! In fact, I skipped the weekend and not much sweat either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, i&#x27;m enjoying it for now. I&#x27;ll see how it goes in a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note - this uses Aluminum Chlorohydrate which is different from the other brands I&#x27;ve used. I think the others use Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s what caused the irritation I had but it seems to be the only ingredient that&#x27;s changed. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> fast Delivery Good product</li>
            <li> From some initial testing Dove Men+Care Dry Spray Antiperspirant seems to do an adequate job as an antiperspirant.  I did not notice any problems with wetness during the day after using this product.  And the \\&quot;Dry Spray\\&quot; actually seemed to work as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am sure that I will not be using this product again due to the scent.  I don&#x27;t dislike the Clean Comfort scent, but it is much too strong - I really don&#x27;t want to be noticing it hours after putting it on.  And worse, due to the aerosol spray used to deliver the product, after using this my bedroom smelled like Clean Comfort for a long time afterward (unacceptable).  Perhaps some consider this scent \\&quot;subtle\\&quot; compared to current Axe products, but unless you prefer your body and your bedroom / bathroom to smell (strongly) like your antiperspirant, I cannot recommended this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use a stick deodorant / antiperspirant, so I might be likely be happier with the stick version of this product.  Perhaps I&#x27;ll give [[ASIN:B005K6X30I Dove Men +Care Deodorant Clean Comfort 3 oz]] a try someday.</li>
            <li> Since I go running twice a week, it&#x27;s important that I don&#x27;t stick up the office when I come into work afterwards. I&#x27;ve been using Axe&lt;br /&gt;deodorant which does the job well. I&#x27;m not crazy about sprays only because they can clog up, whereas I always feel I can get the most out of stick deodorants and antiperspirants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I was attracted to the advertiser&#x27;s claim that this particular spray lasts 48 hours. That&#x27;s a really long time and since most of us shower at least once a day, I think that 48hours would be best for someone who&#x27;s been partying all night, sweated a whole lot and (maybe because he&#x27;s hung over) doesn&#x27;t expect to go out in a day or two. In other words, this spray would be perfect for New Year&#x27;s!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I can&#x27;t wait that long to test it, however, I used this right after I did my six mile run. I timed it and it did a pretty good job of keeping my underarm dry for almost 24 hours (I then showered).  I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the scent, but fortunately it fades away after you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I continue using this over my roll-on deodorant?  Only if it&#x27;s cheaper.  As I said, I&#x27;m not crazy about sprays because (a) they can clog up (b)  you waste more because it&#x27;s harder to be accurate in spraying a body area as opposing to rolling the sticky stuff on and (c) sprays tend to be flammable.  This one says don&#x27;t use it when you&#x27;re smoking or near an open flame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall it does a decent job of keeping my underarm from sticking up the office - but since I shower after every run, I think the 48 hour protection is overkill.</li>
            <li> About 3 years ago I switched from Gillette Right Guard to Brut Antiperspirant Deodorant and have been very happy wth the Brut product.  I never considered Dove as an alternate deodorant for men.  When I saw this product offered through the Amazon Vine program I selected it because I was almost out of my Brut deodorant, but was not expecting much competition for the Brut antiperspirant deodorant.  I was pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of the  antiperspirant and the nice light ( fresh ? ) smell of the Dove product.  The Dove size is smaller Than my normal Brut deodorant can and the price is slightly higher, but with my satisfaction level factored in, I consider them about equal.  The Dove can does pack easier for travel, which is a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line I believe I will continue to purchase the Dove Men+Care Dry Spray Antiperspirant after the free trial is used up, but will still consider Brut as an alternate choice.</li>
            <li> All of the caps were broke</li>
            <li> i use it daily , best one i try . spray morning once and works all day .</li>
            <li> The Dove Men+Care Dry Spray Antiperspirant, Clean Comfort 3.8 Oz appears to work well. The active ingredient is 20 percent Aluminum Chlorhydrate, which it has in common with many other sprays. It has a pronounced but not unpleasant fragrance. The advantage of a 3.8 ounce container is that it is easier to grip than larger spray cans. I have been using it for about a year with good results.</li>
            <li> Goes on dry, does work for 48 hours but is too scented. As someone allergic to many perfumes I usually use Mennen Unscented Gel. I mistook the name Clean Comfort for an insinuation of lack of perfume. Was I wrong. I started gagging before I&#x27;d even spayed  my second  arm.</li>
            <li> This had a nice milder scent that I liked, not overpowering but instead a &#x27;clean&#x27; scent to it.  It did deliver well as an antiperspirant.  One noticeable difference compared to other spray deodorants was how fast it dried after spraying on your skin, a great convenience that I like.  This did not irritate my skin as promised and worked well throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Deodorant sprays on dry and doesn&#x27;t get sticky. Has a nice smell. Has &amp;#34;staying&amp;#34; power! Lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Dove Men+ Care Dry Spray Antiperpirant is a refreshing deoderant that isn&#x27;t heavily perfumed, isn&#x27;t wet and sticky and still keeps the underarms dry.  For many years spray deoderants were wet and sticky and the smell would fade just after a few hours.  This isn&#x27;t so with Dove Men+Care Spray Antiperspirant.  It has a pleasant smell, it goes on cool, and it leaves underarms dry for at least 12 hours.  I have tried many antiperspirant and even though I still use a typical mans stick deodorant, whenever I want to switch to a spray, it will definitely be Dove Men+ Care Dry Spray Antiperspirant!  Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I have this one as well the one for woman. I actually like the smell of it more than the other one. They both work very well in stopping  sweat and preventing any odor from it for the entire time I work, about 8 hours. It keeps the skin dry yet comfortable.</li>
            <li> My son is about to become a teen and I&#x27;ve given him this DOVE ANTIPERSPIRANT in Clean Comfort to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a guy who isn&#x27;t fashion conscious he is picky about the scents he wears and about how things are applied.  Right now, for example, I can&#x27;t get him to use a roll on.  He&#x27;s just not used to it.  That&#x27;s one reason that this spray-on is a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second reason is the scent.  I have to agree with him that it smells nice --and I&#x27;ve tried it and I like the scent too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;More pricey than roll-on or stick, this spray-on Dove antiperspirant works and it has a pleasant scent that my guys don&#x27;t object to.  I would buy this for my son but not for myself. I like a deodorant/antibacterial product and I prefer spray-ons that use a pump and not aerosol propellants.  But this Dove does work.</li>
            <li> Prefer Degree&#x27;s dry antiperspirants than this one! Dove soaps for men are a great buy though üòê</li>
            <li> Really like this product. It goes on dry, room temp (not cold like other aerosols), and leaves no deodorant stains. Most importantly, it works. No sweating and no body odor. The only con for me personally is the scent. I don&#x27;t care for the &#x27;clean&#x27; scent. To me, it smells medicinally and too much like a baby powder type product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all great deodorant/anti-perspirant, just give me a different scent. If you haven&#x27;t tried a dry aerosol yet, then I highly recommend checking them out. This one by Dove is a great place to start.</li>
            <li> While I generally prefer to use a solid stick over an antiperspirant spray, I find Dove&#x27;s antiperspirant for men stellar for its fragrance, longevity, and effectiveness.  I have used this 3.6 ounce bottle for several weeks, and I have virtually no complaints.  It has a manly scent without having a lack of subtlety some Axe brand elicit.  (I love Axe products too, but you have to be more careful with them:  If you use too much, you become a walking room deodorizer.  As economical as Axe is, you have to apply their products sparingly, so you become a chick-magnet, rather than a chick-repellent!)  There are no social consequences to use this Dove Men&#x27;s products:  It is effective, pleasant, and economical.  (If there&#x27;s a possible drawback, it is the use of the ingredient &amp;#34;aluminum chlorohydrate,&amp;#34; a common antiperspirant ingredient, but, while the connections to Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease and free metals is yet to be established, the effectiveness of Tom&#x27;s brand deodorant has some effectiveness limitations.)  Just sayin&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I love this product smells really good thanks.</li>
            <li> smells good and lasts</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved Dove soaps for years(I&#x27;m old enough to have used bar soap most of my life), bu I wasn&#x27;t aware they were doing antiperspirants. Confined to a wheelchair, I can&#x27;t remember the last time I went shopping(someone else does most of it for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this item. Has a good clean smell, is dry when it hits skin, and wears well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satisfying.</li>
            <li> I am a long term Dove user.. and this product is very good. Shake well and spray . There is no powdery deposits and best of all, a gentle baby powder smell for few seconds that goes away. Instantly dries. Only thing you need to be careful the active ingredient is a potential carcinogen. So do not use it on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wikipedia for \\&quot;Aluminium Chlorhydrate\\&quot;. A small snippet:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;\\&quot;\\&quot; The European Journal of Cancer Prevention stated \\&quot;underarm shaving with antiperspirant/deodorant use may play a role in breast cancer.\\&quot;[11] The journal Breast Cancer Research proposed a link between breast cancer and the application of cosmetic chemicals in the underarm, including aluminium, with oestrogenic and/or genotoxic properties.[12] Personal care products are potential contributors to the body burden in aluminium and newer evidence has shown that more aluminium is deposited in the outer regions than the inner regions of the breast. But whether differences in the distribution of aluminium are related to higher incidence of tumours in the outer upper region of the breast remains unknown.[13] \\&quot;\\&quot;\\&quot;\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this product. My husband doesn&#x27;t like spray deoderant so we gave it to the teen son. It isn&#x27;t over powering like a certain brand of body spray for guys. It is just enough to make him smell great.</li>
            <li> The new dry spray deodorant from Dove is nice entry into a very crowded field.  Sprays on very smooth and works well in preventing perspiration.  It&#x27;s basically an almost odorless substance with just the slightest hint of musk.  I0/10 I would use again!</li>
            <li> My husband really lives the Dove Men line.  He has used the facial soap, body soap, and the shampoo/conditioner and was excited to try this new spray Antiperspirant.  He usually uses a specific solid antiperspirant because he is very sensitive to every brand and scent he has tried in the last ten years.  He tried this one and he had no adverse reaction and likes it a great deal.  He is glad to find a second choice as sometimes it is hard to find his normal brand - plus he really likes the scent of the Dove products.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband who HATES gel or wet deodorants and I thought he would be a great product tester for this.  He loved it. He said it went on DRY, smelled nice and did the job.  So i had to try it of course, and I felt the same way.  We both workout and a nice strong antiperspirant is crucial and this worked great.  I love Dove products for myself so I&#x27;m happy they are coming out with a men&#x27;s line.  Afterall, men like to have soft skin too !  Great product</li>
            <li> I‚Äôm not really that fond of spray deodorants and was initially reluctant to give this one a try but I‚Äôm pleased I did. My biggest gripe about spray deodrants is the chilly wet spray that comes out. It‚Äôs not at all pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Dove dry spray is different. When you spray there is no sudden chill and it doesn‚Äôt feel wet. It feels slightly cool‚Äîalmost room temperature. It still feels slightly damp but that disappears almost instantly leaving no discomfort at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the scent is strongest for the first hour and then starts to ease off over about 4 hours but is subtly present even after 8 hours. I didn‚Äôt really want to test the claims of 48 hours.  But with this on, your co-workers will have no occasion to wrinkle their noses through the working day (unless they don‚Äôt like the scent). The scent to me seems like spicy flowers and isn‚Äôt bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray container fits comfortably in your hand and should fit almost any toiletry or gym bag. It has a rounded cap under which you have a similarly shaped nozzle with a soft rubber surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I discovered Dry Spray antiperspirants just about 3 months ago, and I only decided to try them at the recommendation of my wife. I had always used Stick-based antiperspirants, and, while they were never ideal due to leaving marks, feeling cruddy, etc... They worked for the most part. My favorite stick based antiperspirant was Arm &amp; Hammer Men&#x27;s. It didn&#x27;t leave marks that badly and seemed to keep me relatively dry throughout the day. But boy was that stuff hard to scrub off in the shower and it made you feel kind of &#x27;dirty&#x27; after first putting it on until it really set in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have actually tried three brands of dry sprays (and multiple scents) and these have become my go-to&#x27;s, but I&#x27;d like to let you know what I liked and didn&#x27;t like about each brand. I will likely post reviews to the pages of all three products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Degree Men&#x27;s dry spray was the first spray I had tried. So far I have tried &#x27;Extreme&#x27; and &#x27;Adventure&#x27; scents. My favorite scent was actually Extreme, even though I didn&#x27;t care for it as much in the store. When actually on my body, Extreme is a little less overwhelming and more pleasant. Adventure reminded me of a Hollister/Abercrombie boy&#x27;s scent; It was very powerful and had that young men&#x27;s smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I LIKED: The degree had a decently powerful scent but the adventure was a little overwhelming. The product was quite effective and would last me throughout the day - Keeping me dry and feeling clean. I also somewhat appreciated the bottle design, although, it&#x27;s hard to know whether the bottle is open or closed without giving it a second look. This can cause some unintended sprays! It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that the Degree Dry spray is most often the cheapest product of this type in any given market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED: Compared to some of the other sprays I have tried, this one disperses quite a bit - Leaving some product in the air which will likely be accidentally inhaled if you aren&#x27;t careful. The bottle design is nice, but I feel it could be improved to make it more clear whether the nozzle is locked or unlocked.&lt;br /&gt;4.5 STARS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next product I tried was Dove Men+ Dry Spray. This is my favorite for several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I LIKED: The Dove Men+ Dry Spray had a much better dispersion method. It comes out of the bottle nice and easily and does not spray tons of extra product into the air to be inhaled. It seems to be more refined and comes out in a lighter, more controllable stream. Also, because of this, it seems the Dove bottles (of the same size) tend to last me a little longer. I also preferred the lighter, cleaner scent of the Dove. My favorite scent from this brand is the &#x27;Cool Metal&#x27; although I&#x27;ve tried most of the scents from the entire product line and they&#x27;re all good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED: It&#x27;s worth noting firstly, that Dove Mens+ Is often the most expensive of the three brands I have tried in any given market. Also, the bottle design is very basic and unimaginative compared to the other two brands I am reviewing. Thankfully, though, the removable plastic top does make it nice and obvious whether you&#x27;re about to spray or not. I find the push-button release on this product to be softer, more controllable, and overall better than the other two products.&lt;br /&gt;4.8 STARS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last product I have tried is Axe White Label Dry Spray. I believe these scents are meant to be unisex, as there is no men&#x27;s/women&#x27;s branded products on the market as far as I&#x27;m aware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I LIKED: The bottle design is absolutely the best of the three. A nice pop-up button, with a twist can. This is the most innovative of the three bottle designs, but unfortunately, that&#x27;s where most of this product&#x27;s shine wears off. The scents are &#x27;good&#x27; but they&#x27;re overwhelming in the quantities desired to get effectiveness out of this product. I&#x27;ve tried &#x27;Forrest&#x27; and &#x27;Island&#x27; and I like them both, but I tend to sweat easier when wearing this product, so I really have to cake it on when I apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED: The Axe product is the absolute worst application method. The bottle is nice, but you have very little control over the flow, and I can only describe the output as &#x27;like a fire extinguisher&#x27;. If I&#x27;m using this product in a closed bathroom, I have to hold my breath when applying to underarms as to not inhale. When I leave the bathroom, it&#x27;s like I sprayed this product intentionally as an air freshener. This product is still worth buying because it smells great and works decently (especially when applied heavily), but I much prefer the Dove or Degree in preference, even though their canisters aren&#x27;t quite as beautiful! Strangely enough, I think Unilever makes both Dove and Axe products.&lt;br /&gt;4 STARS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, all three products are worth buying but the Dove is clearly my favorite. I wish they&#x27;d make the bottle a little more design-oriented, but it gets the job done the best of the three and I believe it lasts longer due to better application. Generally, I buy whichever is on sale, but I always reach for the Dove if it&#x27;s not ridiculously priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - The bottle does state these are used for underarm purposes only, but I have used them in several other areas to smell good and reduce perspiration significantly. Just remember that the places you apply them do get a slight slippery texture at first. I&#x27;ve even used these on my feet when paired with black leather dress shoes and thick black socks to help keep them fresh throughout the day, and it works. Use your imagination on other areas; But again, the bottle does only recommend the underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps you in shopping!!!ct, so I really have to cake it on when I apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED: The Axe product is the absolute worst application method. The bottle is nice, but you have very little control over the flow, and I can only describe the output as &#x27;like a fire extinguisher&#x27;. If I&#x27;m using this product in a closed bathroom, I have to hold my breath when applying to underarms as to not inhale. When I leave the bathroom, it&#x27;s like I sprayed this product intentionally as an air freshener. This product is still worth buying because it smells great and works decently (especially when applied heavily), but I much prefer the Dove or Degree in preference, even though their canisters aren&#x27;t quite as beautiful! Strangely enough, I think Unilever makes both Dove and Axe products.&lt;br /&gt;4 STARS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, all three products are worth buying but the Dove is clearly my favorite. I wish they&#x27;d make the bottle a little more design-oriented, but it gets the job done the best of the three and I believe it lasts longer due to better application. Generally, I buy whichever is on sale, but I always reach for the Dove if it&#x27;s not ridiculously priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - The bottle does state these are used for underarm purposes only, but I have used them in several other areas to smell good and reduce perspiration significantly. Just remember that the places you apply them do get a slight slippery texture at first. I&#x27;ve even used these on my feet when paired with black leather dress shoes and thick black socks to help keep them fresh throughout the day, and it works. Use your imagination on other areas; But again, the bottle does only recommend the underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps you in shopping!!!</li>
            <li> The odor from this is just WAY too strong. I only use it in an emergency when somehow my wife let&#x27;s us run out of our regular product.</li>
            <li> This went over big. Great anti-perspirant protection and an amazing scent. And the spray is a nice change of pace from roll on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant! The Clean Comfort scent is absolutely perfect! My girlfriend loves when I smell like this so I bought more bottles and put it on my Subscribe and Save list. The Extra Fresh is okay; I haven&#x27;t tried the Cool Silver or Unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s Extra Fresh powder bar deodorant but I got annoyed by white residue on all my clothes. I tried the Degree NCAA edition spray deodorant but the spray is so caustic that it&#x27;s more of a mace/pepper-spray than it is a deodorant. Dove goes on easily without hurting my eyes or sinuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But really, just buy a bottle of Clean Comfort and never look back!</li>
            <li> Great product, long lasting freshness. Wonder why some people wrote bad reviews on this product. Smell is lovely and got people commenting</li>
            <li> Great scent but didn&#x27;t expect it to an aerosol spray. There is a warning on the can to not breathe the spray.  I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free from Walmart.  They had a promotion where you basically get the full size product for free as a sample/trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now.  I&#x27;ve been using stick deodorants pretty much all my life so using a spray is very new to me.  I have to say, this product is great!  It goes on dry so there&#x27;s no dry time that is required with stick deodorants. Stick deodorants tend to leave a residue, especially the gel/liquid deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also worth noting is that the smell is great!  It&#x27;s not too strong, but just strong enough to be noticeable.  It seems the scent is slightly stronger than stick deodorants and the smell lasts longer.  The antiperspirant part of the deodorant also seems to last longer than the usual stick deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product!  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Oh wow!&lt;br /&gt;As a sweaty big guy this stuff is a life saver!&lt;br /&gt;Works a full day for me, smells pleasant and isn&#x27;t too strong.&lt;br /&gt;The can says it&#x27;ll last up to eight weeks, well I&#x27;ll update the review when that time comes!</li>
            <li> this is just 0.4oz too big to pass through the TSA.  they allow 3.4oz, but not 3.8oz.  yes, they do confiscate it.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to giving this a try because I&#x27;m kind of getting sick of using stick deodorant. An antiperspirant spray seemed like a very useful thing, but alas I found this product a disappointment. I only used it once and can&#x27;t see myself using it again, and the main culprit is that awful smell. You&#x27;d think something called &amp;#34;clean comfort&amp;#34; would have a pleasant odor, but not so in this case. The whole day after applying this I kept wondering &amp;#34;what is that awful smell?&amp;#34; and it turned out to be me! The scent is what I&#x27;d describe as &amp;#34;powder fresh&amp;#34; if you&#x27;ve ever had a chance to try an air sanitizer with that name. If you find that scent pleasant, this product might not be a problem for you. As someone who absolutely hates that scent, I couldn&#x27;t stand it. It was overpowering and unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really wish they made these with a different scent. With the current scent it has, I can&#x27;t see myself recommending it to anyone or using it myself ever again.</li>
            <li> This dry spray deodorant is terrible, its kind of weak , different of that ones that I bought before.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy from these seler !!!!</li>
