            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>Tarte makes wonderful products, not just this powder.  </li>
            <li>Love it!!!</li>
            <li>It blends flawlessly like a good transclucent powder.</li>
            <li>Trust me, the \\&quot;ashiness\\&quot; will settle into something beautiful between the time you put it on and your commute to work.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>That is a huge deal for me!!!</li>
            <li>My favorite part is that the company is eco-friendly!!</li>
            <li>The product is excellent, and the shipping was phenomenal.</li>
            <li>A great, great fine!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!!!  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, very fine powder, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with product and seller.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>my favorite thing that this does is get rid of my oiliness!</li>
            <li>The results were GREAT, my makeup didn&#x27;t crease and this powder is sooo finely milled.  </li>
            <li>put this over my SKIN79 BB Cream, and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I thought this stuff would be great because it&#x27;s light and would help absorb the oil.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t remove your liquid makeup and gives a nice polished look.</li>
            <li>Absolutely one of the best finishing powders/setting powders out there.</li>
            <li>I had to kind of wipe it off</li>
            <li>Excellent product, an absolute staple in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, doesn&#x27;t have a color, and evens out your skin tone...</li>
            <li>The look is flawless yet natural.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves this product for good face coverage, i.e., smooth and not clumpy.</li>
            <li>Good clean products.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m pretty happy with this now.   </li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin look, once I get it onto my brush that is.</li>
            <li>You have to slam it on your hand so many times.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product along with the blush.</li>
            <li>the price  on this site is a lot more than anywhere else.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this powder.</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m so glad I found it hiding in my stuff, and it saved a lot of headaches.  </li>
            <li>Instead, it works better to hold the container over the upturned lid and use your finger to tap the powder into it, then use your brush to apply.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make your wrinkles more pronounced the way a lot of powders do.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>all the powder I need! :)</li>
            <li>This is magic fairy dust.</li>
            <li>This stuff is MAGICAL.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so used to buying cosmetic products that claim to do all these great things, but really don&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I love the Tarte amazonian foundation and decided to try this as a compliment to my morning beauty routine.  </li>
            <li>I had to widen the hole in the top of the applicator.  </li>
            <li>Of course, I got way more powder on my brush</li>
            <li>and just hoped that the \\&quot;ashy look\\&quot; I gained from using more</li>
            <li>Smooth Operator works nicely on</li>
            <li>This powder is absolutely amazing, no touch ups in the middle of the day and a very flawless clean look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I was very excited to try this powder.</li>
            <li>It does a really good job of sealing them after I apply eyebrow pencil, so my eyebrows stay in place MUCH longer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, smooth, and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It goes on transparent and is easy to apply, however it&#x27;s almost as if it takes my foundation off or lessens the coverage.</li>
            <li>It works easily this way and prevents wasting powder.</li>
            <li>It does feel really nice when you first apply.</li>
            <li>I was on the hunt for a finishing powder that would not settle into fine lines around my eyes after using a concealer.  </li>
            <li>It does not accentuate fine lines, but it takes care of the shine in my t-zone.  </li>
            <li>Sits in fine lines on your face.  </li>
            <li>Tarte&#x27;s product does everything it promisesâ€¦keeps the oil at bay and makes for a smooth face.</li>
            <li>For almost 30 bucks, I&#x27;m not quite sure if this powder is worth it.</li>
            <li>I have very, very oily skin with blemishes, and ever since I started using this finishing powder, my skin looks super smooth, healthy, and it controls my oil production.</li>
            <li>but like everything I&#x27;m sure other companies will try to copy it as its a good seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lose</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure everyone with oily skin thinks it&#x27;s very oily</li>
            <li>that was super fast!!..</li>
            <li>I have a 13-14 hour military job this finishing powder had me looking good all day even through the sweat it stayed a beautyful oil free Matte finish for me ; )</li>
            <li>This does exactly what it says it will do!</li>
            <li>This goes on like silk and it doesn&#x27;t take very much at all for full coverage.  </li>
            <li>it really feels so smooth on my face,it doesn&#x27;t look chalky..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>It takes a very small amount; just a light dusting does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve put it on, then used a 15x LED lighted mirror later in the day to check the performance of Tarte Smooth Operator, and I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
            <li>But I love many other Tarte products</li>
            <li>Well...........it is very fine powder which is what I like about, but not much of big difference between this clay finishing powder and my Laura Mercier lose powder.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had such a great product in such crappy packaging before...</li>
            <li>It glides on really smoothly and feels very soft under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It feels very silky on the skin is very finely milled and works even on bare skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does control oil better than any other powder I&#x27;ve tried but it doesn&#x27;t work as great for me as some other reviewers.</li>
            <li>Like the powder very much...</li>
            <li>Purchased a couple weeks ago, and at first did not like it.</li>
            <li>So, I started using much more powder a week ago (before I would shake the container only 3-4 times, but now I shake 5-6 times).</li>
            <li>My face now remains pretty oil-free at noon, and seems to remain so the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>Not quite sure what the big deal is.</li>
            <li>I am tempted to buy this entire line :-)</li>
            <li>that said, I LOVE the eyeshadow and mascara and will be reviewing that next.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know how, because it&#x27;s translucent, but it does!</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s really hot</li>
            <li>Trying to find a makeup for this unique combination of 50+ year old skin, and oily/dry skin combo has been a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and makes my makeup stay longer, but it&#x27;s so hard to get out and really touchy.</li>
            <li>Well, wouldn&#x27;t you know this powder not only settled beautifully after checking a 1/2 hour later, but lasted me the entire work day for the first time!</li>
            <li>I also like that it&#x27;s pretty pure and doesn&#x27;t contain a bunch of lab created chemicals.</li>
            <li>&quot; I couldn&#x27;t wait to buy this powder after I&#x27;ve read the positive reviews,so i decided to try it my self.</li>
            <li>and I was doing something strenuous, sometimes I&#x27;ll put a little more around my nose midway through the day and problem solved!</li>
            <li>The only problem that I have with the product is easily remedied:  </li>
            <li>For anyone with large pores...this is a must.  </li>
            <li>Even after several hours my makeup is in place, and not settled into fine lines.</li>
            <li>thanks sephora.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to everyone!..</li>
            <li>I wear it over my makeup (to set it) and I wear it when I&#x27;m wearing no makeup, and it controls shine and evens out my face all day, unless I&#x27;m doing something intense like working out (</li>
            <li>It controls the shine for MUCH longer than BE.</li>
            <li>This powder is better then i expected.</li>
            <li>I have a combinational skin and my face is very shiny in the T-zones.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s colorless, you really don&#x27;t see it on the face.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>but mine really is.</li>
            <li>And I didn&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li>What I really like it for, is my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I used many different products and so far this one works wonders for me.</li>
            <li>Looks white at first but quickly blends in.</li>
            <li>I never thought it would be anything particularly special, and just stuck with regular drugstore brand powder..</li>
            <li>Just tried this for the first time today, and I can see a HUGE difference from the other powder I had been using (NVEY Eco).  </li>
            <li>I would definitely buy a full size of this product.</li>
            <li>I thought my old powder covered my pores pretty well...</li>
            <li>No, seriously.</li>
            <li>I love the powder now and just bought some more from Ulta (sorry Sephora).</li>
            <li>I received this a day later than promised but totally worth the wait.</li>
            <li>But, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a normal oily.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth; does not cake; takes extreme heat before my face gets at all shiny; does not make me break out</li>
            <li>I literally live on this finishing powder.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without</li>
            <li>Also one container lasts a LONG time, so the price is well worth it.</li>
            <li>My pores looked non-existent totally changed the whole look of my face today!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had a chance to use this, while it&#x27;s hot outside, and now with the temperatures dropping (along with the humidity).  </li>
            <li>Since using Tarte cosmetics, my skin has improved, and I actually get compliments on my complexion again for the first time since I was in my 30s.</li>
            <li>But when I put this on in the morning, I&#x27;m completely shine-free ALL DAY!</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals for many years, I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s a bit dry for my face during the winter, since we moved to West Virginia, where the humidity is low.  </li>
            <li>It goes on clear EXCEPT for by my nose.</li>
            <li>Also, if you accidentally get too much on your brush, it will turn your skin white and you have to go over it with your brush about 20 times to get it out.</li>
            <li>My skin might just be too sensitive for this stuff</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of anything, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t understand why one wouldn&#x27;t just buy it directly from tarte or ulta or Sephora,</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to screw the top on, and if you don&#x27;t get the cap on just right, it gets stuck.</li>
            <li>My advice - play around with the amount of powder you need if it&#x27;s not effective at first until you find the right level.</li>
            <li>This is truly one of those products that I&#x27;ll use probably until I die (unless they invent some new skin technology in the future idk).</li>
            <li>At first, I couldn&#x27;t get much out the little hole that&#x27;s supposed to ration out just enough powder for each application.  </li>
            <li>Also, my face is extremely oily and with this it goes right back to oily by lunch time.</li>
            <li>I like Tarte products as they are natural, and nourish the skin while providing a sheer veil over foundation or make up.</li>
            <li>I also have really oily hair that must be washed daily unless I use a dry shampoo spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first two days it made my skin feel almost unbearably tight, despite my trusty moisturizer, and I was going to stop using it.</li>
            <li>I remembered that I had this little sample powder and tried it for the first time to set my concealer under the eyes.  </li>
            <li>But the third day it felt less tight, and the fourth was much better, and then I didn&#x27;t feel it all.</li>
            <li>After a reapplication a few hours later, it seems to be a little more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the little hole on the container does not allow enough power to come through without LOTS of effort, so I take a small metal awl and poke more holes into the container...</li>
            <li>I had the same trouble with my first container, but on my second one I did not try to enlarge the hole in the screen under the lid.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m 52 years old, I still have a lot of oil in my t-zone, especially in the summer, but the skin under my eyes can become a bit dry.  </li>
            <li>few more times before the day ends (which would make my skin look dull and then break out).</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but like everything I&#x27;m sure other companies will try to copy it as its a good seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lose</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure everyone with oily skin thinks it&#x27;s very oily</li>
            <li> that was super fast!!..</li>
            <li> I have a 13-14 hour military job this finishing powder had me looking good all day even through the sweat it stayed a beautyful oil free Matte finish for me ; )</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> This goes on like silk and it doesn&#x27;t take very much at all for full coverage.  </li>
            <li> it really feels so smooth on my face,it doesn&#x27;t look chalky..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> It takes a very small amount; just a light dusting does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve put it on, then used a 15x LED lighted mirror later in the day to check the performance of Tarte Smooth Operator, and I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
            <li> But I love many other Tarte products</li>
            <li> Well...........it is very fine powder which is what I like about, but not much of big difference between this clay finishing powder and my Laura Mercier lose powder.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had such a great product in such crappy packaging before...</li>
            <li> It glides on really smoothly and feels very soft under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It feels very silky on the skin is very finely milled and works even on bare skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does control oil better than any other powder I&#x27;ve tried but it doesn&#x27;t work as great for me as some other reviewers.</li>
            <li> Like the powder very much...</li>
            <li> Purchased a couple weeks ago, and at first did not like it.</li>
            <li> So, I started using much more powder a week ago (before I would shake the container only 3-4 times, but now I shake 5-6 times).</li>
            <li> My face now remains pretty oil-free at noon, and seems to remain so the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Not quite sure what the big deal is.</li>
            <li> I am tempted to buy this entire line :-)</li>
            <li> that said, I LOVE the eyeshadow and mascara and will be reviewing that next.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know how, because it&#x27;s translucent, but it does!</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s really hot</li>
            <li> Trying to find a makeup for this unique combination of 50+ year old skin, and oily/dry skin combo has been a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and makes my makeup stay longer, but it&#x27;s so hard to get out and really touchy.</li>
            <li> Well, wouldn&#x27;t you know this powder not only settled beautifully after checking a 1/2 hour later, but lasted me the entire work day for the first time!</li>
            <li> I also like that it&#x27;s pretty pure and doesn&#x27;t contain a bunch of lab created chemicals.</li>
            <li> &quot; I couldn&#x27;t wait to buy this powder after I&#x27;ve read the positive reviews,so i decided to try it my self.</li>
            <li> and I was doing something strenuous, sometimes I&#x27;ll put a little more around my nose midway through the day and problem solved!</li>
            <li> The only problem that I have with the product is easily remedied:  </li>
            <li> For anyone with large pores...this is a must.  </li>
            <li> Even after several hours my makeup is in place, and not settled into fine lines.</li>
            <li> thanks sephora.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to everyone!..</li>
            <li> I wear it over my makeup (to set it) and I wear it when I&#x27;m wearing no makeup, and it controls shine and evens out my face all day, unless I&#x27;m doing something intense like working out (</li>
            <li> It controls the shine for MUCH longer than BE.</li>
            <li> This powder is better then i expected.</li>
            <li> I have a combinational skin and my face is very shiny in the T-zones.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s colorless, you really don&#x27;t see it on the face.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> but mine really is.</li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li> What I really like it for, is my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I used many different products and so far this one works wonders for me.</li>
            <li> Looks white at first but quickly blends in.</li>
            <li> I never thought it would be anything particularly special, and just stuck with regular drugstore brand powder..</li>
            <li> Just tried this for the first time today, and I can see a HUGE difference from the other powder I had been using (NVEY Eco).  </li>
            <li> I would definitely buy a full size of this product.</li>
            <li> I thought my old powder covered my pores pretty well...</li>
            <li> No, seriously.</li>
            <li> I love the powder now and just bought some more from Ulta (sorry Sephora).</li>
            <li> I received this a day later than promised but totally worth the wait.</li>
            <li> But, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a normal oily.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth; does not cake; takes extreme heat before my face gets at all shiny; does not make me break out</li>
            <li> I literally live on this finishing powder.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without</li>
            <li> Also one container lasts a LONG time, so the price is well worth it.</li>
            <li> My pores looked non-existent totally changed the whole look of my face today!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a chance to use this, while it&#x27;s hot outside, and now with the temperatures dropping (along with the humidity).  </li>
            <li> Since using Tarte cosmetics, my skin has improved, and I actually get compliments on my complexion again for the first time since I was in my 30s.</li>
            <li> But when I put this on in the morning, I&#x27;m completely shine-free ALL DAY!</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals for many years, I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s a bit dry for my face during the winter, since we moved to West Virginia, where the humidity is low.  </li>
            <li> It goes on clear EXCEPT for by my nose.</li>
            <li> Also, if you accidentally get too much on your brush, it will turn your skin white and you have to go over it with your brush about 20 times to get it out.</li>
            <li> My skin might just be too sensitive for this stuff</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of anything, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t understand why one wouldn&#x27;t just buy it directly from tarte or ulta or Sephora,</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to screw the top on, and if you don&#x27;t get the cap on just right, it gets stuck.</li>
            <li> My advice - play around with the amount of powder you need if it&#x27;s not effective at first until you find the right level.</li>
            <li> This is truly one of those products that I&#x27;ll use probably until I die (unless they invent some new skin technology in the future idk).</li>
            <li> At first, I couldn&#x27;t get much out the little hole that&#x27;s supposed to ration out just enough powder for each application.  </li>
            <li> Also, my face is extremely oily and with this it goes right back to oily by lunch time.</li>
            <li> I like Tarte products as they are natural, and nourish the skin while providing a sheer veil over foundation or make up.</li>
            <li> I also have really oily hair that must be washed daily unless I use a dry shampoo spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first two days it made my skin feel almost unbearably tight, despite my trusty moisturizer, and I was going to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I remembered that I had this little sample powder and tried it for the first time to set my concealer under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> But the third day it felt less tight, and the fourth was much better, and then I didn&#x27;t feel it all.</li>
            <li> After a reapplication a few hours later, it seems to be a little more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the little hole on the container does not allow enough power to come through without LOTS of effort, so I take a small metal awl and poke more holes into the container...</li>
            <li> I had the same trouble with my first container, but on my second one I did not try to enlarge the hole in the screen under the lid.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m 52 years old, I still have a lot of oil in my t-zone, especially in the summer, but the skin under my eyes can become a bit dry.  </li>
            <li> few more times before the day ends (which would make my skin look dull and then break out).</li>
            <li> I get extremely oily on my T-zone just a few hours after doing my makeup, no matter the weather, but especially when it&#x27;s hot.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin which would be an oil slick by noontime.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say whether or not it has any effect on my pore size.</li>
            <li> It is pretty messy but what else is to be expected of a loose powder.</li>
            <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve been dealing with really shiny skin.</li>
            <li> I had a sample size in my collection a long time before trying it.  </li>
            <li> but it controls the ouk for a long time</li>
            <li> I set my makeup with it in the morning and the effect lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> the first few days I used this, it dried out my skin a lot.</li>
            <li> and I mean VERY.</li>
            <li> At first, I applied only a little bit of powder because other reviews noted you just needed a small amount.</li>
            <li> With my other products my face would get all shiny again in the middle of the day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently not able to open the container because of this and have been trying to get it open for the last 3 days.</li>
            <li> The Bare Minerals started feeling tight on my face and itching during the winter.  </li>
            <li> Not for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to use much since there  is one little tiny hole that the powder comes out of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like loose powder</li>
            <li> I have to squeeze the sides of the tiny hole just to get some product to come out and tap it upside down repeatedly to get some product.</li>
            <li> My advice: if you have super oilyskin like me, don&#x27;t be afraid to make the sifting hole larger or just pop the lid off all together.  </li>
            <li> Just what I needed and expected.</li>
            <li> (I have acne prone skin); I swear it stays on all day long; the color is translucent,but a little whitish when may face gets tan</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use foundation or any other products.</li>
            <li> Pricy product for such a small container.  </li>
            <li> This was because there was so little left in the container that I couldn&#x27;t get anything out of that wretched little hole.  </li>
            <li> Then I have to re-apply just like any other powder.</li>
            <li> Before then, I just dealt with the results because it was the ONLY product I&#x27;ve used for oily skin that worked for at least a couple hours AND didn&#x27;t cause allergic reactions or acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> Tip: press down on the plastic that covers the powder and the powder comes out of the hole.</li>
            <li> to the &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; store 7 purchase there for much less.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and previously used Primed and Poreless by Too Faced.</li>
            <li> But, my face would still be an oily mess by noon.   </li>
            <li> It made my face feel freakishly tight.</li>
            <li> Within about 30 minutes of washing my face, you can see little pools of oil beginning to form.</li>
            <li> I was amazed and also a little disappointed that I hadn&#x27;t been reaping the full benefits of the powder&#x27;s ability over the 5 months of using the product.  </li>
            <li> Does not look or feel heavy.</li>
            <li> they gave me few samples too\\&quot;perfumes\\</li>
            <li> So if this happens to you, give it a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually, I put my makeup on around 6:45 am and by 7:20 am when I&#x27;m on the express train to work, my face already requires blotting to remove excess oil.  </li>
            <li> that usual</li>
            <li> I have been a hard core BE mineral veil fan for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li> Its cheap plastic and awful.</li>
            <li> At least the blessing of this is that it maintains my youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> I usually get shiny by the end of the day, but not with this stuff!  </li>
            <li> It is SO hard to get the powder to come out of the bottom part!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced an issue with a make-up container like this.</li>
            <li> But for the results and confidence it gives me, it&#x27;s a very small price to pay!</li>
            <li> but my concealer under my eyes was creasing like MAD lately.  </li>
            <li> but in no way has &#x27;treated my pore problem permanently, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Sucky thing is, the container it comes in is really lame.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 and people have a very difficult time believing I&#x27;m not a teenager.</li>
            <li> It never happened before, so this was very annoying.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> For me, this is the best finishing powder. It won&#x27;t remove your liquid makeup and gives a nice polished look. Also one container lasts a LONG time, so the price is well worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Skin looks great,matte. Does not look or feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I have very, very oily skin with blemishes, and ever since I started using this finishing powder, my skin looks super smooth, healthy, and it controls my oil production. A great, great fine!</li>
            <li> wooow!!! that was super fast!!.. thanks sephora.  they gave me few samples too\\&quot;perfumes\\&quot; I couldn&#x27;t wait to buy this powder after I&#x27;ve read the positive reviews,so i decided to try it my self. I don&#x27;t like loose powder but when i tried this powder i was so impressed!! it really feels so smooth on my face,it doesn&#x27;t look chalky.. I highly recommend this to everyone!.. Great powder I&#x27;ve ever used!..</li>
            <li> I literally live on this finishing powder.  I wear it over my makeup (to set it) and I wear it when I&#x27;m wearing no makeup, and it controls shine and evens out my face all day, unless I&#x27;m doing something intense like working out (which in that case I&#x27;d just wash up after working out, moisturize my face, and then apply the finishing powder).  It has even been tested in the heat and humidity of tropical Barbados, and even in their summer it controls shine (although you might use it once in the morning and maybe again to freshen up in the evening).  It is for all skin tones, and has never made me break out.  I was so converted I gave this to my mom as a Christmas gift (she had been using mine anyways).  This is truly one of those products that I&#x27;ll use probably until I die (unless they invent some new skin technology in the future idk).</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin look, once I get it onto my brush that is. It is SO hard to get the powder to come out of the bottom part! You have to slam it on your hand so many times. Also, if you accidentally get too much on your brush, it will turn your skin white and you have to go over it with your brush about 20 times to get it out. It&#x27;s a great product and makes my makeup stay longer, but it&#x27;s so hard to get out and really touchy. Not recommended for novice make-up users.</li>
            <li> Purchased a couple weeks ago, and at first did not like it. I have very oily skin which would be an oil slick by noontime. At first, I applied only a little bit of powder because other reviews noted you just needed a small amount. I apply over my mineral powder make-up. It does feel really nice when you first apply. But, my face would still be an oily mess by noon.   So, I started using much more powder a week ago (before I would shake the container only 3-4 times, but now I shake 5-6 times). My face now remains pretty oil-free at noon, and seems to remain so the rest of the day. So I&#x27;m pretty happy with this now.   My advice - play around with the amount of powder you need if it&#x27;s not effective at first until you find the right level.</li>
            <li> I ordered this finishing powder by Tarte, and received it in record time (3 days,) from the seller. The product is excellent, and the shipping was phenomenal. I like Tarte products as they are natural, and nourish the skin while providing a sheer veil over foundation or make up. Very pleased with product and seller.</li>
            <li> I have been a hard core BE mineral veil fan for over 10 years.  I just received my Clay Finishing Powder, and I am so impressed.  When applied, it does not look white or chalky.  It does what it says!  It controls the shine for MUCH longer than BE. This powder gives a matte finish..not the \\&quot;glowy\\&quot; (oil-breakthrough) finish.  And it does make my pores appear much smaller.  For anyone with large pores...this is a must.  I&#x27;ve worn it alone as well as with Tarte Clay Powder Foundatin.  Either way...it looks great!  BE just lost one of their long-time customers!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product along with the blush. I don&#x27;t use foundation or any other products. The finishing powder provides the ultimate finish look. It&#x27;s light weight, smooth, and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Like the powder very much...the price  on this site is a lot more than anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;Go to the &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; store 7 purchase there for much less.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love!!!  Just tried this for the first time today, and I can see a HUGE difference from the other powder I had been using (NVEY Eco).  This goes on like silk and it doesn&#x27;t take very much at all for full coverage.  I usually get shiny by the end of the day, but not with this stuff!  My pores looked non-existent totally changed the whole look of my face today!  My pores aren&#x27;t even big, but there was quite a difference!  Love it!</li>
            <li> It is pretty messy but what else is to be expected of a loose powder. It goes on transparent and is easy to apply, however it&#x27;s almost as if it takes my foundation off or lessens the coverage. Also, my face is extremely oily and with this it goes right back to oily by lunch time. My skin might just be too sensitive for this stuff but it hasn&#x27;t worked for me at all.</li>
            <li> This powder is better then i expected. I have a combinational skin and my face is very shiny in the T-zones. I used many different products and so far this one works wonders for me. With my other products my face would get all shiny again in the middle of the day and i had to do some touch ups w compact powder few more times before the day ends (which would make my skin look dull and then break out). This powder is absolutely amazing, no touch ups in the middle of the day and a very flawless clean look. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Well...........it is very fine powder which is what I like about, but not much of big difference between this clay finishing powder and my Laura Mercier lose powder.  I don&#x27;t think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Absolutely one of the best finishing powders/setting powders out there. I have an nc42/43 skin tone and it does not look &#x27;white or leave a whitish cast on my face. It blends flawlessly like a good transclucent powder. I use a powder brush to apply. It makes my pores look smaller while I&#x27;m wearing it but in no way has &#x27;treated my pore problem permanently, unfortunately. It feels very silky on the skin is very finely milled and works even on bare skin. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, as far as I can tell. I haven&#x27;t tried anything else similar so I haven&#x27;t had anything to compare it too but like everything I&#x27;m sure other companies will try to copy it as its a good seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lose one star for the packaging! Its cheap plastic and awful. I have to squeeze the sides of the tiny hole just to get some product to come out and tap it upside down repeatedly to get some product. Argh! I&#x27;ve never had such a great product in such crappy packaging before...tarte do something!</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Just what I needed and expected.</li>
            <li> Love this powder. Keeps my makeup set all day.</li>
            <li> I had a sample size in my collection a long time before trying it.  I never thought it would be anything particularly special, and just stuck with regular drugstore brand powder.. but my concealer under my eyes was creasing like MAD lately.  It never happened before, so this was very annoying.  I remembered that I had this little sample powder and tried it for the first time to set my concealer under the eyes.  The results were GREAT, my makeup didn&#x27;t crease and this powder is sooo finely milled.  It glides on really smoothly and feels very soft under my eyes.  It never looks like I have powder on either.  All in all, I&#x27;m so glad I found it hiding in my stuff, and it saved a lot of headaches.  I would definitely buy a full size of this product.</li>
            <li> I was on the hunt for a finishing powder that would not settle into fine lines around my eyes after using a concealer.  Although I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals for many years, I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s a bit dry for my face during the winter, since we moved to West Virginia, where the humidity is low.  Although I&#x27;m 52 years old, I still have a lot of oil in my t-zone, especially in the summer, but the skin under my eyes can become a bit dry.  Trying to find a makeup for this unique combination of 50+ year old skin, and oily/dry skin combo has been a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a chance to use this, while it&#x27;s hot outside, and now with the temperatures dropping (along with the humidity).  It goes on flawless.  It does not accentuate fine lines, but it takes care of the shine in my t-zone.  The Bare Minerals started feeling tight on my face and itching during the winter.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with Tarte.  Since it&#x27;s colorless, you really don&#x27;t see it on the face.  It takes a very small amount; just a light dusting does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve put it on, then used a 15x LED lighted mirror later in the day to check the performance of Tarte Smooth Operator, and I&#x27;m impressed.  Even after several hours my makeup is in place, and not settled into fine lines.</li>
            <li> I started using this powder with my Tarte foundation about 6 months ago. Since using it the pores on my nose have become much smaller. I also use it sometimes dusted over moisturizer. Since using Tarte cosmetics, my skin has improved, and I actually get compliments on my complexion again for the first time since I was in my 30s. I noticed some have difficulty with the container. I had the same trouble with my first container, but on my second one I did not try to enlarge the hole in the screen under the lid. Instead, it works better to hold the container over the upturned lid and use your finger to tap the powder into it, then use your brush to apply.  It works easily this way and prevents wasting powder.</li>
            <li> Not for anyone with dry skin. It made my face feel freakishly tight. I returned it. But I love many other Tarte products</li>
            <li> Not quite sure what the big deal is. I didn&#x27;t notice much of anything, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, very fine powder, easy to apply. Tip: press down on the plastic that covers the powder and the powder comes out of the hole.</li>
            <li> Best powder ever.  Feels like silk, makes your skin look flawless.  Looks white at first but quickly blends in. Doesn&#x27;t make your wrinkles more pronounced the way a lot of powders do.  But I don&#x27;t understand why one wouldn&#x27;t just buy it directly from tarte or ulta or Sephora, the price her is nutso.</li>
            <li> I received this a day later than promised but totally worth the wait. I love it. I have oily skin and previously used Primed and Poreless by Too Faced. There is no comparison. Tarte&#x27;s product does everything it promisesâ€¦keeps the oil at bay and makes for a smooth face. Nobody likes a shiny face. Best part is, no re-applying!! I use this over BB cream or tinted moisturizer. My favorite part is that the company is eco-friendly!! Good clean products. I am tempted to buy this entire line :-)</li>
            <li> I put it on after I apply my liquid foundation (Loreal Infallible). It goes on smooth; does not cake; takes extreme heat before my face gets at all shiny; does not make me break out (I have acne prone skin); I swear it stays on all day long; the color is translucent,but a little whitish when may face gets tan (I  think they have one with a bronze color that I&#x27;m going to try this summer).  The only problem that I have with the product is easily remedied:  the little hole on the container does not allow enough power to come through without LOTS of effort, so I take a small metal awl and poke more holes into the container...voila...all the powder I need! :)</li>
            <li> I have a 13-14 hour military job this finishing powder had me looking good all day even through the sweat it stayed a beautyful oil free Matte finish for me ; )</li>
            <li> Because it arrive timely and product take all oil away.  I may have to you h yo at noon a bit but it controls the ouk for a long time</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and I mean VERY. I&#x27;m sure everyone with oily skin thinks it&#x27;s very oily but mine really is. Within about 30 minutes of washing my face, you can see little pools of oil beginning to form. I also have really oily hair that must be washed daily unless I use a dry shampoo spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I was very excited to try this powder. It goes on clear EXCEPT for by my nose. By my nose, it is visibly white. I had to kind of wipe it off so it wasn&#x27;t so obvious. And I didn&#x27;t use much. It&#x27;s hard to use much since there  is one little tiny hole that the powder comes out of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does control oil better than any other powder I&#x27;ve tried but it doesn&#x27;t work as great for me as some other reviewers. After a reapplication a few hours later, it seems to be a little more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say whether or not it has any effect on my pore size. I think it would take a miracle to help those, though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, I LOVE the eyeshadow and mascara and will be reviewing that next.</li>
            <li> You could get the same results with cornstarch.  Pricy product for such a small container.  Sits in fine lines on your face.  Sending back.</li>
            <li> This is not finishing powder. This is magic fairy dust. No, seriously. This stuff is MAGICAL. I&#x27;m so used to buying cosmetic products that claim to do all these great things, but really don&#x27;t do anything. This does exactly what it says it will do! Minimizes your pores!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this over my SKIN79 BB Cream, and it looks amazing. Any imperfections that that my foundation doesn&#x27;t cover, this does. I really don&#x27;t know how, because it&#x27;s translucent, but it does! I thought my old powder covered my pores pretty well...but then I tried this stuff, and what a difference! You can&#x27;t see any of them, not even the big stubborn ones around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my favorite thing that this does is get rid of my oiliness! I get extremely oily on my T-zone just a few hours after doing my makeup, no matter the weather, but especially when it&#x27;s hot. No product that I&#x27;ve tried has ever helped it. But when I put this on in the morning, I&#x27;m completely shine-free ALL DAY! That is a huge deal for me!!! If it&#x27;s really hot and I was doing something strenuous, sometimes I&#x27;ll put a little more around my nose midway through the day and problem solved! Doesn&#x27;t get cakey at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the first few days I used this, it dried out my skin a lot. The first two days it made my skin feel almost unbearably tight, despite my trusty moisturizer, and I was going to stop using it. But the third day it felt less tight, and the fourth was much better, and then I didn&#x27;t feel it all. I guess my skin just had to get used to it. So if this happens to you, give it a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, this stuff is a bit pricey. But for the results and confidence it gives me, it&#x27;s a very small price to pay!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin that&#x27;s oily.  But, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a normal oily.  I think it&#x27;s a \\&quot;greased my face up like it was competing in a body building competition\\&quot; oily.  Usually, I put my makeup on around 6:45 am and by 7:20 am when I&#x27;m on the express train to work, my face already requires blotting to remove excess oil.  At least the blessing of this is that it maintains my youthful appearance. I&#x27;m 30 and people have a very difficult time believing I&#x27;m not a teenager. Anyway, I love the Tarte amazonian foundation and decided to try this as a compliment to my morning beauty routine.  At first, I couldn&#x27;t get much out the little hole that&#x27;s supposed to ration out just enough powder for each application.  I had to widen the hole in the top of the applicator.  The powder lasted me about five months in this manner. The problem was that I still became oily, just about 4 hours later instead of a 1/2 hour later.  It wasn&#x27;t until I was on my \\&quot;last week\\&quot; of powder that this changed.  This was because there was so little left in the container that I couldn&#x27;t get anything out of that wretched little hole.  Therefore, I popped that piece/lid off the container, then dipped my brush into the powder.  Of course, I got way more powder on my brush that usual and just hoped that the \\&quot;ashy look\\&quot; I gained from using more would dissipate by the time I got on my 7:20 am train.  Well, wouldn&#x27;t you know this powder not only settled beautifully after checking a 1/2 hour later, but lasted me the entire work day for the first time! I was amazed and also a little disappointed that I hadn&#x27;t been reaping the full benefits of the powder&#x27;s ability over the 5 months of using the product.  Before then, I just dealt with the results because it was the ONLY product I&#x27;ve used for oily skin that worked for at least a couple hours AND didn&#x27;t cause allergic reactions or acne breakouts. I love the powder now and just bought some more from Ulta (sorry Sephora). My advice: if you have super oilyskin like me, don&#x27;t be afraid to make the sifting hole larger or just pop the lid off all together.  Trust me, the \\&quot;ashiness\\&quot; will settle into something beautiful between the time you put it on and your commute to work.</li>
            <li> The only powder I&#x27;ve ever repurchased. It works so well on my combination skin. I set my makeup with it in the morning and the effect lasts all day long. My complexion benefits from using it, and I get no adverse skin reactions. The look is flawless yet natural. That&#x27;s all I ask for in a powder! Excellent product, an absolute staple in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I think I like this stuff. Lately, I&#x27;ve been dealing with really shiny skin. I haven&#x27;t had breakouts since I&#x27;ve been using products that work for me (finally). I don&#x27;t like to use foundation, so I thought this stuff would be great because it&#x27;s light and would help absorb the oil. Smooth Operator works nicely on it&#x27;s own, doesn&#x27;t have a color, and evens out your skin tone...but it only works for a couple of hours on me. Max. Then I have to re-apply just like any other powder. What I really like it for, is my eyebrows. It does a really good job of sealing them after I apply eyebrow pencil, so my eyebrows stay in place MUCH longer. I also like that it&#x27;s pretty pure and doesn&#x27;t contain a bunch of lab created chemicals. Sucky thing is, the container it comes in is really lame. It&#x27;s difficult to screw the top on, and if you don&#x27;t get the cap on just right, it gets stuck. I&#x27;ve never experienced an issue with a make-up container like this. I&#x27;m currently not able to open the container because of this and have been trying to get it open for the last 3 days. I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that I&#x27;m going to have to break the plastic open with a hammer and try to scoop the powder into another vessel. For almost 30 bucks, I&#x27;m not quite sure if this powder is worth it.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Can&#x27;t live without</li>
            <li> Tarte makes wonderful products, not just this powder.  My daughter loves this product for good face coverage, i.e., smooth and not clumpy.</li>
