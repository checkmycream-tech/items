            <li>These are nice designs.  </li>
            <li>Nice product</li>
            <li>I was not overly thrilled with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I really liked how they matched and accentuated my gold wedding ring.</li>
            <li>I really liked these stickers.  </li>
            <li>Some of the designs were kind of no bueno</li>
            <li>You get pretty good quality nail things for under two dollars, how can you not be happy with that.</li>
            <li>These are nice quality, very pretty and a great price.</li>
            <li>very pretty on nails and great price..</li>
            <li>I love , I love this..!</li>
            <li>Not so many though but really cute!</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re nice for the price,  actually better.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Not suitable for nail art.</li>
            <li>One day, I&#x27;m sure they will come in handy.</li>
            <li>This gives me many options to maintain the up keep of my own nails.</li>
            <li>Nail glue easily keeps these attached to the nail and you will have to change your nail polish before you need to replace the slices!  </li>
            <li>Super cute, Love THE FREE SHIPPING!!!</li>
            <li>will look great with the hot design nail art I purchased.</li>
            <li>They came rather quickly and were packaged good.</li>
            <li>I really loved these and enjoy using them it was easy to order and was shipped promptly.</li>
            <li>Ok product, but the container to &amp;#34;organize&amp;#34; them is a joke.</li>
            <li>But its cute and i like it.</li>
            <li>This product was ok, would I buy it again?</li>
            <li>Love the item.</li>
            <li>better use in gel polish.</li>
            <li>They are all so cute.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product : In my wheel i received; crowns, hearts with the word love in them, snowflakes, dragonflies, stars, christmas trees, lightning bolts, roses, bows, lips, butterflies, and teddy bears.</li>
            <li>so they hug your nail &amp; apply a top coat.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>they still look cute.</li>
            <li>cute add ons for my nails</li>
            <li>the designs was okay..</li>
            <li>designs was okay.</li>
            <li>Cute.</li>
            <li>There are so many of them and</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>IT WOULD BE BETTER</li>
            <li>I am glad this happened because as i emptied them all out</li>
            <li>Each design had between 7 and 9 pieces and not one had more then 10.</li>
            <li>I would purchase again :)</li>
            <li>but i like most of them.</li>
            <li>Not as many pieces and the contain did not contain the pieces well.</li>
            <li>BUT HOPEFULLY  YOU GUYS CAN PACK IT BETTER.</li>
            <li>By the time it arrived, almost all the pieces were no longer organized and there aren&#x27;t as many on the wheel as there are in the picture.  </li>
            <li>I thought they were more like stickers that go on to the shape of your nail.</li>
            <li>These are more durable than nail polish.</li>
            <li>cheap too!</li>
            <li>so I will be buying more</li>
            <li>Like don&#x27;t love though</li>
            <li>A couple had more but not many.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are too cute and just what I wanted, took a while to get them in the mail</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even knew this was coming with not one but TWO wheel of magical nail</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have many designs(9 designs and most of them are hello kitty)</li>
            <li>but most came out during shipping</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love all the designs.</li>
            <li>It would have been better if I received the stickers as posted in the picture.</li>
            <li>It seemed as there weren&#x27;t to many in the package.</li>
            <li>They are cute, though.  </li>
            <li>Cute item but</li>
            <li>is that when you try to put it on nail on top of design or polish it tends to stick out and snag of fabric or hair.</li>
            <li>Otherwise its okay.</li>
            <li>and it did not contain as many pieces as were in the description.  </li>
            <li>Cute order came just as pictured</li>
            <li>However when I received that package, most of them came out of the container and were just laying in the bag.</li>
            <li>They stuck to the nail after top coat was applied to the nail.</li>
            <li>And then I applied another top coat to make sure that they were on.</li>
            <li>I sure hope they fix the way they package it.</li>
            <li>I guess I have to get creative.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t even know how many are supposed to be in the pack (350?)  </li>
            <li>Love how they look on my nails.</li>
            <li>The cute ones too were the ones lacking quantity</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t count how many were in there, but it arrived on time</li>
            <li>and I think they look really cute on my finger and toe nails.</li>
            <li>I recieved this item on time and it works and will be buying more.</li>
            <li>Cute.</li>
            <li>bee-7; Crown (not a princess type crown more of one that looks like the one on a liquor bottle or something- 8;</li>
            <li>Heart with love - 8;</li>
            <li>Teddy bear - 8 ; Roses - 6; Flowers; 7; Christmas Trees 8; Stars -6 (all but one of these was bent beyond repair) and the design I got the most of was &amp;#34;H&amp;#34; (the letter H).....not sure what to do with that since I don&#x27;t even have an h in my name or know anyone whose name begins with that??</li>
            <li>Fantastic shapes, so shinny!</li>
            <li>So cute.  </li>
            <li>Cute designs.</li>
            <li>I do wish there were more of them, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li>Ok so I didn&#x27;t count how many were in there, but I did the organize them.</li>
            <li>If you like trees, bears, and the letter H, then this is the nail decal set for you. :)</li>
            <li>I gave it a five because is a good product, priced right</li>
            <li>received and grand kids said they were easy to use loved the different designs of heart butter fly and apple  etc</li>
            <li>but for the price they are pretty good.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look as full but still has a nice amount</li>
            <li>I love gold decals and these look like fun! :)</li>
            <li>These are very cool, and would tell my friends to buy,&lt;br /&gt;again</li>
            <li>Oh and most important</li>
            <li>Great little packet of decorations - look beautiful too :) thanks!</li>
            <li>they get adhered with nail polish but get off too easily because they get tangled easily on the clothes or even the hair when you pass your hands by.</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t Bend that easy to your nail.</li>
            <li>Easy to use .Great item .</li>
            <li>Sweet patterns and easy to mold for fitting.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, if you really put a lot of Top Coat on top you might be able to make it look like it belongs on there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I order this mostly because i thought the spiders would be cool for halloween</li>
            <li>Which was fine.</li>
            <li>They were still super cute though</li>
            <li>Either way they are super cute.</li>
            <li>The decoration wheel arrived just as described in the description and photo is an accurate depiction.  </li>
            <li>Accurate description.</li>
            <li>No wonder why this item was so cheap.</li>
            <li>(Ya&#x27;ll, free shipping from China can take up to 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>Took forever to get here,but the price was so cheap</li>
            <li>These slices are great for making different styles.  </li>
            <li>To make them fit against the nail, I had to bend them into a curved shape.</li>
            <li>They got lost in mail when I just ordered them, but the seller has sent me a free replacement.</li>
            <li>Overall, the price was great, and I will still use what I have.</li>
            <li>Light weight and easly to apply.</li>
            <li>I will enjoy using these nail decorations.  </li>
            <li>shape them to fit ur nails</li>
            <li>Overall very nice product though/</li>
            <li>Very pretty and easy to use</li>
            <li>I got them fairly quick beside the package messy it great!</li>
            <li>did contact seller and if they fix the  problem I am willing to purchase again because I really love these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>So bummer that this product is pretty and creative bit</li>
            <li>I would recommended to anyone who wants something cheap and cute</li>
            <li>Good product looks great against black polish.easy to use and ivlove that it has so many different styles ob one wheel.</li>
            <li>They get caught easy if not put on right.</li>
            <li>Fun for nails...  quick and easy</li>
            <li>It was a miss but love them after got them all straight up.</li>
            <li>If it was full like it shows in the picture - 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Some of the designs could be slightly larger but over all good size.  </li>
            <li>The package was ok, I expected a couple more for each design, but it was ok.</li>
            <li>THEY ARE ALL MIXED UP AND MOVE EVRYWHERE., BUT THEY ARE GOOD TO USE STILL.,</li>
            <li>plus im not even sure there is really 10 of each.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d got the full 120 pieces.</li>
            <li>but I feel like I didn&#x27;t get my full order.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good buy overall</li>
            <li>fast shipping, lovely item</li>
            <li>The gold nail art we&#x27;re not bad</li>
            <li>Theyre not bad</li>
            <li>THEY DON&#x27;T FIT RIGHT ON THE NAIL.</li>
            <li>, how could they not slide around??), and I didn&#x27;t get exactly what was pictured,  but I was aware of that as well from the description, so I&#x27;m happy with these, and for the price (between $1 &amp; $2 with free shipping) would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>Wish they came with a shaper to shape it to the contore of the nail but other than that they are great.</li>
            <li>so I had to sort them out but other than that great</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t lay completely flat on your nail, but they still look good.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so tiny and cute, easy to bend to fit my nails.</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>Very durable &amp; still looks great even after multiple wears.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>I super ed glued them on so they would stay on bc</li>
            <li>Very pretty on the nails</li>
            <li>Love these cute fun and very inexpensive everthing that I expected will gladly order again.</li>

            <li>This collection of gold colored metal designs are fun to work with.</li>
            <li>I make sure to put on a clear topcoat though,so they stay on.</li>
            <li>I like these golden stickers</li>
            <li>These are fun to use and the price means you don&#x27;t have to worry if they slip off.</li>

            <li>but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t worth the hassle of stratching your face</li>
            <li>Just have to bend a little bit when you place them on the nails but very nice</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE IT SMALL AND CUTE!</li>
            <li>pretty quick</li>
            <li>I DID NOT HAVE ANYTHING CLOSE TO THE RIGHT AMOUNT.</li>
            <li>only reason I gave them 3 stars is because they really are nice metal designs and as such may be painted if you like (I used silver polish and painted one of my 2 stars silver and it worked nicely).  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used any of them yet, but they look super pretty and very shiny!</li>
            <li>My little flower popped off but still left an impression in my polish that looks awesome (</li>
            <li>love these cute little nail sparkles</li>
            <li>I recently started to take care of my own growing ever so fast nails.</li>
            <li>Very cute and thinner than the other ones I have received before</li>
            <li>These are made of the same stuff as sequins, light weight, shiny and can be curved a little to fit on your nail and a good size for nail decoration.  </li>
            <li>Very light and tiny.</li>
            <li>They are pretty, however I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use them yet.</li>
            <li>Most of the gold pieces have fallen out of the white holder and it looks too tacky to give as a gift.</li>
            <li>Although my wheel was short several pieces, I&#x27;m happy with them and loved the variety offered especially the double c&#x27;s (Chanel logo).  </li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re all quite pretty.</li>
            <li>I paid like $1.25 and no shipping for pretty gold things to put on my nails</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.</li>
            <li>They also came prior to the estimated delivery date. :-)</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll do the job and they&#x27;re really pretty, though.</li>
            <li>the do pretty do I didn&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li>they r really pretty.</li>
            <li>Which can be used in many things not only with nails</li>
            <li>If they are willing to remedy this issue I will change my rating.</li>
            <li>overall im pleased.</li>
            <li>The only note to the users - make sure you bend the stickers a bit before applying to your nails.</li>
            <li>At first I was like</li>
            <li>they did not come in wheel nor did they have any of the designs as shown in picture very upset and will not buy again!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>but they are pretty</li>
            <li>I definitely didn&#x27;t receive as many as were advertised.</li>
            <li>The stickers are pretty but there is not 350 pcs in that container</li>
            <li>Thank so much!</li>
            <li>They are pretty in the case</li>
            <li>First I did not receive 120 designs as stated (12 times 10 &#x3D; 120).</li>
            <li>I love these, not to big</li>
            <li>First of all it seem like it took forever and a day to come.</li>
            <li>it turns out, its probably better than I got two of the same sets.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and was received in time</li>
            <li>but if you can live with that, they are pretty wearable and look most striking on dark colors.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, they were really nice</li>
            <li>I am using nail stone adhesive but nothing is enough to get them to fit right.</li>
            <li>The wheel these nail art decals come in pretty cheap, but the decals are definitely not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t bend the stickers to give them the same curvature as your nails, they will detach easily</li>
            <li>of the designs did come out of the wheel, but easy to put back</li>
            <li>Kind of an odd selection(girl with ponytail, strawberry, star.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast exactly what I expected :)</li>
            <li>I guess it would be fine if I didn&#x27;t work with fragile lace every day, but I cannot risk the decals ripping something.</li>
            <li>The decals don&#x27;t seem to stay in their own little port.</li>
            <li>But they don&#x27;t fit most nail shapes and they are hard to bend.</li>
            <li>And, considering I only paid $1.65 with free shipping, I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>The picture of this product is very misleading.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind so much.</li>
            <li>If you have really curved nails, press them against your nail before you paint it, to get them to curve a bit.</li>
            <li>With my dotting tool designs they really pop.</li>
            <li>so it looks much smoother on your nails.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li>I really like this studs</li>
            <li>Very shiny and cute!&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really wouldn&#x27;t bothered me to get fewer of some if it had evened out</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not getting as much use out of them as I would like.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m definitely gonna enjoy using these</li>
            <li>and I REALLY wanted the crown.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The phrase &amp;#34;350buy&amp;#34; is very misleading, it makes the conumer think they&#x27;re buying 350 pcs.</li>
            <li>bow.&lt;br /&gt;They really need to change their shipping methods/packaging</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I use the Sally Hansen quick dry in clearly quick..</li>
            <li>For instance, on my pinkies, I needed to do extra top coat to keep the edges of the snowflakes I did for Christmas from being free and sharp and poke-y.</li>
            <li>Since the designs were flat it was a little hard to fit it properly on the nail, if you bend it a titch, the product is fine, and the designs are beautiful!</li>
            <li>Gold but not overpowering/ overwhelming like some other nail effects.</li>
            <li>but they make up for it by adding more of other designs.</li>
            <li>The need to be curved to fit  the nail, but they are flat.</li>
            <li>Super cute assortment, but they were all mixed up together when they arrived due to jostling.</li>
            <li>Its pretty easy to shake them out and organize them, you just have to remember to never shake it or turn it upside down again.</li>
            <li>didnt have half as many as i thought it should very cheap product not worth the buy</li>
            <li>like them but kind of small to work with</li>
            <li>cute, but not worth it.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t give you a full set of any design, there was only like eight of each design</li>
            <li>Nice and small to adjust any where on the nail bed.</li>
            <li>I put them under the top coat of my gel polish and then just dry top coat with the UV lamp, as usual.</li>
            <li>I think they would look even better on darker colors, blues, greens or black if you like a bolder look.</li>
            <li>Works best with crazy glue (when she tried using it with just a clear coat it wouldn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li>I mainly use these on my daughter and she loves them.</li>
            <li>i love how thin and small they are,  great size for any nail bed.</li>
            <li>the other pieces are nice, especially the butterflies</li>
            <li>Hello kitty one&#x27;s by far my fav!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love all of the little gold metal charms I can put on my finger nails.</li>
            <li>I love these little metal designs.  </li>
            <li>I use a clear topcoat instead of glue, then I coat the whole nail, after the decal has set.</li>
            <li>so there is no way to use for a manicure unless someone is missing a finger or more.</li>
            <li>Comes in a really handy case that keeps these a little larger than glitter in place until you need them.</li>
            <li>They were pretty long, but I was able to cut them down.</li>
            <li>I like light colors on my nails and thought they might stand out to much for everyday.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the wheel they are in doesn&#x27;t do a good job of keeping the designs separate.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE these little things!</li>
            <li>Other than that, these would be better glued to paper or something to that effect, than to be used on an actual nail.</li>
            <li>No pattern came with all ten so can&#x27;t do a consistent design.</li>
            <li>the pieces are a bit to big and to flat to fit on ur nail</li>
            <li>They stay just fine on nail if you curve a little</li>
            <li>BUT it certainly does not appear to be threehundredandfifty different nail art.</li>
            <li>I will probably order more of these when I start to run low; they are easy to use and look nice, adding a touch of detail to normally boring nails</li>
            <li>clear finger nail polish didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>It displays a  &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; wheel of emblems although the actual amount of product received was very scarce and scattered.  </li>
            <li>They do not bend very well around your nail so be prepared for them to stick up above the nail somewhat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  not a nail art professional</li>
            <li>i thought they were in a soft material</li>
            <li>I really like the different designs.</li>
            <li>Most of the decals were on the outside of the selection wheel and a few of them were bent.</li>
            <li>When they arrived they were kind of over the place because they are so thin</li>
            <li>While I had more than ten in some designs, I got less than ten in others.</li>
            <li>I even put an extra thick top coat and it still did not sit flush to my nail.</li>
            <li>extremely small, really feel like I wasted my money, but glad the seller refunded me my money.</li>
            <li>Less than ten means I&#x27;m relegated to accent nails rather than a full set.</li>
            <li>I like these fine, they will be used, just accept the fact that you will have to sort them all out because when you get them they will be all mixed up and also, there will be some you will only have a few of</li>
            <li>It left a completely smooth surface and the mani lasted about two weeks just as usual.  </li>
            <li>Oh, they also came in a bit early, only took 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>Ten is a pretty minimal number when talking about a manicure.</li>
            <li>Stayed only nails with a thick top coat, however the pieces were mixed together</li>
            <li>It was irritating, but not awful.</li>
            <li>Where to start, it took a month for the thing to come, then the case lid is not tight so the different gold nail art pieces mix together when u flip it around (and how it came) and if u do order look at the pic and imagine like 1/8 of that</li>
            <li>and I had to sit down and sort them out right after I got them because they had gotten all mixed together.</li>
            <li>but I tried putting these on and they&#x27;re super stiff and do not bend enough to go on my nail.</li>
            <li>Overall, these are a fun little buy.</li>
            <li>There was not 1 single design that had 10</li>
            <li>The other reason is because the don&#x27;t stay don&#x27;t on my nail and when i try to touch them down, the edges really hurt and are really pointy.</li>
            <li>I mean, if you have really flat straight nails, this is really for you!</li>
            <li>Although I am somewhat pleased with my gold nail art decals,  I am super disappointed with the way they came in the packaging itself.</li>
            <li>These are small and just right for my nails, and I like that they are gold.</li>
            <li>Super thick like metal punch outs</li>
            <li>So be thankful for free shipping, even if it&#x27;s slow!</li>
            <li>I applied a couple on the last steps of a gel nail manicure by pressing the tiny butterfly on over a small area of wet topcoat and then went under the UV light for about 30 seconds then applied topcoat over the entire nail.  </li>

            <li> These are nice designs.  </li>
            <li> Nice product</li>
            <li> I was not overly thrilled with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I really liked how they matched and accentuated my gold wedding ring.</li>
            <li> I really liked these stickers.  </li>

            <li> One day, I&#x27;m sure they will come in handy.</li>
            <li> This gives me many options to maintain the up keep of my own nails.</li>
            <li> Nail glue easily keeps these attached to the nail and you will have to change your nail polish before you need to replace the slices!  </li>
            <li> Super cute, Love THE FREE SHIPPING!!!</li>
            <li> will look great with the hot design nail art I purchased.</li>
            <li> They came rather quickly and were packaged good.</li>
            <li> I really loved these and enjoy using them it was easy to order and was shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> Ok product, but the container to &amp;#34;organize&amp;#34; them is a joke.</li>
            <li> But its cute and i like it.</li>
            <li> This product was ok, would I buy it again?</li>
            <li> Love the item.</li>
            <li> better use in gel polish.</li>
            <li> They are all so cute.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product : In my wheel i received; crowns, hearts with the word love in them, snowflakes, dragonflies, stars, christmas trees, lightning bolts, roses, bows, lips, butterflies, and teddy bears.</li>
            <li> so they hug your nail &amp; apply a top coat.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> they still look cute.</li>
            <li> cute add ons for my nails</li>
            <li> the designs was okay..</li>
            <li> designs was okay.</li>
            <li> Cute.</li>
            <li> There are so many of them and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> IT WOULD BE BETTER</li>
            <li> I am glad this happened because as i emptied them all out</li>
            <li> Each design had between 7 and 9 pieces and not one had more then 10.</li>
            <li> I would purchase again :)</li>
            <li> but i like most of them.</li>
            <li> Not as many pieces and the contain did not contain the pieces well.</li>
            <li> BUT HOPEFULLY  YOU GUYS CAN PACK IT BETTER.</li>
            <li> By the time it arrived, almost all the pieces were no longer organized and there aren&#x27;t as many on the wheel as there are in the picture.  </li>
            <li> I thought they were more like stickers that go on to the shape of your nail.</li>
            <li> These are more durable than nail polish.</li>
            <li> cheap too!</li>
            <li> so I will be buying more</li>
            <li> Like don&#x27;t love though</li>
            <li> A couple had more but not many.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are too cute and just what I wanted, took a while to get them in the mail</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even knew this was coming with not one but TWO wheel of magical nail</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have many designs(9 designs and most of them are hello kitty)</li>
            <li> but most came out during shipping</li>
            <li> /&gt;i love all the designs.</li>
            <li> It would have been better if I received the stickers as posted in the picture.</li>
            <li> It seemed as there weren&#x27;t to many in the package.</li>
            <li> They are cute, though.  </li>
            <li> Cute item but</li>
            <li> is that when you try to put it on nail on top of design or polish it tends to stick out and snag of fabric or hair.</li>
            <li> Otherwise its okay.</li>
            <li> and it did not contain as many pieces as were in the description.  </li>
            <li> Cute order came just as pictured</li>
            <li> However when I received that package, most of them came out of the container and were just laying in the bag.</li>
            <li> They stuck to the nail after top coat was applied to the nail.</li>
            <li> And then I applied another top coat to make sure that they were on.</li>
            <li> I sure hope they fix the way they package it.</li>
            <li> I guess I have to get creative.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t even know how many are supposed to be in the pack (350?)  </li>
            <li> Love how they look on my nails.</li>
            <li> The cute ones too were the ones lacking quantity</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t count how many were in there, but it arrived on time</li>
            <li> and I think they look really cute on my finger and toe nails.</li>
            <li> I recieved this item on time and it works and will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Cute.</li>
            <li> bee-7; Crown (not a princess type crown more of one that looks like the one on a liquor bottle or something- 8;</li>
            <li> Heart with love - 8;</li>
            <li> Teddy bear - 8 ; Roses - 6; Flowers; 7; Christmas Trees 8; Stars -6 (all but one of these was bent beyond repair) and the design I got the most of was &amp;#34;H&amp;#34; (the letter H).....not sure what to do with that since I don&#x27;t even have an h in my name or know anyone whose name begins with that??</li>
            <li> Fantastic shapes, so shinny!</li>
            <li> So cute.  </li>
            <li> Cute designs.</li>
            <li> I do wish there were more of them, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li> Ok so I didn&#x27;t count how many were in there, but I did the organize them.</li>
            <li> If you like trees, bears, and the letter H, then this is the nail decal set for you. :)</li>
            <li> I gave it a five because is a good product, priced right</li>
            <li> received and grand kids said they were easy to use loved the different designs of heart butter fly and apple  etc</li>
            <li> but for the price they are pretty good.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look as full but still has a nice amount</li>
            <li> I love gold decals and these look like fun! :)</li>
            <li> These are very cool, and would tell my friends to buy,&lt;br /&gt;again</li>
            <li> Oh and most important</li>
            <li> Great little packet of decorations - look beautiful too :) thanks!</li>
            <li> they get adhered with nail polish but get off too easily because they get tangled easily on the clothes or even the hair when you pass your hands by.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t Bend that easy to your nail.</li>
            <li> Easy to use .Great item .</li>
            <li> Sweet patterns and easy to mold for fitting.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, if you really put a lot of Top Coat on top you might be able to make it look like it belongs on there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I order this mostly because i thought the spiders would be cool for halloween</li>
            <li> Which was fine.</li>
            <li> They were still super cute though</li>
            <li> Either way they are super cute.</li>
            <li> The decoration wheel arrived just as described in the description and photo is an accurate depiction.  </li>
            <li> Accurate description.</li>
            <li> No wonder why this item was so cheap.</li>
            <li> (Ya&#x27;ll, free shipping from China can take up to 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Cheap.</li>
            <li> Took forever to get here,but the price was so cheap</li>
            <li> These slices are great for making different styles.  </li>
            <li> To make them fit against the nail, I had to bend them into a curved shape.</li>
            <li> They got lost in mail when I just ordered them, but the seller has sent me a free replacement.</li>
            <li> Overall, the price was great, and I will still use what I have.</li>
            <li> Light weight and easly to apply.</li>
            <li> I will enjoy using these nail decorations.  </li>
            <li> shape them to fit ur nails</li>
            <li> Overall very nice product though/</li>
            <li> Very pretty and easy to use</li>
            <li> I got them fairly quick beside the package messy it great!</li>
            <li> did contact seller and if they fix the  problem I am willing to purchase again because I really love these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> So bummer that this product is pretty and creative bit</li>
            <li> I would recommended to anyone who wants something cheap and cute</li>
            <li> Good product looks great against black polish.easy to use and ivlove that it has so many different styles ob one wheel.</li>
            <li> They get caught easy if not put on right.</li>
            <li> Fun for nails...  quick and easy</li>
            <li> It was a miss but love them after got them all straight up.</li>
            <li> If it was full like it shows in the picture - 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Some of the designs could be slightly larger but over all good size.  </li>
            <li> The package was ok, I expected a couple more for each design, but it was ok.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE ALL MIXED UP AND MOVE EVRYWHERE., BUT THEY ARE GOOD TO USE STILL.,</li>
            <li> plus im not even sure there is really 10 of each.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d got the full 120 pieces.</li>
            <li> but I feel like I didn&#x27;t get my full order.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good buy overall</li>
            <li> fast shipping, lovely item</li>
            <li> The gold nail art we&#x27;re not bad</li>
            <li> Theyre not bad</li>
            <li> THEY DON&#x27;T FIT RIGHT ON THE NAIL.</li>
            <li> , how could they not slide around??), and I didn&#x27;t get exactly what was pictured,  but I was aware of that as well from the description, so I&#x27;m happy with these, and for the price (between $1 &amp; $2 with free shipping) would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Wish they came with a shaper to shape it to the contore of the nail but other than that they are great.</li>
            <li> so I had to sort them out but other than that great</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t lay completely flat on your nail, but they still look good.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so tiny and cute, easy to bend to fit my nails.</li>
            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> Very durable &amp; still looks great even after multiple wears.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I super ed glued them on so they would stay on bc</li>
            <li> Very pretty on the nails</li>
            <li> Love these cute fun and very inexpensive everthing that I expected will gladly order again.</li>
            <li> Overall I love these!</li>
            <li> These are so pretty!</li>
            <li> but I definitely will be ordering more after I run out!</li>
            <li> Thanks Enjoy what I received from your store</li>
            <li> This collection of gold colored metal designs are fun to work with.</li>
            <li> I make sure to put on a clear topcoat though,so they stay on.</li>
            <li> I like these golden stickers</li>
            <li> These are fun to use and the price means you don&#x27;t have to worry if they slip off.</li>
            <li> Have fun dressing your nails.</li>
            <li> but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t worth the hassle of stratching your face</li>
            <li> Just have to bend a little bit when you place them on the nails but very nice</li>
            <li> AND I LOVE IT SMALL AND CUTE!</li>
            <li> pretty quick</li>
            <li> I DID NOT HAVE ANYTHING CLOSE TO THE RIGHT AMOUNT.</li>
            <li> only reason I gave them 3 stars is because they really are nice metal designs and as such may be painted if you like (I used silver polish and painted one of my 2 stars silver and it worked nicely).  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used any of them yet, but they look super pretty and very shiny!</li>
            <li> My little flower popped off but still left an impression in my polish that looks awesome (</li>
            <li> love these cute little nail sparkles</li>
            <li> I recently started to take care of my own growing ever so fast nails.</li>
            <li> Very cute and thinner than the other ones I have received before</li>
            <li> These are made of the same stuff as sequins, light weight, shiny and can be curved a little to fit on your nail and a good size for nail decoration.  </li>
            <li> Very light and tiny.</li>
            <li> They are pretty, however I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use them yet.</li>
            <li> Most of the gold pieces have fallen out of the white holder and it looks too tacky to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> Although my wheel was short several pieces, I&#x27;m happy with them and loved the variety offered especially the double c&#x27;s (Chanel logo).  </li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re all quite pretty.</li>
            <li> I paid like $1.25 and no shipping for pretty gold things to put on my nails</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.</li>
            <li> They also came prior to the estimated delivery date. :-)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll do the job and they&#x27;re really pretty, though.</li>
            <li> the do pretty do I didn&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li> they r really pretty.</li>
            <li> Which can be used in many things not only with nails</li>
            <li> If they are willing to remedy this issue I will change my rating.</li>
            <li> overall im pleased.</li>
            <li> The only note to the users - make sure you bend the stickers a bit before applying to your nails.</li>
            <li> At first I was like</li>
            <li> they did not come in wheel nor did they have any of the designs as shown in picture very upset and will not buy again!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> but they are pretty</li>
            <li> I definitely didn&#x27;t receive as many as were advertised.</li>
            <li> The stickers are pretty but there is not 350 pcs in that container</li>
            <li> Thank so much!</li>
            <li> They are pretty in the case</li>
            <li> First I did not receive 120 designs as stated (12 times 10 &#x3D; 120).</li>
            <li> I love these, not to big</li>
            <li> First of all it seem like it took forever and a day to come.</li>
            <li> it turns out, its probably better than I got two of the same sets.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and was received in time</li>
            <li> but if you can live with that, they are pretty wearable and look most striking on dark colors.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, they were really nice</li>
            <li> I am using nail stone adhesive but nothing is enough to get them to fit right.</li>
            <li> The wheel these nail art decals come in pretty cheap, but the decals are definitely not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t bend the stickers to give them the same curvature as your nails, they will detach easily</li>
            <li> of the designs did come out of the wheel, but easy to put back</li>
            <li> Kind of an odd selection(girl with ponytail, strawberry, star.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast exactly what I expected :)</li>
            <li> I guess it would be fine if I didn&#x27;t work with fragile lace every day, but I cannot risk the decals ripping something.</li>
            <li> The decals don&#x27;t seem to stay in their own little port.</li>
            <li> But they don&#x27;t fit most nail shapes and they are hard to bend.</li>
            <li> And, considering I only paid $1.65 with free shipping, I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> The picture of this product is very misleading.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind so much.</li>
            <li> If you have really curved nails, press them against your nail before you paint it, to get them to curve a bit.</li>
            <li> With my dotting tool designs they really pop.</li>
            <li> so it looks much smoother on your nails.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> I really like this studs</li>
            <li> Very shiny and cute!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really wouldn&#x27;t bothered me to get fewer of some if it had evened out</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not getting as much use out of them as I would like.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m definitely gonna enjoy using these</li>
            <li> and I REALLY wanted the crown.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The phrase &amp;#34;350buy&amp;#34; is very misleading, it makes the conumer think they&#x27;re buying 350 pcs.</li>
            <li> bow.&lt;br /&gt;They really need to change their shipping methods/packaging</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I use the Sally Hansen quick dry in clearly quick..</li>
            <li> For instance, on my pinkies, I needed to do extra top coat to keep the edges of the snowflakes I did for Christmas from being free and sharp and poke-y.</li>
            <li> Since the designs were flat it was a little hard to fit it properly on the nail, if you bend it a titch, the product is fine, and the designs are beautiful!</li>
            <li> Gold but not overpowering/ overwhelming like some other nail effects.</li>
            <li> but they make up for it by adding more of other designs.</li>
            <li> The need to be curved to fit  the nail, but they are flat.</li>
            <li> Super cute assortment, but they were all mixed up together when they arrived due to jostling.</li>
            <li> Its pretty easy to shake them out and organize them, you just have to remember to never shake it or turn it upside down again.</li>
            <li> didnt have half as many as i thought it should very cheap product not worth the buy</li>
            <li> like them but kind of small to work with</li>
            <li> cute, but not worth it.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t give you a full set of any design, there was only like eight of each design</li>
            <li> Nice and small to adjust any where on the nail bed.</li>
            <li> I put them under the top coat of my gel polish and then just dry top coat with the UV lamp, as usual.</li>
            <li> I think they would look even better on darker colors, blues, greens or black if you like a bolder look.</li>
            <li> Works best with crazy glue (when she tried using it with just a clear coat it wouldn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> I mainly use these on my daughter and she loves them.</li>
            <li> i love how thin and small they are,  great size for any nail bed.</li>
            <li> the other pieces are nice, especially the butterflies</li>
            <li> Hello kitty one&#x27;s by far my fav!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love all of the little gold metal charms I can put on my finger nails.</li>
            <li> I love these little metal designs.  </li>
            <li> I use a clear topcoat instead of glue, then I coat the whole nail, after the decal has set.</li>
            <li> so there is no way to use for a manicure unless someone is missing a finger or more.</li>
            <li> Comes in a really handy case that keeps these a little larger than glitter in place until you need them.</li>
            <li> They were pretty long, but I was able to cut them down.</li>
            <li> I like light colors on my nails and thought they might stand out to much for everyday.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the wheel they are in doesn&#x27;t do a good job of keeping the designs separate.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these little things!</li>
            <li> Other than that, these would be better glued to paper or something to that effect, than to be used on an actual nail.</li>
            <li> No pattern came with all ten so can&#x27;t do a consistent design.</li>
            <li> the pieces are a bit to big and to flat to fit on ur nail</li>
            <li> They stay just fine on nail if you curve a little</li>
            <li> BUT it certainly does not appear to be threehundredandfifty different nail art.</li>
            <li> I will probably order more of these when I start to run low; they are easy to use and look nice, adding a touch of detail to normally boring nails</li>
            <li> clear finger nail polish didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It displays a  &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; wheel of emblems although the actual amount of product received was very scarce and scattered.  </li>
            <li> They do not bend very well around your nail so be prepared for them to stick up above the nail somewhat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  not a nail art professional</li>
            <li> i thought they were in a soft material</li>
            <li> I really like the different designs.</li>
            <li> Most of the decals were on the outside of the selection wheel and a few of them were bent.</li>
            <li> When they arrived they were kind of over the place because they are so thin</li>
            <li> While I had more than ten in some designs, I got less than ten in others.</li>
            <li> I even put an extra thick top coat and it still did not sit flush to my nail.</li>
            <li> extremely small, really feel like I wasted my money, but glad the seller refunded me my money.</li>
            <li> Less than ten means I&#x27;m relegated to accent nails rather than a full set.</li>
            <li> I like these fine, they will be used, just accept the fact that you will have to sort them all out because when you get them they will be all mixed up and also, there will be some you will only have a few of</li>
            <li> It left a completely smooth surface and the mani lasted about two weeks just as usual.  </li>
            <li> Oh, they also came in a bit early, only took 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> Ten is a pretty minimal number when talking about a manicure.</li>
            <li> Stayed only nails with a thick top coat, however the pieces were mixed together</li>
            <li> It was irritating, but not awful.</li>
            <li> Where to start, it took a month for the thing to come, then the case lid is not tight so the different gold nail art pieces mix together when u flip it around (and how it came) and if u do order look at the pic and imagine like 1/8 of that</li>
            <li> and I had to sit down and sort them out right after I got them because they had gotten all mixed together.</li>
            <li> but I tried putting these on and they&#x27;re super stiff and do not bend enough to go on my nail.</li>
            <li> Overall, these are a fun little buy.</li>
            <li> There was not 1 single design that had 10</li>
            <li> The other reason is because the don&#x27;t stay don&#x27;t on my nail and when i try to touch them down, the edges really hurt and are really pointy.</li>
            <li> I mean, if you have really flat straight nails, this is really for you!</li>
            <li> Although I am somewhat pleased with my gold nail art decals,  I am super disappointed with the way they came in the packaging itself.</li>
            <li> These are small and just right for my nails, and I like that they are gold.</li>
            <li> Super thick like metal punch outs</li>
            <li> So be thankful for free shipping, even if it&#x27;s slow!</li>
            <li> I applied a couple on the last steps of a gel nail manicure by pressing the tiny butterfly on over a small area of wet topcoat and then went under the UV light for about 30 seconds then applied topcoat over the entire nail.  </li>
            <li> Worth the few bucks I spent on them.</li>
            <li> It was dang near EMPTY!  </li>
            <li> Other than that you get what you see as far as the figures go.</li>
            <li> Yes, they were a mess in the wheel, but I was aware of that from other reviews (and they&#x27;re so slim</li>
            <li> Keep in mind these are metal and they are flat so on smaller nails, the surface may not lay flat.</li>
            <li> They do not lay flat.  </li>
            <li> The stickers are flat and the nails are a bit curved.</li>
            <li> bend them to the shape of your nail before trying to use them as they are flat and</li>
            <li> Until then, I will try to teach my nails on how to stay flat.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s flat and doesn&#x27;t have a curve so it doesn&#x27;t stay on nails.  </li>
            <li> Does not go on flat at all.....</li>
            <li> Indeed, these little creatures meant to live on our nails will not bend to the shape on my nails.</li>
            <li> &gt;  1 crown (13th extra piece, different from all the other crowns)&lt;br /&gt;bummed out about the hearts but</li>
            <li> BUT they don&#x27;t lay flat so the edges get caught on everything!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when these finally got to my house, only to be super disappointed when I opened the package to notice ONE little tiny gold bow in the disk they package them in. :</li>
            <li> I received these yesterday and they were all mixed up &amp; laying loose in the bag because they slipped through and out of container.</li>
            <li> They did take a little long to get here, but look how far its coming from.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the rigidity of these decals makes it difficult to place them securely to a nail.  </li>
            <li> Both the decals (they&#x27;re NOT stickers) and the storage case were smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> The stickers are not soft.</li>
            <li> I got them earlier then I expected anlove them they were in the case.</li>
            <li> the wire metal things bend and scratch when not completely covered by gel nail polish</li>
            <li> I only got 3-5 of each one and there are 3 spaces that are completely empty after organizing.</li>
            <li> I am certainly not looking forward to sorting them and putting into the wheel properly!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> the nail art pieces aren&#x27;t like the pieces in the picture, has some of them but only half of them with different shapes</li>
            <li> To stiff to put on natural nails.</li>
            <li> 13 crowns (different from the other two crowns)&lt;br /</li>
            <li> However due to shipping process the pieces were all mixed up and out of the wheel, so I had some sorting to do</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to see from the photos, but there are all different decorations here, from the Dior logo to Hello Kitty that you can use to create fun, flirty nail art.  </li>
            <li> Only order if you only care about getting a few pieces.</li>
            <li> The container is hard to open and its a tiny tiny container.</li>
            <li> The majority of the companies that I have dealt with through AMAZON have been above average that I just expect that from each company I deal with.</li>
            <li> It worked better but the stickers still get stuck in the clothes and hair and that&#x27;s very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> the wheel is a bit loose</li>
            <li> and although they were all out of the holder none were loose in the envelope and could not have fallen out.</li>
            <li> product is as described except you might not get 10 pcs of each design which is the only down</li>
            <li> let it dry a bit, then another coat or two, and it seals it in quite well!</li>
            <li> The pieces are pretty, but they are useless if you want to use them with a regular manicure.</li>
            <li> you only get half the amount that it shows in the picture.</li>
            <li> Was a mess, and only a couple where as shown.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re  a big mess</li>
            <li> Only drawback is that the items don&#x27;t stay in their little bin.</li>
            <li> I tried to follow an advise left by a customer here and wrapped it around a pencil and bent it a little bit, but it didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> The container wheel was all mixed up, but was enclosed in a little zip loc bag and none were lost.  </li>
            <li> suggest getting the little wax-tip pencil made for picking up tiny things like this.</li>
            <li> they do come a little mixed up</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> But I expected that.</li>
            <li> So I have 4 missing, 2 crowns and 2 bigger sized butterflies making what I recieved 116 instead of 120.</li>
            <li> Shipping was forever but that was expected.  </li>
            <li> It came faster than the expected delivery date which even though it took three weeks</li>
            <li> expected I would recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> During shipment everything shifted and spilled, so I had to spend time empty the case out and sorting them.</li>
            <li> so I decided to empty each compartment to re-organize them so it would be easier to find the design I want......</li>
            <li> If you are careful with removal, you can try to reuse them.</li>
            <li> Be careful gold does not go with every color.</li>
            <li> There were only a few pieces in the wheel.</li>
            <li> It came as a expected &amp; On time.</li>
            <li> which what a pain to organize myself, and they aren&#x27;t as thin as every one has been saying they are which was the main reason I gave them a 3.</li>
            <li> Missing over half of the supplies, not bothered by them being mixed</li>
            <li> i love u sticker and queen&#x27;s crown :(</li>
            <li> The decals are small enough, but do not bend.</li>
            <li> to those complaining that the metal slices were everywhere but the wheel; thats to be expected!</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> some other one that looks like 1 C and 1 backwards C stuck together&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> But other than that, they worked well.</li>
            <li> I wish they came in silver or other metal colors.</li>
            <li> When I used these and would touch my hair it would get stuck on these because they are not able to get close enough to the nail fully.</li>
            <li> They are small enough to put on any nail.</li>
            <li> I was afraid these were going to be more like confetti than hard metal, but they arent.</li>
            <li> Way less than I expected.</li>
            <li> the box is too small, I expected a little bigger</li>
            <li> these were cheep to buy but tiny very hard to put on the nail they are flat and the edges stay up</li>
            <li> u glue them down or the edges stick up .. other than that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sad about because I wanted the certain ones that were in the picture</li>
            <li> When I received the package, all of the things were mixed together and they are hard</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only reason I am giving this a 4 star is because they are hard.</li>
            <li> Is it tht hard to pick them out and pop them back in..?</li>
            <li> Defiantly not worth your money.</li>
            <li> I had to take 3 hours out of my time to organize these decals not a fun job ..</li>
            <li> I suppose some strange word I&#x27;m not exactly sure what it says</li>
            <li> AND NOT WORTH $2 ...</li>
            <li> Of the 12 designs, they broke down like this:&lt;br /&gt;butterfly-</li>
            <li> Which comes down to under a penny per nail.  </li>
            <li> Odd assortment.</li>
            <li> It arrived with less than half of what&#x27;s supposed to be in the wheel.</li>
            <li> Only thing was wrong was they were mixed up an i had to sort them.</li>
            <li> is I bent them slightly, then put them in place on my design.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the amount it was less than 350</li>
            <li> You can bend them slightly to match curve of nail.</li>
            <li> These were a mess when I got them..</li>
            <li> I think a lot of people are being a little over reactive about their ratings.</li>
            <li> As u can tell I&#x27;m a little upset bc of that reason..</li>
            <li> They are a little bulky and don&#x27;t want to form to my nail.</li>
            <li> IF THEY WERE LESS STIFF</li>
            <li> The little shapes are so thin they were coming out of the container and are all mixed up.  </li>
            <li> I did this by pressing it against a round pencil.</li>
            <li> the edges will stick out if you don&#x27;t - try pushing them against a round polish bottle with tweezers to get uniform curve.  </li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The decals are not smooth, they get caught on your clothing.</li>
            <li> However they do slip and get mixed up in the wheel because of how thin they are.</li>
            <li> (I received the letter H) and childish (teddy bears and whatnot)</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan.</li>
            <li> When the package came half of them were out of the container!</li>
            <li> they are too stiff they don&#x27;t bend to stick to your nail.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also stiff metal</li>
            <li> Not easy to use.</li>
            <li> definitely not worth getting!!</li>
            <li> so I find it hard to bend these little things into a shape that will stay on my nails</li>
            <li> I now have three empty spaces!!!!</li>
            <li> Difficult to shape to the nail bed properly causing it to be ripped off my nail during sleep.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they are completely different then on the picture.</li>
            <li> to re-organize them i realized i was missing A LOT of pieces!</li>
            <li> i had 4 designs with 11 each, 7 with 10 each and 1 design with only 9 plus one random heart.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with The production.</li>
            <li> some of the decorations were coming out of the container and they are so small that it was difficult to put hem back</li>
            <li> I like these and was not sure I would.</li>
            <li> Their 2 small &amp; their glue on didn&#x27;t like them</li>
            <li> was not happy had to scramble to find other ones in my area</li>
            <li> Small and delicate shapes.</li>
            <li> i am missing a few from several designs, and the wheel holder is horrible at holding these, several got bent trying to get them out of the wheel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Star</li>
            <li> The pieces are too hard, doesn&#x27;t bend.</li>
            <li> Artful but sort of hard to put on</li>
            <li> JUST HARD TO WORK WITH.</li>
            <li> A bit curved and hard to place on the nail plate.</li>
            <li> and it came in a little plastic bag!!</li>
            <li> You have to bend them which sucks.</li>
            <li> Sucks not even 100 pieces🙅</li>
            <li> Was really slow getting here and had fallen out of the container.</li>
            <li> They are so tiny and delicate and look very expensive on the nail.</li>
            <li> also the shapes are very small</li>
            <li> Even with gel polish, it&#x27;s difficult to get them to stay down with no lifting.</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> this products is not good it doesn&#x27;t attach to your nail</li>
            <li> so no good</li>
            <li> not good for nail art.</li>
            <li> I did however learn the hard way, you cannot use heat on these!</li>
            <li> So disappointed, I didn&#x27;t received which I selected and received either 350, only got me 100!!</li>
            <li> BUT they were very hard to work with because there three dimensional.</li>
            <li> They shipped poorly &amp; were all over the place.</li>
            <li> logo- 10 (one was broken, so 9)&lt;br /&gt;Apple (Mac) logo-</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a gold thin metal.</li>
            <li> They are so thin they slide all over the place and have no respect for compartment dividers.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s frustrating.</li>
            <li> I think picking a random letter as a design is a poor choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed about that.</li>
            <li> All designs had 10-13 pieces, and a random playboy bunny.</li>
            <li> But, for random selection, why pick the letter &amp;#34;F&amp;#34;?? 13 of them.</li>
            <li> and I would never use some random name for design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to give them to a friend who crafts.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re advertised as \\&quot;Nail Art\\&quot;, and it&#x27;s useless for that.</li>
            <li> but i did receive a lot of designs that i would never use and i realize that it says you will get a random set</li>
            <li> so I pasted them with fake nails glue.</li>
            <li> n&#x27;t it was at random</li>
            <li> I recieved some weird ones that ill never use.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what ill do with that.</li>
            <li> They end up sticking  our of your nail weirdly</li>
            <li> These are very thin, and they&#x27;ve been shipped across the globe, it happens.</li>
            <li> Just disappointing.</li>
            <li> It is disappointing when they do not</li>
            <li> For the price, you absolutely can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Not too bad for the price though.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m waiting to see how bad it gets.</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with this item not because it was not good but because it was horribly shipped.</li>
            <li> 12 :((</li>
            <li> Came with like 2 jewels in each compartment. :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;So disappointed.</li>
            <li> So that is very annoying...</li>
            <li> These are awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They are pretty, however I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use them yet.</li>
            <li> it is wonderful.it is very great for those people who like decorating their own nails</li>
            <li> Got this to give as a gift.  Most of the gold pieces have fallen out of the white holder and it looks too tacky to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> not what i ordered but they are cute.they also was spilled out of the wheel and i had to reorganize them and put them back they did come a week before shipping date</li>
            <li> Ok product, but the container to &amp;#34;organize&amp;#34; them is a joke. Forget even trying to fix it either, because as soon as you move it, they get mixed up again.</li>
            <li> They are nice but I don&#x27;t like them on my nails. Had to bend them to put on my nails. Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> like them but kind of small to work with</li>
            <li> Arrived 7 days earlier than the earliest date. Was a mess, and only a couple where as shown. But I expected that. All designs had 10-13 pieces, and a random playboy bunny. But, for random selection, why pick the letter &amp;#34;F&amp;#34;?? 13 of them. I think picking a random letter as a design is a poor choice. 13 pieces I won&#x27;t use. Not too bad for the price though.</li>
            <li> Odd assortment. Difficult to shape to the nail bed properly causing it to be ripped off my nail during sleep.</li>
            <li> Just have to bend a little bit when you place them on the nails but very nice</li>
            <li> The pieces are too hard, doesn&#x27;t bend. If it wasn&#x27;t for the low price I would&#x27;ve asked for my money back. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter absolutely loved these, they are perfect for her nail designs. Quantity &amp; quality were satisfactory. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The picture of this product is very misleading.  It displays a  &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; wheel of emblems although the actual amount of product received was very scarce and scattered.  I doubt if there&#x27;s even 60 pieces total. Definitely not 120 pieces.  And they&#x27;re not stickers as the title suggests.  They&#x27;re tiny non-stick metal pieces.  Although my wheel was short several pieces, I&#x27;m happy with them and loved the variety offered especially the double c&#x27;s (Chanel logo).  And, considering I only paid $1.65 with free shipping, I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
            <li> The container is hard to open and its a tiny tiny container. But its cute and i like it.</li>
            <li> The decals don&#x27;t seem to stay in their own little port. So you have to separate them.</li>
            <li> very cute, but omg, all of them spilled out of the container into the plastic sleeve!!!</li>
            <li> Overall I love these! For the price, you absolutely can&#x27;t go wrong! They were pretty long, but I was able to cut them down. Also, they shed a lot so I&#x27;m waiting to see how bad it gets. I did however learn the hard way, you cannot use heat on these! Other than that, they were really nice and I might even buy a second pair.</li>
            <li> Packing was a miss the charm was all mixed the divier don&#x27;t work.  It was a miss but love them after got them all straight up.</li>
            <li> This product was ok, would I buy it again? Ummm don&#x27;t think so. They don&#x27;t shape to the nail correctly. You have to bend them which sucks. They get caught easy if not put on right. No wonder why this item was so cheap. Oh and it took forever to get to my house. cute, but not worth it.</li>
            <li> very pretty on nails and great price..</li>
            <li> Love the item. Only drawback is that the items don&#x27;t stay in their little bin. They were all mixed up</li>
            <li> So I have 4 missing, 2 crowns and 2 bigger sized butterflies making what I recieved 116 instead of 120. Shipping was forever but that was expected.  Its good material and I have no complaints except I wanted the 120 in total that I paid for that is all. P.s. one of the designs says Carter. ..and I would never use some random name for design.</li>
            <li> They shipped poorly &amp; were all over the place. I had to spend 1/2 hour sorting &amp; putting in correct wells.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t contour to nail well, snag on everything</li>
            <li> So cute! You get ten of each and they&#x27;re all quite pretty. Keep in mind these are metal and they are flat so on smaller nails, the surface may not lay flat. For instance, on my pinkies, I needed to do extra top coat to keep the edges of the snowflakes I did for Christmas from being free and sharp and poke-y.</li>
            <li> The item it&#x27;s the same as the picture. I have not used them yet but for the price they are pretty good. I will definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Everyone who is complaining about these... look at what you paid! LOL. I feel like I got a good value for the price. NO, you probably won&#x27;t get the same designs pictured. I got SOME of those...the butterfly, the tiara, snowflake, etc... and some others. No, I didn&#x27;t get a uniform number of each design, but I did get plenty. Yes, they were all mixed up. These are very thin, and they&#x27;ve been shipped across the globe, it happens. They&#x27;re going to move around in this packaging (mine didn&#x27;t come out, just all about the wheel). If that&#x27;s going to bother you, you&#x27;re going to want to store them differently. I don&#x27;t mind so much. Of the 12 designs, they broke down like this:&lt;br /&gt;butterfly- 9&lt;br /&gt;heart- 14&lt;br /&gt;Lips- 14&lt;br /&gt;snowflake-11&lt;br /&gt;tiara- 10 (one was bent, so 9)&lt;br /&gt;bow 1- 9&lt;br /&gt;bow 2- 11&lt;br /&gt;flower- 13&lt;br /&gt;rose- 9&lt;br /&gt;Star- 10&lt;br /&gt;Chanel logo- 10 (one was broken, so 9)&lt;br /&gt;Apple (Mac) logo- 9 (not a fan, lol. But I liked the others!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I got 129 pieces total, no complaints! Oh, they also came in a bit early, only took 2 weeks! (Ya&#x27;ll, free shipping from China can take up to 6 weeks. But I work for a company that ships stuff to and from China a lot, and just DOCUMENTS run us about $45 one way. So be thankful for free shipping, even if it&#x27;s slow! lol). Overall, these are a fun little buy. If you have really curved nails, press them against your nail before you paint it, to get them to curve a bit. I use the Sally Hansen quick dry in clearly quick.. I do a think coat, place the decal on, let it dry a bit, then another coat or two, and it seals it in quite well!</li>
            <li> I got them fairly quick beside the package messy it great!</li>
            <li> It arrived with less than half of what&#x27;s supposed to be in the wheel. Purchase at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I worth the money!!!! really good !!!! i LOVE it!. just like in the picture. better use in gel polish.</li>
            <li> Defiantly not worth your money. When the package came half of them were out of the container!</li>
            <li> The wheel these nail art decals come in pretty cheap, but the decals are definitely not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used any of them yet, but they look super pretty and very shiny! I love gold decals and these look like fun! :)</li>
            <li> Mine did with the nail things falling out of the container but it honestly does not bother me at all. I paid like $1.25 and no shipping for pretty gold things to put on my nails and that&#x27;s exactly what I got. They are all so cute. It came faster than the expected delivery date which even though it took three weeks that&#x27;s great. I think a lot of people are being a little over reactive about their ratings. You get pretty good quality nail things for under two dollars, how can you not be happy with that.</li>
            <li> I got what I wanted and I&#x27;m happy. Was upset that they were all over the place but that&#x27;s not anyone&#x27;s fault. It gets moved around, what do you expect.</li>
            <li> Some pieces only came with 3 in a slot. Not even enough to do 1 set of nails. If it was full like it shows in the picture - 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Shipping : Received before estimated arrival date so that was great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product : In my wheel i received; crowns, hearts with the word love in them, snowflakes, dragonflies, stars, christmas trees, lightning bolts, roses, bows, lips, butterflies, and teddy bears. They stay just fine on nail if you curve a little so they hug your nail &amp; apply a top coat.</li>
            <li> Yes they were all over the place when they arrived, however they are beautiful. With my dotting tool designs they really pop. Love them. They also came prior to the estimated delivery date. :-)</li>
            <li> Some of the designs could be slightly larger but over all good size.  More variety of designs would be great!</li>
            <li> Very cute and thinner than the other ones I have received before so it looks much smoother on your nails.</li>
            <li> Item  was as stated and came about the time expected I would recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today and i eas very happy with the item. Only thing was wrong was they were mixed up an i had to sort them. It was 12 designs and i got 10 of each.</li>
            <li> receive merchandise  on Friday. some items were mixed up but that wasn&#x27;t a problem. so I sorted them and found all 12 designs with 10 of each in the wheel, and items as described. 350buy is the brand not the quantity. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> this products is not good it doesn&#x27;t attach to your nail it doesn&#x27;t have the shape or your name so no good</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a stocking stuffer for my teenage daughter. She loves it. Works best with crazy glue (when she tried using it with just a clear coat it wouldn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> This collection of gold colored metal designs are fun to work with. They are a good price but come from China so you have to wait a week or two to get them. They do not bend very well around your nail so be prepared for them to stick up above the nail somewhat. Comes in a really handy case that keeps these a little larger than glitter in place until you need them.</li>
            <li> THESE THINGS ARE VERY TINY.  I just received the product today</li>
            <li> They do not lay flat.  Not easy to use.</li>
            <li> I finally received them in the mail today. Unfortunately they are completely different then on the picture. I got some Christmas trees, smiley faces, stars, the letter V, different shape of butterfly&#x27;s. But for the price I am not too worried about it they still look cute.</li>
            <li> the box is too small, I expected a little bigger</li>
            <li> cute add ons for my nails</li>
            <li> The package was ok, I expected a couple more for each design, but it was ok. Since the designs were flat it was a little hard to fit it properly on the nail, if you bend it a titch, the product is fine, and the designs are beautiful!</li>
            <li> the stickers are not the same what i have seen on the picture!!! has come 10 kind Metal Slice Stickers instead of 12 :(( no i love u sticker and queen&#x27;s crown :(</li>
            <li> Thank you for your product Angelica M</li>
            <li> Slower shipping.. the designs was okay.. designs was okay. The wheel it came in wasn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li> Was really slow getting here and had fallen out of the container.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get what you see in the picture...  I bought two sets of these different times and still almost got the same symbols..</li>
            <li> When I received the package, all of the things were mixed together and they are hard so they do not form to your nail which means they get stuck on a lot  of stuff.</li>
            <li> Cute. Came quickly. Cheap. What else can you ask for</li>
            <li> not gold, fall apart, extremely small, really feel like I wasted my money, but glad the seller refunded me my money. definitely not worth getting!!</li>
            <li> Not enough quantity. Color as picture.</li>
            <li> Havent get this,..take for ever for the order?&lt;br /&gt;I cant wait to see it. And i hope i like it</li>
            <li> These are small and just right for my nails, and I like that they are gold. i think they will add something extra to my nail designs. Gold but not overpowering/ overwhelming like some other nail effects.</li>
            <li> Just what I thought they&#x27;d be.  Took forever to get here,but the price was so cheap I didn&#x27;t care.  they&#x27;re nice for the price,  actually better. I make sure to put on a clear topcoat though,so they stay on.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these little things! There are so many of them and the designs are just the cutest. Very very happy!!!</li>
            <li> Both the decals (they&#x27;re NOT stickers) and the storage case were smaller than I expected. The white storage case fits in the palm of my hand with room left over. During shipment everything shifted and spilled, so I had to spend time empty the case out and sorting them. They&#x27;ll do the job and they&#x27;re really pretty, though. Designs include a bow, a hello kitty head, a Christmas tree, a teddy bear, a butterfly, a crown, a snowflake, a flower, a rose (flower, stem, and leaves), a heart, a coach symbol, and \\&quot;Dior\\&quot;. NOT WHAT WAS PICTURED.&lt;br /&gt;The number of pieces vary from design to design. I received 6 heart decals, 5 \\&quot;Dior\\&quot; decals, 7 bow decals...&lt;br /&gt;Not suitable for nail art. The decals are small enough, but do not bend. I even put an extra thick top coat and it still did not sit flush to my nail. I guess it would be fine if I didn&#x27;t work with fragile lace every day, but I cannot risk the decals ripping something. I&#x27;m just going to give them to a friend who crafts.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re advertised as \\&quot;Nail Art\\&quot;, and it&#x27;s useless for that.</li>
            <li> the nail art pieces aren&#x27;t like the pieces in the picture, has some of them but only half of them with different shapes</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> I like these golden stickers but you do have to tweek them to mold to your nail. If any corners or edges aren&#x27;t flush with nail, they get snagged on things. As with most beauty tools you learn how  to perfect it. It&#x27;s a bargain. I put mine into a bigger organizer.</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with this item not because it was not good but because it was horribly shipped. All of the gold stickers were out of the wheel and falling everywhere out of the envelope when i opened it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok you get what you paid</li>
            <li> There good but they were kinda scattered around in different places but the do pretty do I didn&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li> Very pretty and easy to use</li>
            <li> loved the item, great price</li>
            <li> Artful but sort of hard to put on</li>
            <li> Great selection of art to put on nails. Thanks Enjoy what I received from your store</li>
            <li> These slices are great for making different styles.  It&#x27;s difficult to see from the photos, but there are all different decorations here, from the Dior logo to Hello Kitty that you can use to create fun, flirty nail art.  I will probably order more of these when I start to run low; they are easy to use and look nice, adding a touch of detail to normally boring nails</li>
            <li> no way to put them on</li>
            <li> PIECES NOT FLEXIBLE ENOUGH! THEY DON&#x27;T FIT RIGHT ON THE NAIL. GOOD QUALITY, JUST HARD TO WORK WITH. IF THEY WERE LESS STIFF IT WOULD BE BETTER HOW THEY SIT ON THE NAIL, ESPECIALLY IF THE NAILS ARE SHORT.</li>
            <li> I received these yesterday and they were all mixed up &amp; laying loose in the bag because they slipped through and out of container. I am glad this happened because as i emptied them all out to re-organize them i realized i was missing A LOT of pieces! There was not 1 single design that had 10 so there is no way to use for a manicure unless someone is missing a finger or more. Each design had between 7 and 9 pieces and not one had more then 10. The item itself is as described and i have no problem with that but i did receive a lot of designs that i would never use and i realize that it says you will get a random set so that is understandable. I contacted seller and will see what happens from here. Just disappointing.</li>
            <li> I really like this studs they r really pretty. Which can be used in many things not only with nails</li>
            <li> product is as described except you might not get 10 pcs of each design which is the only down but they make up for it by adding more of other designs. I would purchase again :)</li>
            <li> I received my purchase today...I am dissapointed.  Once I opened the package I realized that all of the pieces were mixed up...so I decided to empty each compartment to re-organize them so it would be easier to find the design I want......that&#x27;s when I truly realized that I only have 9 different designs and there are anot a lot of each design.  After putting them back into the wheel I now have three empty spaces!!!! I contacted the seller....hopefully they get back to me soon.  If they are willing to remedy this issue I will change my rating.</li>
            <li> got different designs than the picture but i like most of them. i had 4 designs with 11 each, 7 with 10 each and 1 design with only 9 plus one random heart. to those complaining that the metal slices were everywhere but the wheel; thats to be expected! overall im pleased.</li>
            <li> Not as many pieces and the contain did not contain the pieces well. They were still super cute though</li>
            <li> I was afraid these were going to be more like confetti than hard metal, but they arent. They&#x27;re a gold thin metal. To make them fit against the nail, I had to bend them into a curved shape. I did this by pressing it against a round pencil. Worked great. Also, I have used one piece (a bow) on atleast 3 seperate manicures now. I use a clear topcoat instead of glue, then I coat the whole nail, after the decal has set. When I want to change my mani, I just remove the polish with any remover, &amp; save the decal to reuse. Very durable &amp; still looks great even after multiple wears.</li>
            <li> I rated this a 3 star because when it arrived the metal slices where not in it&#x27;s container it was all over the envelope it came with.</li>
            <li> The stickers are so awesome! They got lost in mail when I just ordered them, but the seller has sent me a free replacement. And I love them! I put them under the top coat of my gel polish and then just dry top coat with the UV lamp, as usual. Very shiny and cute!&lt;br /&gt; The only note to the users - make sure you bend the stickers a bit before applying to your nails. The stickers are flat and the nails are a bit curved. If you don&#x27;t bend the stickers to give them the same curvature as your nails, they will detach easily</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED IT AND I LOVE IT SMALL AND CUTE! BUT HOPEFULLY  YOU GUYS CAN PACK IT BETTER., THE GOLD METALS ARE EVERYWHERE., BUT THEY ARE CUTE! AS YOU CAN TELL IN THE PHOTO THEY ARE ALL MIXED UP AND MOVE EVRYWHERE., BUT THEY ARE GOOD TO USE STILL.,</li>
            <li> By the time it arrived, almost all the pieces were no longer organized and there aren&#x27;t as many on the wheel as there are in the picture.  Overall very nice product though/</li>
            <li> I only got 3 different types of designs, and it didn&#x27;t even come in the wheel. At first I was like oh it&#x27;s in a bag so they don&#x27;t spill all over the place, but then I realized that they weren&#x27;t in a wheel because there were only three different types.  Yes it was nice and dandy that I received it a week earlier than the arrival date, but what I received totally ruined it!!</li>
            <li> Maybe someone can help me out but I tried putting these on and they&#x27;re super stiff and do not bend enough to go on my nail. They fall off immediately. I am using nail stone adhesive but nothing is enough to get them to fit right. I thought they were more like stickers that go on to the shape of your nail.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all mixed up when i got them plus im not even sure there is really 10 of each. I wouldnt recommend buying them.</li>
            <li> the stickers look very nice but i wish they were thinner. I tried to follow an advise left by a customer here and wrapped it around a pencil and bent it a little bit, but it didn&#x27;t help. After couple hours of wearing the stickers fell of from nails.</li>
            <li> I did my daughter nails and they look good she likes them can&#x27;t wait to do my own nail</li>
            <li> Cute! Worth the few bucks I spent on them.</li>
            <li> These are fun to use and the price means you don&#x27;t have to worry if they slip off. These are more durable than nail polish.</li>
            <li> I like these fine, they will be used, just accept the fact that you will have to sort them all out because when you get them they will be all mixed up and also, there will be some you will only have a few of but if you can live with that, they are pretty wearable and look most striking on dark colors.  TIP:  bend them to the shape of your nail before trying to use them as they are flat and the edges will stick out if you don&#x27;t - try pushing them against a round polish bottle with tweezers to get uniform curve.  If you are careful with removal, you can try to reuse them.</li>
            <li> Not at all what people said they worked great for me ad I&#x27;m just a kid definetly buy!☝️And cheap too!</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money. Not satisfied with The production.</li>
            <li> some of the decorations were coming out of the container and they are so small that it was difficult to put hem back</li>
            <li> Very beautiful....Everything I would want for the beautification of my nails....Arrived much earlier that estimated delivery date....And they cane from overseas....Very impressed.</li>
            <li> They were all mixed upwhen I recieved it.</li>
            <li> Love these cute fun and very inexpensive everthing that I expected will gladly order again. All the charms were in the package. And i got them on time</li>
            <li> I really loved these and enjoy using them it was easy to order and was shipped promptly. Wish they came with a shaper to shape it to the contore of the nail but other than that they are great.</li>
            <li> im changing the review im giving a 5 star because the sellers contacted me and giving me the missing pieces I really like the designs and for them to fix the problem im really happy so I will be buying more</li>
            <li> I like these and was not sure I would. I like light colors on my nails and thought they might stand out to much for everyday. Was impressed that they did not. Be careful gold does not go with every color. I think they would look even better on darker colors, blues, greens or black if you like a bolder look. Have fun dressing your nails.</li>
            <li> Great gift for a friend</li>
            <li> I bought two of these design and it works great!!! I will buy again if the price doesnt goes up. Works wonderfully,  I would recommended to anyone who wants something cheap and cute</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the ones I ordered!!!! So that is very annoying... and it came in a little plastic bag!! Not the wheel it shows in th  picture....</li>
            <li> Although they came within the time they stated they would they were all over the package. I am not going to count them BUT it certainly does not appear to be threehundredandfifty different nail art. I am certainly not looking forward to sorting them and putting into the wheel properly!!!!!!! The majority of the companies that I have dealt with through AMAZON have been above average that I just expect that from each company I deal with. It is disappointing when they do not</li>
            <li> Like don&#x27;t love though</li>
            <li> i did not receive what i ordered.  i got actual nails  to packs no nail art stickers!!! was not happy had to scramble to find other ones in my area</li>
            <li> Although I am somewhat pleased with my gold nail art decals,  I am super disappointed with the way they came in the packaging itself. Most of the decals were on the outside of the selection wheel and a few of them were bent. Also, what the picture shows compared to what I got is not the same. Overall, the price was great, and I will still use what I have.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars for effort. There was not even 100 pieces in the container. Only order if you only care about getting a few pieces.</li>
            <li> The decoration wheel arrived just as described in the description and photo is an accurate depiction.  Nail glue easily keeps these attached to the nail and you will have to change your nail polish before you need to replace the slices!  The designs are great and offer an array of variety!</li>
            <li> they did not come in wheel nor did they have any of the designs as shown in picture very upset and will not buy again!</li>
            <li> There were only a few pieces in the wheel. Way less than I expected.</li>
            <li> Good product looks great against black polish.easy to use and ivlove that it has so many different styles ob one wheel.</li>
            <li> these were cheep to buy but tiny very hard to put on the nail they are flat and the edges stay up I would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> To stiff to put on natural nails.</li>
            <li> only HAD 3 IN EACH SLOT ;;{ I DO NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE,,, NOT ENOUGH STICKERS..I WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> the variety wasn&#x27;t as great as shown but I did get a good selection. I mainly use these on my daughter and she loves them.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE, LOVING IT !!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I got these today, 3 days before the earliest estimated delivery date. They were all out and messed up. Which was fine. I organized them myself and counted of them. I did get 12 designs but there was only 1 of them that actually had 10. A couple had more but not many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got:&lt;br /&gt;9 butterflys&lt;br /&gt;9 snowflakes&lt;br /&gt;11 hearts&lt;br /&gt;9 Chanel symbols&lt;br /&gt;9 hello kitty faces&lt;br /&gt;10 crowns&lt;br /&gt;7 bows&lt;br /&gt;6 teddy bears&lt;br /&gt;12 Christmas trees&lt;br /&gt;9 flowers&lt;br /&gt;7 roses&lt;br /&gt;13 Dior&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really wouldn&#x27;t bothered me to get fewer of some if it had evened out and I&#x27;d got the full 120 pieces. I could just use them on accent nails or whatever but I feel like I didn&#x27;t get my full order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did contact seller and if they fix the  problem I am willing to purchase again because I really love these. I will also change the rating if they fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be an actual product review up on my blog after I get the chance to try these out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannahsnails11.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> Very pretty on the nails</li>
            <li> They are too cute and just what I wanted, took a while to get them in the mail but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Came with so many!! Cute hello kitty, lips, anchors! Would buy it again!</li>
            <li> excellent and beautiful product</li>
            <li> The gold nail art we&#x27;re not bad</li>
            <li> just as claimed. Very light and tiny. Good packaging and shipping.</li>
            <li> will look great with the hot design nail art I purchased.</li>
            <li> Yes, they were a mess in the wheel, but I was aware of that from other reviews (and they&#x27;re so slim, how could they not slide around??), and I didn&#x27;t get exactly what was pictured,  but I was aware of that as well from the description, so I&#x27;m happy with these, and for the price (between $1 &amp; $2 with free shipping) would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Love them they are gorgeous , but they came out the package so I had to sort them out but other than that great</li>
            <li> A bit curved and hard to place on the nail plate.</li>
            <li> Got these today, shipping took awhile but I was in no rush.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m assorting them now since they came all mixed up. They&#x27;re so tiny and cute, easy to bend to fit my nails. But I wish I got heart shaped ones though, that was basically the only reason I bought it and I have none :(&lt;br /&gt;I got: 13 rounded shaped crowns&lt;br /&gt;  10 bows&lt;br /&gt;  11 joker looking kind of hat/crown (idk)&lt;br /&gt;  9 barbie girly heads&lt;br /&gt;  7 butterflies&lt;br /&gt;  13 crowns (different from the other two crowns)&lt;br /&gt;  12 flowers&lt;br /&gt;  20 gucci labels&lt;br /&gt;  16 stars&lt;br /&gt;  20 anchors&lt;br /&gt;  12 lips&lt;br /&gt;  25 smiley faces (p.s I could have done without the smiley faces, gross)&lt;br /&gt;  1 crown (13th extra piece, different from all the other crowns)&lt;br /&gt;bummed out about the hearts but the other pieces are nice, especially the butterflies</li>
            <li> excellent product I recommend</li>
            <li> These are great for nail art.  My only complaint is that the wheel they are in doesn&#x27;t do a good job of keeping the designs separate.  A lot of mine were mixed up when I received them, but the pieces are big so it is not as big of a deal.</li>
            <li> The decals are not smooth, they get caught on your clothing.</li>
            <li> so cute! just what I needed. Thank you</li>
            <li> They are so thin they slide all over the place and have no respect for compartment dividers. Its pretty easy to shake them out and organize them, you just have to remember to never shake it or turn it upside down again. I&#x27;m  not a nail art professional so I find it hard to bend these little things into a shape that will stay on my nails so I&#x27;m not getting as much use out of them as I would like. I guess practice is going to have to make ... useable. My little flower popped off but still left an impression in my polish that looks awesome (fIN). The only one that I will never use is the word..... What the heck is &amp;#34;Carller&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> they are too stiff they don&#x27;t bend to stick to your nail.</li>
            <li> The stickers are not soft. i thought they were in a soft material but they are in a &amp;#34;metallic&amp;#34; material. they get adhered with nail polish but get off too easily because they get tangled easily on the clothes or even the hair when you pass your hands by. so I pasted them with fake nails glue. It worked better but the stickers still get stuck in the clothes and hair and that&#x27;s very uncomfortable. they look nice on the nails. That&#x27;s why I give the 3 stars. otherwise i would have given them 2 stars.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick. Everything was wonderful and happened like it was supposed to. I didn&#x27;t even knew this was coming with not one but TWO wheel of magical nail art.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I am giving this a 4 star is because they are hard. Indeed, these little creatures meant to live on our nails will not bend to the shape on my nails. I mean, if you have really flat straight nails, this is really for you! Otherwise, if you really put a lot of Top Coat on top you might be able to make it look like it belongs on there.&lt;br /&gt;But, eh, I thought maybe it was a good purchase. I can use them in an album sticker I can now make. Or i can just stick them around on things I like. One day, I&#x27;m sure they will come in handy. Until then, I will try to teach my nails on how to stay flat.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have many designs(9 designs and most of them are hello kitty)</li>
            <li> I got them earlier then I expected anlove them they were in the case.</li>
            <li> Cute and a good size but most came out during shipping so they&#x27;re  a big mess</li>
            <li> the wheel is a bit loose&lt;br /&gt;i love all the designs. you do get alot&lt;br /&gt;some of the designs did come out of the wheel, but easy to put back&lt;br /&gt;came pretty quick</li>
            <li> So disappointed, I didn&#x27;t received which I selected and received either 350, only got me 100!!</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t give you a full set of any design, there was only like eight of each design and I had to sit down and sort them out right after I got them because they had gotten all mixed together.</li>
            <li> Small and delicate shapes. Mine came with Chanel which I could have done without. It would have been better if I received the stickers as posted in the picture.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s flat and doesn&#x27;t have a curve so it doesn&#x27;t stay on nails.  I have to bend it into a curve before I put it on my nails and even then some stays on my nails.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. However due to shipping process the pieces were all mixed up and out of the wheel, so I had some sorting to do but I&#x27;m definitely gonna enjoy using these</li>
            <li> Fun for nails...  quick and easy</li>
            <li> These were a mess when I got them.. ALL OF the decals were all mixed together. I had to take 3 hours out of my time to organize these decals not a fun job .. As u can tell I&#x27;m a little upset bc of that reason.. Once I got them separated they were great product. I super ed glued them on so they would stay on bc clear finger nail polish didn&#x27;t work. And u have to shape them to your nail b4 u glue them down or the edges stick up .. other than that there good..The only reason I gave them 2 stars was bc I had to organize them.</li>
            <li> Came with like 2 jewels in each compartment. :(</li>
            <li> the only problem I had with my order was that they were all mixed together</li>
            <li> Arrived fast exactly what I expected :)</li>
            <li> i am missing a few from several designs, and the wheel holder is horrible at holding these, several got bent trying to get them out of the wheel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Star 10&lt;br /&gt;Clover 9&lt;br /&gt;Asterisk 10&lt;br /&gt;Trees 10&lt;br /&gt;Flower 9&lt;br /&gt;butterfly 10&lt;br /&gt;Crown 11&lt;br /&gt;Present 10&lt;br /&gt;Bow 10&lt;br /&gt;Second flower 10&lt;br /&gt;cc 10&lt;br /&gt;Love 10</li>
            <li> Some only have 3 maybe 4 of the same but they are pretty</li>
            <li> he best thing that  was good about this was it came a week before its standard date.. but I am 50...50 on these nail decals they are metal plated which is really nice but I didn&#x27;t get everything I was supposed to like in the picture I didn&#x27;t get all those decals the way I should have which I&#x27;m really sad about because I wanted the certain ones that were in the picture but I didn&#x27;t it was at random I Tell you what I got&lt;br /&gt;I got rings, spiders, snowflakes, Hearts,stars,butterflies, crowns, roses,fourth leaf clovers,some leaves thing, lips, and I decal I suppose some strange word I&#x27;m not exactly sure what it says</li>
            <li> Super cute assortment, but they were all mixed up together when they arrived due to jostling. Either way they are super cute. I can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> These are very cute. But they don&#x27;t fit most nail shapes and they are hard to bend.</li>
            <li> I love , I love this..!</li>
            <li> It seemed as there weren&#x27;t to many in the package.</li>
            <li> Very cute designs in package.  @Styledbymo90</li>
            <li> The little shapes are so thin they were coming out of the container and are all mixed up.  They are cute, though.  I intend to use them for craft purposes.</li>
            <li> Sucks not even 100 pieces🙅</li>
            <li> This is a great buy! I recently started to take care of my own growing ever so fast nails. This gives me many options to maintain the up keep of my own nails.</li>
            <li> Sweet patterns and easy to mold for fitting.</li>
            <li> Do not stay on nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I got these and I think I love them!</li>
            <li> Perfect delivery thanks *****</li>
            <li> It was dang near EMPTY!  AND NOT WORTH $2 ... also the shapes are very small</li>
            <li> Cute item but the wire metal things bend and scratch when not completely covered by gel nail polish</li>
            <li> product looks like the picture, only draw back is that when you try to put it on nail on top of design or polish it tends to stick out and snag of fabric or hair. Otherwise its okay.</li>
            <li> I definitely didn&#x27;t receive as many as were advertised. The pieces are pretty, but they are useless if you want to use them with a regular manicure. Even with gel polish, it&#x27;s difficult to get them to stay down with no lifting. The best way that I have been able to use them is to encapsulate them in acrylic. Other than that, these would be better glued to paper or something to that effect, than to be used on an actual nail.</li>
            <li> People moaning about them falling out in the package...? Seriously? Is it tht hard to pick them out and pop them back in..? I dnt think so.. Great little packet of decorations - look beautiful too :) thanks!</li>
            <li> Light weight and easly to apply. Beautiful designs.</li>
            <li> They are a little bulky and don&#x27;t want to form to my nail. I get it a 4/10</li>
            <li> Good price, learning how to apply, would buy again.</li>
            <li> This product worked great.  Stayed only nails with a thick top coat, however the pieces were mixed together and it did not contain as many pieces as were in the description.  Other than that a great product.</li>
            <li> Great designs, I can have salon looking nails for cost of designs doing it myself.  Which comes down to under a penny per nail.  Hello kitty one&#x27;s by far my fav!!</li>
            <li> I order this mostly because i thought the spiders would be cool for halloween and I REALLY wanted the crown. I got a lot that weren&#x27;t even  pictured. Here is the list of things I got:&lt;br /&gt;-roses&lt;br /&gt;-stars&lt;br /&gt;-flowers&lt;br /&gt;-thumb print&lt;br /&gt;-butterflies&lt;br /&gt;-teddy bears&lt;br /&gt;-another kind of flower&lt;br /&gt;-lightning bolt&lt;br /&gt;-sailor boat wheel&lt;br /&gt;-gucci&lt;br /&gt;-snowflake&lt;br /&gt;-and some other one that looks like 1 C and 1 backwards C stuck together&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also they came unorganized which what a pain to organize myself, and they aren&#x27;t as thin as every one has been saying they are which was the main reason I gave them a 3. The other reason is because the don&#x27;t stay don&#x27;t on my nail and when i try to touch them down, the edges really hurt and are really pointy. I was expecting stickers not metal sheets with pointy edges</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Good price.</li>
            <li> Cute order came just as pictured</li>
            <li> The are perfect for what I use them for - decorating art.</li>
            <li> I really like the different designs. However when I received that package, most of them came out of the container and were just laying in the bag. I had to go through and sort all of them. But other than that, they worked well. They stuck to the nail after top coat was applied to the nail. And then I applied another top coat to make sure that they were on. And they last. Overall, I would probably still buy this again. I sure hope they fix the way they package it. Maybe send then in a sealed container rather than the wheel?</li>
            <li> I absolutely love all of the little gold metal charms I can put on my finger nails. They are so cute !</li>
            <li> The phrase &amp;#34;350buy&amp;#34; is very misleading, it makes the conumer think they&#x27;re buying 350 pcs.The stickers are pretty but there is not 350 pcs in that container realistically it&#x27;s 108 pcs. I&#x27;m a little disappointed about that. I guess you get what you pay for. There were some &amp;#34;letter K&#x27; pcs in there; I don&#x27;t have a K in my name what the hell am I going to do with those. I guess I have to get creative. The crown and tiara pcs were not included in this manicure wheel.</li>
            <li> Super cute, Love THE FREE SHIPPING!!! Price was amazing!! Thank so much!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when these finally got to my house, only to be super disappointed when I opened the package to notice ONE little tiny gold bow in the disk they package them in. :(&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even know how many are supposed to be in the pack (350?)  but I got ONE tiny bow.&lt;br /&gt;They really need to change their shipping methods/packaging, I won&#x27;t be ordering again.&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are nice designs.  When they arrived they were kind of over the place because they are so thin and they slide out of their compartments in the wheel.  they were all mixed up and some of them were even outside the wheel in the plastic baggie and in the delivery envelope itself, so beware!!  They have a beautiful gold tone that didn&#x27;t fade as I wore them.  the rigidity of these decals makes it difficult to place them securely to a nail.  What I did to aid in them staying attached to my nail is I bent them slightly, then put them in place on my design.</li>
            <li> Product is not flexible so it doesn&#x27;t on nails.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for my daughter who loves doing her nails so she doesn&#x27;t have to spend a fortune at the salon.</li>
            <li> These are so pretty! They are so tiny and delicate and look very expensive on the nail. However they do slip and get mixed up in the wheel because of how thin they are. They came rather quickly and were packaged good. I did have to sort them but was not a big deal.I am very satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look as full but still has a nice amount</li>
            <li> Super thick like metal punch outs</li>
            <li> Love how they look on my nails.</li>
            <li> Theyre not bad i was just upset i didnt recieve the decals as in the picture. I recieved some weird ones that ill never use. Like that letter k. I have no idea what ill do with that. And some didnt have all 10 pieces as promised. The cute ones too were the ones lacking quantity</li>
            <li> you only get half the amount that it shows in the picture.</li>
            <li> They are pretty in the case BUT they don&#x27;t lay flat so the edges get caught on everything! Shirts hair jackets you name it its getting caught. They&#x27;re also stiff metal so they don&#x27;t Bend that easy to your nail. So bummer that this product is pretty and creative bit isn&#x27;t worth the hassle of stratching your face</li>
            <li> It came as a expected &amp; On time. It has a lot of cute designs and look very good on any nail. The only problem was that they were all mixed up but besides that it was no problem! I would recommend it. Good buy overall</li>
            <li> received and grand kids said they were easy to use loved the different designs of heart butter fly and apple  etc</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t count how many were in there, but it arrived on time and I think they look really cute on my finger and toe nails. I did have to bend some of them and kinda &amp;#34;shape&amp;#34; them to my finger but I definitely will be ordering more after I run out!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t receive same decals as shown</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the amount it was less than 350</li>
            <li> beautiful shapes, but they container does not keep them separated</li>
            <li> I recieved this item on time and it works and will be buying more. It would be a good gift.</li>
            <li> Nice and small to adjust any where on the nail bed.Easy to use .Great item .</li>
            <li> Cute. Haven&#x27;t used them yet though. They are foil like but thicker. You can bend them slightly to match curve of nail.</li>
            <li> They are so cute! Not so many though but really cute! I wish they were in silver too. Nice product</li>
            <li> These I like. These are very cool, and would tell my friends to buy,&lt;br /&gt;again not all patterns were in the box.&lt;br /&gt;thank You, bonnie</li>
            <li> I was not overly thrilled with this purchase.  First I did not receive 120 designs as stated (12 times 10 &#x3D; 120). Also, of the designs I did receive which were: Butterflies-6; Snowflakes; 8; Bows-8; Tiny hearts - 8; bee-7; Crown (not a princess type crown more of one that looks like the one on a liquor bottle or something- 8; Heart with love - 8; Teddy bear - 8 ; Roses - 6; Flowers; 7; Christmas Trees 8; Stars -6 (all but one of these was bent beyond repair) and the design I got the most of was &amp;#34;H&amp;#34; (the letter H).....not sure what to do with that since I don&#x27;t even have an h in my name or know anyone whose name begins with that?? but I got 11 of those??? for a total of 99 designs of those only about 74-75 are useable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave them 3 stars is because they really are nice metal designs and as such may be painted if you like (I used silver polish and painted one of my 2 stars silver and it worked nicely).  You do have to use glue, since they are metal, topcoat only will not hold them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked the envelope they arrived in and although they were all out of the holder none were loose in the envelope and could not have fallen out.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shapes, so shinny! They are beautiful on my nails.</li>
            <li> Will buy them again.  Love the ways I can use them!</li>
            <li> I do not like the set that was sent to me.</li>
            <li> These decals are show stopping beautiful!</li>
            <li> I love these, not to big you can wear these if your nails are short as well. However they do not have a curve to them so they don&#x27;t lay completely flat on your nail, but they still look good.</li>
            <li> First of all it seem like it took forever and a day to come. The only reason I gave it one star is because it came. I DID NOT HAVE ANYTHING CLOSE TO THE RIGHT AMOUNT. They were scattered all outside of the wheel. I had to literally take it apart to get them out.</li>
            <li> Only came with 20 pc in it. No pattern came with all ten so can&#x27;t do a consistent design.</li>
            <li> I love these little metal designs.  So cute.  I wish they came in silver or other metal colors.</li>
            <li> Very cute.  Kind of an odd selection(girl with ponytail, strawberry, star. butterfly, flower, hearts, bow, one that that is the letters &amp;#34;MOR&amp;#34; that I cannot figure out...)  but there are several that I like.  I will enjoy using these nail decorations.  The container wheel was all mixed up, but was enclosed in a little zip loc bag and none were lost.  I received this item well before the time given.  These are made of the same stuff as sequins, light weight, shiny and can be curved a little to fit on your nail and a good size for nail decoration.  I applied a couple on the last steps of a gel nail manicure by pressing the tiny butterfly on over a small area of wet topcoat and then went under the UV light for about 30 seconds then applied topcoat over the entire nail.  It left a completely smooth surface and the mani lasted about two weeks just as usual.  I really liked how they matched and accentuated my gold wedding ring.</li>
            <li> Their 2 small &amp; their glue on didn&#x27;t like them</li>
            <li> These are nice quality, very pretty and a great price. They did take a little long to get here, but look how far its coming from.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest getting the little wax-tip pencil made for picking up tiny things like this. It works great and leaves no residue or sticky spots on the teeny stars and stuff.</li>
            <li> These were packaged well and came on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these cute little nail sparkles and I&#x27;ll be using them in my nailart projects soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im very pleased!</li>
            <li> received before scheduled time ...but pieces.all mixed up</li>
            <li> I gave it a five because is a good product, priced right and it has a good variety of diferent shapes</li>
            <li> Cute designs. BUT they were very hard to work with because there three dimensional. They end up sticking  our of your nail weirdly</li>
            <li> Where to start, it took a month for the thing to come, then the case lid is not tight so the different gold nail art pieces mix together when u flip it around (and how it came) and if u do order look at the pic and imagine like 1/8 of that that&#x27;s what you will get. Oh and most important the pieces are a bit to big and to flat to fit on ur nail so you have to bend/shape them to fit ur nails,otherwise the stick out.</li>
            <li> These are awful. They do not bend to the nail and are too big to sit properly on the nail without there being gaps in places between the nail and metal. When I used these and would touch my hair it would get stuck on these because they are not able to get close enough to the nail fully.</li>
            <li> I ordered two, I was hoping I&#x27;d get different slices in each package. No such luck. The variety was good within the package.&lt;br /&gt;I got;&lt;br /&gt;snow flakes&lt;br /&gt;butterflies&lt;br /&gt;two kinds of crowns&lt;br /&gt;spiders&lt;br /&gt;dragonflies&lt;br /&gt;bows&lt;br /&gt;keys&lt;br /&gt;hearts&lt;br /&gt;teddy bears&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it turns out, its probably better than I got two of the same sets. While I had more than ten in some designs, I got less than ten in others. Ten is a pretty minimal number when talking about a manicure. Less than ten means I&#x27;m relegated to accent nails rather than a full set. That&#x27;s frustrating.</li>
            <li> Does not go on flat at all.....not good for nail art.</li>
            <li> Missing over half of the supplies, not bothered by them being mixed I just organized them myself and that&#x27;s when I realized I only got 3-5 of each one and there are 3 spaces that are completely empty after organizing. I would have loved them if I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I like them but no one knows how to bend them so they can add them to my nails</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay on the nail. The packaged stamps were all messed up. The need to be curved to fit  the nail, but they are flat.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, thank you!</li>
            <li> Accurate description.</li>
            <li> The package took forever to arrive they were look from the tin the came in didnt have half as many as i thought it should very cheap product not worth the buy</li>
            <li> On time delivery good chance I&#x27;ll order again thanks</li>
            <li> beautifully put together. everything in one compact.</li>
            <li> Great item. Exactly as described and was received in time</li>
            <li> Bottom line, for the price, you cannot beat these! I received all different designs, with only one pattern having 9 instead of 10. They are small enough to put on any nail. I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Nothing like the picture, they arrived all mixed up and often they get stuck in the wheel. Other than that you get what you see as far as the figures go.</li>
            <li> they do come a little mixed up but you can easily open the lid and put it back on without breaking it to sort them.  i love how thin and small they are,  great size for any nail bed.</li>
            <li> I really liked these stickers.  I will use them as accents on cards.  I do wish there were more of them, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain.  They are tiny, but then they are made for use on nails.  I would (probably will) purchase them again.</li>
            <li> Ok so I didn&#x27;t count how many were in there, but I did the organize them. It was irritating, but not awful. Some of the designs were kind of no bueno (I received the letter H) and childish (teddy bears and whatnot) but I can put those to use on my nieces. I purchased these for hope of an anchor that I didn&#x27;t get (but for the price, oh well). If you like trees, bears, and the letter H, then this is the nail decal set for you. :)</li>
            <li> MY SISTER SAID SHE LOVES HER NAIL ART....</li>
            <li> fast shipping, lovely item</li>
