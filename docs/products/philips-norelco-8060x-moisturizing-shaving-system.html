    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>He had to get use to using an electric razor but was impressed with the moisturizing cream which helped in getting a close shave without razor burn.  </li>
            <li>This is the best one they have made.</li>
            <li>works great!  </li>
            <li>The Phillips Norelco 8060X Moisturizing Shaving System is one of the best shavers out there.</li>
            <li>It is a real good improvement.</li>
            <li>The product is excellent for an electric razor.</li>
            <li>but this one is the best I&#x27;ve ever had, way to go Norelco</li>
            <li>THIS ITEM IS EXCELLENT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this razor</li>
            <li>This Shaver is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>The best my husband ever had.</li>
            <li>The Nivea Moisturizing Cream is one of the best technology invention as it gives a gliding feeling on my face.</li>
            <li>What a pleasant surprise!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the quality of the shave to be very good.  </li>
            <li>Charging and battery life also seem to be very good.     </li>
            <li>Nothing&#x27;s perfect but this is as good as you&#x27;ll get if you want a razor that dispenses lotion.</li>
            <li>if they didn&#x27;t tell you how great the auto fill is</li>
            <li>Happy Shaving</li>
            <li>the charging system and auto refill setup is great.</li>
            <li>all and all, its a great razor and</li>
            <li>Great razer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I got the \\&quot;Shaving System\\&quot; as well</li>
            <li>In conclusion the Philips Norelco 8060X Moisturizing Shaving System was a purchase that I am now entirely happy for having bought.  </li>
            <li>I have always just applied soap to my face and used the shaver like that and get a great shave.  </li>
            <li>I currently own 4 Norelco shavers and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>- While the charge and refill station is great, it seems that I always run out of moisturizer before running out of battery, so I have to remember to refill it myself, since they suggest not leaving the razor on charge all the time.  </li>
            <li>The charging and lotion refill stand does a great job.  </li>
            <li>Nice!  </li>
            <li>An update: To be fair I might have over-reacted in my judgement of this product.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li>I have used electric razors for over 35 years all have good points and all have weaknesses.  </li>
            <li>Good Product.</li>
            <li>It feels so good on the skin when you hit that lotion button, on the cheeks that is, when I got to my neck</li>
            <li>Good battery life between charges.  </li>
            <li>THIS RAZOR IS GOOD IN THE SHOWER OR JUST SITTING IN YOUR ROOM SHAVING BEFORE YOU HEAD INTO WORK</li>
            <li>IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD RAZOR</li>
            <li>I have seen lot of good reviews about this shaving system which led me to buy it.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>then there is no reason I would not have it on the 15 or 16 at the very latest.</li>
            <li>My husband is very pleased with the Norelco 8060X.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the quality of my shaves and ease of operation.</li>
            <li>I really liked the Philips Norelco 8060X Moisturizing Shaving System as I had heard lots of good things about it.  </li>
            <li>But what I loved the most was how good this razor feels as you are shaving.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver!</li>
            <li>I love this shaver!  </li>
            <li>If you are OK with the pros and cons, then I say go for it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li>After about three months of ownership, I still love this shaver!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>The shaving conditioner delivery system is great and makes for a comfortable shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>Awesome product highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>He loves the warm shave cream that came with it.</li>
            <li>I got it for my husband for his birthday and he too liked it.    </li>
            <li>lotion filler/dispenser is handy when it works.     </li>
            <li>I liked the concept of the moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li>Kind of pricey</li>
            <li>He is very happy with the 8060X and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>One of the best shavers ever produced by Norelco so smooth and moist for super close shave.  </li>
            <li>So far I have been extremely impressed with this razor.</li>
            <li>He liked this shaver even better.</li>
            <li>The Norelco 8060X gives me by far the best electric shave I have ever gotten.  </li>
            <li>It has many great features and a cool look.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to bother with doing the lotion refill by hand and the stand does the job flawlessly with no mess.  </li>
            <li>I liked the idea of lotion and being able to use it in the shower - and the stripped-down scifi looks were interesting.  </li>
            <li>Gives a great shave and is very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>The best part is that there is no mess after he is done shaving and leaves his skin smooth and smelling nice.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t intend to use moisturizer with this system then you would probably be better off buying a product that is not designed for it.</li>
            <li>It took 3 weeks for my face to get accustomed to the electric razor-I love this thing.</li>
            <li>I decided to try one more thing</li>
            <li>This is a great razor and gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li>With fathers day coming up, its a gift that any father would love to receive.</li>
            <li>Now after three weeks of shaving I can say that I am quite satisfied.    </li>
            <li>Think of this problem like a paper shredder that has not beeen emptied and hasn&#x27;t room for more papers in the bin.       </li>
            <li>Even after I printed out the RMA I thought to myself, let me give this one more shot.</li>
            <li>I love Philips products.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to love this also</li>
            <li>Love that I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>Most also said that after their skin got used to it, it was a worthwhile buy.  </li>
            <li>They sure have changed.  </li>
            <li>I love when I&#x27;m in a rush</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver almost a month ago and I am perfectly satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love the auto shaving lotion fill dispenser that comes with this unit.</li>
            <li>It has the best overall design as it relates to comfort while shaving, from the floating heads with the glide ring, to it&#x27;s thinner, lighter weight.</li>
            <li>Moisturizing, under the shower operated and much better shaving system.</li>
            <li>so I am relatively satisfied with that feature until I get hit with sticker shock for buying a replacement.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is much better than my 2004 model, and eliminates the need for a foil shaver.    </li>
            <li>I love the convenience of the 8060x&#x27;s charging stand.  </li>
            <li>AND I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>After never being able to use any electric razor in my life</li>
            <li>I will say that it does a better job than most electric razors I have used</li>
            <li>I found that just constant rinsing the shaver with water works best.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco 8060X moisturizing shaving system has the potential to be the best shaver I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Cons:  - You&#x27;ll be compelled to shave daily, since it works best and most efficiently that way.  </li>
            <li>untill I find a better electric shaver than this for me.</li>
            <li>It is the best Norelco I have ever had out of a total of five Norelcos owned.  </li>
            <li>every time you needed more lotion.</li>
            <li>This is much more convenient than either running out of lotion mid-shave or being out of lotion because you forgot to replace the cartridge.</li>
            <li>Love the razor with the lotion ejection system built in.</li>
            <li>The latest model has a better system.</li>
            <li>Great new product form Norelco!</li>
            <li>This ones worth it!!</li>
            <li>This new one is great like all of them.</li>
            <li>Electric razors work best on a dry beard----and</li>
            <li>i love shaving in the shower as it gives a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>The tool is very quiet, gives a good close shave, almost as good as a razor shave.</li>
            <li>I found these shavers delivered a very smooth, comfortable shave on my tender skin.  </li>
            <li>Great razor for sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li>He is so pleased with the way the shave heads move which gives him a close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I use a light glycerin based shaving gel, and I get much better shaves than I do with the Nivea lotion.</li>
            <li>The cleaning of the shaver is very easy, a quick rinse under the faucet.     </li>
            <li>And while I thought it was a great idea that you can pump in the Nivea cream, I actually find the packets more convenient.</li>
            <li>Some people withlarger hands may find is inconvient and others may find it easy to drop.      </li>
            <li>When his last electric razor (also a Norelco, which was great) broke after many years of use, I tried to find the closest thing to what he had and came across the 8060X.</li>
            <li>Cleaning the heads is easy.  </li>
            <li>the lotion dispenser keeps the razor gliding easily.    </li>
            <li>The razor also comes with a travel charging stand for easy carrying.</li>
            <li>Easy on maintenance.</li>
            <li>Leaves cuttings all over , have to lean over basin for easy cleanup.  </li>
            <li>I loved using the older model in the shower.</li>
            <li>He loves the blades for his so strong beard also it</li>
            <li>I do not have a particularly strong beard: dont know how it would work there.</li>
            <li>While it is heavier than the new model it gave me a good, close shave and the battery charge lasted about a month.     </li>
            <li>No need for pre-shave lotion, can be used in shower and easy clean up using water.</li>
            <li>Plus it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I get a close shave, and my skin is no longer irratated because the lotion makes it comfortable.</li>
            <li>The fact that P/N warranty terminates after the initial unit is replaced is not making me a happy P/N customer.  </li>
            <li>The Nivea solution is great, but you can use regular shave cream or gel.  </li>
            <li>After this period this razor was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>because not only does this model have a great quick-charge function</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s smooth shaving from there.</li>
            <li>None shave as close as a cheap Bic or any brand plastic razor.  </li>
            <li>The cream that comes from the razor is like a lubricant and allows the razor to glide smoothly across one&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>CONS - You have to use the razor bent over a sink or in the shower because clippings come out of the head, and they are free to fall from there.  </li>
            <li>I have owned this razor for about 2 months giving it over 2x the recommended break-in period and still cannot get a smooth shave from it.  </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve discovered I enjoy shaving in the shower.  </li>
            <li>- Comfortable to hold and use.  </li>
            <li>freely rotataing heads give me one of the smoothest shaves.  </li>
            <li>Also nice is having lotion electronically dispensed to your face, eliminating the need to repeatedly press the dispensing button on older models.  </li>
            <li>As stated in the manual, you most probably do not get a close shave in the first days of using it.</li>
            <li>It really matches the razor blade shave, but is much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>- The charging and refill system is nice (more on this later).  </li>
            <li>Clean close shave.</li>
            <li>The shave is very comfortable, and very close.  </li>
            <li>The pros of this razor easily satisfy my wonder if I had made the right choice of electric razor and what I needed it for when my \\&quot;manual\\&quot; razor worked so well.  </li>
            <li>blade\\&quot; called the Speed XL, they just seem to be underpowered.(just as a note the older Spectra blade replacements fit these razors and seem to work better).   </li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve never really used a high quality electric before, I think this razor is superb.  </li>
            <li>The shaving is a very pleasant experience, thanks to the wet foam or cream that is used on the face during the shave.</li>
            <li>The Sprectra was more gentle, and the 9160 gave a closer shave as it was a triple head.</li>
            <li>I have been using the cool skin shavers for 9 years.</li>
            <li>I recommend to not use it, as there are better alternatives that are much cheaper.    </li>
            <li>I returned the razor for full refund.</li>
            <li>The ability to dispense lotion directly from the shaver was also a nice feature, eliminating the need to have a separate dispenser of shaving cream or gel.  </li>
            <li>I bought another Cool Skin in 2004 (</li>
            <li>Overall, I am delighted with this shaver, and am awarding it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>90 mins for a full charge</li>
            <li>but none came close to the shave you get with a good blade, such as the Mach 3.  </li>
            <li>Still, not quite as good as the old model but much closer.</li>
            <li>Norelco 8060X is fantastic, even better than my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>and I can use the 8060 to quickly get rid of my five or six-oclock shadow.  </li>
            <li>The older model did a much better shave.</li>
            <li>So in summary:   Pros: auto-filling lotion cartridge, waterproof, quick charging, does glide well over face (no irritation WHILE shaving, but boy</li>
            <li>and it has a quick charge mode</li>
            <li>I suspect this is gunk is high in bacteria and the cause of most skin infections from nicks.  </li>
            <li>Love the new design.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE MY NEW NORELCO</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice and love the results already - despite the instructions stating that it would take my skin up to 21 days to adjust to the new razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been getting better since!  </li>
            <li>Starting using the day after Christmas and is extremely happy with his new razor.  </li>
            <li>This razor does not have a chamber to collect the cut hair, so you may not want to use it as a dry shaver after putting on a white shirt, but it is the perfect shower shaver, which is where I use it.</li>
            <li>I loved it for the convenience of being able to shave wet or dry, as well as being able to shave in the shower or bath tub.  </li>
            <li>So far though I love the product and it is one of the closest</li>
            <li>The heads are more firmer to allow pushing harder to get more pressure.</li>
            <li>Not have ever seen or used this type of razor before Iwas not convinced it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>A hair catcher would&#x27;ve been a nice edition but the ones in electric trimmers I use or have used only seemed to get in the way.  </li>
            <li>It took some getting use too, but it was well worth the time.</li>
            <li>Theoretically, the lotion should just come out onto the blades and on to the skin but while shaving the lotion leaks out to the underside of the blade where it doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot of good.</li>
            <li>This new system is a huge improvement over previous models, and I am really happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It also shaves much faster than the older model, courtesy of having more blades in the shaving head.    </li>
            <li>, it seems to be the right thickness for the razor and works alomost as well as the cream you load in the razor.      </li>
            <li>Yes, that&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is the best all around razor I have owned, there is a brief time required for your face to get used to any new razor...</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get as close of a shave with it at first, but as the manual says - some break-in is required, and now that I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks - it&#x27;s doing a great job</li>
            <li>PROS - Decent close shave with comfortable grip.</li>
            <li>The older Norelco had to be held in my fist - the newer model can be comfortably held in my fingers.    </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s going to be used for a light trim rather than being my main razor.</li>
            <li>So all in all not a bad electric razor but be be aware it will not leave your skin clean shaven and smooth like a traditional razor will.</li>
            <li>A good shave takes roughly 5 minutes, more or less the same time as a good razor shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found a single electric razor that shaves as close as a blade, but I used to own a Norelco Advantage that gave a decently close shave that was pretty comfortable and didn&#x27;t irritate my neck.    </li>
            <li>Here is what makes this new razor fantastic.</li>
            <li>- I haven&#x27;t found a great shower mirror yet, so I wind up starting my shave prior to the shower, to trim around sideburns and the like.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this razor and would suggest it to anyone looking for a new electric.  </li>
            <li>I know it takes a full three weeks before skin can adjust to a new razor, but the first time i used this razor I got a super-smooth shave-something rare for my stubbornly scruffy face.  </li>
            <li>Now it is giving me a decent shave and it does it quickly.</li>
            <li>I also had to pass this around the same areas so many times.</li>
            <li>This was definitely a first for me, as well as others I knew</li>
            <li>This is the first wet/dry I have owned</li>
            <li>Just keep the shaver running under a tap of hot water for 30 seconds.    </li>
            <li>- many foil shavers let you simply flip up the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver that I have used.</li>
            <li>Often seems better without the nivea squirted internally.  </li>
            <li>When I had my original norelco cool skin, it required individual Nivea skin packs.</li>
            <li>The shaving 8060X system is a significant improvement over the old cartidge type models.</li>
            <li>I can have a bunch hanging in the shower and replace a spent one very easily.</li>
            <li>The lotion charging station is pretty cool too, no mess.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I can see from the other ratings that many people have had a lot of success with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable but not as close as enclosed head design it replaced; keeping as spare and ordering more traditional model for daily use.</li>
            <li>I order the Norelco 8060X to replace an old Norelco Cool Shave razor.     </li>
            <li>Anyway, the 8060x makes many improvements over the older line but further improvements can be made.  </li>
            <li>I like this design much better than the Cool Skin Norelco that this unit replaced -- none of those little packets of shaving lotion</li>
            <li>The blades disassemble easily so you can get at those occasional \\&quot;longer</li>
            <li>By the time you have read the detailed instuction book you have to go back to figure out exactly how to do something.  </li>
            <li>Shaving is pure pleasure with the Nivea lotion.  </li>
            <li>I think the moisturizing system on an electric razor is pure genius</li>
            <li>The new Norelco 8060x Coolskin is far better than the old 7xxx series in practically every way.    </li>
            <li>Description of product was very informative.</li>
            <li>The shave is very close</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the razor all that much.</li>
            <li>The head system is much improved with no shaver body around the heads allowing the heads to trim easier under the nose and side burns.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver!     </li>
            <li>Having lotion automatically dispensed into the shaver is a real luxury.  </li>
            <li>It shaves very well.</li>
            <li>My husband used it for a month and really wanted to like it</li>
            <li>Having the lotion come from the center of the blades is a much more efficient design.</li>
            <li>so maybe I am asking too much from an electric razor (that is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1).  </li>
            <li>Buy the shaver, then using the much cheaper gel that you slap on your face.</li>
            <li>- The moisturizing system does work very well.  </li>
            <li>but my shaving time did not improve much in a month.</li>
            <li>The lotion cans are very convenient.    </li>
            <li>The lotion comes through two stems coming off of the body and then through a hole in the center of the top two blades.</li>
            <li>One needs to use it more frequently than a traditional blade shaver</li>
            <li>I bought the first edition of the Norelco Cool Skin/Advantage shavers back in 1999.  </li>
            <li>Remember to wet your face first, and when things start to drag, using a bit more water, as well as Nivea, keeps things moving smoothly along.  </li>
            <li>I own the previous model of this razor and bought the new model because I travel a lot.</li>
            <li>I will start out by saying that I am in the military and required to have a very clean shave</li>
            <li>Every other brand of electric shaver I have used has worked better.</li>
            <li>I attempt to get everything I can Philips, my 32\\&quot; LCD, my Sonicare Elite with the UV station, my 2030 Bodygroom, so many other things.</li>
            <li>You must take the blade and cutter assembly apart to clean properly and if you cut longer hairs by accident(side burn area etc.)</li>
            <li>If you have had problems in the past with an electric shaver, I do not believe you will have any better success with this shaver.</li>
            <li>I have tried both the special Nivea lotion and regular shaving foam.</li>
            <li>In short, if you only plan to use this razor in the shower this is a good choice, but if you need to use the razor outside of the shower as well, you may want to choose something else.</li>
            <li>Though I am sure the lotion is not very cheap.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is constructed well and is lighter and more compact than previous models.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband who was using a much older version.</li>
            <li>I have changed batteries in several of my Norelco shavers and the build up of gunk where only disassembly could find and cure it, is remarkable(same with most brands).  </li>
            <li>Foil shavers seem to cut the hairs further below the skin than rotary shavers, so 24 hours later you will have more growth from a rotary shave than a foil shave.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention having to fuss with the Nivea cartridges used in older models.    </li>
            <li>My older Norelco and Braun are being retired.</li>
            <li>I had an older version of this type of waterproof shaver that lasted for 5+ years.</li>
            <li>I did not expect this product to truly replace blade shaving, but I had hoped, especially with the lubricate dispenser to let me do quick touch ups.  </li>
            <li>I have already learned to scale back my use of this conditioner to only a couple of pumps for each shave, which hopefully will allow one to get many shaves from a bottle of conditioner</li>
            <li>You have to mount the trimmer in place of the main shaving heads on the shaver.  </li>
            <li>I think this product would work better if shaven every day or alternate days and with not that coarse hair as mine.</li>
            <li>you have to do with the older line.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>so they can squeeze a little more out of ya.</li>
            <li>In the few months I&#x27;ve owned it, I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the performance and the overall results.  </li>
            <li>and I usually shave every 4 to 5 days which might be the reason that I am not finding this shaver good enough for me.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller and more lightweight than its predecessors, it&#x27;s easier to clean due to its open design, and not having to replace lotion cartridges every couple of weeks is a plus.</li>
            <li>I own a Norelco dry shaver electric razor and a panosonic wet</li>
            <li>and if so it doesn&#x27;t have to be done right away, especially if you&#x27;re in a rush.  </li>
            <li>The new model on the other hand shaves just as close, but is also extremely comfortable, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin irritated, even during the regrowth phase.    </li>
            <li>In addition, when it is time to replace the razor heads, you take the triple razor head off and snap on a new one.</li>
            <li>and I ordered a set of new blades.</li>
            <li>There is nothing new about the moisturizing angle here, Braun Freegliders did this and has since dropped it.</li>
            <li>Compared to my Braun (and a new Panasonic a friend loaned me), it still takes longer to shave with the 8060x, but the shave is now as close.  </li>
            <li>The redesigned head makes it much easier to shave in hard to reach places, notably the neck and below the nose.  </li>
            <li>Another hitch I found was that the shaver does get filled with the Nivea shaving lotion but not enough (atleast for me) for the entire shave.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of very old cans  of Gillette foamy Gel.  </li>
            <li>After reading the numerous positive reviews I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>Evidently the hair growth is different than on the face.  </li>
            <li>and I am experiencing exactly the same problem</li>
            <li>The blade assembly is completely seperate from the motor unit&#x3D; no place for gunk to build up!</li>
            <li>I feel exactly the same way.  </li>
            <li>I remember the first one I bought was a basic corded shaver.</li>
            <li>My 7775X is quieter than the first two, but 8060X is so quiet you may not even know</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Mach3 Turbo for the past three years or so and was generally pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>First off, this razor is relatively compact over the 7XXX line.</li>
            <li>I must say the dry shaver was less pleasant and more irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li>Cons: seems to cause ingrown hairs at a higher rate than its predecessors, very high neck irritation, lotion seems to drip off of razor head while shaving, not a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>With each can there is a new insert to replace the old one.</li>
            <li>The old razor was causing a rash on his neck and even with new blades, he was no longer getting a close shave.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that this razor is a huge improvement over previous models.</li>
            <li>This is a huge advancement over the previous model.</li>
            <li>While the shaver does fine on my cheeks, it does little or nothing on my neck.  </li>
            <li>The 8060X gives a close, comfortable shave particularly when you press the blue button to apply Nivea shaving conditioner to your face directly through two holes in the center of two of the three shaving heads.</li>
            <li>This is a great razor, although I will agree with some of the bad reviews, the open head does let a lot of the hair trimmings fall on the floor or counter or where ever you are shaving, but if you actually use the lotion it comes with, it collects most of the trimmings so you dont have a mess to clean up.</li>
            <li>- Works better as a wet razor than as a dry one.  </li>
            <li>Now maybe I&#x27;m just one unlucky guy, getting two shavers that have exactly the same problems and almost within the same time frame (1 year), but this seems to indicate a design flaw in this particular model.</li>
            <li>The main problem I find with this new design is that the heads/razors are floating and not encased as previous models and most other shavers.</li>
            <li>The overall quality is just as good as previous models and other Philips/Norelco products.   </li>
            <li>I still use the older model and there is no comparison in the shave I get from the new model especially if I miss a day shaving.</li>
            <li>The only issue he had with this product was getting a real close shave under his chin, neck area.  </li>
            <li>With sensitive skin, I still needed to use pre-electric shave with either.</li>
            <li>In the old days, you would buy a box of 10 nivea cartridges, and throw each away.</li>
            <li>The old blades must have dulled eventhough</li>
            <li>I like the Nivea Gel for Sensitive Skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lighter, easier to use, and is  quite a bit quieter than my old razor.</li>
            <li>but I never seem to let it drain completely.</li>
            <li>So I also bought a Braun for occasions when I wanted a faster and really close (though somewhat more irritating</li>
            <li>I think that it would do a good job for someone who doesn&#x27;t have as such thick facial hair.</li>
            <li>I use mine in the shower so no mess.  </li>
            <li>I found the entire system to be durable and high quality.  </li>
            <li>So it takes a bit longer to shave than with a conventional electric shaver, but the results are certainly worth it.</li>
            <li>I love the wet shavers and have had a previous Norelco model.  </li>
            <li>Little irritation and its works fine was traditional shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Have to shave every day or it becomes difficult to get clean shave without many passes and then not completely; no weekend slackening off!</li>
            <li>The old models shaved very close, but irritated my skin and left me red and inflamed.    </li>
            <li>There is a small reservoir in the shaver which can be filled automatically with conditioner from the Nivea bottle while the unit is charging.  </li>
            <li>Because the shaver does not catch shaved hair, the stubble tends to collect on your face (which you always wet first), where the conditioner holds it until you wash your face after shaving.  </li>
            <li>- I shave more often using this than any other razor I&#x27;ve used previously.    </li>
            <li>I am disapponted in the new model because it simply does not give a close shave.</li>
            <li>The pivoting blades are very good, but the trimmer is awkward to use and not nearly as good as what many other shavers have.  </li>
            <li>The only negative for some people might be the size or shape of the handle, it is smaleer and lighter than most shavers.  </li>
            <li>The protective cap for the shaving heads is much improved - it is less likey to be dislodged than was the case with older models.    </li>
            <li>To me this is a major oversight and design flaw.   </li>
            <li>Three weeks ago I purchased the 8060x without any expectations of a major improvement.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a step in the right direction from the previous models.</li>
            <li>The shave is closer than any other electric shaver and my skin feels soft afterwards thanks to the lotion.  </li>
            <li>The cutters have more blades on each, so the shave is faster and the motor seems stronger than previous models, hence less slowing.   </li>
            <li>This electric razor provides a decent shave but takes double the amount of time as using a regular razor and doesn&#x27;t get as close.  </li>
            <li>Two months ago, I switched back to the old manual razor.  </li>
            <li>Hard to clean.  </li>
            <li>The shaving system allows simply plugging the razor in the charging station and filling and charging in one simple action.</li>
            <li>This same email will be posted on every review I can find as well as major social networks.</li>
            <li>Norelco Customer Service is also hard to beat - they stand behind their products and will go above and beyond to keep their customers happy.</li>
            <li>Not so with the new Norelco - it now shaves as close, with far less irritation.    </li>
            <li>This new Norelco will not match a blade - at least for me, with my combination of tough beard and tender skin - but it is far superior to any other electric shaver I have used.  </li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t as good as the other reviews make it out to be, at least in my humble opinion.  </li>
            <li>I have horribly dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is lighter than the old model, but the battery charge doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li>Norelco user - started with Norelco Advantage 5 or 6 years ago, then had two different Cool Skin shavers, and now have been using the new 8060X for the past few weeks.</li>

            <li> The product is excellent for an electric razor.</li>

            <li> What a pleasant surprise!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the quality of the shave to be very good.  </li>
            <li> Charging and battery life also seem to be very good.     </li>
            <li> Nothing&#x27;s perfect but this is as good as you&#x27;ll get if you want a razor that dispenses lotion.</li>

            <li> In conclusion the Philips Norelco 8060X Moisturizing Shaving System was a purchase that I am now entirely happy for having bought.  </li>
            <li> I have always just applied soap to my face and used the shaver like that and get a great shave.  </li>
            <li> I currently own 4 Norelco shavers and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> It works great.  </li>
            <li> - While the charge and refill station is great, it seems that I always run out of moisturizer before running out of battery, so I have to remember to refill it myself, since they suggest not leaving the razor on charge all the time.  </li>
            <li> The charging and lotion refill stand does a great job.  </li>
            <li> Nice!  </li>
            <li> An update: To be fair I might have over-reacted in my judgement of this product.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li> I have used electric razors for over 35 years all have good points and all have weaknesses.  </li>
            <li> Good Product.</li>
            <li> It feels so good on the skin when you hit that lotion button, on the cheeks that is, when I got to my neck</li>
            <li> Good battery life between charges.  </li>
            <li> THIS RAZOR IS GOOD IN THE SHOWER OR JUST SITTING IN YOUR ROOM SHAVING BEFORE YOU HEAD INTO WORK</li>
            <li> IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD RAZOR</li>
            <li> I have seen lot of good reviews about this shaving system which led me to buy it.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> then there is no reason I would not have it on the 15 or 16 at the very latest.</li>
            <li> My husband is very pleased with the Norelco 8060X.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the quality of my shaves and ease of operation.</li>
            <li> I really liked the Philips Norelco 8060X Moisturizing Shaving System as I had heard lots of good things about it.  </li>
            <li> But what I loved the most was how good this razor feels as you are shaving.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver!</li>
            <li> I love this shaver!  </li>
            <li> If you are OK with the pros and cons, then I say go for it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> After about three months of ownership, I still love this shaver!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> The shaving conditioner delivery system is great and makes for a comfortable shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> Awesome product highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> He loves the warm shave cream that came with it.</li>
            <li> I got it for my husband for his birthday and he too liked it.    </li>
            <li> lotion filler/dispenser is handy when it works.     </li>
            <li> I liked the concept of the moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li> Kind of pricey</li>
            <li> He is very happy with the 8060X and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> One of the best shavers ever produced by Norelco so smooth and moist for super close shave.  </li>
            <li> So far I have been extremely impressed with this razor.</li>
            <li> He liked this shaver even better.</li>
            <li> The Norelco 8060X gives me by far the best electric shave I have ever gotten.  </li>
            <li> It has many great features and a cool look.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to bother with doing the lotion refill by hand and the stand does the job flawlessly with no mess.  </li>
            <li> I liked the idea of lotion and being able to use it in the shower - and the stripped-down scifi looks were interesting.  </li>
            <li> Gives a great shave and is very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> The best part is that there is no mess after he is done shaving and leaves his skin smooth and smelling nice.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t intend to use moisturizer with this system then you would probably be better off buying a product that is not designed for it.</li>
            <li> It took 3 weeks for my face to get accustomed to the electric razor-I love this thing.</li>
            <li> I decided to try one more thing</li>
            <li> This is a great razor and gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> With fathers day coming up, its a gift that any father would love to receive.</li>
            <li> Now after three weeks of shaving I can say that I am quite satisfied.    </li>
            <li> Think of this problem like a paper shredder that has not beeen emptied and hasn&#x27;t room for more papers in the bin.       </li>
            <li> Even after I printed out the RMA I thought to myself, let me give this one more shot.</li>
            <li> I love Philips products.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to love this also</li>
            <li> Love that I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Most also said that after their skin got used to it, it was a worthwhile buy.  </li>
            <li> They sure have changed.  </li>
            <li> I love when I&#x27;m in a rush</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver almost a month ago and I am perfectly satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the auto shaving lotion fill dispenser that comes with this unit.</li>
            <li> It has the best overall design as it relates to comfort while shaving, from the floating heads with the glide ring, to it&#x27;s thinner, lighter weight.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing, under the shower operated and much better shaving system.</li>
            <li> so I am relatively satisfied with that feature until I get hit with sticker shock for buying a replacement.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is much better than my 2004 model, and eliminates the need for a foil shaver.    </li>
            <li> I love the convenience of the 8060x&#x27;s charging stand.  </li>
            <li> AND I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> After never being able to use any electric razor in my life</li>
            <li> I will say that it does a better job than most electric razors I have used</li>
            <li> I found that just constant rinsing the shaver with water works best.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco 8060X moisturizing shaving system has the potential to be the best shaver I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Cons:  - You&#x27;ll be compelled to shave daily, since it works best and most efficiently that way.  </li>
            <li> untill I find a better electric shaver than this for me.</li>
            <li> It is the best Norelco I have ever had out of a total of five Norelcos owned.  </li>
            <li> every time you needed more lotion.</li>
            <li> This is much more convenient than either running out of lotion mid-shave or being out of lotion because you forgot to replace the cartridge.</li>
            <li> Love the razor with the lotion ejection system built in.</li>
            <li> The latest model has a better system.</li>
            <li> Great new product form Norelco!</li>
            <li> This ones worth it!!</li>
            <li> This new one is great like all of them.</li>
            <li> Electric razors work best on a dry beard----and</li>
            <li> i love shaving in the shower as it gives a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The tool is very quiet, gives a good close shave, almost as good as a razor shave.</li>
            <li> I found these shavers delivered a very smooth, comfortable shave on my tender skin.  </li>
            <li> Great razor for sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li> He is so pleased with the way the shave heads move which gives him a close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I use a light glycerin based shaving gel, and I get much better shaves than I do with the Nivea lotion.</li>
            <li> The cleaning of the shaver is very easy, a quick rinse under the faucet.     </li>
            <li> And while I thought it was a great idea that you can pump in the Nivea cream, I actually find the packets more convenient.</li>
            <li> Some people withlarger hands may find is inconvient and others may find it easy to drop.      </li>
            <li> When his last electric razor (also a Norelco, which was great) broke after many years of use, I tried to find the closest thing to what he had and came across the 8060X.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the heads is easy.  </li>
            <li> the lotion dispenser keeps the razor gliding easily.    </li>
            <li> The razor also comes with a travel charging stand for easy carrying.</li>
            <li> Easy on maintenance.</li>
            <li> Leaves cuttings all over , have to lean over basin for easy cleanup.  </li>
            <li> I loved using the older model in the shower.</li>
            <li> He loves the blades for his so strong beard also it</li>
            <li> I do not have a particularly strong beard: dont know how it would work there.</li>
            <li> While it is heavier than the new model it gave me a good, close shave and the battery charge lasted about a month.     </li>
            <li> No need for pre-shave lotion, can be used in shower and easy clean up using water.</li>
            <li> Plus it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I get a close shave, and my skin is no longer irratated because the lotion makes it comfortable.</li>
            <li> The fact that P/N warranty terminates after the initial unit is replaced is not making me a happy P/N customer.  </li>
            <li> The Nivea solution is great, but you can use regular shave cream or gel.  </li>
            <li> After this period this razor was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> because not only does this model have a great quick-charge function</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s smooth shaving from there.</li>
            <li> None shave as close as a cheap Bic or any brand plastic razor.  </li>
            <li> The cream that comes from the razor is like a lubricant and allows the razor to glide smoothly across one&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> CONS - You have to use the razor bent over a sink or in the shower because clippings come out of the head, and they are free to fall from there.  </li>
            <li> I have owned this razor for about 2 months giving it over 2x the recommended break-in period and still cannot get a smooth shave from it.  </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve discovered I enjoy shaving in the shower.  </li>
            <li> - Comfortable to hold and use.  </li>
            <li> freely rotataing heads give me one of the smoothest shaves.  </li>
            <li> Also nice is having lotion electronically dispensed to your face, eliminating the need to repeatedly press the dispensing button on older models.  </li>
            <li> As stated in the manual, you most probably do not get a close shave in the first days of using it.</li>
            <li> It really matches the razor blade shave, but is much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> - The charging and refill system is nice (more on this later).  </li>
            <li> Clean close shave.</li>
            <li> The shave is very comfortable, and very close.  </li>
            <li> The pros of this razor easily satisfy my wonder if I had made the right choice of electric razor and what I needed it for when my \\&quot;manual\\&quot; razor worked so well.  </li>
            <li> blade\\&quot; called the Speed XL, they just seem to be underpowered.(just as a note the older Spectra blade replacements fit these razors and seem to work better).   </li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve never really used a high quality electric before, I think this razor is superb.  </li>
            <li> The shaving is a very pleasant experience, thanks to the wet foam or cream that is used on the face during the shave.</li>
            <li> The Sprectra was more gentle, and the 9160 gave a closer shave as it was a triple head.</li>
            <li> I have been using the cool skin shavers for 9 years.</li>
            <li> I recommend to not use it, as there are better alternatives that are much cheaper.    </li>
            <li> I returned the razor for full refund.</li>
            <li> The ability to dispense lotion directly from the shaver was also a nice feature, eliminating the need to have a separate dispenser of shaving cream or gel.  </li>
            <li> I bought another Cool Skin in 2004 (</li>
            <li> Overall, I am delighted with this shaver, and am awarding it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> 90 mins for a full charge</li>
            <li> but none came close to the shave you get with a good blade, such as the Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> Still, not quite as good as the old model but much closer.</li>
            <li> Norelco 8060X is fantastic, even better than my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> and I can use the 8060 to quickly get rid of my five or six-oclock shadow.  </li>
            <li> The older model did a much better shave.</li>
            <li> So in summary:   Pros: auto-filling lotion cartridge, waterproof, quick charging, does glide well over face (no irritation WHILE shaving, but boy</li>
            <li> and it has a quick charge mode</li>
            <li> I suspect this is gunk is high in bacteria and the cause of most skin infections from nicks.  </li>
            <li> Love the new design.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE MY NEW NORELCO</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice and love the results already - despite the instructions stating that it would take my skin up to 21 days to adjust to the new razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been getting better since!  </li>
            <li> Starting using the day after Christmas and is extremely happy with his new razor.  </li>
            <li> This razor does not have a chamber to collect the cut hair, so you may not want to use it as a dry shaver after putting on a white shirt, but it is the perfect shower shaver, which is where I use it.</li>
            <li> I loved it for the convenience of being able to shave wet or dry, as well as being able to shave in the shower or bath tub.  </li>
            <li> So far though I love the product and it is one of the closest</li>
            <li> The heads are more firmer to allow pushing harder to get more pressure.</li>
            <li> Not have ever seen or used this type of razor before Iwas not convinced it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> A hair catcher would&#x27;ve been a nice edition but the ones in electric trimmers I use or have used only seemed to get in the way.  </li>
            <li> It took some getting use too, but it was well worth the time.</li>
            <li> Theoretically, the lotion should just come out onto the blades and on to the skin but while shaving the lotion leaks out to the underside of the blade where it doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot of good.</li>
            <li> This new system is a huge improvement over previous models, and I am really happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It also shaves much faster than the older model, courtesy of having more blades in the shaving head.    </li>
            <li> , it seems to be the right thickness for the razor and works alomost as well as the cream you load in the razor.      </li>
            <li> Yes, that&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is the best all around razor I have owned, there is a brief time required for your face to get used to any new razor...</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get as close of a shave with it at first, but as the manual says - some break-in is required, and now that I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks - it&#x27;s doing a great job</li>
            <li> PROS - Decent close shave with comfortable grip.</li>
            <li> The older Norelco had to be held in my fist - the newer model can be comfortably held in my fingers.    </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s going to be used for a light trim rather than being my main razor.</li>
            <li> So all in all not a bad electric razor but be be aware it will not leave your skin clean shaven and smooth like a traditional razor will.</li>
            <li> A good shave takes roughly 5 minutes, more or less the same time as a good razor shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a single electric razor that shaves as close as a blade, but I used to own a Norelco Advantage that gave a decently close shave that was pretty comfortable and didn&#x27;t irritate my neck.    </li>
            <li> Here is what makes this new razor fantastic.</li>
            <li> - I haven&#x27;t found a great shower mirror yet, so I wind up starting my shave prior to the shower, to trim around sideburns and the like.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this razor and would suggest it to anyone looking for a new electric.  </li>
            <li> I know it takes a full three weeks before skin can adjust to a new razor, but the first time i used this razor I got a super-smooth shave-something rare for my stubbornly scruffy face.  </li>
            <li> Now it is giving me a decent shave and it does it quickly.</li>
            <li> I also had to pass this around the same areas so many times.</li>
            <li> This was definitely a first for me, as well as others I knew</li>
            <li> This is the first wet/dry I have owned</li>
            <li> Just keep the shaver running under a tap of hot water for 30 seconds.    </li>
            <li> - many foil shavers let you simply flip up the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver that I have used.</li>
            <li> Often seems better without the nivea squirted internally.  </li>
            <li> When I had my original norelco cool skin, it required individual Nivea skin packs.</li>
            <li> The shaving 8060X system is a significant improvement over the old cartidge type models.</li>
            <li> I can have a bunch hanging in the shower and replace a spent one very easily.</li>
            <li> The lotion charging station is pretty cool too, no mess.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I can see from the other ratings that many people have had a lot of success with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable but not as close as enclosed head design it replaced; keeping as spare and ordering more traditional model for daily use.</li>
            <li> I order the Norelco 8060X to replace an old Norelco Cool Shave razor.     </li>
            <li> Anyway, the 8060x makes many improvements over the older line but further improvements can be made.  </li>
            <li> I like this design much better than the Cool Skin Norelco that this unit replaced -- none of those little packets of shaving lotion</li>
            <li> The blades disassemble easily so you can get at those occasional \\&quot;longer</li>
            <li> By the time you have read the detailed instuction book you have to go back to figure out exactly how to do something.  </li>
            <li> Shaving is pure pleasure with the Nivea lotion.  </li>
            <li> I think the moisturizing system on an electric razor is pure genius</li>
            <li> The new Norelco 8060x Coolskin is far better than the old 7xxx series in practically every way.    </li>
            <li> Description of product was very informative.</li>
            <li> The shave is very close</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the razor all that much.</li>
            <li> The head system is much improved with no shaver body around the heads allowing the heads to trim easier under the nose and side burns.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver!     </li>
            <li> Having lotion automatically dispensed into the shaver is a real luxury.  </li>
            <li> It shaves very well.</li>
            <li> My husband used it for a month and really wanted to like it</li>
            <li> Having the lotion come from the center of the blades is a much more efficient design.</li>
            <li> so maybe I am asking too much from an electric razor (that is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1).  </li>
            <li> Buy the shaver, then using the much cheaper gel that you slap on your face.</li>
            <li> - The moisturizing system does work very well.  </li>
            <li> but my shaving time did not improve much in a month.</li>
            <li> The lotion cans are very convenient.    </li>
            <li> The lotion comes through two stems coming off of the body and then through a hole in the center of the top two blades.</li>
            <li> One needs to use it more frequently than a traditional blade shaver</li>
            <li> I bought the first edition of the Norelco Cool Skin/Advantage shavers back in 1999.  </li>
            <li> Remember to wet your face first, and when things start to drag, using a bit more water, as well as Nivea, keeps things moving smoothly along.  </li>
            <li> I own the previous model of this razor and bought the new model because I travel a lot.</li>
            <li> I will start out by saying that I am in the military and required to have a very clean shave</li>
            <li> Every other brand of electric shaver I have used has worked better.</li>
            <li> I attempt to get everything I can Philips, my 32\\&quot; LCD, my Sonicare Elite with the UV station, my 2030 Bodygroom, so many other things.</li>
            <li> You must take the blade and cutter assembly apart to clean properly and if you cut longer hairs by accident(side burn area etc.)</li>
            <li> If you have had problems in the past with an electric shaver, I do not believe you will have any better success with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have tried both the special Nivea lotion and regular shaving foam.</li>
            <li> In short, if you only plan to use this razor in the shower this is a good choice, but if you need to use the razor outside of the shower as well, you may want to choose something else.</li>
            <li> Though I am sure the lotion is not very cheap.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is constructed well and is lighter and more compact than previous models.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who was using a much older version.</li>
            <li> I have changed batteries in several of my Norelco shavers and the build up of gunk where only disassembly could find and cure it, is remarkable(same with most brands).  </li>
            <li> Foil shavers seem to cut the hairs further below the skin than rotary shavers, so 24 hours later you will have more growth from a rotary shave than a foil shave.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention having to fuss with the Nivea cartridges used in older models.    </li>
            <li> My older Norelco and Braun are being retired.</li>
            <li> I had an older version of this type of waterproof shaver that lasted for 5+ years.</li>
            <li> I did not expect this product to truly replace blade shaving, but I had hoped, especially with the lubricate dispenser to let me do quick touch ups.  </li>
            <li> I have already learned to scale back my use of this conditioner to only a couple of pumps for each shave, which hopefully will allow one to get many shaves from a bottle of conditioner</li>
            <li> You have to mount the trimmer in place of the main shaving heads on the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I think this product would work better if shaven every day or alternate days and with not that coarse hair as mine.</li>
            <li> you have to do with the older line.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> so they can squeeze a little more out of ya.</li>
            <li> In the few months I&#x27;ve owned it, I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the performance and the overall results.  </li>
            <li> and I usually shave every 4 to 5 days which might be the reason that I am not finding this shaver good enough for me.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller and more lightweight than its predecessors, it&#x27;s easier to clean due to its open design, and not having to replace lotion cartridges every couple of weeks is a plus.</li>
            <li> I own a Norelco dry shaver electric razor and a panosonic wet</li>
            <li> and if so it doesn&#x27;t have to be done right away, especially if you&#x27;re in a rush.  </li>
            <li> The new model on the other hand shaves just as close, but is also extremely comfortable, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin irritated, even during the regrowth phase.    </li>
            <li> In addition, when it is time to replace the razor heads, you take the triple razor head off and snap on a new one.</li>
            <li> and I ordered a set of new blades.</li>
            <li> There is nothing new about the moisturizing angle here, Braun Freegliders did this and has since dropped it.</li>
            <li> Compared to my Braun (and a new Panasonic a friend loaned me), it still takes longer to shave with the 8060x, but the shave is now as close.  </li>
            <li> The redesigned head makes it much easier to shave in hard to reach places, notably the neck and below the nose.  </li>
            <li> Another hitch I found was that the shaver does get filled with the Nivea shaving lotion but not enough (atleast for me) for the entire shave.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of very old cans  of Gillette foamy Gel.  </li>
            <li> After reading the numerous positive reviews I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> Evidently the hair growth is different than on the face.  </li>
            <li> and I am experiencing exactly the same problem</li>
            <li> The blade assembly is completely seperate from the motor unit&#x3D; no place for gunk to build up!</li>
            <li> I feel exactly the same way.  </li>
            <li> I remember the first one I bought was a basic corded shaver.</li>
            <li> My 7775X is quieter than the first two, but 8060X is so quiet you may not even know</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Mach3 Turbo for the past three years or so and was generally pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> First off, this razor is relatively compact over the 7XXX line.</li>
            <li> I must say the dry shaver was less pleasant and more irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> Cons: seems to cause ingrown hairs at a higher rate than its predecessors, very high neck irritation, lotion seems to drip off of razor head while shaving, not a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> With each can there is a new insert to replace the old one.</li>
            <li> The old razor was causing a rash on his neck and even with new blades, he was no longer getting a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that this razor is a huge improvement over previous models.</li>
            <li> This is a huge advancement over the previous model.</li>
            <li> While the shaver does fine on my cheeks, it does little or nothing on my neck.  </li>
            <li> The 8060X gives a close, comfortable shave particularly when you press the blue button to apply Nivea shaving conditioner to your face directly through two holes in the center of two of the three shaving heads.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor, although I will agree with some of the bad reviews, the open head does let a lot of the hair trimmings fall on the floor or counter or where ever you are shaving, but if you actually use the lotion it comes with, it collects most of the trimmings so you dont have a mess to clean up.</li>
            <li> - Works better as a wet razor than as a dry one.  </li>
            <li> Now maybe I&#x27;m just one unlucky guy, getting two shavers that have exactly the same problems and almost within the same time frame (1 year), but this seems to indicate a design flaw in this particular model.</li>
            <li> The main problem I find with this new design is that the heads/razors are floating and not encased as previous models and most other shavers.</li>
            <li> The overall quality is just as good as previous models and other Philips/Norelco products.   </li>
            <li> I still use the older model and there is no comparison in the shave I get from the new model especially if I miss a day shaving.</li>
            <li> The only issue he had with this product was getting a real close shave under his chin, neck area.  </li>
            <li> With sensitive skin, I still needed to use pre-electric shave with either.</li>
            <li> In the old days, you would buy a box of 10 nivea cartridges, and throw each away.</li>
            <li> The old blades must have dulled eventhough</li>
            <li> I like the Nivea Gel for Sensitive Skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter, easier to use, and is  quite a bit quieter than my old razor.</li>
            <li> but I never seem to let it drain completely.</li>
            <li> So I also bought a Braun for occasions when I wanted a faster and really close (though somewhat more irritating</li>
            <li> I think that it would do a good job for someone who doesn&#x27;t have as such thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> I use mine in the shower so no mess.  </li>
            <li> I found the entire system to be durable and high quality.  </li>
            <li> So it takes a bit longer to shave than with a conventional electric shaver, but the results are certainly worth it.</li>
            <li> I love the wet shavers and have had a previous Norelco model.  </li>
            <li> Little irritation and its works fine was traditional shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Have to shave every day or it becomes difficult to get clean shave without many passes and then not completely; no weekend slackening off!</li>
            <li> The old models shaved very close, but irritated my skin and left me red and inflamed.    </li>
            <li> There is a small reservoir in the shaver which can be filled automatically with conditioner from the Nivea bottle while the unit is charging.  </li>
            <li> Because the shaver does not catch shaved hair, the stubble tends to collect on your face (which you always wet first), where the conditioner holds it until you wash your face after shaving.  </li>
            <li> - I shave more often using this than any other razor I&#x27;ve used previously.    </li>
            <li> I am disapponted in the new model because it simply does not give a close shave.</li>
            <li> The pivoting blades are very good, but the trimmer is awkward to use and not nearly as good as what many other shavers have.  </li>
            <li> The only negative for some people might be the size or shape of the handle, it is smaleer and lighter than most shavers.  </li>
            <li> The protective cap for the shaving heads is much improved - it is less likey to be dislodged than was the case with older models.    </li>
            <li> To me this is a major oversight and design flaw.   </li>
            <li> Three weeks ago I purchased the 8060x without any expectations of a major improvement.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a step in the right direction from the previous models.</li>
            <li> The shave is closer than any other electric shaver and my skin feels soft afterwards thanks to the lotion.  </li>
            <li> The cutters have more blades on each, so the shave is faster and the motor seems stronger than previous models, hence less slowing.   </li>
            <li> This electric razor provides a decent shave but takes double the amount of time as using a regular razor and doesn&#x27;t get as close.  </li>
            <li> Two months ago, I switched back to the old manual razor.  </li>
            <li> Hard to clean.  </li>
            <li> The shaving system allows simply plugging the razor in the charging station and filling and charging in one simple action.</li>
            <li> This same email will be posted on every review I can find as well as major social networks.</li>
            <li> Norelco Customer Service is also hard to beat - they stand behind their products and will go above and beyond to keep their customers happy.</li>
            <li> Not so with the new Norelco - it now shaves as close, with far less irritation.    </li>
            <li> This new Norelco will not match a blade - at least for me, with my combination of tough beard and tender skin - but it is far superior to any other electric shaver I have used.  </li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t as good as the other reviews make it out to be, at least in my humble opinion.  </li>
            <li> I have horribly dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is lighter than the old model, but the battery charge doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> Norelco user - started with Norelco Advantage 5 or 6 years ago, then had two different Cool Skin shavers, and now have been using the new 8060X for the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> The shave cream is in a bigger package than my previous razor, but it is only two and a half ounces and didn&#x27;t really last much longer than the package inserts on my old razor.  </li>
            <li> The current price I think is a little high.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars, because the conditioner that is automatically loaded into the razor during the charge, doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion the trimmer is too small and operates too slowly to be effective - it appears to be a poor aferthought.  </li>
            <li> The blade system snaps out and offers a snap in trimmmer that actually works well unlike previous models where the trimmers were marginal.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco shavers are not worth anywhere near the prices shown.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;shaves very well in small places.</li>
            <li> I have owned this for only a month so cannot comment on how long the conditioner lasts, etc.  </li>
            <li> This shaver excels in convex facial skin areas, but not concave underarm areas at least for this user.</li>
            <li> Certainly it still has to pass the test of time which to this point has only been a little less than three months.  </li>
            <li> I might be doing something wrong, but it seems the new model doesn&#x27;t cut my beard nearly as well as the 3 year old model I have.     </li>
            <li> Other reviewers have noted the absence of a chamber to catch cut hairs, and as Norelco points out, Nivea is the key to keeping cuttings in place until the shaver is cleaned.    </li>
            <li> other than that, i got very little razor burn the first time i used it, just as i have with all other electric razors, but that was the one and only time it messed up my neck.</li>
            <li> Some reviews complained about the razor using too much lotion and not getting a close shave</li>
            <li> It is a pity the battery charger does not have a simple timer for this charging problem.    </li>
            <li> This shaver takes too long to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I  finally have gotten used to the Norelco Nivea wet shaving machine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it too long now to return, so</li>
            <li> It boggles my mind that I can run an electric shaver over a patch of stubble and the stubble will sit there, unaffected, as if nothing at all had happened.  </li>
            <li> When I first got this shaver I had already read other reviews negatively reflect on the break-in period.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s less than average, it simply doesn&#x27;t give a close shave, and the unusual design means that the few clippings it does make aren&#x27;t captured.    </li>
            <li> I have had the Norelco dry razors and lotion razors over the years.</li>
            <li> I went to a dry shave with the Spectra and then the triple head 9160.</li>
            <li> There was no time saving when using the dry shaver.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how expensive blades had become, and how much slower a razor shave is.</li>
            <li> The funny thing is that in the beginning it probably could have been worse.  </li>
            <li> I see that after even long , careful shaving there was residual hair on my face.</li>
            <li> I compared the shaving comfort of this wet shaver with the shaving comfort of my fiends Philips dry shaver</li>
            <li> The mostly read that at first the shaver can be awful on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Did I mention how well this new design shaves tough to get places like your upper lip/nose area?</li>
            <li> Some reviews have said that the cartridge does not hold enough lotion and that the clippings make a mess.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that I cannot dispense \\&quot;just a little bit\\&quot; of lotion in order to shave my mustache.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it so bad</li>
            <li> I love this shaver, and feel badly that I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> This product is far too complex for the benefits received.  </li>
            <li> It is far too complex for the purpose at hand.</li>
            <li> It is meant to be used wet and with the Nivea lotion since when used without hair clippings will go everywhere.</li>
            <li> I call Philips/Norelco customer care, the shaver has a 2 year warranty, but not really.  </li>
            <li> This shaver was bought for me after careful studying of the reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> However, the quality is what I expected from a Norelco.</li>
            <li> The battery can be overcharged, so be careful.  </li>
            <li> I then saw this on the lightning deal, and was curious how a wet shaver would work.  </li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re troubled by hair growing out of your ears (Norelco calls this \\&quot;second puberty\\&quot;), the heads do a decent job of reaching this area.    </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have pointed out this is really not a razor to use in the car.</li>
            <li> Electric razors never seem to get close enough and usually cause me to break out in a rash.</li>
            <li> Guess it&#x27;s time to consider other shavers and that would be my advise for those looking at the P/N models.</li>
            <li> The old razor heads merely recessed back into the body when pressed harder.</li>
            <li> I always tried to avoid mixing shaving before a shower due to the irritation, but this works well.  </li>
            <li> Other people have mentioned that the hairs fall out of this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have used a variety of razors over the past few years and received comments at work about the state of my neck - red, irritated - resembling an altercation with a hangman.</li>
            <li> Also it comes with a smaller travel charger base which I prefer anyways as the refill station is enormous and takes up too much counter space.</li>
            <li> In other words, you now buy a can and no longer buy these little Nivea packs.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be the upgrade to the Advantage, but after just a few days of use my neck is chewed up far worse than it ever has been with any other electric.  </li>
            <li> That package is now in my hometown post office in less than a day.</li>
            <li> Previous review:   </li>
            <li> Hidden Build up.</li>
            <li> My previous was the 7775X.</li>
            <li> I have noticed it takes less time to shave.</li>
            <li> I get substantially less skin irritation than I have in previous razors that I&#x27;ve used.    </li>
            <li> The blades sit atop the body making the razor smaller overall but leaves the blades vulnerable to damage during travel.</li>
            <li> The bottles are $10 for less than 3 oz.</li>
            <li> the razor would leak lotion out of the side of the razor when in the dispenser making a mess.    </li>
            <li> This model is a lot less messy to use, but moisturizer is still a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> it would sometimes leave my skin irritated from shaving a little too close.  </li>
            <li> I have thick facial hair that has always been hard to shave.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Having used it now for a couple months (they recommend that you use it a few months to get accustomed to it)</li>
            <li> Part of my problem may be that I&#x27;m a shaving perfectionist and if I&#x27;m not getting a close shave in a given area I&#x27;ll go over it again a few times until the hairs are cut off.  </li>
            <li> Here are a few things I&#x27;ve found...    </li>
            <li> I recommend this razor despite the few gripes I have about it.</li>
            <li> If you have poor skin or when you first use this it chafes your skin badly, give it some time because your skin should definitely become accustomed to it</li>
            <li> There is no doubt, atleast for me that this shaver takes awful more time to shave than the conventional blade razors (Mach-3).</li>
            <li> But this is a design issue that I suspect is not easily overcome with a triple head rotary shaver.    </li>
            <li> As the cutter and blades fill up the motor is not able to maintain the speed and nicks result.  </li>
            <li> had used an electric razor in the past.  </li>
            <li> In the past I could never find an electric razor that worked for me.</li>
            <li> For the past six years I have been using the 6756 Advantage razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaving system in the hopes that it could make shaving a bit less painful, as I&#x27;ve always had fairly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> He has a very heavy beard and at the end of each day has a five o&#x27;clock shadow.  </li>
            <li> The shallow heads can make you get closer to hard to reach areas like under your nose, as opposed to previous models.  </li>
            <li> For the past 4 years, I was using an expensive Braun dry shaver and not getting a close shave.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for at least the past 7 years.</li>
            <li> It came with a single blade system, I found it difficult to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> So when this product is dropped by the mfgr, parts are hard to come by (as to the moisturizer canisters or whatever it is).</li>
            <li> I have used the shaver in my car when running late and do not worry about hairs getting all over the place.  </li>
            <li> I have owned at least a dozen electric razors - Remington, Braun, Norelco -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying enough that I&#x27;m not willing to \\&quot;wait it</li>
            <li> (If you overcharge for a few extra hours nothing bad seems to happen with the shaver, but Philips writes that overcharging is not good for the lifetime of the battery.)</li>
            <li> Again I unfortunately can&#x27;t compare to other electrics on the market.  </li>
            <li> As bad as it was, I have to say that I believe it was my atypical skin that aided in causing this.  </li>
            <li> Underarm shaving is not good with any part of this system, but maybe it wasn&#x27;t meant to be.  </li>
            <li> I would like to file a complaint against false information against Amazon.</li>
            <li> it will wrap around the cutting blade and really slow the motor down.</li>
            <li> I am retired and for me to change habits is tough</li>
            <li> This product works as expected, nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li> However I went through a worse \\&quot;break-in\\&quot; period than the ones I read about.  </li>
            <li> I have not experienced any of these problems.</li>
            <li> I eventually got tired of using it b/c</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this also makes it difficult for me to compare it to ones that I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> The blades especially take awful lot of time to cut the hair and especially in the neck area it was a painful job for me to get rid of the hair.</li>
            <li> The motor slowing is the worst on the new \\&quot;3</li>
            <li> No more missed hairs just below the nostrels!!!</li>
            <li> but sorry. &#x3D;</li>
            <li> Therefore, one does not need to keep purchasing the expensive norelco shaving cream.</li>
            <li> If you overuse the conditioner, it can get expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have a difficult time shaving so after reading the reviews I ordered this.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of months, it started leaving cuts on my neck and my face felt uncomfortable when finished.  </li>
            <li> Having to detach the cutting heads and replace them with the trimmer is inconvenient</li>
            <li> The stuff you never knew was there is nasty!    </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Description of product was very informative. No need for pre-shave lotion, can be used in shower and easy clean up using water.</li>
            <li> I bought this electric razor for my husband for Christmas.  He has a very heavy beard and at the end of each day has a five o&#x27;clock shadow.  He had to get use to using an electric razor but was impressed with the moisturizing cream which helped in getting a close shave without razor burn.  The only issue he had with this product was getting a real close shave under his chin, neck area.  Evidently the hair growth is different than on the face.  He has to repeat the area to get all the hairs under his chin and neck.</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with electric razors. Electric razors never seem to get close enough and usually cause me to break out in a rash. So far I have been extremely impressed with this razor. The shave is very close and I don&#x27;t have problems with skin irritation. Plus it is easy to clean. I lather my face with soap pre-shave which helps cut back on the amount of nivea lotion I need to use. The only downside on mine is that the refill station does not appear to work. This is not a big deal though as you can fill it manually with the nivea lotion bottle. Also it comes with a smaller travel charger base which I prefer anyways as the refill station is enormous and takes up too much counter space. As other reviewers have pointed out this is really not a razor to use in the car. It is meant to be used wet and with the Nivea lotion since when used without hair clippings will go everywhere. I found when using soap and the lotion I do not have a problem with clippings. In the manual on page 22 it states: \\&quot;This razor has no hair collection chamber to capture stubble. To prevent stubble from falling, apply sufficient shaving conditioner while shaving.\\&quot; If you don&#x27;t intend to use moisturizer with this system then you would probably be better off buying a product that is not designed for it. So far though I love the product and it is one of the closest shaves I ever had. On a side note I only paid $109 when I purchased mine. The current price I think is a little high. Awesome product highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It took 3 weeks for my face to get accustomed to the electric razor-I love this thing.I shave everywhere! In the shower,watching TV,while on the computer,driving.I can throw away my styptic pencil,finally!</li>
            <li> I have had the Norelco dry razors and lotion razors over the years. This is the best one they have made. When I had my original norelco cool skin, it required individual Nivea skin packs. It came with a single blade system, I found it difficult to get a close shave. The packs were not convenient. I went to a dry shave with the Spectra and then the triple head 9160. The Sprectra was more gentle, and the 9160 gave a closer shave as it was a triple head. With sensitive skin, I still needed to use pre-electric shave with either. I would need to use a regular razor to touch up with both some times. Here is what makes this new razor fantastic. It uses the triple head system so you get a closer shave, and by electronic touch, nivea skin lotion comes out of two heads.The charging stand holds a nivea can that automatically fills the razor when the lotion runs out. In other words, you now buy a can and no longer buy these little Nivea packs. With each can there is a new insert to replace the old one. In the old days, you would buy a box of 10 nivea cartridges, and throw each away. With this, the can refills the razor.  There is no longer a hair collection area surrounded by a metal blade holder as the triple head blades are exposed. Because of this, you can get closer in areas around your nose and sideburns. The head unit swivels around your chin making it easier. The blade system snaps out and offers a snap in trimmmer that actually works well unlike previous models where the trimmers were marginal. Because of this, I no longer need to use a regular razor to touch up. I get a close shave, and my skin is no longer irratated because the lotion makes it comfortable. In addition, when it is time to replace the razor heads, you take the triple razor head off and snap on a new one. This eliminates having to replace each head individually which if you have ever dropped one, was sometimes a hassle. This new system is a huge improvement over previous models, and I am really happy with my purchase. The model below this is the 8040. The only difference is you fill that model with the can manually, and it takes 4 hours to charge versus the 1.5 hours the 8060 takes. I wanted the stand and faster charge time. Great razor for sensitive skin.    Update: one year later I was told I can no longer use the Nivea lotion as it irritates rosecea. I have bought an Arcitec 1050 and it works well.</li>
            <li> works great!  i&#x27;d highly recommend this product.  i love shaving in the shower as it gives a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Gives a great shave and is very gentle on the skin. I&#x27;ve had the razor about month and I could not be happier.</li>
            <li> I would like to file a complaint against false information against Amazon. I ordered the above product on October 13. I received conformation that the product shipped on October 14 from a facility that is 45 mins away. The USPS tracking information stated that they had not received the package until today, October 17. That package is now in my hometown post office in less than a day. See if Amazon ACTUALLY sent that package on the 14 then there is no reason I would not have it on the 15 or 16 at the very latest. I believe that Amazon chose to hold my package and claim shipment because I did not want to pay out the extra money for speedy shipment. This same email will be posted on every review I can find as well as major social networks. I want everyone to know how Amazon is playing them when shipping their products.</li>
            <li> An update: To be fair I might have over-reacted in my judgement of this product. I decided to try one more thing and I ordered a set of new blades. That improved the razor dramatically. The old blades must have dulled eventhough I didn&#x27;t use the razor all that much. Now it is giving me a decent shave and it does it quickly. Still, not quite as good as the old model but much closer. My 2 star rating should be changed to 4 stars (Amazon doesn&#x27;t seem to let me do this).    Previous review:   I own the previous model of this razor and bought the new model because I travel a lot. I loved using the older model in the shower. While it is heavier than the new model it gave me a good, close shave and the battery charge lasted about a month.     I am disapponted in the new model because it simply does not give a close shave. I still use the older model and there is no comparison in the shave I get from the new model especially if I miss a day shaving. I might be doing something wrong, but it seems the new model doesn&#x27;t cut my beard nearly as well as the 3 year old model I have.     I like that it is lighter than the old model, but the battery charge doesn&#x27;t last as long. And while I thought it was a great idea that you can pump in the Nivea cream, I actually find the packets more convenient. I can have a bunch hanging in the shower and replace a spent one very easily. Not so with the can.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who was using a much older version. Starting using the day after Christmas and is extremely happy with his new razor.  The old razor was causing a rash on his neck and even with new blades, he was no longer getting a close shave.  Some reviews complained about the razor using too much lotion and not getting a close shave but we do not share this view.  This is a great razor and gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I have tried several Brands of Electric Shavers, Norelco is the only one that works for me. Norelco 8060X is fantastic, even better than my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for almost 2 years (purchased 12/08).  I&#x27;ve found the quality of the shave to be very good.  However I found the quality of the shaver to not meet my expectations.  After a year of usage my shaver would stop intermittently while I was shaving. After a couple weeks the shaver would not turn on at all. The shaver was replaced under warranty.      Walk the calendar forward to Nov 2010 and I am experiencing exactly the same problem, shaver stops intermittently while I&#x27;m shaving (even though it&#x27;s fully charged). Knowing what&#x27;s about to occur AGAIN I call Philips/Norelco customer care, the shaver has a 2 year warranty, but not really.  While P/N warranties the shaver for 2 years, they only cover replacement ONCE. Even though I&#x27;m still within my 2 year warranty, the unit is no longer covered.     Now maybe I&#x27;m just one unlucky guy, getting two shavers that have exactly the same problems and almost within the same time frame (1 year), but this seems to indicate a design flaw in this particular model. The fact that P/N warranty terminates after the initial unit is replaced is not making me a happy P/N customer.  Guess it&#x27;s time to consider other shavers and that would be my advise for those looking at the P/N models.</li>
            <li> The Phillips Norelco 8060X Moisturizing Shaving System is one of the best shavers out there. With fathers day coming up, its a gift that any father would love to receive.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco shavers are not worth anywhere near the prices shown. They don&#x27;t do a good job. Every other brand of electric shaver I have used has worked better.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000UJZIEY Philips Norelco 8060X Moisturizing Shaving System]]  This shaver was bought for me after careful studying of the reviews on Amazon. Now after three weeks of shaving I can say that I am quite satisfied.    The tool is very quiet, gives a good close shave, almost as good as a razor shave. The shaving is a very pleasant experience, thanks to the wet foam or cream that is used on the face during the shave. I have tried both the special Nivea lotion and regular shaving foam. They work equally well. No hair or foam is spilled onto your shirt or over the sink.     A good shave takes roughly 5 minutes, more or less the same time as a good razor shave. The cleaning of the shaver is very easy, a quick rinse under the faucet.     All in all, the shaving experience is very similar to a razor shave. The advantage is that the shaver never cuts you, something a razor blade cannot achieve.    The only drawback is that the batteries should not be overcharged. Therefore you have to make an effort to stop the charging process after 90 minutes. (If you overcharge for a few extra hours nothing bad seems to happen with the shaver, but Philips writes that overcharging is not good for the lifetime of the battery.) It is a pity the battery charger does not have a simple timer for this charging problem.    I compared the shaving comfort of this wet shaver with the shaving comfort of my fiends Philips dry shaver [[ASIN:B001AMRQ2W Philips Norelco SpeedXL 8240XL Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]. I must say the dry shaver was less pleasant and more irritating to the skin. There was no time saving when using the dry shaver.</li>
            <li> Have been using a Phillips lotion shaver for several years. I think the shave is close and comfy. This new one is great like all of them. Save your money and don&#x27;t buy the charger/auto  filler. Easier and faster (and cheaper) to fill manually, and charge in the included holder. 5 stars if they didn&#x27;t tell you how great the auto fill is so they can squeeze a little more out of ya. When this one dies I will buy the newer model...Happy Shaving</li>
            <li> This is a great razor, although I will agree with some of the bad reviews, the open head does let a lot of the hair trimmings fall on the floor or counter or where ever you are shaving, but if you actually use the lotion it comes with, it collects most of the trimmings so you dont have a mess to clean up. other than that, i got very little razor burn the first time i used it, just as i have with all other electric razors, but that was the one and only time it messed up my neck. the charging system and auto refill setup is great. all and all, its a great razor and i would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have used electric razors for over 35 years all have good points and all have weaknesses.  Norelco razors have two problems.        Hard to clean.  As the cutter and blades fill up the motor is not able to maintain the speed and nicks result.  You must take the blade and cutter assembly apart to clean properly and if you cut longer hairs by accident(side burn area etc.) it will wrap around the cutting blade and really slow the motor down. The motor slowing is the worst on the new \\&quot;3 blade\\&quot; called the Speed XL, they just seem to be underpowered.(just as a note the older Spectra blade replacements fit these razors and seem to work better).   Think of this problem like a paper shredder that has not beeen emptied and hasn&#x27;t room for more papers in the bin.       Hidden Build up. I have changed batteries in several of my Norelco shavers and the build up of gunk where only disassembly could find and cure it, is remarkable(same with most brands).  I suspect this is gunk is high in bacteria and the cause of most skin infections from nicks.  The stuff you never knew was there is nasty!    Now for the cure: Norelco 8060x!  This razor blade assembly has open backs for the stubble to fall through as you shave. I use mine in the shower so no mess.  The blade assembly is completely seperate from the motor unit&#x3D; no place for gunk to build up! The unit is entirely water proof.  The blades disassemble easily so you can get at those occasional \\&quot;longer hairs\\&quot; that wrap around the cutters. The cutters have more blades on each, so the shave is faster and the motor seems stronger than previous models, hence less slowing.   The Nivea solution is great, but you can use regular shave cream or gel.  I like the Nivea Gel for Sensitive Skin, it seems to be the right thickness for the razor and works alomost as well as the cream you load in the razor.      The only negative for some people might be the size or shape of the handle, it is smaleer and lighter than most shavers.  Some people withlarger hands may find is inconvient and others may find it easy to drop.      Overall this is the best all around razor I have owned, there is a brief time required for your face to get used to any new razor... This ones worth it!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the cool skin shavers for 9 years. My previous was the 7775X. The shaving 8060X system is a significant improvement over the old cartidge type models. The shaving system allows simply plugging the razor in the charging station and filling and charging in one simple action. The head system is much improved with no shaver body around the heads allowing the heads to trim easier under the nose and side burns. The heads are more firmer to allow pushing harder to get more pressure. The old razor heads merely recessed back into the body when pressed harder. I have noticed it takes less time to shave. I have not noticed any closer shave with the 8060X.</li>
            <li> I bought the razor after a period of reflection on the product.Not have ever seen or used this type of razor before Iwas not convinced it was worth the money.I now use it every day.I like the built in despencer for the shaving jell.I carry it with me when I travel.It is on my \\&quot;To give \\&quot; Chrustmas list.Good Product.</li>
            <li> Hi,  I had to return this even though I did not want to. Even after I printed out the RMA I thought to myself, let me give this one more shot. It feels so good on the skin when you hit that lotion button, on the cheeks that is, when I got to my neck oh man it cut my neck up like a cheese grater. It is not the shavers fault, this happens to me with almost every electric shaver except the Bodygroom. I also had to pass this around the same areas so many times. I noticed my neck turning red but I didnt see the cuts, but I felt them when I got in the shower...OUCH!! I wanted to love it so bad but oh well. I love Philips products. I attempt to get everything I can Philips, my 32\\&quot; LCD, my Sonicare Elite with the UV station, my 2030 Bodygroom, so many other things. I just wanted to love this also but sorry. &#x3D;[</li>
            <li> My husband is very pleased with the Norelco 8060X.  When his last electric razor (also a Norelco, which was great) broke after many years of use, I tried to find the closest thing to what he had and came across the 8060X. He shaves in the shower and he likes the way it fits into his hand.  He is so pleased with the way the shave heads move which gives him a close and comfortable shave. He is very happy with the 8060X and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> There is nothing new about the moisturizing angle here, Braun Freegliders did this and has since dropped it. Electric razors work best on a dry beard----and its been that way since they came out over 50 years ago. The after-shave balm is applied AFTER--not during--the shave. So when this product is dropped by the mfgr, parts are hard to come by (as to the moisturizer canisters or whatever it is). Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Great razer.  I like this design much better than the Cool Skin Norelco that this unit replaced -- none of those little packets of shaving lotion, this one fills automatically when you charge it from a bottle of lotion.  Good battery life between charges.  Love that I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my husband because he had used norelco before. He liked this shaver even better. He has senitive skin and fines he hasn&#x27;t had any flair-ups with using this shaver. He loves the warm shave cream that came with it. He said he would rate this shaver with the highest rating.</li>
            <li> When I first got this shaver I had already read other reviews negatively reflect on the break-in period.  The mostly read that at first the shaver can be awful on your skin.  Most also said that after their skin got used to it, it was a worthwhile buy.  I feel exactly the same way.  However I went through a worse \\&quot;break-in\\&quot; period than the ones I read about.  I have horribly dry and sensitive skin.  This shaver cut me numberous times at the beginning.  Yes, that&#x27;s right.  An electric razor cut my skin.  This was definitely a first for me, as well as others I knew had used an electric razor in the past.  As bad as it was, I have to say that I believe it was my atypical skin that aided in causing this.  The funny thing is that in the beginning it probably could have been worse.  The lotion in the shaver helped to minimize the pain and harm that the shaver had caused me.  After this period this razor was fantastic.  I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor, myself, in probably over a decade.  They sure have changed.  Unfortunately this also makes it difficult for me to compare it to ones that I have used in the past.  The ones that I did were practically archaic next to the current products that I shopped through.  The pros of this razor easily satisfy my wonder if I had made the right choice of electric razor and what I needed it for when my \\&quot;manual\\&quot; razor worked so well.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how close this shaver got.  I was astonished.  Again I unfortunately can&#x27;t compare to other electrics on the market.  I love when I&#x27;m in a rush and I can use the 8060 to quickly get rid of my five or six-oclock shadow.  Almost no cleanup and if so it doesn&#x27;t have to be done right away, especially if you&#x27;re in a rush.  A hair catcher would&#x27;ve been a nice edition but the ones in electric trimmers I use or have used only seemed to get in the way.  I&#x27;m happy I got the \\&quot;Shaving System\\&quot; as well because not only does this model have a great quick-charge function but you also never have to manually put the lotion in the shaver.  It&#x27;s done automatically.  And, as stated before, I absolutely love the lotion, especially for difficult skin like mine.  In conclusion the Philips Norelco 8060X Moisturizing Shaving System was a purchase that I am now entirely happy for having bought.  If you have poor skin or when you first use this it chafes your skin badly, give it some time because your skin should definitely become accustomed to it and it&#x27;s smooth shaving from there.</li>
            <li> I love the wet shavers and have had a previous Norelco model.  Love the new design.  The shallow heads can make you get closer to hard to reach areas like under your nose, as opposed to previous models.  The lotion charging station is pretty cool too, no mess.  Though I am sure the lotion is not very cheap.  I have always just applied soap to my face and used the shaver like that and get a great shave.  Would definately recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver almost a month ago and I am perfectly satisfied with my purchase. It is now giving me the closest and smoothest shave I ever had. As stated in the manual, you most probably do not get a close shave in the first days of using it. I love this shaver!</li>
            <li> I really liked the Philips Norelco 8060X Moisturizing Shaving System as I had heard lots of good things about it.  I got it for my husband for his birthday and he too liked it.    The best part is that there is no mess after he is done shaving and leaves his skin smooth and smelling nice.  He doesn&#x27;t have to worry about carrying shaving lotion as it is stored in the razor itself so its convenient for when he is traveling.     I would recommend Philips Norelco 8060X Moisturizing Shaving System to everyone. My husband really likes it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for years. I remember the first one I bought was a basic corded shaver. I currently own 4 Norelco shavers and this one is the best. I love the auto shaving lotion fill dispenser that comes with this unit. But what I loved the most was how good this razor feels as you are shaving. It has the best overall design as it relates to comfort while shaving, from the floating heads with the glide ring, to it&#x27;s thinner, lighter weight. This razor does not have a chamber to collect the cut hair, so you may not want to use it as a dry shaver after putting on a white shirt, but it is the perfect shower shaver, which is where I use it. I LOVE MY NEW NORELCO 8060X. Did I mention how well this new design shaves tough to get places like your upper lip/nose area? No more missed hairs just below the nostrels!!!</li>
            <li> Moisturizing, under the shower operated and much better shaving system. It is a real good improvement. Recommendable for the skeptics.</li>
            <li> The new Norelco 8060x Coolskin is far better than the old 7xxx series in practically every way.    The old models shaved very close, but irritated my skin and left me red and inflamed.    The new model on the other hand shaves just as close, but is also extremely comfortable, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin irritated, even during the regrowth phase.    It also shaves much faster than the older model, courtesy of having more blades in the shaving head.    I highly recommend this shaver!     The only thing I don&#x27;t like, is the Nivea shaving lotion.  I recommend to not use it, as there are better alternatives that are much cheaper.    I use a light glycerin based shaving gel, and I get much better shaves than I do with the Nivea lotion.</li>
            <li> This product is far too complex for the benefits received.  It has a 30+ page instuction book that it is suggested one reads before using.  I own a Norelco dry shaver electric razor and a panosonic wet shave electric razor.  None shave as close as a cheap Bic or any brand plastic razor.  This razor has a stand for charging and a clipper type of attachment.  By the time you have read the detailed instuction book you have to go back to figure out exactly how to do something.  The cream that comes from the razor is like a lubricant and allows the razor to glide smoothly across one&#x27;s face.  Nice!  I haven&#x27;t had to purchase another can so I am relatively satisfied with that feature until I get hit with sticker shock for buying a replacement.  Having used it now for a couple months (they recommend that you use it a few months to get accustomed to it) I consider my evaluation as being legitimate.  I would not purchase this shaver--I could buy a couple years of plastic manual razors and not have to read and reread the instruction manual.  It is far too complex for the purpose at hand.</li>
            <li> I order the Norelco 8060X to replace an old Norelco Cool Shave razor.     PROS - Decent close shave with comfortable grip. Shave lotion filler/dispenser is handy when it works.     CONS - You have to use the razor bent over a sink or in the shower because clippings come out of the head, and they are free to fall from there.  The shave cream is in a bigger package than my previous razor, but it is only two and a half ounces and didn&#x27;t really last much longer than the package inserts on my old razor.  The razor I received had two defects the rotating razor blades would get stuck in the head and the razor would leak lotion out of the side of the razor when in the dispenser making a mess.    I returned the razor for full refund.</li>
            <li> This razor seemed to work well but irritated my skin. I will be returning it to Norelco.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent for an electric razor. One needs to use it more frequently than a traditional blade shaver however, the product works well. Little irritation and its works fine was traditional shaving cream. Therefore, one does not need to keep purchasing the expensive norelco shaving cream.</li>
            <li> In the past I could never find an electric razor that worked for me. It took some getting use too, but it was well worth the time. I think it was the moisturizing cream that made the difference</li>
            <li> This is the third of Norelco&#x27;s waterproof series that I have owned.   The overall quality is just as good as previous models and other Philips/Norelco products.   The shaver is constructed well and is lighter and more compact than previous models. Charging and battery life also seem to be very good.     The main problem I find with this new design is that the heads/razors are floating and not encased as previous models and most other shavers. When using this shaver in the shower this is not a problem. However, when you use this shaver outside of the shower, the lack of casing around the heads means that as you shave, all of the hair pieces fall from the shaver to the counter or wherever else you may be (I would not recommend using this shaver in the car unless you don&#x27;t mind getting yourself and your car covered with hair pieces). To me this is a major oversight and design flaw.   In short, if you only plan to use this razor in the shower this is a good choice, but if you need to use the razor outside of the shower as well, you may want to choose something else.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver!  It replaced an earlier model that used packets for the moisturizer.  This model is a lot less messy to use, but moisturizer is still a bit pricey. However, the quality is what I expected from a Norelco.</li>
            <li> This is the first wet/dry I have owned so I have nothing to compare it to but it works as advertised. Used it for a month and no problems yet.</li>
            <li> I bought the first edition of the Norelco Cool Skin/Advantage shavers back in 1999.  I loved it for the convenience of being able to shave wet or dry, as well as being able to shave in the shower or bath tub.  The ability to dispense lotion directly from the shaver was also a nice feature, eliminating the need to have a separate dispenser of shaving cream or gel.  I bought another Cool Skin in 2004 (model 7775X).  I found these shavers delivered a very smooth, comfortable shave on my tender skin.  But the shave wasn&#x27;t as close as a foil shaver, and it took longer to shave.  So I also bought a Braun for occasions when I wanted a faster and really close (though somewhat more irritating) shave.    Three weeks ago I purchased the 8060x without any expectations of a major improvement.  What a pleasant surprise!  This shaver is much better than my 2004 model, and eliminates the need for a foil shaver.    I like its form factor - it&#x27;s a bit lighter than my 7775X, and its smaller size makes it easier to hold and manipulate.  The older Norelco had to be held in my fist - the newer model can be comfortably held in my fingers.    The protective cap for the shaving heads is much improved - it is less likey to be dislodged than was the case with older models.    The redesigned head makes it much easier to shave in hard to reach places, notably the neck and below the nose.  And if you&#x27;re troubled by hair growing out of your ears (Norelco calls this \\&quot;second puberty\\&quot;), the heads do a decent job of reaching this area.    Compared to my Braun (and a new Panasonic a friend loaned me), it still takes longer to shave with the 8060x, but the shave is now as close.  \\&quot;Close\\&quot; means 24 hours after you shave.  Foil shavers seem to cut the hairs further below the skin than rotary shavers, so 24 hours later you will have more growth from a rotary shave than a foil shave.  Not so with the new Norelco - it now shaves as close, with far less irritation.    Shaving is pure pleasure with the Nivea lotion.  Remember to wet your face first, and when things start to drag, using a bit more water, as well as Nivea, keeps things moving smoothly along.  Other reviewers have noted the absence of a chamber to catch cut hairs, and as Norelco points out, Nivea is the key to keeping cuttings in place until the shaver is cleaned.    Cleaning the heads is easy.  Just keep the shaver running under a tap of hot water for 30 seconds.    I love the convenience of the 8060x&#x27;s charging stand.  Having lotion automatically dispensed into the shaver is a real luxury.  Also nice is having lotion electronically dispensed to your face, eliminating the need to repeatedly press the dispensing button on older models.  Not to mention having to fuss with the Nivea cartridges used in older models.    This is also a very quiet shaver.  My Braun sounds like a buzz saw, and my friend&#x27;s Panasonic sounded like a dentist&#x27;s drill.  My 7775X is quieter than the first two, but 8060X is so quiet you may not even know it&#x27;s on!    Negatives?  Having to detach the cutting heads and replace them with the trimmer is inconvenient - many foil shavers let you simply flip up the trimmer.  But this is a design issue that I suspect is not easily overcome with a triple head rotary shaver.    Overall, I am delighted with this shaver, and am awarding it 5 stars.  My older Norelco and Braun are being retired.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for about a month.  It shaves very well. My only suggestion is that everyone read the instructions, especially regarding cleaning and recharging. The razor doesn&#x27;t have to continuously be in the charging stand. The battery can be overcharged, so be careful.  That is my only caution regarding this razor.  I am very pleased with the quality of my shaves and ease of operation.</li>
            <li> I never though I would Like an electric shave but this one is the best I&#x27;ve ever had, way to go Norelco</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for his birthday. I liked the concept of the moisturizing lotion. My husband used it for a month and really wanted to like it but found that it just doesn&#x27;t work for him. The shave on this razor left him having to shave twice. He&#x27;s always used Panasonic wet/dry razors and they have always served him well with the exception of battery life. They just die after a year. So we wanted to give Norelco a shot. We did, but it didn&#x27;t work out. Back to Panasonic.</li>
            <li> This shaver takes too long to get the job done. It has many great features and a cool look. I had an older version of this type of waterproof shaver that lasted for 5+ years. The older model did a much better shave.</li>
            <li> For the past six years I have been using the 6756 Advantage razor. I have to say that this razor is a huge improvement over previous models. It&#x27;s lighter, easier to use, and is  quite a bit quieter than my old razor. Another improvement is the location of the lotion dispensing holes. Having the lotion come from the center of the blades is a much more efficient design. Some reviews have said that the cartridge does not hold enough lotion and that the clippings make a mess. I have not experienced any of these problems. The only issue I have is that I cannot dispense \\&quot;just a little bit\\&quot; of lotion in order to shave my mustache. I guess I will just have to adjust when I press the button.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS ITEM AFTER I WAS IN IRAQ.  THIS ITEM IS EXCELLENT AND I LOVE IT, I DONT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THIS RAZOR.  THIS RAZOR IS GOOD IN THE SHOWER OR JUST SITTING IN YOUR ROOM SHAVING BEFORE YOU HEAD INTO WORK, I HAVE READ REPORTS WHERE PEOPLE SAY THE RAZOR DROPS FACIAL HAIR ON TO YOUR CLOTHING I HAVE NOT HAD A PROBLEM WITH THIS.  IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD RAZOR I RECOMMEND THIS RAZOR TO EVERYONE.</li>
            <li> After never being able to use any electric razor in my life I  finally have gotten used to the Norelco Nivea wet shaving machine.  I am retired and for me to change habits is tough but this works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Mach3 Turbo for the past three years or so and was generally pleased with the results.  I eventually got tired of using it b/c it would sometimes leave my skin irritated from shaving a little too close.  Well I bought the 8060X and it came in a couple days ago.  I&#x27;ve used it twice and love the results already - despite the instructions stating that it would take my skin up to 21 days to adjust to the new razor.  While I&#x27;ve never really used a high quality electric before, I think this razor is superb.  I get a close shave (but not too close) and the lotion dispenser keeps the razor gliding easily.    Anyway, I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> After reading the numerous positive reviews I had high hopes for this product.  I will start out by saying that I am in the military and required to have a very clean shave so maybe I am asking too much from an electric razor (that is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1).  I have owned this razor for about 2 months giving it over 2x the recommended break-in period and still cannot get a smooth shave from it.  This electric razor provides a decent shave but takes double the amount of time as using a regular razor and doesn&#x27;t get as close.  I will say that it does a better job than most electric razors I have used but it isn&#x27;t as good as the other reviews make it out to be, at least in my humble opinion.  So all in all not a bad electric razor but be be aware it will not leave your skin clean shaven and smooth like a traditional razor will.</li>
            <li> I did not expect this product to truly replace blade shaving, but I had hoped, especially with the lubricate dispenser to let me do quick touch ups.  While the shaver does fine on my cheeks, it does little or nothing on my neck.  I found that just constant rinsing the shaver with water works best.  If you have had problems in the past with an electric shaver, I do not believe you will have any better success with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Great new product form Norelco! I&#x27;m a long time Norelco user - started with Norelco Advantage 5 or 6 years ago, then had two different Cool Skin shavers, and now have been using the new 8060X for the past few weeks. I&#x27;m very happy with this razor and it&#x27;s a step in the right direction from the previous models. It&#x27;s smaller and more lightweight than its predecessors, it&#x27;s easier to clean due to its open design, and not having to replace lotion cartridges every couple of weeks is a plus. I couldn&#x27;t get as close of a shave with it at first, but as the manual says - some break-in is required, and now that I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks - it&#x27;s doing a great job and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. Norelco Customer Service is also hard to beat - they stand behind their products and will go above and beyond to keep their customers happy.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of lotion and being able to use it in the shower - and the stripped-down scifi looks were interesting.  But when it&#x27;s judged on the basic function of a razor it&#x27;s less than average, it simply doesn&#x27;t give a close shave, and the unusual design means that the few clippings it does make aren&#x27;t captured.    I&#x27;ve had it too long now to return, so it&#x27;s going to be used for a light trim rather than being my main razor.</li>
            <li> For the past 4 years, I was using an expensive Braun dry shaver and not getting a close shave. Two months ago, I switched back to the old manual razor.  I was surprised at how expensive blades had become, and how much slower a razor shave is. Especially shaving around the throat.  I then saw this on the lightning deal, and was curious how a wet shaver would work.  I gave it a try.  The shave is very comfortable, and very close.  It really matches the razor blade shave, but is much more comfortable.  I only gave it 4 stars, because the conditioner that is automatically loaded into the razor during the charge, doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  One reviewer wrote that he uses regular shave gel. I have a lot of very old cans  of Gillette foamy Gel.  I used that as if I was using a razor.  It works great.  Just rinse it off the shaver during shaving and after you finish, while the power is on. Since this shaver is made to use in the shower, using regular shave cream and rinsing the shaver doesn&#x27;t cause any problem.  Given the price of razor blades, it won&#x27;t bother me to spend $30 for replacement blades when needed.  I love this shaver, and feel badly that I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  Buy the shaver, then using the much cheaper gel that you slap on your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long-time blade shaver, but every 3-4 years I go on an electric shaver kick and use it for about a year.  I&#x27;ve never found a single electric razor that shaves as close as a blade, but I used to own a Norelco Advantage that gave a decently close shave that was pretty comfortable and didn&#x27;t irritate my neck.    This is supposed to be the upgrade to the Advantage, but after just a few days of use my neck is chewed up far worse than it ever has been with any other electric.  It&#x27;s annoying enough that I&#x27;m not willing to \\&quot;wait it out\\&quot; for the 30-day trial period that Norelco recommends, and I&#x27;ll be returning it next week.    That being said, I can see from the other ratings that many people have had a lot of success with this shaver.  Part of my problem may be that I&#x27;m a shaving perfectionist and if I&#x27;m not getting a close shave in a given area I&#x27;ll go over it again a few times until the hairs are cut off.  It boggles my mind that I can run an electric shaver over a patch of stubble and the stubble will sit there, unaffected, as if nothing at all had happened.  You don&#x27;t see that happening with blades...    So in summary:   Pros: auto-filling lotion cartridge, waterproof, quick charging, does glide well over face (no irritation WHILE shaving, but boy you&#x27;ll feel it later)  Cons: seems to cause ingrown hairs at a higher rate than its predecessors, very high neck irritation, lotion seems to drip off of razor head while shaving, not a very close shave.  NO ELECTRIC IS EVER AS CLOSE AS A BLADE, so I wish that Norelco and Braun would stop claiming such.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco 8060X moisturizing shaving system has the potential to be the best shaver I have ever owned.  Certainly it still has to pass the test of time which to this point has only been a little less than three months.  The 8060X gives a close, comfortable shave particularly when you press the blue button to apply Nivea shaving conditioner to your face directly through two holes in the center of two of the three shaving heads. There is a small reservoir in the shaver which can be filled automatically with conditioner from the Nivea bottle while the unit is charging.  I have already learned to scale back my use of this conditioner to only a couple of pumps for each shave, which hopefully will allow one to get many shaves from a bottle of conditioner - I have yet to use up one bottle.  If you overuse the conditioner, it can get expensive.  The shaving conditioner delivery system is great and makes for a comfortable shaving experience.  The pivoting blades are very good, but the trimmer is awkward to use and not nearly as good as what many other shavers have.  You have to mount the trimmer in place of the main shaving heads on the shaver.  In my opinion the trimmer is too small and operates too slowly to be effective - it appears to be a poor aferthought.  Underarm shaving is not good with any part of this system, but maybe it wasn&#x27;t meant to be.  This shaver excels in convex facial skin areas, but not concave underarm areas at least for this user.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaving system in the hopes that it could make shaving a bit less painful, as I&#x27;ve always had fairly sensitive skin.  In the few months I&#x27;ve owned it, I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the performance and the overall results.  Here are a few things I&#x27;ve found...    Pros:  - The moisturizing system does work very well.  I get substantially less skin irritation than I have in previous razors that I&#x27;ve used.    - I&#x27;ve discovered I enjoy shaving in the shower.  I always tried to avoid mixing shaving before a shower due to the irritation, but this works well.  - The charging and refill system is nice (more on this later).  - Comfortable to hold and use.  - I shave more often using this than any other razor I&#x27;ve used previously.    Cons:  - You&#x27;ll be compelled to shave daily, since it works best and most efficiently that way.  That can be a pro or a con, depending on your lifestyle.   - While the charge and refill station is great, it seems that I always run out of moisturizer before running out of battery, so I have to remember to refill it myself, since they suggest not leaving the razor on charge all the time.  - I haven&#x27;t found a great shower mirror yet, so I wind up starting my shave prior to the shower, to trim around sideburns and the like.  - Works better as a wet razor than as a dry one.  - While I like the scent of the moisturizer, it took me a bit to get used to it.    Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this razor and would suggest it to anyone looking for a new electric.  If you are OK with the pros and cons, then I say go for it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I have seen lot of good reviews about this shaving system which led me to buy it. This is my first electric shaver that I have used. But my experiences with it has not been satisfactory. Before I let all my concerns out I would like to tell that my facial hair is coarse and I usually shave every 4 to 5 days which might be the reason that I am not finding this shaver good enough for me.    There is no doubt, atleast for me that this shaver takes awful more time to shave than the conventional blade razors (Mach-3). I thought it was part of getting used to it but my shaving time did not improve much in a month. Another hitch I found was that the shaver does get filled with the Nivea shaving lotion but not enough (atleast for me) for the entire shave. The blades especially take awful lot of time to cut the hair and especially in the neck area it was a painful job for me to get rid of the hair. I see that after even long , careful shaving there was residual hair on my face. I think this product would work better if shaven every day or alternate days and with not that coarse hair as mine. I am switching back to Mach-3 untill I find a better electric shaver than this for me.</li>
            <li> This Shaver is a wonderful product. The best my husband ever had. He loves the blades for his so strong beard also it&lt;br /&gt;shaves very well in small places.</li>
            <li> After about three months of ownership, I still love this shaver!  It is the best Norelco I have ever had out of a total of five Norelcos owned.  The shave is closer than any other electric shaver and my skin feels soft afterwards thanks to the lotion.  It is also way cheaper than the Arcitec shavers that are quite frankly overpriced.  The charging and lotion refill stand does a great job.  I didn&#x27;t want to bother with doing the lotion refill by hand and the stand does the job flawlessly with no mess.  The lotion cans are very convenient.    Other people have mentioned that the hairs fall out of this shaver.  I have never had this problem.  They stay inside until the shaver is rinsed out under the faucet.  I have used the shaver in my car when running late and do not worry about hairs getting all over the place.  Using the lotion while shaving means that the hairs stay inside the shaver.</li>
            <li> I picked up this razor as a replacement for my 7735x because the battery finally lost its charge after over 2 years of daily use. I think the moisturizing system on an electric razor is pure genius and I hope Norelco contiues to improve the line. Anyway, the 8060x makes many improvements over the older line but further improvements can be made.  First off, this razor is relatively compact over the 7XXX line. The blades sit atop the body making the razor smaller overall but leaves the blades vulnerable to damage during travel. The lotion dispensing is now electronically actuated vs. the manual pumping you have to do with the older line. One thing that irked me was that the lotion didn&#x27;t always make it to the blade or skin surface. The lotion comes through two stems coming off of the body and then through a hole in the center of the top two blades. Theoretically, the lotion should just come out onto the blades and on to the skin but while shaving the lotion leaks out to the underside of the blade where it doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot of good. Maybe if you dispensed the lotion while it wasn&#x27;t pressed against your face but that would add time to your shave to do that every time you needed more lotion. On to the charging and refilling stand. This is a huge advancement over the previous model. The stand not only recharges the razor but automatically refills the razor with lotion! This is much more convenient than either running out of lotion mid-shave or being out of lotion because you forgot to replace the cartridge. The bottles are $10 for less than 3 oz. Kind of pricey if you ask me and I haven&#x27;t checked what $10/3 oz. would equate to vs. the cartridges. The razor charges in no time. 90 mins for a full charge and it has a quick charge mode but I never seem to let it drain completely. The razor also comes with a travel charging stand for easy carrying. You&#x27;ll have to carry a bottle of the lotion to refill it manually in this case. One last thing, you do get a trimmer attachment. Just pull the blade head off and snap the trimmer on and you&#x27;re good to go. I recommend this razor despite the few gripes I have about it. Nothing&#x27;s perfect but this is as good as you&#x27;ll get if you want a razor that dispenses lotion.</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of razors over the past few years and received comments at work about the state of my neck - red, irritated - resembling an altercation with a hangman. I started shaving the night before.    With this razor, I have had no problems. Clean close shave. Easy on maintenance. No irritation.    Only comment - I do not have a particularly strong beard: dont know how it would work there.</li>
            <li> I know it takes a full three weeks before skin can adjust to a new razor, but the first time i used this razor I got a super-smooth shave-something rare for my stubbornly scruffy face.  It&#x27;s only been getting better since!  I love it!</li>
            <li> The Norelco 8060X gives me by far the best electric shave I have ever gotten.  Over 40 years I have owned at least a dozen electric razors - Remington, Braun, Norelco - but none came close to the shave you get with a good blade, such as the Mach 3.  This new Norelco will not match a blade - at least for me, with my combination of tough beard and tender skin - but it is far superior to any other electric shaver I have used.  I have owned this for only a month so cannot comment on how long the conditioner lasts, etc.  Because the shaver does not catch shaved hair, the stubble tends to collect on your face (which you always wet first), where the conditioner holds it until you wash your face after shaving.  So it takes a bit longer to shave than with a conventional electric shaver, but the results are certainly worth it.</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time shaving so after reading the reviews I ordered this.  I found the entire system to be durable and high quality.  I used the razor for two months.  The shave was close but not as close as a mach 3. The instructions say that with time the shave will get closer.  After a couple of months, it started leaving cuts on my neck and my face felt uncomfortable when finished.  I ended up going back to a mach 3 but miss the ease of the norelco.  I have thick facial hair that has always been hard to shave.  I think that it would do a good job for someone who doesn&#x27;t have as such thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 8060X Moisturizing Shaving System   One of the best shavers ever produced by Norelco so smooth and moist for super close shave.  3 freely rotataing heads give me one of the smoothest shaves.  The Nivea Moisturizing Cream is one of the best technology invention as it gives a gliding feeling on my face.</li>
            <li> This product works as expected, nothing bad to say. Love the razor with the lotion ejection system built in. Have been using it for at least the past 7 years. The latest model has a better system.</li>
            <li> Often seems better without the nivea squirted internally.  Leaves cuttings all over , have to lean over basin for easy cleanup.  Have to shave every day or it becomes difficult to get clean shave without many passes and then not completely; no weekend slackening off! Have to remember not to keep in charging cradle as had been accustomed to. Comfortable but not as close as enclosed head design it replaced; keeping as spare and ordering more traditional model for daily use.</li>
