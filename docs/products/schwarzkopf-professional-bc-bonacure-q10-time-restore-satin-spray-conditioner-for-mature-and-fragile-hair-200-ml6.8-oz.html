            <li> Smells great that&#x27;s all</li>
            <li> Great on all hair even fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Becoming difficult to find.</li>
            <li> Definitely a great product for satin-smooth hair</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. The price on Amazon is the best I have found. It&#x27;s a leave in conditioner that does not weigh down your hair. My hair is very fine. Just towel dry your hair, spray it on and dry/style.  I especially like it in the winter months as it keeps your hair from having that dreaded static electricity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of using too many products in my hair, but this one is great. It&#x27;s very light and does the job very well. It makes brushing after shower so much easier, without loosing a ton of hair. It also helps make hair feel smoother and softer. I&#x27;ve ordered it twice already, and will order again.</li>
            <li> Great hair product and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I like that this is more lightweight than other leave-ins I have tried, yet still produces a silky texture after blow drying. I have thin and dry hair and prefer to use leave-ins rather than normal conditioner because normal conditioner can be too heavy, but this is too light as a stand alone conditioner, but great paired with normal conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have bleach fried hair and honestly didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in my hair. Could it be the product or that my hair is past the point of help, not sure. But, the smell is nice, the price is great, and the packaging was very good.</li>
            <li> If you use more than a mere mist, it makes your hair seem a bit tacky to the touch.  Not too softening, i.e no silky feel throughout the day.  Undoubtedly, the Schwarzkopf brand is exceptional and the Bonacure Q10 will benefit your hair.  If you use hairsray, gel or other products on your hair, this product will definitely serve to protect and repair.</li>
            <li> I use all Schwarzkopf products.  This product will make your hair silkly smooth but I am trying to grow my hair back in and I  mix it with the conditioner and rub over entire scalp.  It definitely helps.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for hair that tangles easily.  Spray a little on your hair when it is wet and you will notice a difference.  My stylist recommended it to me about a year ago.  Now that I have moved, I can&#x27;t get it from her anymore so I ordered online.  The shipping took a long time, but the price was reasonable and the product works. It has a really pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few leave-ins and this is my favorite.  It makes my hair easy to comb out, which means I&#x27;m not damaging or breaking it.  And it just adds something....I feel like my hair looks and feels healthier when I use it.  Great price on Amazon.  I&#x27;ll buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> Excellent - Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service</li>
            <li> Great product, and cheaper here then at a salon. Helps with my tangled curly colored hair to get silky smooth. Don&#x27;t need use as much, just a few sprays does the job, and I have long thick hair.  Hope that&#x27;s helps.</li>
            <li> I am a male with long hair and was searching for a leave-in product that would make my hair more manageable. This conditioner spray does not weigh my hair down, keeps it in place and leaves it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Very good for my fine hair</li>
