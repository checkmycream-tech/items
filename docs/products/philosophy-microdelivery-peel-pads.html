            <li>Awesome product - have used for 7 years....</li>
            <li>I am on a perpetual search for the perfect exfoliator, and this one is not it.</li>

            <li>These pads work great</li>
            <li>Philosophy is a great skin product</li>
            <li>OK, I admit the Philosophy line of products are the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived on time and was in good condition.  </li>
            <li>She was so delighted with them that I bought them for myself.</li>

            <li>This stuff made my skin look so bright and healthy, that I will continue to purchase over and over.</li>
            <li>I use this with Boots No. 7 protect and perfect intense serum and philosophy&#x27;s microdelivery pads.</li>
            <li>Although the pads, which are nice and saturated with the solution, smelled like they should do something (a pungent, herbaceous odor), and delivered a bit of a stinging sensation, they did not effect a noticeable change in my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin seems to be balancing out more, i&#x27;m seeing a reduction in redness too and my skin is feeling smoother.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m getting so many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>These Microdelivery Pads are one of my favorite items in the kit.</li>
            <li>The pads have a gentle exfoliating affect, but with great results.</li>
            <li>I expect the results will continue to improve more dynamically as I continue with using these pads along with the weekly peel.</li>
            <li>Use them with the weekly Microdelivery Peel to get even better results.</li>
            <li>Love these Peel Pads.    </li>
            <li>Maybe they are all meant to do different things, but I&#x27;m 65 and just trying to do what&#x27;s best for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love this product always will.</li>
            <li>and I plan on using it for many years to come.</li>
            <li>I love these peel pads.</li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using Philosophy skin care for more than a year now, but was feeling like the line was needing a toner like product to help with exfoliation on a daliy basis.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a brighter complexion, or just a more even skintone this will impress you.</li>
            <li>Within two weeks of using them along with the weekly use of the Microdelivery Peel, I noticed a huge improvement in the coloration of my skin.</li>
            <li>It gives a great glow to my cheeks, I am constantly getting compliments on my \\&quot;glow\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s not going to give the same results as a chemical peel, but I think it&#x27;s doing a good job for the money and the delivery method.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more!!</li>
            <li>Very clean fresh scent, not at all medicinal like some products.    </li>
            <li>The Peel Pads feel great when you are applying it, refreshing and clean sensation, no burning like other pads I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The first day I used it,  it was ok,</li>
            <li>The cost on this product seems more reasonable, and I use during the evening after cleansing and before serum and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and fair skin, and I am able to use it daily.  </li>
            <li>and I wish they came in a higher count!</li>
            <li>I use my clarisonic first to clean my face, then these pads as an additional exfoliator and then Hope in a Jar as my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but we&#x27;ll worth it</li>
            <li>They leave my face feeling very clean and smooth, just like after a facial!!  </li>
            <li>product is super gentle, even for a mild acid peel.</li>
            <li>Is this the right way.....</li>
            <li>They are just the right harshness to do the job, but without the irritation.</li>
            <li>I believe the product is a good one, but just not right for my type of skin.</li>
            <li>Then afterwards I worried that the oils baking into my face all night would make me wake up with a face full of acne, but much to my surprise</li>
            <li>Microdelivery Peel Daily Peel Pads are the best little pads to remove any lingering cleanser, and prepare your face for the Philosophy serum, and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>For now, i give it 5 stars and I will follow up in a few more weeks to report beck &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>They are very gentle on my face.  </li>
            <li>First thing I noticed was that my pores are not as visible.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this product I thought to myself</li>
            <li>Once you try this product, you will never want to apply your makeup products without this first.</li>
            <li>and ive been hooked since first use.</li>
            <li>When I first started using this</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>My spots are lightening, and my skin overall is looking more even colored.  </li>
            <li>These pads are just full of ingredients that help sluff off dead cells, and let your new bright cells step forward.  </li>
            <li>One pad is good enough for me to use on my entire face, neck, chest and the backs of my hands.  </li>
            <li>However, they seem to large for just the face  </li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>The are really saturated in the solution, so</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m young and don&#x27;t have much, but I&#x27;m definitely in love with this enough to continue using it.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried at first but trust me the tingling is worth it because the next morning your face looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31 and have dry skin and the \\&quot;hope\\&quot; series works great for me (Purity made simple, when hope is not enough, hope in a jar and hope in a tub).</li>
            <li>The little extra that I needed to make my skin look and feel better!  </li>
            <li>they dry out pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Very few products receive a 5 from me, but philosophy sure earned it.</li>
            <li>You need only one pad per application because they really go a long way and have enough juice in them to be able to use on the face, neck and even the and chest area.</li>
            <li>I have used the large pads that are in the individual foil packets, and I do like them.  </li>
            <li>but since it&#x27;s winter, it&#x27;s gentle enough not to irritate my skin.    </li>
            <li>I would not recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive and dry, I was terrified to try these, but if I use them continually, my skin seems more hydrated and less sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I can use it everyday, it&#x27;s incredibly friendly on my dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li>I had started several products at once and attributed my glowing clear complexion to a vitamin c oil</li>
            <li>I also use Bare Minerals for make up.</li>
            <li>This is a 60-peel product and I am barely on my 11&#x27;th peel so</li>
            <li>When you first use them your face will tingle a little</li>
            <li>My dark spots are fading and my skin is much clearer.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nothing more than a few small blemishes.  </li>

            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with the Micro Delivery Pads if you are looking to improve the coloration and fine lines of your face.</li>
            <li> I am a serious Philosophy customer and purchased these first for my Mother.  </li>
            <li> These are smaller, already wet with the ingredients</li>
            <li> The second thing I noticed is that now that it has been a week and a half, I have only needed to blot my skin once a day!</li>
            <li> I use them in the morning and evening after using the Purity facial wash, but before applying any other product.</li>
            <li> I was thinking the product was a bit pricey, but then when I was looking at similar products from other lines, I changed my thinking.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for any skin care fanatic</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed an improvement on my skin tone and less blackheads using this regularly and in combination with other philosophy products.</li>
            <li> Also, I am asian with dark, oily skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 19 male, with dry skin and slight rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars, but the greasy feeling you get afterwards is bothersome enough to knock it down a star.</li>
            <li> my skin felt cleaner, but after the next day I noticed that my red little spider veins started to show, on my face!</li>
            <li> Last, my neck is really really dry and had little bumps that makes it feel rough</li>
            <li> The only thing I have noticed is that if you have a blemish and use it you can feel a little burn, and after use my skin feels sticky.</li>
            <li> They are expensive - working out to about 50 cents a pad, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> I usually have dry skin with redness and it&#x27;s finally balancing out due to all these things.</li>
            <li> if you store them with the lid tight, there is no way they can dry out.  </li>
            <li> I have to be very careful with my skin products and this gave me no problems.</li>
            <li> so my face looks grossly oily by the end of the day that i have to use oil blots at least 4 times a day.  </li>
            <li> My face appears to have a unified tone and the slight lines around my eyes are not noticeable whatsoever.     </li>
            <li> and now it feels a little smoother.  </li>
            <li> The pads are a little thinner than what I was expecting but it isn&#x27;t a problem for me.</li>
            <li> But I notices that after a few hours my skin gets a little oily, which didn&#x27;t happen before I started using the pads.</li>
            <li> The pads are very soft (also very thin).  </li>
            <li> I will say, that if I stop using them for a few months, I will experience some breakouts in the beginning</li>
            <li> My skin is oily usually</li>
            <li> I use them once a day, usually at night, but I will use them sometimes in the morning, before my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helping with wrinkles yet</li>
            <li> It has been a week and a half now since I began using this product and after two days, I noticed a dramatic change in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> Bought these just over a week ago, I am definitely seeing results. My skin seems to be balancing out more, i&#x27;m seeing a reduction in redness too and my skin is feeling smoother. I use this with Boots No. 7 protect and perfect intense serum and philosophy&#x27;s microdelivery pads. I also use Bare Minerals for make up. I started using them all around the same time and i&#x27;m getting so many compliments on my skin. I usually have dry skin with redness and it&#x27;s finally balancing out due to all these things. HTH!</li>
            <li> It has been a week and a half now since I began using this product and after two days, I noticed a dramatic change in my skin.  I use it on my face and my neck- my neck is slower at changing than my face.  First thing I noticed was that my pores are not as visible.  Also, I am asian with dark, oily skin so my face looks grossly oily by the end of the day that i have to use oil blots at least 4 times a day.  The second thing I noticed is that now that it has been a week and a half, I have only needed to blot my skin once a day! Last, my neck is really really dry and had little bumps that makes it feel rough and now it feels a little smoother.  This is a 60-peel product and I am barely on my 11&#x27;th peel so who knows to what extent my skin will improve.  For now, i give it 5 stars and I will follow up in a few more weeks to report beck &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about three weeks and there is a noticeable difference in my skin texture.  My skin feels smoother, my pores look smaller, and my skin appears smoother and younger in photos.  I use the pads about four times a week.  They are expensive - working out to about 50 cents a pad, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.  Sure, it&#x27;s not going to give the same results as a chemical peel, but I think it&#x27;s doing a good job for the money and the delivery method.</li>
            <li> Awesome product - have used for 7 years....</li>
            <li> I received this item in a multi-set that I believe was named \\&quot;Radical Skin Makeover Kit\\&quot;. These Microdelivery Pads are one of my favorite items in the kit. I use them in the morning and evening after using the Purity facial wash, but before applying any other product. You need only one pad per application because they really go a long way and have enough juice in them to be able to use on the face, neck and even the and chest area. The pads have a gentle exfoliating affect, but with great results. Within two weeks of using them along with the weekly use of the Microdelivery Peel, I noticed a huge improvement in the coloration of my skin. My face appears to have a unified tone and the slight lines around my eyes are not noticeable whatsoever.     I expect the results will continue to improve more dynamically as I continue with using these pads along with the weekly peel. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with the Micro Delivery Pads if you are looking to improve the coloration and fine lines of your face. Use them with the weekly Microdelivery Peel to get even better results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Philosophy products for a while. I&#x27;m 31 and have dry skin and the \\&quot;hope\\&quot; series works great for me (Purity made simple, when hope is not enough, hope in a jar and hope in a tub). The Peel Pads feel great when you are applying it, refreshing and clean sensation, no burning like other pads I&#x27;ve tried. But I notices that after a few hours my skin gets a little oily, which didn&#x27;t happen before I started using the pads. The pads are a little thinner than what I was expecting but it isn&#x27;t a problem for me. I believe the product is a good one, but just not right for my type of skin.</li>
            <li> So they recommended this pads in Sephora, and I bought them, they said it&#x27;s doing miracles. The first day I used it,  it was ok, my skin felt cleaner, but after the next day I noticed that my red little spider veins started to show, on my face! so I stopped using the product on the third day... Now I&#x27;m worried about this redness which does not go away!  Damn ppl, put a warning it&#x27;s not for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Love these Peel Pads.    They leave my face feeling very clean and smooth, just like after a facial!!  They are very gentle on my face.  My skin is oily usually but since it&#x27;s winter, it&#x27;s gentle enough not to irritate my skin.    Very clean fresh scent, not at all medicinal like some products.    Will definitely buy more!!</li>
            <li> These pads work great and I could tell the difference in my skin in just one week.  The only problem is that they leave my face sticky after it dries.   So I have to wash my face again to take it off.  Is this the right way.....BKolterman, Onaga,KS</li>
            <li> I have used the large pads that are in the individual foil packets, and I do like them.  However, they seem to large for just the face  and then when you use them on your arms, elbows etc. they dry out pretty fast.  These are smaller, already wet with the ingredients so you don&#x27;t have to pour a bottle of liquid in to moisten them.  Maybe they are all meant to do different things, but I&#x27;m 65 and just trying to do what&#x27;s best for my skin.  The cost on this product seems more reasonable, and I use during the evening after cleansing and before serum and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have been using these pads for a week now and I don&#x27;t get it.  I have noticed nothing.  Really? What are they supposed to do because they are not doing it.  The only thing I have noticed is that if you have a blemish and use it you can feel a little burn, and after use my skin feels sticky.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I thought to myself \\&quot;This doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing anything...\\&quot; Then afterwards I worried that the oils baking into my face all night would make me wake up with a face full of acne, but much to my surprise I woke up the next morning to smaller pores and clearer skin! I use my clarisonic first to clean my face, then these pads as an additional exfoliator and then Hope in a Jar as my moisturizer. I definitely recommend this product! I would have given it 5 stars, but the greasy feeling you get afterwards is bothersome enough to knock it down a star. Would only recommend using at night.</li>
            <li> OK, I admit the Philosophy line of products are the best I have ever used.  And trust me, I have used them all!  A self proclaimed makeup expert here!!  Just ask any of my friends.  The Philosophy Microdelivery Peel Daily Peel Pads are the best little pads to remove any lingering cleanser, and prepare your face for the Philosophy serum, and moisturizer.  These pads are just full of ingredients that help sluff off dead cells, and let your new bright cells step forward.  Once you try this product, you will never want to apply your makeup products without this first.</li>
            <li> Love this product always will. Philosophy is a great skin product and ive been hooked since first use. Highly recommend this product for any skin care fanatic</li>
            <li> The little extra that I needed to make my skin look and feel better!  I have to be very careful with my skin products and this gave me no problems.</li>
            <li> I am on a perpetual search for the perfect exfoliator, and this one is not it. Although the pads, which are nice and saturated with the solution, smelled like they should do something (a pungent, herbaceous odor), and delivered a bit of a stinging sensation, they did not effect a noticeable change in my skin. I would not recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin. Or anyone who expects beauty products to deliver on their promises. The search continues...</li>
            <li> I love this product! This is my 3 time buying and I plan on using it for many years to come.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and was in good condition.  Initially, I wondered if the quality of the product would be the same as in the store.  It was.</li>
            <li> I love these peel pads. When you first use them your face will tingle a little and then it goes away. I was a little worried at first but trust me the tingling is worth it because the next morning your face looks amazing. It glows. Believe it or not this along with the retinol in the tube from Philosophy helped with my acne. This is a fabulous product and a great price. Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for seven years and I love them.  Now with the auto-delivery I can get them at a discounted price.  My skin is so sensitive and dry, I was terrified to try these, but if I use them continually, my skin seems more hydrated and less sensitive.  I will say, that if I stop using them for a few months, I will experience some breakouts in the beginning but it&#x27;s nothing more than a few small blemishes.  One pad is good enough for me to use on my entire face, neck, chest and the backs of my hands.  The are really saturated in the solution, so if you store them with the lid tight, there is no way they can dry out.  I use them once a day, usually at night, but I will use them sometimes in the morning, before my makeup.  It gives a great glow to my cheeks, I am constantly getting compliments on my \\&quot;glow\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin. I had started several products at once and attributed my glowing clear complexion to a vitamin c oil so I stopped using it. A month later and my skin started to look a but duller. M using it again and the difference was instantly noticeable. I love this product. My dark spots are fading and my skin is much clearer. I also use it on my neck and hands. A bit pricey but we&#x27;ll worth it</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed an improvement on my skin tone and less blackheads using this regularly and in combination with other philosophy products.</li>
            <li> I jus recently purchased these pads.  I have been using Philosophy skin care for more than a year now, but was feeling like the line was needing a toner like product to help with exfoliation on a daliy basis.  Well, this is it!  The pads are very soft (also very thin).  I definately felt the product working and it made a difference.  I was thinking the product was a bit pricey, but then when I was looking at similar products from other lines, I changed my thinking.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This miracle stuff is making my face beautiful!  Well... more beautiful.  ;)  I have sensitive and fair skin, and I am able to use it daily.  My spots are lightening, and my skin overall is looking more even colored.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helping with wrinkles yet, I&#x27;m young and don&#x27;t have much, but I&#x27;m definitely in love with this enough to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I am a serious Philosophy customer and purchased these first for my Mother.  She was so delighted with them that I bought them for myself. They are just the right harshness to do the job, but without the irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 19 male, with dry skin and slight rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;This product is super gentle, even for a mild acid peel. I can use it everyday, it&#x27;s incredibly friendly on my dehydrated skin. This stuff made my skin look so bright and healthy, that I will continue to purchase over and over. If you are looking for a brighter complexion, or just a more even skintone this will impress you. Very few products receive a 5 from me, but philosophy sure earned it. LOVE!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t beat microdermabrasion but comes close.  I use these every day and I wish they came in a higher count!</li>
