    <ol>
            <li>this gel gripper is AWESOME!</li>
            <li>great product!</li>
            <li>These have been a great replacement!</li>
            <li>: It fits great in our Kaemark brand shampoo bowls and they stay put.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Great product....</li>
            <li>This neck cushion was a perfect fit for all my needs.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mom&#x27;s beauty salon and was very pleased.</li>
            <li>way better than I anticipated I love it, my clients love it, I am very happy with it and would recommend this product to ANYONE.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s almost a struggle to move the neck rest to clean it, which is good and means it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job!</li>
            <li>It is kind of hard.they should be</li>
            <li>and this one is the most comfortable, best fitting and has lasted the longest (over a year now).</li>
            <li>clients say its very comfy and soft!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect fit and stays right in place.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as soft as others but nothing is perfect.</li>
            <li>Love love love this!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great support for my clients neck and an easy clean</li>
            <li>it is very comfortable now.</li>
            <li>AND FEELS VERY COMFORTABLE.  </li>
            <li>The comfort of my clients is very important.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>There are okay.</li>
            <li>more soft.i don&#x27;t know what to say.maybe</li>
            <li>I love The Gripper.  </li>
            <li>It cleans off very easily, mostly stays in place, and hasn&#x27;t cracked or torn in the 3 years I&#x27;ve had mine.</li>
            <li>but, it slips a lot and falls underneath the bowl if I shampoo to many clients.</li>
            <li>Better than a foam one.</li>
            <li>Clients love this neck rest.</li>
            <li>Love this item.  </li>
            <li>It stays on best if the sink (under the neckrest area) is kept dry, as the water acts as a lubricant.</li>
            <li>The salon had their own version of a neck rest but this product was far superior.  </li>
            <li>makes it more comfortable for the customer.</li>
            <li>much more comfortable for guests and</li>
            <li>Works well for clients makes shampooing more comfortable</li>
            <li>Fast delivery it what I wanted but does not stick to the bowl as good as it should</li>
            <li>This is slimmer but just as comfortable AND most importantly,  doesn&#x27;t rip and tear.</li>
            <li>Remember to clean all surfaces well before installing as this will make the suction cups hold better.</li>
            <li>This product however does the job just fine</li>
            <li>Clients are comfortable, easy to clean and it doesn&#x27;t move.</li>
            <li>On the Olla it stays on firm and fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>Item is comfortable on the neck.</li>
            <li>Sooooooo Comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and well made.  </li>
            <li>It has a snug fit, does not shift and it is comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Fairly comfortable and stays in place.</li>
            <li>Great solid product.</li>
            <li>Other wise it is a nice neck rest.</li>
            <li>When it works it&#x27;s great, but it slips off very easily and is not comfortable to some clients</li>
            <li>It gives good support but it can pull on/out hair if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>I have had many other neck rests and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Perfect fit, but it is too thick on the neck.</li>
            <li>This one stays very well and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>A lot more mid-range and older people would go to the salon if they knew it wasn&#x27;t going to hurt!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>By far it is the better choice.</li>
            <li>The Betty dain shampoo bowl neck rest is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Everything was great shipping was fast and the gripper was what I expected Thanks</li>
            <li>This would probably fit most ceramic bowl sinks.</li>
            <li>The Gripper allows water to leak all over clients and consistently slides out of place.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser also used it on a disabled customer to help her feel more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Suction cups keep it on very well, has not come off yet.</li>
            <li>It works, but it has a very sticky texture to it, and my client&#x27;s hair gets stuck to it.</li>
            <li>My clients think it&#x27;s very comfy</li>
            <li>It seems to create a seal when the client has their head in the neck rest and it stays in place very well after you get the suction cups situated.  </li>
            <li>I use a product like this at the salon that I work at and the one at my salon is a little bit more gel like and higher quality.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different neck rest for the shampoo bowls and this one is so far the most comfortable and helps to keep the clients dry.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>This is the third neck rest I&#x27;ve tried for my backwash shampoo units, these work very well with the suction cups keeping them in place at most times, once in a while they well move a little bit</li>
            <li>Kept buying the cheap black foam neck insert from the SB store.</li>
            <li>Only reason I didn&#x27;t give these a 5 star is because they could be a little thinner which would work better.</li>
            <li>Most clients said it felt as hard as the sink.</li>
            <li>The suction cups help, but doesn&#x27;t completely stablize the neck rest.</li>
            <li>but it is really the only way I can have my hair shampooed.  </li>
            <li>not wide enoughon new shaped shampoo bowls.  </li>
            <li>Super comfy and keeps water from running down clients neck</li>
            <li>I was getting rather discouraged as the place where I get my hair done recently put in new shampoo bowls.  </li>
            <li>As far doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do its mediocre, nothing spectacular</li>
            <li>My stylist said she had other customers who would interested in this</li>

            <li> It really helps prevent water from leaking past the client&#x27;s neck.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought perhaps because they were new and needed to be broken down a bit.</li>
            <li> I like this headrest because it stays in place and it doesn&#x27;t hold water so it is dry for the customer.</li>
            <li> dry between shampoos.</li>
            <li> I had to order a second one because other stylist&#x27;s were borrowing mine!</li>
            <li> slips if it gets wet.  </li>
            <li> This should not be called the gripper because it slips around when wet.</li>
            <li> I went through a few different ones before I got this</li>
            <li> They would get wet.</li>
            <li> It was too big,  the client&#x27;s head would be half in bowl half out.</li>
            <li> Saw other reviews saying the cups didn&#x27;t work well, maybe its the type of sink.</li>
            <li> I recommend paying the money for this product as compared to other neck rests.</li>
            <li> it slides around when wet!  </li>
            <li> The little suction nubs don&#x27;t grip the sinks.</li>
            <li> The gel is very comforting to the neck and is very tough.</li>
            <li> The ones that I had before this wore down immediately.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little to pricey</li>
            <li> no more water down their backs!</li>
            <li> Very heavy duty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shallow, totally different from the foam block neck rests; which are useless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as hard as the shampoo bowl itself.</li>
            <li> I came across this little gem and can now continue to go to my regular salon and come away without a painful neck.  </li>
            <li> It is made with thick rubber and fits the neck well as well as the sink.</li>
            <li> They really get my neck hurting very badly and was</li>
            <li> Maybe it needs to be broken in</li>
            <li> Also, no complaints from clients about it being uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very ugly color and was ridiculously dusty.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s never gotten that nasty moldy smell.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this headrest because it stays in place and it doesn&#x27;t hold water so it is dry for the customer. It isn&#x27;t as soft as others but nothing is perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom&#x27;s beauty salon and was very pleased. The gel is very comforting to the neck and is very tough. The suction cups work well to hold the gripper onto the bowl as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this and took it to my stylist because I have arthritis in my neck.  Now it doesn&#x27;t hurt to sit at the shampoo bowl.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife for her Olla sink I bought from Amazon. The sink hurt my neck but with this on it is very comfortable now. Suction cups keep it on very well, has not come off yet. Saw other reviews saying the cups didn&#x27;t work well, maybe its the type of sink. On the Olla it stays on firm and fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> this gel gripper is AWESOME! way better than I anticipated I love it, my clients love it, I am very happy with it and would recommend this product to ANYONE.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very ugly color and was ridiculously dusty.As far doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do its mediocre, nothing spectacular</li>
            <li> Item is comfortable on the neck. It is made with thick rubber and fits the neck well as well as the sink. I have had many other neck rests and this one is by far the best. The only problem I have been having with it, is that it can still slip off if the client improperly lays back onto it. The suction cups help, but doesn&#x27;t completely stablize the neck rest. It stays on best if the sink (under the neckrest area) is kept dry, as the water acts as a lubricant. I recommend paying the money for this product as compared to other neck rests. By far it is the better choice.</li>
            <li> not wide enoughon new shaped shampoo bowls.  slips if it gets wet.  dry between shampoos.</li>
            <li> It works, but it has a very sticky texture to it, and my client&#x27;s hair gets stuck to it. Other wise it is a nice neck rest.</li>
            <li> This would probably fit most ceramic bowl sinks. Looking forward to seeing how this stays in place. I would recommend if you can to use it with the suction cups on the outside of the bowl (where the shoulders are)</li>
            <li> Have used &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; type headrests before that slip all over the place.  This one stays very well and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Does not stay in the sink bowl. Slips &amp; slides.</li>
            <li> The Gripper allows water to leak all over clients and consistently slides out of place.  I had to order another one from a different company.  This company does not allow returns after 30 days, so I am now stuck with a faulty product.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to use in our backwash shampoo shuttles. We had customer complaints of the neck rest being uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: It fits great in our Kaemark brand shampoo bowls and they stay put.&lt;br /&gt;CON (and its a biggie) It&#x27;s as hard as the shampoo bowl itself. So, pretty much pointless.</li>
            <li> Most clients said it felt as hard as the sink. Maybe it needs to be broken in I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ll be sending it back.</li>
            <li> makes it more comfortable for the customer.</li>
            <li> ARRIVED ON TIME. SEEMS SRABLE BUT I WILL TEST IT AND REVIEW LATER.  LOOKS LIKE IT WILL GET THE JOB DONE AND FEELS VERY COMFORTABLE.  HAVEN&#x27;T PLACED IT ON THE ACTUAL SPOT YET ....BUT SOON. WILL DEFINATELY REMEMBER TO SAY SO WHEN I DO!!</li>
            <li> Do not like what the product is made out of. Everything sticks to it ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had that at my salon for almost 2 years and it&#x27;s never gotten that nasty moldy smell. It gives good support but it can pull on/out hair if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> great product! much more comfortable for guests and no more water down their backs!</li>
            <li> This should not be called the gripper because it slips around when wet. But if the client keeps their neck against it during shampoo it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> These are made of a different, cheaper rubber than the ones I used to have, even though they&#x27;re from the same company. The little suction nubs don&#x27;t grip the sinks. Instead of staying in place, they keep popping up and sliding all over the place. At first, I thought perhaps because they were new and needed to be broken down a bit. I&#x27;ve had them for months now, and they still don&#x27;t work properly.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery it what I wanted but does not stick to the bowl as good as it should</li>
            <li> protects my clients necks...from strokes and neck problems</li>
            <li> There are okay. It is kind of hard.they should be more soft.i don&#x27;t know what to say.maybe you can try</li>
            <li> The comfort of my clients is very important. This neck cushion was a perfect fit for all my needs. It&#x27;s sanitizable. It conforms to any bowl and hugs the neck in comfort.</li>
            <li> I love The Gripper.  Terrific value.  I will never again suffer from a pinched neck nerve.  My hairdresser also used it on a disabled customer to help her feel more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Everything was great shipping was fast and the gripper was what I expected Thanks</li>
            <li> Love love love this! I use it on my portable shampoo bowl and it makes all the difference. Clients are comfortable, easy to clean and it doesn&#x27;t move. I went through a few different ones before I got this and this one is the most comfortable, best fitting and has lasted the longest (over a year now).</li>
            <li> I use a product like this at the salon that I work at and the one at my salon is a little bit more gel like and higher quality. This product however does the job just fine and I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> this neck rest was just what we needed to use with my handicapped sister in law. it stays in place like it should.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, but it is too thick on the neck. Needs to be a bit thinner or make it adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gripper neck for years. It really helps prevent water from leaking past the client&#x27;s neck. It&#x27;s shallow, totally different from the foam block neck rests; which are useless. It cleans off very easily, mostly stays in place, and hasn&#x27;t cracked or torn in the 3 years I&#x27;ve had mine. I had to order a second one because other stylist&#x27;s were borrowing mine!</li>
            <li> I have this after exepriencing the difference it made at a hair salon.  The hair salon is no longer in existence but it is really the only way I can have my hair shampooed.  My neck is fused, but even for those with just simple neck pain I think this is a must.  A lot more mid-range and older people would go to the salon if they knew it wasn&#x27;t going to hurt!!!&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy one for myself and keep it in case I needed it and I have.</li>
            <li> it slides around when wet!  Won&#x27;t buy another one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great support for my clients neck and an easy clean but, it slips a lot and falls underneath the bowl if I shampoo to many clients.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a shampoo bowl neck rest and these definitely did the trick!  The ones that I had before this wore down immediately.  These have been a great replacement!</li>
            <li> This is the third neck rest I&#x27;ve tried for my backwash shampoo units, these work very well with the suction cups keeping them in place at most times, once in a while they well move a little bit but they stay stuck, others just come off with every shampoo. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give these a 5 star is because they could be a little thinner which would work better.</li>
            <li> If you have a shampoo bowl, you need this neck rest!&lt;br /&gt;My clients say its very comfy and soft!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy</li>
            <li> Better than a foam one.</li>
            <li> Great product....My clients think it&#x27;s very comfy and it doesn&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li> Been a stylist for 25 years. Kept buying the cheap black foam neck insert from the SB store. It was too big,  the client&#x27;s head would be half in bowl half out. They would get wet. This is slimmer but just as comfortable AND most importantly,  doesn&#x27;t rip and tear. Auctions to inside of bowl and doesn&#x27;t move. Why don&#x27;t they sell these in supply store?????? Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Works well for clients makes shampooing more comfortable</li>
            <li> Sooooooo Comfortable. Clients love this neck rest. It&#x27;s a perfect fit and stays right in place.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for use at my hair salon.  The salon had their own version of a neck rest but this product was far superior.  It is comfortable and well made.  I would recommend for anyone who has issues with their cervical spine or just needs additional support.</li>
            <li> Love this item.  It has a snug fit, does not shift and it is comfortable.  Enhances the usable time of the shampoo basin because of the comfort support.</li>
            <li> The Betty dain shampoo bowl neck rest is worth the money. $25. Fairly comfortable and stays in place. I do prefer the belvedere but @ $100. It&#x27;s a little to pricey</li>
            <li> I have had two cervical fusions and have been putting off having to have another surgery.  I was getting rather discouraged as the place where I get my hair done recently put in new shampoo bowls.  They really get my neck hurting very badly and was I was beginning to look for another salon, even though I have been using them for over 10 years.  I came across this little gem and can now continue to go to my regular salon and come away without a painful neck.  My stylist said she had other customers who would interested in this so she is going to tell them about it.</li>
            <li> When it works it&#x27;s great, but it slips off very easily and is not comfortable to some clients</li>
            <li> Super comfy and keeps water from running down clients neck</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different neck rest for the shampoo bowls and this one is so far the most comfortable and helps to keep the clients dry.  It seems to create a seal when the client has their head in the neck rest and it stays in place very well after you get the suction cups situated.  Remember to clean all surfaces well before installing as this will make the suction cups hold better.</li>
            <li> Great solid product. Very heavy duty. The suction cups stay put and it&#x27;s almost a struggle to move the neck rest to clean it, which is good and means it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job! Also, no complaints from clients about it being uncomfortable.</li>
