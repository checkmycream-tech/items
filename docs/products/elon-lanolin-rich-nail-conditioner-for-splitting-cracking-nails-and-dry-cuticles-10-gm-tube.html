            <li>Fair value.</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I liked it, seems to make m nails stronger.</li>
            <li>If you have brittle nails like I did, use this stuff (just a drop about the size of a pinhead) on each nail, massage it into the cuticle and nail bed really really well, and do this each day for a week, your nails will look great!!!!  </li>
            <li>I apply and rub it in, then use a nice smelling lotion on top.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, I use it every morning on my feet and it keeps my nails healthy looking, free from cracking and drying out.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and in good shape.</li>

            <li>This product is better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>This tube is a MUCH better design</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m hoping that combined with the elon nail supplements I&#x27;m taking and the lanolin, the problem will get better over time.</li>
            <li>I take the polish off on weekends and apply this cream 3 times a day to make sure I keep my longish nails.  </li>
            <li>My cuticles have never been better.  </li>
            <li>Maybe the lotion smells better?</li>
            <li>Working better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>But it works better than anything I have tried to strengthen nails.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this product for my nails that have ridges and break easy.  </li>
            <li>The product is fine though</li>
            <li>just apply daily and keep them looking great.</li>
            <li>Great for nails especially if you have problems with breaking or splitting.  </li>
            <li>My nails were getting smooth again and the peeling had stopped.</li>
            <li>Really helps my nails become so much more healthy and the splitting/peeling has stopped.</li>
            <li>It has taken about 2-3 months for the entire nail to grow out with a new, perfect nail.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for dry cuticles.</li>
            <li>It makes your nails healthy and shiny and the cuticles soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>With all of the positive feedback I thought I would give it a try, and I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>This is good as you continue to use it several times a day</li>
            <li>Love it and hope to continue using it...hard to find and Amazon is only place I&#x27;ve been able to buy it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years and have been extremely pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li>I have had nice long nails that don&#x27;t break easily for over two years.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have found Elon Lanolin-Rich Nail Conditioner to work exactly as it&#x27;s advertised.  </li>
            <li>but they have not done either since got them done and for the first time the polish is growing out from the cuticles instead of the polish breaking off or pealing.</li>
            <li>Very healing for nails that split or crack!</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first week.</li>
            <li>First recommended by my dermatologist as a remedy to stop me from picking at ragged cuticles.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for four+ weeks but haven&#x27;t seen the results I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>but it seems worth it as it really lubricates the nails and helps strengthen.  </li>
            <li>came fast!</li>
            <li>Best product on the market for difficult nails.</li>
            <li>This stuff does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>I had a manicure a few weeks ago and the technician said she didn&#x27;t need to do much because my cuticles were in such good condition, and my nails are so healthy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain my nails are benefiting, but the dryness I suffered from for years is gone from my hands.  </li>
            <li>my nails have been much stronger.</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes my cuticles and nails.</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t need to apply much</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 1 month and have not seen much progress.  </li>
            <li>It really makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>very helpful for cracking nails</li>
            <li>That means you can store it upside down so that the product drips to the top of the tube</li>
            <li>In the end, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to both men and women.</li>
            <li>really really works as soon as I apply and massage it around my nails  become so soft .</li>
            <li>For the first several months, I used it three times a day, but now use it at bedtime.</li>
            <li>Too early to review</li>
            <li>My nail are normally soft, and split, break off, but, after a couple of weeks, what a difference.  </li>
            <li>Liners to this therapy and natural nail manicures.  </li>
            <li>So far, I still have ridges.</li>
            <li>The last order of 3 tubes arrived 1 tube short but they shipped another one right away when I let them know.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small tube so is easily taken in your purse or pocket.</li>
            <li>I had one nail that was worse than the rest that I kept on trimming for over a year hoping it would grow out better.  </li>
            <li>Kind of expensive</li>
            <li>Elon conditioner is the only product I have found that really helps my perpetually dry nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li>As far as my nails go, I have a medical issue which needs stronger medication, so I don&#x27;t know if this works for regular damaged nails.</li>
            <li>I also purchased their base and top coats - they are fantastic, too.</li>
            <li>did receive a pink colored tube instead of the familiar black, but I assume its the same product?</li>
            <li>The ones I got were RED not black - AND this one has a flat cap.</li>

            <li> The ones I got were RED not black - AND this one has a flat cap.</li>
            <li> The price is a little high</li>
            <li> The only negative is that I was hoping for this EXACT container.</li>
            <li> For no apparent reason as can not recall hitting my thumb or pinching it</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with dry nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li> The tube is a bit difficult to get the last of the cream out - luckily my husband is helpful enough to help me squeeze out as much as possible.  </li>
            <li> This is a very concentrated cream so only need to use a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> Product good but very small tube which is difficult for me to squeeze.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry nails and cuticles despite having manicures every 2 weeks religiously.  </li>
            <li> Once I get my nails as long as I want, i&#x27;ll still use this once a day as maintenance.  </li>
            <li> Used it for a long time now and will keep using it as long as they sell it.  </li>
            <li> I have to literally HANG mine upside down to get the same benefit from the red tube with the rounded cap.  </li>
            <li> I came across Elon nail conditioner when I was looking for something for my dry cuticles.  </li>
            <li> After six weeks of three to two times a day my nails do not peal, crack or dry out.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for dry hands, oh yes, and for your nails.  </li>
            <li> Living in the desert as I do, everything is dry.  </li>
            <li> Makes dry peeling nails heal with continued use.  </li>
            <li> recommend this if you have dry cuticle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will work well, but getting it out of the tube is VERY difficult.  </li>
            <li> This has hardened my very soft nails so that I hardly ever have to file them anymore.</li>
            <li> Regardless of your nail type this works well for everyone; hard, brittle, soft, chipped, it strenthens soft nails and stops hard nails from breaking.  </li>
            <li> My nails have improved and aren&#x27;t splitting at the center.</li>
            <li> Tube of Elon was empty</li>
            <li> It is small enough to drop in my pruse and use it while I am waiting in line at the pharmacy, or check out line  of the grocery store  or while someone else is driving the car!  </li>
            <li> My manicurist is sold on its effectiveness and recommends it to her other clients.</li>
            <li> Wore acrylic nails for over nine years this stuff healed the thinning, flaking and splitting in less than two months.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little time to notice the difference, has get into your nail matrix.  </li>
            <li> A little dab is all you need to cover all nails at each application.</li>
            <li> It was very sticky and had a bad odor.</li>
            <li> I got my nails done 12 days ago and usually the polish is pealing and cracking in two days</li>
            <li> No more splitting nails, brittle nails, bendable nails, dull looking nails.  </li>
            <li> I think it works, my tube came with components separated and is hard to get out as it is so hard.  </li>
            <li> would hardly squeeze out of tube, then so thick could not massage on fingers</li>
            <li> Not a good product for me.</li>
            <li> My nails seem to grow faster but they are still extremely weak, brittle, and peel/split/break often.</li>
            <li> I used to use acrylic nails because my nails were really thin.  </li>
            <li> I know the product is supposed to be used to conditions fingernails, but my hands stay as dry as sand paper and this product was recommended to me by my dermatologist to help prevent this annoying dryness.  </li>
            <li> they make a fake thumbnail to cover my thumb meanwhile, ladies?</li>
            <li> I must say that I was skeptical, but after a week&#x27;s application nightly, the dryness in my hands is gone.  </li>
            <li> It has a weird smell</li>
            <li> Too bad there aren&#x27;t 6 stars.  </li>
            <li> My nails were in terrible shape with splits and all kinds of ugly.</li>
            <li> If you have ridged, bumpy, ugly nails, you need this product!  </li>
            <li> The stuff smells awful, medicinal, so I do not care to keep using it and will never know if it works.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Keeps my nails moister than they otherwise would be. It is working just as it was advertised. I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> For no apparent reason as can not recall hitting my thumb or pinching it but, the nail turned south on me. Using it and will continue.&lt;br /&gt;Do they make a fake thumbnail to cover my thumb meanwhile, ladies? Hope this works for men as well as some ladies nails....</li>
            <li> Product good but very small tube which is difficult for me to squeeze.  Will try jar next time.  Fair value.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I always had brittle peeling nails.  The dermatologist recommended this and it is great.  I have had nice long nails that don&#x27;t break easily for over two years.</li>
            <li> My nails have gotten stronger, but are not yet growing; they become jagged, requiring constant trimming.  I&#x27;m debating whether to order a refill.</li>
            <li> I have found Elon Lanolin-Rich Nail Conditioner to work exactly as it&#x27;s advertised.  Where I have used it my nails have been much stronger.</li>
            <li> I have very dry nails and cuticles despite having manicures every 2 weeks religiously.  My daughter-in-law (who is a Dermatology PA) gave me a sample to try.  I saw almost immediate improvement. So, I decided to try the product on a regular basis using nightly before bed.  My cuticles are now not splitting and tearing.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with dry nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li> If you have ridged, bumpy, ugly nails, you need this product!  I had one nail that was worse than the rest that I kept on trimming for over a year hoping it would grow out better.  It had white ridges going horizontally across it, pits and bumps.  I used the Elon cream 3-4 times a day and within a couple of weeks could see the good nail growing out.  It has taken about 2-3 months for the entire nail to grow out with a new, perfect nail.  My nails have never looked better!  I bought another tube just apply daily and keep them looking great.</li>
            <li> I  like this product. It really moisturizes my cuticles and nails. It is small enough to drop in my pruse and use it while I am waiting in line at the pharmacy, or check out line  of the grocery store  or while someone else is driving the car!  It really is a good conditioner for the nails.</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference in the health of my nails.  They continued to split and peel.</li>
            <li> My nails have never been better.</li>
            <li> Too early to review&lt;br /&gt;Must use for a month or two to see results</li>
            <li> My nails are beautiful.  I came across Elon nail conditioner when I was looking for something for my dry cuticles.  With all of the positive feedback I thought I would give it a try, and I am so glad I did.  I have been using it three times a day for almost six months and my cuticles and nails are so healthy and look great!  They even survived months of packing and shipping boxes at work - before the cream, my nails would never have survived.  I had a manicure a few weeks ago and the technician said she didn&#x27;t need to do much because my cuticles were in such good condition, and my nails are so healthy.  The price is a little high but you don&#x27;t need to apply much so it does last quite a while.  The tube is a bit difficult to get the last of the cream out - luckily my husband is helpful enough to help me squeeze out as much as possible.  In the end, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After six weeks of three to two times a day my nails do not peal, crack or dry out. I use only once a day now, one dab per hand does it all. I got my nails done 12 days ago and usually the polish is pealing and cracking in two days but they have not done either since got them done and for the first time the polish is growing out from the cuticles instead of the polish breaking off or pealing. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Great for nails especially if you have problems with breaking or splitting.  I highly recommend to both men and women.</li>
            <li> I know the product is supposed to be used to conditions fingernails, but my hands stay as dry as sand paper and this product was recommended to me by my dermatologist to help prevent this annoying dryness.  I must say that I was skeptical, but after a week&#x27;s application nightly, the dryness in my hands is gone.  My thumb was cracked from dryness, and even that has begun to close up!  I&#x27;m certain my nails are benefiting, but the dryness I suffered from for years is gone from my hands.  I recommend this product for dry hands, oh yes, and for your nails.  Living in the desert as I do, everything is dry.  This product is better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> Very healing for nails that split or crack!</li>
            <li> OMG I now have nails again. You have to use it as directed. I noticed a difference after the first week. My nails were getting smooth again and the peeling had stopped. It took about 2 weeks for the cracked nail to heal. I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 weeks and had to trim my nails several times. I LOVE ELON!!!</li>
            <li> Product works great on my wife&#x27;s nails..would recommend</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  It takes a little time to notice the difference, has get into your nail matrix.  But, even after a couple of weeks of usage I could see a difference.  My nail are normally soft, and split, break off, but, after a couple of weeks, what a difference.  I will always use it.  Once I get my nails as long as I want, i&#x27;ll still use this once a day as maintenance.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have had a split thumb nail for approx. 10 years...it is now healed using this product.  Love it and hope to continue using it...hard to find and Amazon is only place I&#x27;ve been able to buy it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work but it did. I used to use acrylic nails because my nails were really thin.  But not anymore ever since I tried using this product for like a month.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that I was hoping for this EXACT container. The ones I got were RED not black - AND this one has a flat cap. That means you can store it upside down so that the product drips to the top of the tube and you get all of it rather than leaving a ton of it coating the tube.  I have to literally HANG mine upside down to get the same benefit from the red tube with the rounded cap.  This tube is a MUCH better design and THAT&#x27;S what I thought I was buying.  Instead I got the product in a red tube that looks NOTHING like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that the product seems good. My nails are still brittle with lots of vertical ridges but I&#x27;m hoping that combined with the elon nail supplements I&#x27;m taking and the lanolin, the problem will get better over time.</li>
            <li> Too bad there aren&#x27;t 6 stars.  Miracle in a tube.  Wore acrylic nails for over nine years this stuff healed the thinning, flaking and splitting in less than two months.  I would keep it on the lavatory and every time I used the bathroom I washed my hands and applied.  Used it four times a day for two months then twice a day.  Always remembering to use at bedtime.  My manicurist has moves about 75% of her acrylic. Liners to this therapy and natural nail manicures.  It works that good.</li>
            <li> This lanolin feels wonderful when applied.</li>
            <li> First recommended by my dermatologist as a remedy to stop me from picking at ragged cuticles. Boy has it worked! I no longer have ragged cuticles to pick at. I know it&#x27;s working because I get compliments from my manicurists. I&#x27;m on my second tube, with a back-up in the bedside drawer. this is part of my bedtime regimen.</li>
            <li> This is good as you continue to use it several times a day but I didn&#x27;t care for the odor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will work well, but getting it out of the tube is VERY difficult.  Bummer!</li>
            <li> It did what it said it would do. I put it on my nails every day three or 4 times.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with my nails splitting and breaking off for years.  My dermatologist recommended this product.  After a month of use I actually have nails that I can paint!  I take the polish off on weekends and apply this cream 3 times a day to make sure I keep my longish nails.  I also purchased their base and top coats - they are fantastic, too.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to those whose nails are brittle and tend to break off. This strengthens mine. It&#x27;s a small tube so is easily taken in your purse or pocket. A little dab is all you need to cover all nails at each application.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful. My nails were in terrible shape with splits and all kinds of ugly. Nothing seemed to work until the nurse practioner at the dermatologist&#x27;s office recommended Elon Nail Conditioner. For the first several months, I used it three times a day, but now use it at bedtime.</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell and I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for four+ weeks but haven&#x27;t seen the results I&#x27;d like.  My nails seem to grow faster but they are still extremely weak, brittle, and peel/split/break often.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended that I purchase and use this product for my nail problem.  I have been using it for 1 month and have not seen much progress.  I will continue to use it as recommended.</li>
            <li> This product is great for dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome!  Makes dry peeling nails heal with continued use.  This is a very concentrated cream so only need to use a very small amount.  I use it over polish as well as unpolished nails.  My cuticles have never been better.  I highly recommend this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years and have been extremely pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li> It was very sticky and had a bad odor. Had to wash my hands after using to get rid of tackiness and odor.  Not a good product for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible.  Been using it for years.  Really helps my nails become so much more healthy and the splitting/peeling has stopped.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by dermatologist. I have been using it for a couple of years.  Kind of expensive but it seems worth it as it really lubricates the nails and helps strengthen.  Came quickly and in good shape.</li>
            <li> came fast! and as described. Thank you</li>
            <li> would hardly squeeze out of tube, then so thick could not massage on fingers</li>
            <li> I liked it, seems to make m nails stronger.</li>
            <li> I received a jar, not the tube in the photo. Just used it once. The stuff smells awful, medicinal, so I do not care to keep using it and will never know if it works. Maybe the lotion smells better?</li>
            <li> Working better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.  My nails have improved and aren&#x27;t splitting at the center. Only problem..........remembering to apply!</li>
            <li> Have used this ever since my dermatologist recommended it, and it is the ONLY thing that works for my nails</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product for my nails that have ridges and break easy.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for two months.  I continue to use it, hoping for the results it promised.  So far, I still have ridges.</li>
            <li> Regardless of your nail type this works well for everyone; hard, brittle, soft, chipped, it strenthens soft nails and stops hard nails from breaking.  Best product on the market for difficult nails.</li>
            <li> really really works as soon as I apply and massage it around my nails  become so soft . recommend this if you have dry cuticle</li>
            <li> This has hardened my very soft nails so that I hardly ever have to file them anymore. I love it!</li>
            <li> If you can get over the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; this product is very good for nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li> Along with some Omega-3, this conditioner has saved my splitting and peeling nails. I&#x27;ll never be without it. My manicurist is sold on its effectiveness and recommends it to her other clients.</li>
            <li> This stuff does exactly what it says it will do.  It makes your nails healthy and shiny and the cuticles soft and healthy.  If you have brittle nails like I did, use this stuff (just a drop about the size of a pinhead) on each nail, massage it into the cuticle and nail bed really really well, and do this each day for a week, your nails will look great!!!!  No more splitting nails, brittle nails, bendable nails, dull looking nails.  It fixes all that.  Used it for a long time now and will keep using it as long as they sell it.  great product.</li>
            <li> Elon conditioner is the only product I have found that really helps my perpetually dry nails and cuticles. I try to use it a couple of times a day. It really makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a pink colored tube instead of the familiar black, but I assume its the same product?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably ordered a dozen of these tubes for the wife in the last two years. She loves the product and won&#x27;t use anything else. It must be because it works. The last order of 3 tubes arrived 1 tube short but they shipped another one right away when I let them know.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for cuticles! As far as my nails go, I have a medical issue which needs stronger medication, so I don&#x27;t know if this works for regular damaged nails.</li>
            <li> It does stink. But it works better than anything I have tried to strengthen nails. I apply and rub it in, then use a nice smelling lotion on top. That way I am not wincing from the smell but get the benefits of the product.</li>
            <li> I think it works, my tube came with components separated and is hard to get out as it is so hard.  It was a red tube not the picture you see.  sort of happy with it...</li>
            <li> Tube of Elon was empty</li>
            <li> very helpful for cracking nails</li>
            <li> I just do not like tubes.  The product is fine though</li>
            <li> Good stuff, I use it every morning on my feet and it keeps my nails healthy looking, free from cracking and drying out.</li>
