            <li>I will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment again!</li>
            <li>I bought this trial-size bottle to see how it would work for me, because,for some reason, a lot of perfumes smell funny on me.</li>
            <li>&amp; it was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I love this scent, and I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted to do.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to see exactly what the scent smelled like.  </li>
            <li>The price was pretty reasonable after the discount.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t be certain of what you are getting.</li>
            <li>and I got it fast.</li>
            <li>its size es very goog to take it in the handbag</li>

            <li>Just sweet enough.</li>
            <li>She said this was not the one she wanted and was not that particular with the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely be ordering this again maybe even a bigger size:)</li>
            <li>The bottle is lovely, but clearly I am missing something.  </li>

            <li>Usually a scent of this quality is much more costly.</li>

            <li> this is a popular but expensive fragrance...</li>
            <li> I just broke down and broughta new bottle from the mall on my next venture.</li>
            <li> The only things that wre a problem were that it is very exspensive for such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> The fragrance from this item did not last long at all and no one appeared to notice I was wearing it.</li>
            <li> Product smelled like the real thing but had an oily residue at bottom of the bottle, possibly contained mostly alcohol with scented oil base.</li>
            <li> it was completely watered down with no scent!</li>
            <li> it smells like an out-of-fashion middle aged woman.</li>
            <li> It is not too loud of a scent or too oily or harsh for the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sensuous and lasts for long!!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the tiny bottle is a few years old or not.....</li>
            <li> The bottle contains only a few grams of perfume, but one drop is plenty for an application.</li>
            <li> It has a soft subtle smell to it.</li>
            <li> I will also recommend other people to use this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t done that yet, so I&#x27;m not sure how the perfume actually smells.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, Ireally like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a sample along with other burberry fragances.</li>
            <li> A little lighter than I expected.</li>
            <li> At first i was a little skeptical about buying this product i just decided to try it out anyway.</li>
            <li> the fragrance usually lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Today I got them and they were not watered down at all or anything.</li>
            <li> I was a little upset when I got it</li>
            <li> Could be a little stronger.</li>
            <li> it is really a waste of my money to buy this one.</li>
            <li> It was really small -_-</li>
            <li> I decided to be conservative and buy the small bottle in case I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> it was just too small.  </li>
            <li> Perfume sometimes turns sour on my skin and I was afraid to order larger size....</li>
            <li> Burberry is a fragrance I&#x27;ve used in the past (at least four years from a store beauty</li>
            <li> The scent is so subtle and pleasing.</li>
            <li> I am big fan of Amazon, but this delay really disappointed me.</li>
            <li> oz FALSE ADVERTISEMENT</li>
            <li> Cap is difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> I assume I remove this, which looks like it could be difficult.  </li>
            <li> I was SSSOOOOOO disappointed.</li>
            <li> the scent of it is so terrible for me.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the size.  Cap is difficult to remove.  Other than that, love the product.  Don&#x27;t like buying larger versions as they tend to go \\&quot;bad\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I bought the small bottle , due to not being sure what to expect...............love it, and the price is so great for a small get to know fragrance.</li>
            <li> This perfume is the best that I have ever use. I will buy more in the future. I will also recommend other people to use this product.</li>
            <li> The bottle is lovely, but clearly I am missing something.  The cap pulls off, but a white plastic stopper is wedged into the opening.  I assume I remove this, which looks like it could be difficult.  I haven&#x27;t done that yet, so I&#x27;m not sure how the perfume actually smells.  And do I keep the stopper or put it back each time?</li>
            <li> This fragance has everything i looked for an all day fragance.. it smells delicious. Will buy it again and again</li>
            <li> I bought it for traveling, but once you take the stopper out you have to put it back in to keep it from spilling. The lid does not steal it. Besides that it is a great size for travel.</li>
            <li> this is a popular but expensive fragrance...I love it and I got it fast. I would recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> its size es very goog to take it in the handbag, I hope to buy others to gift my friends</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne for my daughter.  She said this was not the one she wanted and was not that particular with the fragrance.  I did receive this in the mail, fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Love everything people reviewed this perfume on....size was so truthful, not fake perfume, bottle and box from home of origin. I love the fragrance. I will order more of this, thank you so much for being honest, time and money was so positive on all levels.</li>
            <li> It was really small -_- I was a little upset when I got it but it smelled good but smelled like rubbing alcohol. I plan on buying the big bottle but I won&#x27;t be buying it online .</li>
            <li> But perfect for carrying in the purse for those moments when you are out for the evening and want to dab a bit of my Burberry. Fast shipment again!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this item from the vendor. I purchased this from one vendor (in which I ordered it new and wrapped) and received it from another and when I got it the box was unwrapped and the bottle smelled like glue. When I went to open the bottle, it was stuck and when I finally got it open it was completely watered down with no scent! I was SSSOOOOOO disappointed. I contacted Amazon and they let me know they were sending an email to the vendor and I never heard anything back from anyone! I just broke down and broughta new bottle from the mall on my next venture.</li>
            <li> DID NOT look like this picture at all and was way smaller than it appears.  Not even the same fragrance as the original.</li>
            <li> Product smelled like the real thing but had an oily residue at bottom of the bottle, possibly contained mostly alcohol with scented oil base. This is why I only buy samplers from Amazon site. You can&#x27;t be certain of what you are getting. Probably a knockoff!</li>
            <li> The purfume is a Christmas gift for my girlfriend, it smells amazing and I&#x27;m sure she will love it !!!!</li>
            <li> This came extremely quickly.  It has a very nice feminine scent.  Probably will order a larger size.  But this size was excellent as a &#x27;try me out&#x27; size.</li>
            <li> the scent of it is so terrible for me. it smells like an out-of-fashion middle aged woman. it is really a waste of my money to buy this one.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! The scent is so subtle and pleasing. Just sweet enough. I decided to be conservative and buy the small bottle in case I didn&#x27;t like it. I&#x27;m definitely getting the big one. Love it!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is fantastic. Not too strong. daffodil and vanilla subtlety. I will buy it again and again and again.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this and one another perfume for my sister to gift her on her birthday, but now her birthday is all gone. It was showing that the product will be delivered by latest of 4th of this month, today is 6th and its still not delivered. I am big fan of Amazon, but this delay really disappointed me.</li>
            <li> This is a good value if you like the original Burberry fragrance.  The bottle&lt;br /&gt;is the size of the ones that come in the set.  I treat it like liquid gold&lt;br /&gt;and use it on special occasions.  It&#x27;s divine!! I preserve it by keeping the&lt;br /&gt;plastic stopper in it to prevent any evaporation.  I was very pleased that it&lt;br /&gt;arrived in a very short time of the order and am thrilled with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister as a stocking stuffer she loves it and asked me to get her a bottle for her birthday.</li>
            <li> good things come in small packages i love my lil treat smells good look good what else could a girl ask for. lol</li>
            <li> I bought this trial-size bottle to see how it would work for me, because,for some reason, a lot of perfumes smell funny on me. Not so with this! It smells fresh and pretty. I plan on buying a full-size bottle when I finish this one!</li>
            <li> very small bottle more like a collector size!&lt;br /&gt;I bought a larger one from another CO for a little bit more and it wasnt knock of!  under 20 dollars!</li>
            <li> At first i was a little skeptical about buying this product i just decided to try it out anyway.I mean for such a good price why not. It smells just like the one you would buy from your local perfume store. Its pretty small about the size of a gulf ball, every time i go out people always complement me.I would definitely be ordering this again maybe even a bigger size:)</li>
            <li> this has become one of my most favorite perfumes .... I tend to wear this for work and for play as the scent is universal.</li>
            <li> very soft and lasts a long time very good smelling fragrance one that stays with you unlike others that lasts a while i love it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It smells so good , this is one of my favorites &amp; I received item quickly &amp; it was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I received the product and it was for a gift. My friend was happy with the product and really enjoys it a lot.</li>
            <li> I like it but my wife is not as enthusiastic. It is a very nice scent and smells a little different on each individual. The bottle contains only a few grams of perfume, but one drop is plenty for an application. Try it, you&#x27;ll probable like it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this fragrance.  It is light and pleasant and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.  My boyfriend has allergies and is often affected by perfume, and I am too.  I ordered this because he knew it was one he liked and didn&#x27;t react to, and we are very pleased with it.  Some perfumes also turn on me and smell cheap or like an insecticide, and this one does not.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product. I bought it as a gift for my mother. She loved it. She said that the scent was unique and not like what she is used to. The only things that wre a problem were that it is very exspensive for such a small bottle. Another thing is that it was deliverd close to a week after the assinged delivery date. Other than that, Ireally like it. [[ASIN:B000194YE8 Burberry by Burberry for Women, .15 oz Mini EDP]]</li>
            <li> Received very quickly.  Product as described and worth the price.  Will order again as needed.  Thanks for the quick service</li>
            <li> yayyyyyyy tks I can&#x27;t complain it is fabulous really a very good buy would buy again. Was affordable and reached on time.</li>
            <li> I was having second thoughts about buying perfumes online. Today I got them and they were not watered down at all or anything. I love this scent, and I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted to do. I ordered the smaller sample size to try out before I buy the larger size. This will be another addition to my perfume collection as I have ordered the larger 0.7 oz.</li>
            <li> A little lighter than I expected. A wonderful scent;but must be applied more than once.Could be a little stronger. Meshes well with her body odor.</li>
            <li> Need I say more???  XD XD dd XD. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haha aha.  Killing this counting</li>
            <li> it says it says .17 oz i did not get that I received .15 oz FALSE ADVERTISEMENT why would you say itas .17 oz and not shipp that</li>
            <li> I did actually like this perfume it was just too small.  I would have rather brought a larger bottle but I wanted to see exactly what the scent smelled like.  I would reccommend people to buy this perfume.  It is not too loud of a scent or too oily or harsh for the skin.</li>
            <li> Burberry is a fragrance I&#x27;ve used in the past (at least four years from a store beauty counter)...the fragrance usually lasts a long time. The fragrance from this item did not last long at all and no one appeared to notice I was wearing it. I am not sure if the tiny bottle is a few years old or not..... the fragrance was excellent but seemed to be dated. I would purchase Burberry again, but I would like a bottle where the fragrance didn&#x27;t appear to be so dated.</li>
            <li> Great perfume that last all day with out being annoying. Perfect size for travel. I will order larger size soon. Perfume sometimes turns sour on my skin and I was afraid to order larger size....</li>
            <li> smells great it was a gift for my mom i didnt expect it to be so tiny but i guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a sample along with other burberry fragances. This one was nicely snatched up by my younger daughter. It has a soft subtle smell to it. perfect for my college student.</li>
            <li> I liked the perfume. It&#x27;s sensuous and lasts for long!! The price was pretty reasonable after the discount. Coz of it&#x27;s size it can easily be slipped into your bag.</li>
            <li> Love Burberry from first time I experience it. It&#x27;s perfect for me! It&#x27;s not too much of anything-other than being the most lovely fragrance I&#x27;ve found to date! For a perfume of it&#x27;s quality I believe it&#x27;s very reasonably priced. Usually a scent of this quality is much more costly. My fav definately. Haven&#x27;t found another I like better-not yet anyway!</li>
