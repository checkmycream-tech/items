            <li>I couldn&#x27;t agree more!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky, and has an amazing cooling effect.</li>

            <li>Amazing product.  </li>
            <li>I have tried every kind of powder out there to relieve burning and chafe.&lt;br /&gt;Saw</li>
            <li>It honestly didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>This is really an awesome cream, thanks to bluesteel my life has def improved.</li>
            <li>I came upon this item looking for a nice Anti chafe cream and  </li>
            <li>and I had an upcoming  7 day vacation to Disney World which I knew would consist of 30+ miles of walking in warm weather.</li>
            <li>Really worked great!</li>
            <li>Great Product, worth the money!</li>
            <li>Best product ever for runners, highly recommend</li>
            <li>I liked the Lanacane better</li>
            <li>Works great so worth the bucks.</li>
            <li>I swear by this stuff by far the best I have found</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have used thus far in my years of bicycling!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Worked well first time out and did a great job protecting against a troublesome pair of running shorts.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, lasts longer than most other products, even has a good fragrance (tea tree - if you like it).</li>
            <li>I recommend it to others, and will be stocking up on more for myself soon.</li>
            <li>No rash or saddle sores after many sweaty hours in the saddle.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this stuff, and will definitely continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast service.  </li>
            <li>Blue Steel Sports Anti-chafe Cream works wonderfully well for my cycling needs as a chamois cream.  </li>
            <li>i love everything that this product does for me..</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;d never run more than 10 miles in mu life), I picked up a load of products at the expo.  </li>
            <li>This was the most valuable.  </li>
            <li>so I could compare them and hopefully decide on the better product.</li>
            <li>It was much better remedying any chafing that had occurred during the ride.  </li>
            <li>I find that exercise is much better with an anti chafe product.</li>
            <li>Blue Steel Sports Anti-Chafe Cream]] is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>He loves it! :)    </li>
            <li>smells great and works really well on irritation on the thighs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many anti-chafing creams throughout my athletic career.  </li>
            <li>six more words required?  </li>
            <li>I like the smell, though I admit it smells better on a man than on a woman.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it on Amazon, as it is so wonderful that it is always sold out at my local Biking &amp; running stores.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This anti-chafe cream is my favorite on runs.  </li>
            <li>Really glad I stumbled upon this stuff.</li>
            <li>tried the Monistat anti-chafing cream and it is quite a bit better (it feels quite silky, while this feels like a lotion).  </li>
            <li>I ve tried many options as changing the type of workout shirt i put on but nothing mattered.</li>
            <li>I may sweat more than others</li>
            <li>and now I am looking for something better.</li>
            <li>It made my vacation enjoyable and will recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>Thank you for helping make my vacation enjoyable</li>
            <li>If I know I&#x27;m going to go more than that</li>
            <li>Ok, so Grandma and Grandpa start bicycling again.</li>
            <li>Love the product for biking.</li>
            <li>A friend and fellow triathlete recommended Blue Steel as the best anti-chafe cream she&#x27;d ever used</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but am confident it will do the job.</li>
            <li>Seriously - Blue Steel Sports Anti-Chafe  Cream is the greatest.</li>
            <li>I love how this helps keep my legs from chaffing when I run.</li>
            <li>I love the way it performs during walking and exercising.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and washes off easily!</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is a cream instead of a stick because I can more easily apply it all over.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best by far!!</li>
            <li>Customer service was excellent and it shipped faster than expected.  </li>
            <li>He was originally using my Monistat Soothing Cream but he seemed to like that more than this product.</li>
            <li>I used this stuff most of last summer, and it was great.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, stays on even for the longest run.</li>
            <li>Stays on during workout but washes off easily.</li>
            <li>&quot; If you haven&#x27;t tried it I strongly suggest you do.</li>
            <li>The cream is lightly scented, applies easily and prevents chafing as asserted.  </li>
            <li>This product has eliminated the chaffing and rubbing that would typically occur and it smells great to boot!</li>
            <li>This arrived so quick!</li>
            <li>It smells kind of mentholish and fresh, so if you get a whiff of it while you are running, it&#x27;s not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>I just used it for a marathon in very hot weather and didn&#x27;t chafe one bit!</li>
            <li>but I find it great for my cuticles, helps to keep them smooth and it is totally greaseless.</li>
            <li>I helps to keep him sore free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to report the Blue Steel cream lives up to its description.</li>
            <li>Tea tree scent is light and didn&#x27;t cause any tingliness like some tea tree products can.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my feet chafe free throughout my workout and run.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure glad I did, I&#x27;ve done two very strenuous rides 70 &amp; 154 milers</li>
            <li>So far, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Works great on long horseback rides.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t notice any significant difference from chamois butter or dznuts.  </li>
            <li>Use it for long runs, works great no chafing at all.</li>
            <li>(Amazon Prime spoiled me quickly with free shipping.)</li>
            <li>Blue Steel is by far the best on the market.  </li>
            <li>As stated, nothing special.</li>
            <li>Absolute Magic.</li>
            <li>I have used everything from Bag Balm to Asics - and while these are good products...I use Blue Steel Anti-Chafe Cream 90% of the time.</li>
            <li>I heard good things about Blue Steel, so decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise I went 7 full days with no chafing using this cream.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>I am a seasoned bodybuilder (11 years), and looking at my thighs you can tell I can easily squat 500</li>
            <li>I was a loyal user of another chamois product for road cycling.  </li>
            <li>Just fairly adequate for walking in a dress in Disney.  </li>
            <li>Item was delivered quickly and packaged so as to prevent damage.  </li>
            <li>I found the Blue Steel cream to be a lot more soothing when I applied it, making already sore areas immediately feel better.</li>
            <li>Mild smell</li>
            <li>with this product the very first day on the treadmill i ran 3 miles no problem</li>
            <li>It is not unpleasant but noticeable for a while after applying.</li>
            <li>only Hoo Ha Ride Glide(you gotta love that name!).</li>
            <li>It is by far better</li>
            <li>I have experienced chafing for my entire adult life.</li>
            <li>After using Blue Steel I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>Seems to last for miles, nice smell.  </li>
            <li>ITS WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>A very different feel from the waxy sports lubricants and nice tea tree scent.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting something a bit more lubricating to protect sensitive areas from chafing.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;d estimate that it made a 90% improvement, which is well worth it.</li>
            <li>but if you have the dollars to spare, worth it.</li>
            <li>After the ride I seemed not to have developed any issues and was much more comfortable during the ride than I normally would have been without it.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different brands and this is by far the best of them all!</li>
            <li>like I was originally thinking (since it still causes some irritation for me at least, but no product is perfect and everyone is different).  </li>
            <li>So, granted, you&#x27;ll need to re-apply more frequently, but since this is so cheap and you use so little, who cares? :-)</li>
            <li>Will be buying more to use everywhere before my next race.</li>
            <li>I do a lot of jogging in the hot and humid South Florida sun, this stuff works, but it has a pine-like smell to it.</li>
            <li>I get pretty chaffed sometimes.</li>
            <li>This was a first attempt at finding a product I could apply to either keep my skin chafing to a minimum or to stop it altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My son says the cream is exactly what he hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>I have tried many anti-chafe creams and this one is head and shoulders above the others.  </li>
            <li>Great for long distance cycling (100 miles) even when raining moderately.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands of anti-chafe cream, and this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that seems to prevent/ minimize both.  </li>
            <li>It was my first try with a chafing product</li>
            <li>the smell at first is not something you&#x27;d fancy on a date night</li>
            <li>, I turn to body glide stick for anything greater than a 5K, but I use Blue Steel for 5Ks.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll re-apply somewhere in the middle, but that&#x27;s more for my peace of mind.  </li>
            <li>Plan on buying a lot more in the future.  </li>
            <li>I recently took a backpacking trip on which I experienced extreme discomfort from chaffing, and I have since been seeking a product that would help with that.  </li>
            <li>It really lasted in hot, humid weather</li>
            <li>Particularly if I apply powder over top of it, it lasts several hours.</li>
            <li>and well I have a large chest and run ALOT and burn baby burn.</li>
            <li>Having tried a few different types of anti-chafe cream in the past, I must say I&#x27;m the most impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>My first lube, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this when he is riding his bike.</li>
            <li>It does both very well.  </li>
            <li>and I never have to worry about it, if I forget, and get chafing, then this really helps to soothe and heal it.</li>
            <li>Nothing really helped.</li>
            <li>My husband uses this and says it works really well</li>
            <li>The tea-tree oil really helps keep my \\&quot;lady parts\\&quot; from getting irritated while I ride.</li>
            <li>Very disapointed in this product.  </li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>It does the job and adds a hint of tea tree oil that is very soothing.  </li>
            <li>but this really does work.  </li>
            <li>I live in a hot and humid climate, so</li>
            <li>The smell (think tee tree oil - a little oaky-smelling) is very mild and quickly dissipates after about a minute</li>
            <li>Other anti-chafing products are more like zinc oxide (for sun protection).</li>
            <li>Not sure why this has such great reviews.  </li>
            <li>, it is easy to apply and to wash off, and it seems to last well, although I have not ridden more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>This was because I normally chafe within a few hours of walking in warm weather</li>
            <li>..when i first applied this product i was hesitant because it felt like it just rubbed into my skin and wasnt going to do anything..as soon as i started running and sweating this stuff went into action..</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that was possible for (seemed like just a full marathon runners problem)</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s a cream that isn&#x27;t thin or runny, stays where one puts it, and has a light, refreshing smell.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>Blue steel spreads better and covers a larger area.</li>
            <li>Tried many different products with mixed results.</li>
            <li>Seriously - NO chafing.</li>
            <li>It was my longest ride yet on this particular unicycle which was 40 miles.</li>
            <li>I tried many different creams before Blue Steel but none lasts like this one.</li>
            <li>I have a very physical job, that is also very hot 4 or 5 months out of the year and chaffing is unavoidable.</li>
            <li>Blue Steel, at about the 4.5 mile mark, you become very aware of your chafing parts.  </li>
            <li>I highly recomend this product and this vendor.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to fellow runners.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and it does not melt in high temperatures.  </li>
            <li>The tea tree oil scent is a little overwhelming but dissipates after a while</li>
            <li>Immediately upon application, my thighs (which normally just brush) feel like they are gunked together.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done some pretty long rides (&gt;100 miles) and some pretty vigorous/sweaty races using this stuff and at the end of the day</li>
            <li>When this happens over the course of super long distances in warmer weather, issues happen.  </li>
            <li>Nice product but a very small tube.</li>
            <li>Cannot live without it</li>
            <li>I have been buying this for over a year now, and I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m brand new to road bicycling and have been training to ride a century (100 miles).</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and have tried the product at the beach.  </li>
            <li>I used Blue Steel for the first time during the Portland Marathon when I got a trial size packet.</li>
            <li>Unlike most other similar products.</li>
            <li>Has saved many century rides for me in the past, infact had I not had it</li>
            <li>Pretty much standard equipment in my gym bag now.  </li>
            <li>I do a lot of trail hiking in hot weather, and massaging a tiny bit of this cream into a couple of spots that chafe with regularity has allowed me to go for substantially longer hikes.</li>
            <li>Does not go away with a little sweat but can be easily washed off with soap and water.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Used the Blue Steel this morning on a 40 mile ride, worked super, especially with a new saddle, stem and handle bar setup.</li>
            <li>This product lasted such a long time and you don&#x27;t need a huge amount during application.</li>
            <li>I am a professional chef, and work under very hot and sweaty conditions at a fast pace everyday.</li>
            <li>It rained during the whole marathon and my feet were soaked from running through puddles, but this product stayed on and I only had 1 or 2 blisters which were where I hadn&#x27;t applied the cream.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have used chamois creams for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>I was thoroughly surprised.</li>
            <li>I happen to have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>so that is frequently.</li>
            <li>I can get 3x as much for the same price of my ladies-</li>
            <li>If you are looking to banish chafe from your life forever, you really need to try Blue Steel.</li>
            <li>and I was so pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it to anyone, old or young.</li>
            <li>When I first learned there was such a thing as chafe cream, I read the Amazon reviews and reluctantly chose Blue Steel.</li>
            <li>The owner of the company contacted me immediately for feedback and got the main company Blue Steel to answer my questions on a Sunday!  </li>
            <li>I used this everyday and just one mild one developed toward the end of the trip.</li>
            <li>However, on my long runs during the summer (16-20 milers), I still ended up with some chafing by the end of the run, despite applying the cream very liberally.</li>
            <li>I used a different chamois cream for miles 1-100 of a double century, then switched to this for 101-200, so this isn&#x27;t a scientifically pure review.</li>
            <li>It worked well, but I did have to apply it more often than the other brand (I also had to use a lot less,</li>
            <li>Thanks for prompt shipping.\\&quot;  Just recently finished the 300 mile Redmond to Spokane bike ride and Blue Steel was the ticket for minimizing chafing in the heat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different brands of anti-chafe creams, and this one works really well.</li>
            <li>Body Glide Stick works for any half-marathon+ distance, but offers far fewer applications per package than blue steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue</li>
            <li>This actualy makes a difference on long rides, especially those of 50+ miles in hot weather.</li>
            <li>I have not used any other product as this was the first one I had bought to tackle armpit chaffing.</li>
            <li>The areas under the bra where I used the cream were fine, like nothing happened but that spot under that strap on my back was completely raw.  </li>
            <li>Smell is a little strong and it takes a minute to dry.</li>
            <li>It helped from the very first day to shrink existing sores and with continued use I developed no more saddle sores at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>your daily run consists of a few miles at a time, Blue Steel will work just fine.</li>
            <li>Having bought my second bottle, I can&#x27;t give this a high enough recommendation.</li>
            <li>From specialized biking chamois creams to general anti-chafing creams to baby products.</li>
            <li>Now I finally have a product that takes all that away completely.</li>
            <li>Apparently, the tea tree oil helps when you forget a spot.</li>
            <li>then I can barely walk...</li>
            <li>It is not greasy like other products that I have used in the past and the clean up is much easier.</li>
            <li>This cream is similar to hand lotion in that once you rub it in, it absorbs into your skin and doesn&#x27;t do much to protect it or keep it dry.</li>
            <li>I decided to run my first half marathon 1 day before the race.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done long, hot days on the bike and Blue Steel is the only cream last lasted all day and prevented chafing.  </li>
            <li>This cream really solved my under arm chafing due to surgery.</li>
            <li>I was trying other chamois creams and they were really bothering my nether-regions.</li>
            <li>miles a day in Europe with not a single day of chafing.  </li>
            <li>There is enough in the tube for months of daily applications if you use it on the 3 spots I do (sensitive parts of chest and between the legs).  </li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due to the relative thinness of this cream, but I had more of a problem with this stuff oozing through my shorts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many anti-chafe creams for bicycling, including Chamois Butt&#x27;r, which has the most press and sales, but breaks down to worthless in less than an hour, sooner when hot and humid.</li>
            <li>My son tried the product to prevent chafing during military training in upstate New York.  </li>
            <li>I was disappointed because I had heard such great reviews</li>
            <li>Also, if your skin is sensitive or slightly compromised from previous chafing, this doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate at all--it&#x27;s very gentle.  </li>
            <li>What chafing occurred was due to the new saddle.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Amazing product.  </li>

            <li> and I had an upcoming  7 day vacation to Disney World which I knew would consist of 30+ miles of walking in warm weather.</li>
            <li> Really worked great!</li>
            <li> Great Product, worth the money!</li>
            <li> Best product ever for runners, highly recommend</li>
            <li> I liked the Lanacane better</li>
            <li> Works great so worth the bucks.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff by far the best I have found</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have used thus far in my years of bicycling!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Worked well first time out and did a great job protecting against a troublesome pair of running shorts.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, lasts longer than most other products, even has a good fragrance (tea tree - if you like it).</li>
            <li> I recommend it to others, and will be stocking up on more for myself soon.</li>
            <li> No rash or saddle sores after many sweaty hours in the saddle.  </li>

            <li> Great price and fast service.  </li>
            <li> Blue Steel Sports Anti-chafe Cream works wonderfully well for my cycling needs as a chamois cream.  </li>
            <li> i love everything that this product does for me..</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d never run more than 10 miles in mu life), I picked up a load of products at the expo.  </li>
            <li> This was the most valuable.  </li>
            <li> so I could compare them and hopefully decide on the better product.</li>
            <li> It was much better remedying any chafing that had occurred during the ride.  </li>
            <li> I find that exercise is much better with an anti chafe product.</li>
            <li> Blue Steel Sports Anti-Chafe Cream]] is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> He loves it! :)    </li>
            <li> smells great and works really well on irritation on the thighs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many anti-chafing creams throughout my athletic career.  </li>
            <li> six more words required?  </li>
            <li> I like the smell, though I admit it smells better on a man than on a woman.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I found it on Amazon, as it is so wonderful that it is always sold out at my local Biking &amp; running stores.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This anti-chafe cream is my favorite on runs.  </li>
            <li> Really glad I stumbled upon this stuff.</li>
            <li> tried the Monistat anti-chafing cream and it is quite a bit better (it feels quite silky, while this feels like a lotion).  </li>
            <li> I ve tried many options as changing the type of workout shirt i put on but nothing mattered.</li>
            <li> I may sweat more than others</li>
            <li> and now I am looking for something better.</li>
            <li> It made my vacation enjoyable and will recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Thank you for helping make my vacation enjoyable</li>
            <li> If I know I&#x27;m going to go more than that</li>
            <li> Ok, so Grandma and Grandpa start bicycling again.</li>
            <li> Love the product for biking.</li>
            <li> A friend and fellow triathlete recommended Blue Steel as the best anti-chafe cream she&#x27;d ever used</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but am confident it will do the job.</li>
            <li> Seriously - Blue Steel Sports Anti-Chafe  Cream is the greatest.</li>
            <li> I love how this helps keep my legs from chaffing when I run.</li>
            <li> I love the way it performs during walking and exercising.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and washes off easily!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is a cream instead of a stick because I can more easily apply it all over.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best by far!!</li>
            <li> Customer service was excellent and it shipped faster than expected.  </li>
            <li> He was originally using my Monistat Soothing Cream but he seemed to like that more than this product.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff most of last summer, and it was great.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, stays on even for the longest run.</li>
            <li> Stays on during workout but washes off easily.</li>
            <li> &quot; If you haven&#x27;t tried it I strongly suggest you do.</li>
            <li> The cream is lightly scented, applies easily and prevents chafing as asserted.  </li>
            <li> This product has eliminated the chaffing and rubbing that would typically occur and it smells great to boot!</li>
            <li> This arrived so quick!</li>
            <li> It smells kind of mentholish and fresh, so if you get a whiff of it while you are running, it&#x27;s not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I just used it for a marathon in very hot weather and didn&#x27;t chafe one bit!</li>
            <li> but I find it great for my cuticles, helps to keep them smooth and it is totally greaseless.</li>
            <li> I helps to keep him sore free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to report the Blue Steel cream lives up to its description.</li>
            <li> Tea tree scent is light and didn&#x27;t cause any tingliness like some tea tree products can.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my feet chafe free throughout my workout and run.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure glad I did, I&#x27;ve done two very strenuous rides 70 &amp; 154 milers</li>
            <li> So far, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works great on long horseback rides.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t notice any significant difference from chamois butter or dznuts.  </li>
            <li> Use it for long runs, works great no chafing at all.</li>
            <li> (Amazon Prime spoiled me quickly with free shipping.)</li>
            <li> Blue Steel is by far the best on the market.  </li>
            <li> As stated, nothing special.</li>
            <li> Absolute Magic.</li>
            <li> I have used everything from Bag Balm to Asics - and while these are good products...I use Blue Steel Anti-Chafe Cream 90% of the time.</li>
            <li> I heard good things about Blue Steel, so decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise I went 7 full days with no chafing using this cream.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> I am a seasoned bodybuilder (11 years), and looking at my thighs you can tell I can easily squat 500</li>
            <li> I was a loyal user of another chamois product for road cycling.  </li>
            <li> Just fairly adequate for walking in a dress in Disney.  </li>
            <li> Item was delivered quickly and packaged so as to prevent damage.  </li>
            <li> I found the Blue Steel cream to be a lot more soothing when I applied it, making already sore areas immediately feel better.</li>
            <li> Mild smell</li>
            <li> with this product the very first day on the treadmill i ran 3 miles no problem</li>
            <li> It is not unpleasant but noticeable for a while after applying.</li>
            <li> only Hoo Ha Ride Glide(you gotta love that name!).</li>
            <li> It is by far better</li>
            <li> I have experienced chafing for my entire adult life.</li>
            <li> After using Blue Steel I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> Seems to last for miles, nice smell.  </li>
            <li> ITS WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> A very different feel from the waxy sports lubricants and nice tea tree scent.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting something a bit more lubricating to protect sensitive areas from chafing.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d estimate that it made a 90% improvement, which is well worth it.</li>
            <li> but if you have the dollars to spare, worth it.</li>
            <li> After the ride I seemed not to have developed any issues and was much more comfortable during the ride than I normally would have been without it.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different brands and this is by far the best of them all!</li>
            <li> like I was originally thinking (since it still causes some irritation for me at least, but no product is perfect and everyone is different).  </li>
            <li> So, granted, you&#x27;ll need to re-apply more frequently, but since this is so cheap and you use so little, who cares? :-)</li>
            <li> Will be buying more to use everywhere before my next race.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of jogging in the hot and humid South Florida sun, this stuff works, but it has a pine-like smell to it.</li>
            <li> I get pretty chaffed sometimes.</li>
            <li> This was a first attempt at finding a product I could apply to either keep my skin chafing to a minimum or to stop it altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My son says the cream is exactly what he hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> I have tried many anti-chafe creams and this one is head and shoulders above the others.  </li>
            <li> Great for long distance cycling (100 miles) even when raining moderately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands of anti-chafe cream, and this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that seems to prevent/ minimize both.  </li>
            <li> It was my first try with a chafing product</li>
            <li> the smell at first is not something you&#x27;d fancy on a date night</li>
            <li> , I turn to body glide stick for anything greater than a 5K, but I use Blue Steel for 5Ks.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll re-apply somewhere in the middle, but that&#x27;s more for my peace of mind.  </li>
            <li> Plan on buying a lot more in the future.  </li>
            <li> I recently took a backpacking trip on which I experienced extreme discomfort from chaffing, and I have since been seeking a product that would help with that.  </li>
            <li> It really lasted in hot, humid weather</li>
            <li> Particularly if I apply powder over top of it, it lasts several hours.</li>
            <li> and well I have a large chest and run ALOT and burn baby burn.</li>
            <li> Having tried a few different types of anti-chafe cream in the past, I must say I&#x27;m the most impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> My first lube, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this when he is riding his bike.</li>
            <li> It does both very well.  </li>
            <li> and I never have to worry about it, if I forget, and get chafing, then this really helps to soothe and heal it.</li>
            <li> Nothing really helped.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this and says it works really well</li>
            <li> The tea-tree oil really helps keep my \\&quot;lady parts\\&quot; from getting irritated while I ride.</li>
            <li> Very disapointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> It does the job and adds a hint of tea tree oil that is very soothing.  </li>
            <li> but this really does work.  </li>
            <li> I live in a hot and humid climate, so</li>
            <li> The smell (think tee tree oil - a little oaky-smelling) is very mild and quickly dissipates after about a minute</li>
            <li> Other anti-chafing products are more like zinc oxide (for sun protection).</li>
            <li> Not sure why this has such great reviews.  </li>
            <li> , it is easy to apply and to wash off, and it seems to last well, although I have not ridden more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> This was because I normally chafe within a few hours of walking in warm weather</li>
            <li> ..when i first applied this product i was hesitant because it felt like it just rubbed into my skin and wasnt going to do anything..as soon as i started running and sweating this stuff went into action..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that was possible for (seemed like just a full marathon runners problem)</li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s a cream that isn&#x27;t thin or runny, stays where one puts it, and has a light, refreshing smell.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Blue steel spreads better and covers a larger area.</li>
            <li> Tried many different products with mixed results.</li>
            <li> Seriously - NO chafing.</li>
            <li> It was my longest ride yet on this particular unicycle which was 40 miles.</li>
            <li> I tried many different creams before Blue Steel but none lasts like this one.</li>
            <li> I have a very physical job, that is also very hot 4 or 5 months out of the year and chaffing is unavoidable.</li>
            <li> Blue Steel, at about the 4.5 mile mark, you become very aware of your chafing parts.  </li>
            <li> I highly recomend this product and this vendor.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to fellow runners.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and it does not melt in high temperatures.  </li>
            <li> The tea tree oil scent is a little overwhelming but dissipates after a while</li>
            <li> Immediately upon application, my thighs (which normally just brush) feel like they are gunked together.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done some pretty long rides (&gt;100 miles) and some pretty vigorous/sweaty races using this stuff and at the end of the day</li>
            <li> When this happens over the course of super long distances in warmer weather, issues happen.  </li>
            <li> Nice product but a very small tube.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without it</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for over a year now, and I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m brand new to road bicycling and have been training to ride a century (100 miles).</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and have tried the product at the beach.  </li>
            <li> I used Blue Steel for the first time during the Portland Marathon when I got a trial size packet.</li>
            <li> Unlike most other similar products.</li>
            <li> Has saved many century rides for me in the past, infact had I not had it</li>
            <li> Pretty much standard equipment in my gym bag now.  </li>
            <li> I do a lot of trail hiking in hot weather, and massaging a tiny bit of this cream into a couple of spots that chafe with regularity has allowed me to go for substantially longer hikes.</li>
            <li> Does not go away with a little sweat but can be easily washed off with soap and water.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Used the Blue Steel this morning on a 40 mile ride, worked super, especially with a new saddle, stem and handle bar setup.</li>
            <li> This product lasted such a long time and you don&#x27;t need a huge amount during application.</li>
            <li> I am a professional chef, and work under very hot and sweaty conditions at a fast pace everyday.</li>
            <li> It rained during the whole marathon and my feet were soaked from running through puddles, but this product stayed on and I only had 1 or 2 blisters which were where I hadn&#x27;t applied the cream.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have used chamois creams for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> I was thoroughly surprised.</li>
            <li> I happen to have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> so that is frequently.</li>
            <li> I can get 3x as much for the same price of my ladies-</li>
            <li> If you are looking to banish chafe from your life forever, you really need to try Blue Steel.</li>
            <li> and I was so pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> and I recommend it to anyone, old or young.</li>
            <li> When I first learned there was such a thing as chafe cream, I read the Amazon reviews and reluctantly chose Blue Steel.</li>
            <li> The owner of the company contacted me immediately for feedback and got the main company Blue Steel to answer my questions on a Sunday!  </li>
            <li> I used this everyday and just one mild one developed toward the end of the trip.</li>
            <li> However, on my long runs during the summer (16-20 milers), I still ended up with some chafing by the end of the run, despite applying the cream very liberally.</li>
            <li> I used a different chamois cream for miles 1-100 of a double century, then switched to this for 101-200, so this isn&#x27;t a scientifically pure review.</li>
            <li> It worked well, but I did have to apply it more often than the other brand (I also had to use a lot less,</li>
            <li> Thanks for prompt shipping.\\&quot;  Just recently finished the 300 mile Redmond to Spokane bike ride and Blue Steel was the ticket for minimizing chafing in the heat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands of anti-chafe creams, and this one works really well.</li>
            <li> Body Glide Stick works for any half-marathon+ distance, but offers far fewer applications per package than blue steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue</li>
            <li> This actualy makes a difference on long rides, especially those of 50+ miles in hot weather.</li>
            <li> I have not used any other product as this was the first one I had bought to tackle armpit chaffing.</li>
            <li> The areas under the bra where I used the cream were fine, like nothing happened but that spot under that strap on my back was completely raw.  </li>
            <li> Smell is a little strong and it takes a minute to dry.</li>
            <li> It helped from the very first day to shrink existing sores and with continued use I developed no more saddle sores at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> your daily run consists of a few miles at a time, Blue Steel will work just fine.</li>
            <li> Having bought my second bottle, I can&#x27;t give this a high enough recommendation.</li>
            <li> From specialized biking chamois creams to general anti-chafing creams to baby products.</li>
            <li> Now I finally have a product that takes all that away completely.</li>
            <li> Apparently, the tea tree oil helps when you forget a spot.</li>
            <li> then I can barely walk...</li>
            <li> It is not greasy like other products that I have used in the past and the clean up is much easier.</li>
            <li> This cream is similar to hand lotion in that once you rub it in, it absorbs into your skin and doesn&#x27;t do much to protect it or keep it dry.</li>
            <li> I decided to run my first half marathon 1 day before the race.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done long, hot days on the bike and Blue Steel is the only cream last lasted all day and prevented chafing.  </li>
            <li> This cream really solved my under arm chafing due to surgery.</li>
            <li> I was trying other chamois creams and they were really bothering my nether-regions.</li>
            <li> miles a day in Europe with not a single day of chafing.  </li>
            <li> There is enough in the tube for months of daily applications if you use it on the 3 spots I do (sensitive parts of chest and between the legs).  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due to the relative thinness of this cream, but I had more of a problem with this stuff oozing through my shorts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many anti-chafe creams for bicycling, including Chamois Butt&#x27;r, which has the most press and sales, but breaks down to worthless in less than an hour, sooner when hot and humid.</li>
            <li> My son tried the product to prevent chafing during military training in upstate New York.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I had heard such great reviews</li>
            <li> Also, if your skin is sensitive or slightly compromised from previous chafing, this doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate at all--it&#x27;s very gentle.  </li>
            <li> What chafing occurred was due to the new saddle.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers noted, there is a definite tea tree oil smell with the cream, but it&#x27;s neither unpleasant nor too strong and dissipates quickly after application.</li>
            <li> Unlike other cycling creams, Blue Steel rubs in completely and does not seem to leave a lubrication layer on the skin.</li>
            <li> I used body glide before and it just could not last long enough.</li>
            <li> i recently started off training for a half marathon where i couldnt even complete a mile before the insides of my thighs began to chafe</li>
            <li> Use a pea sized amount and it should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Normally I will just use gold bond which works for a few hours....</li>
            <li> I received a few trial packets right before a 10k &amp; Half Challenge.</li>
            <li> This product can be brought along on the run for quick re-application (I use a small black twist pod that I think my wife had for makeup)</li>
            <li> Blue steel lasts all day long!</li>
            <li> I was a little sceptic at first, since I had used a sample packets on a few rides earlier this year.  </li>
            <li> We are fit but the contest rub of shorts or a bathing suit with the sale and sand became uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> This product did not seem to work as well during a long bike ride.</li>
            <li> As a long distance cyclist doing rides of 200-600 km regularly...a sore butt is something I&#x27;ve accepted as a given.</li>
            <li> Now a tube of this anti-chafe cream accompanies me on all my long rides, and my roadie buddies give me hell if I ever forget to carry it on a ride.</li>
            <li> Used it twice on long runs.</li>
            <li> It offers a few miles of protection from chafing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also soothes after a long ride.</li>
            <li> I have only a little experience riding with anti-chafe cream, and my distances are not long.</li>
            <li> It was quickly shipped, and hasn&#x27;t failed me yet when running at the gym or outside.</li>
            <li> I have tried other anti-chafe products and recently purchase this to evaluate.</li>
            <li> I have used several other products this year, but this lasted the longest, wasn&#x27;t greasy feeling and almost eliminated the chafing.</li>
            <li> I know that it is intended for running and other sports, but anyone who has a physically demanding job should have some.</li>
            <li> Blue Steel has an edge over all the other products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a year at every race or long run!</li>
            <li> Other creams simply did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it!</li>
            <li> You need to allow this to dry.</li>
            <li> My husband could not live without it during the summer months.</li>
            <li> However, for me these other anti-chafing products did not do the job while Blue Steel does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added benefit of Blue Steel is that it does not leave a water unsoluble mess in your bike shorts.</li>
            <li> It is a little more expensive than some of the other products that I have tried</li>
            <li> This bigger bottle means it will last a lot longer (without having to buy as often), and It works just as well if not better than Lanacane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I run half marathons regularly</li>
            <li> I am a long distance unicyclist among other things.</li>
            <li> As a 60-year old cyclist riding 150 miles a week for the past few years, saddle soreness is a constant irritation.</li>
            <li> As a bigger guy exercising on a bike or treadmill can be pretty painful because of chafing, even just walking around outside regularly, I put this on before I&#x27;m active</li>
            <li> but if I rode more I&#x27;d develop painful saddle sores.</li>
            <li> The product is a bit expensive, but its worth it.</li>
            <li> A few miles later the sting was gone.</li>
            <li> just spent 4 weeks in Hawaii cycling 15-20 hours a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different brands and varieties of chamois cream for cycling.  </li>
            <li> It does not feel wet or &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34; while on.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I recently ran a half marathon, and this anti-chafe cream was a life saver!  </li>
            <li> With some serious chafing   all the other creams dry or get \\&quot;chafed away\\&quot;, only Blue Steel, once applied, lasts forever!  </li>
            <li> No greasy feeling and certainly no chafing after the run was over.</li>
            <li> I have tried other powders and such, but they all wear off within a few hours.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical due to the price point, but it&#x27;s worth every penny, I promise you.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a sweaty runner with any amount of bounce to your chest like me, Blue Steel begins to break down at the 4-mile mark (a little sooner in hotter</li>
            <li> The only drawback is there is a very faint mediciny smell, but it&#x27;s not noticeable in use and is a small price to pay for the benefits of being able to do an entire day&#x27;s hard work with zero chafing.</li>
            <li> It is a little less greasy than some, similar to dznuts in that respect.</li>
            <li> It also spreads out easily, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a cream, not oil, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I always get blisters on my feet, even when using other anti-chafing creams.</li>
            <li> Tried other products but nothing keeps me from chaffing like this product.</li>
            <li> Not a pretty site.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the other reviewers were using this for skin/clothing chafing rather than</li>
            <li> but once you get past it Blue Steel does its job.</li>
            <li> Small tube, but lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Other than that it serves it&#x27;s purpose!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the heat/humidity/sweat broke this down in less than an hour, but on a multi-hour adventure, this is a non-starter.  </li>
            <li> Tried a few other brands but none have given me the results that this cream has.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight odor.</li>
            <li> and it stays put, but does wash off slightly.  </li>
            <li> I ran a half marathon and my friends told me that I was going to need some anti chafing cream</li>
            <li> and it also has an odd smell.</li>
            <li> The chafing on my thighs in particular was getting tiresome.</li>
            <li> I have a very hot, active job and sometimes experience painful chafing from my pants rubbing around my waistband and bikini area.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Body Glide in the past, but it doesn&#x27;t work that well after 6-8 miles and can be a little harder to apply.  </li>
            <li> No significant smell too.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE PRICED</li>
            <li> I purchased this for running for inner thighs and chest, as I have had the unfortunate occurence of irritation and bloody nipples at mileages more than 6 miles, especially when cold or wet outside.  </li>
            <li> It works just fine, but I hate the smell of it.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product a few days before my NY marathon race and it came just in time (the day before the race).</li>
            <li> but this cream reduces the pain for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my husband, Brett Milton, who is a National Title Holder for Scottish Hightland Heavy Events Athletics.  </li>
            <li> and I can guarantee to chafe anytime I run over a few miles.</li>
            <li> Grandma is suffering after a few miles of biking.</li>
            <li> I use this cream everyday now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap</li>
            <li> I used it to prevent chafing under my sports bra while training for a half marathon in June, my chafing scars are still there!  </li>
            <li> on the rave reviews, I bought this cream, and it actually made the problem much worse, not better!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about Blue Steel but decided to try it anyway.</li>
            <li> While I thought this was slightly expensive, it has proved itself every day for the last two months!</li>
            <li> no more complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used BodyGlide for the past decade + for my chafing issues.  </li>
            <li> , some are no better than lotion.  </li>
            <li> In the past the salt and sand used to give a rash.  </li>
            <li> This literally saved my butt a few times!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this only lasted an hour each time and I was forced to run topless.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 16 mile long runs, and haven&#x27;t had it fail yet.</li>
            <li> We had trouble with painful chafing during our training, but that all went away once we started using the Blue Steel.  </li>
            <li> I wear dresses and skirts exclusively, commute on foot often, and have thunderous thighs, so in warmer months when tights and leggings are out, his stuff is a lifesaver; I never liked using the deodorant trick.</li>
            <li> It was less expensive and did qualify for Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> Seriously, if you struggle at all with chafing, you need this.</li>
            <li> I got a chafe from a bad gel-pad seam and added Blue Steel to the sore spot.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately could stand to lose a few pounds, so my thighs rub together when I walk.  </li>
            <li> I then put on Vaseline and hope the chafing is gone by morning, only to be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I mean nothing is like this product!</li>
            <li> I have bad skin unfortunately around the same area chafing occurs for cyclists.</li>
            <li> The company stands behind their product and immediately replaced a defective tube.</li>
            <li> My daughter noticed it and she has a poor sense of smell.</li>
            <li> but alas, I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I usually suffer from really bad chafing on my runs, but this product does what it says, and isn&#x27;t greasy or oily like some products.</li>
            <li> I got this as a replacement for Lanacane because, frankly, Lanacane is expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was not helpful at all.</li>
            <li> On a blind buy I bought this.</li>
            <li> that being said, it fits well in a pocket when riding, so a convenient size although expensive.</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I suffered from horrible rash for months in my inner thighs and it made any workout hell.</li>
            <li> If the worst of my concerns is a slightly greasy feel afterwards, then all is well.</li>
            <li> Bad smell, kills the point.</li>
            <li> Chaffing has always been an issue and at times a very painful one.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My husband really likes this when he is riding his bike. I helps to keep him sore free. Will buy it again when needed.</li>
            <li> It does not totally stop blisters from occurring but I find it great for my cuticles, helps to keep them smooth and it is totally greaseless.</li>
            <li> I bike and hike and this anti-chafing cream works great.  Plus, the tea tree oil smells great besides being good for your skin.</li>
            <li> Works as claimed, a great alternative to powder. The company stands behind their product and immediately replaced a defective tube. I will continue using this product and dealing with them.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this has such great reviews.  Have used the product for two days, and I might as well have used baby powder.  In fact, I wish I had.  I live in a hot and humid climate, so I don&#x27;t know if the heat/humidity/sweat broke this down in less than an hour, but on a multi-hour adventure, this is a non-starter.  Back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li> I was getting all kinds of sores when I started riding to work every day. This product did an excellent job of protecting my skin and has made my bicycle rides to work so much more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I have a very physical job, that is also very hot 4 or 5 months out of the year and chaffing is unavoidable. I used this stuff most of last summer, and it was great. I recommend it to others, and will be stocking up on more for myself soon. I tried lanacanes anti-chafe but its not even close to as good as this.</li>
            <li> I was a loyal user of another chamois product for road cycling.  But I like the smell of tea tree oil and I like the form factor of Blue Steel anti-chafe cream (tube vs jar) so I decided to give it a try.  Well I just rode RAMROD using it.  159 miles in the midst of a record breaking heat-wave.  No rash or saddle sores after many sweaty hours in the saddle.  I&#x27;m convinced: it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I recently took a backpacking trip on which I experienced extreme discomfort from chaffing, and I have since been seeking a product that would help with that.  I bought this product in hopes that it would reduce the friction without having a greasy feel.  It does both very well.  I am very happy with this stuff, and will definitely continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I have tried other anti-chafe products and recently purchase this to evaluate. It is by far better then all the others I have tried.  It performs as advertised.[[ASIN:B001JK6N3I Blue Steel Sports Anti-Chafe Cream]]</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Works as advertised.  Great price and fast service.  I highly recomend this product and this vendor.</li>
            <li> I used Blue Steel for the first time during the Portland Marathon when I got a trial size packet. I always get blisters on my feet, even when using other anti-chafing creams. It rained during the whole marathon and my feet were soaked from running through puddles, but this product stayed on and I only had 1 or 2 blisters which were where I hadn&#x27;t applied the cream.  I&#x27;ll be using this all the time now!</li>
            <li> Blue Steel Sports Anti-chafe Cream works wonderfully well for my cycling needs as a chamois cream.  I do however used it in combination with Mueller Runner&#x27;s Lube.  The best thing about the cream is just that: it&#x27;s a cream that isn&#x27;t thin or runny, stays where one puts it, and has a light, refreshing smell.  Customer service was excellent and it shipped faster than expected.  I will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> i love everything that this product does for me..i recently started off training for a half marathon where i couldnt even complete a mile before the insides of my thighs began to chafe and i had to stop because of the pain..with this product the very first day on the treadmill i ran 3 miles no problem..when i first applied this product i was hesitant because it felt like it just rubbed into my skin and wasnt going to do anything..as soon as i started running and sweating this stuff went into action..the spot that used to chafe was now gliding over and over with no problems..i ended up running the longest i have since i can remember!! i will buy this roduct over and over and will recommend this to anyone else that has similar problems!!</li>
            <li> This is a truly wonderful product. I have experienced chafing for my entire adult life. Now I finally have a product that takes all that away completely. I am a user for life. The product is a bit expensive, but its worth it.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Used the Blue Steel this morning on a 40 mile ride, worked super, especially with a new saddle, stem and handle bar setup. I have used several other products this year, but this lasted the longest, wasn&#x27;t greasy feeling and almost eliminated the chafing. What chafing occurred was due to the new saddle. Thanks for prompt shipping.\\&quot;  Just recently finished the 300 mile Redmond to Spokane bike ride and Blue Steel was the ticket for minimizing chafing in the heat.</li>
            <li> I decided to run my first half marathon 1 day before the race.  Knowing nothing about running this distance (I&#x27;d never run more than 10 miles in mu life), I picked up a load of products at the expo.  This was the most valuable.  The salesperson gave me some ideas about where to put it and I slathered it on wherever there seemed to be a chaffing risk.  Well, I didn&#x27;t think about one spot on my back where the strap of my sports bra hits my skin.  The areas under the bra where I used the cream were fine, like nothing happened but that spot under that strap on my back was completely raw.  I didn&#x27;t think that was possible for (seemed like just a full marathon runners problem) but alas, I was wrong.  Will be buying more to use everywhere before my next race.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 similar products at the same time so I could compare them and hopefully decide on the better product. This product did not seem to work as well during a long bike ride. It was much better remedying any chafing that had occurred during the ride.  This product also has a definite smell. It is not unpleasant but noticeable for a while after applying. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many anti-chafe creams for bicycling, including Chamois Butt&#x27;r, which has the most press and sales, but breaks down to worthless in less than an hour, sooner when hot and humid. I&#x27;ve done long, hot days on the bike and Blue Steel is the only cream last lasted all day and prevented chafing.  Apparently, the tea tree oil helps when you forget a spot. I got a chafe from a bad gel-pad seam and added Blue Steel to the sore spot. A few miles later the sting was gone. Even though the chafing raised a welt, the welt was painless and went away the next morning. Untreated chafing welts tend to last 2-3 days, but Blue Steel cut this one short.</li>
            <li> As a bigger guy exercising on a bike or treadmill can be pretty painful because of chafing, even just walking around outside regularly, I put this on before I&#x27;m active and I never have to worry about it, if I forget, and get chafing, then this really helps to soothe and heal it.</li>
            <li> I purchased both this and Lanacane. This product is a white cream while Lanacane is gel. Blue steel spreads better and covers a larger area. You need to allow this to dry. It does not seem to have the silky feel of the lanacane. It does have a slight odor. Not bad. Tree tea oil. My daughter noticed it and she has a poor sense of smell. I actually look at this as a plus depending on where you are putting it. Instead of smelling like sweat after exercise, you smell like tree oil. While I did not chafe with this product. I liked the Lanacane better but I am still experimenting with both products. I find that exercise is much better with an anti chafe product. Places that I thought were skin tears, turned out to be chafed areas. All these problems have gone away with the use of these products.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a few days before my NY marathon race and it came just in time (the day before the race). I&#x27;m prone to getting blisters on my toes even during short distance races so I applied the product all over my feet. Amazingly enough, no blisters after the marathon. Also put it on my body and legs to prevent chafing and it worked! Highly recommended to fellow runners.</li>
            <li> This cream really solved my under arm chafing due to surgery.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different brands and this is by far the best of them all! Goes on easy, stays on even for the longest run. I won&#x27;t buy another brand.</li>
            <li> Blue Steel Sports Anti-Chafe Cream [[ASIN:B001JK6N3I Blue Steel Sports Anti-Chafe Cream]] is an excellent product. When I first learned there was such a thing as chafe cream, I read the Amazon reviews and reluctantly chose Blue Steel. I did so reluctantly because at the time it did not qualify for Amazon Prime shipping.   After using Blue Steel I was thrilled. I was no longer getting chafed between my thighs after my hour-long workout on my elliptical trainer. I began to use it sparingly so I could avoid paying shipping charges. (Amazon Prime spoiled me quickly with free shipping.) Even using Blue Steel sparingly did not decrease its effectiveness.   When the Blue Steel ran out, I again went to Amazon and read reviews. I decided to try Chamois BUTT&#x27;r [[ASIN:B004H4V6GC Chamois BUTT&#x27;r]]. It was less expensive and did qualify for Amazon Prime. The Chamois worked as well as Blue Steel and is four dollars cheaper than the same amount of Blue Steel. Even though Blue Steel currently qualifies for Amazon Prime, I have remained with Chamois because, well, four dollars is four dollars.</li>
            <li> I got this as a replacement for Lanacane because, frankly, Lanacane is expensive. This bigger bottle means it will last a lot longer (without having to buy as often), and It works just as well if not better than Lanacane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have big thighs (that sweat) which means I need something that won&#x27;t rub off before noon. This does the trick. It also spreads out easily, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> best anti-chafe cream i ever tried</li>
            <li> I have struggled with saddle sores from long-distance bike riding for years. I had no big problem riding about 8-10 hours a week but if I rode more I&#x27;d develop painful saddle sores. Tried many different products with mixed results. From specialized biking chamois creams to general anti-chafing creams to baby products. Nothing really helped. I was skeptical about Blue Steel but decided to try it anyway. It helped from the very first day to shrink existing sores and with continued use I developed no more saddle sores at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just spent 4 weeks in Hawaii cycling 15-20 hours a week. I never could have done this before I used Blue Steel. Absolute Magic. Never needed to reapply even for 5 hour rides. This in 80-90 degree weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Blue Steel cures and prevents the infections that are saddle sores which are caused by heat and sweating. I don&#x27;t know how well it works preventing physical chafing. Unlike other cycling creams, Blue Steel rubs in completely and does not seem to leave a lubrication layer on the skin. So, if you are trying to protect against physical chafing it may or may not work for you. I liken this product to sun screen. You rub it in, it disappears but keeps on protecting. Other anti-chafing products are more like zinc oxide (for sun protection). They don&#x27;t rub in but leave a protection layer on the surface of the skin. However, for me these other anti-chafing products did not do the job while Blue Steel does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added benefit of Blue Steel is that it does not leave a water unsoluble mess in your bike shorts. Unlike most other similar products.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Cannot live without it</li>
            <li> Seriously - NO chafing. NONE. This stuff is a miracle.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. My husband could not live without it during the summer months.</li>
            <li> I work in a warehouse for ten hours a day, walking at a brisk pace. I&#x27;m a bigger guy so all that running about can cause chafing issues. I bought this product because it promised not to sweat off, which was a problem with the otherwise excellent Lanacane anti-chafing gel I had been using. I&#x27;m happy to report the Blue Steel cream lives up to its description. I can make it through an entire shift and it&#x27;s still doing its job. The only drawback is there is a very faint mediciny smell, but it&#x27;s not noticeable in use and is a small price to pay for the benefits of being able to do an entire day&#x27;s hard work with zero chafing. Plus, the stuff soothes chafed skin, after the fact. Bonus!</li>
            <li> Seems to last for miles, nice smell.  Stays on during workout but washes off easily. My first lube, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my bf. He was too embarrassed to buy it. He loves it! :)    UPDATE: My boyfriend wont go anywhere without this. Saved us during vacation! TRY IT.</li>
            <li> smells great and works really well on irritation on the thighs.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for over a year now, and I can&#x27;t live without it. I am a professional chef, and work under very hot and sweaty conditions at a fast pace everyday. Chaffing has always been an issue and at times a very painful one. I have tried other powders and such, but they all wear off within a few hours. Blue steel lasts all day long! I know that it is intended for running and other sports, but anyone who has a physically demanding job should have some. They should have called it \\&quot;blue collar work cream\\&quot; instead. If you are even looking at this, you need it! Don&#x27;t work/play through the pain anymore! Relief is here!</li>
            <li> Does not work.  I used it to prevent chafing under my sports bra while training for a half marathon in June, my chafing scars are still there!  My son tried the product to prevent chafing during military training in upstate New York.  Unfortunately, it was not helpful at all.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best by far!! I tried others nothing I mean nothing is like this product!</li>
            <li> I do a lot of jogging in the hot and humid South Florida sun, this stuff works, but it has a pine-like smell to it.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this and says it works really well</li>
            <li> I use this product on my inner thighs when wearing dresses or shorts and it lasts for around 4 hours.  Not only does it help my legs from chafing, but the cream hasn&#x27;t discolored any of my clothing and leaves my skin oh-so-soft!  The smell (think tee tree oil - a little oaky-smelling) is very mild and quickly dissipates after about a minute but I find it pleasant.  This is a cream, not oil, and a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve used this product and then gone swimming in the ocean repeatedly and it stays put, but does wash off slightly.  So, granted, you&#x27;ll need to re-apply more frequently, but since this is so cheap and you use so little, who cares? :-)</li>
            <li> As eluded in a product review for [[ASIN:B0029ZAHJI Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Massaging Gel Extra Support Insoles, Men&#x27;s Size 8 to 14, 1-Pair Package]], I work in a warehouse for a living. The chafing on my thighs in particular was getting tiresome. Trying some anti-chafing gels, and they didn&#x27;t work. On a blind buy I bought this. While I thought this was slightly expensive, it has proved itself every day for the last two months! If the worst of my concerns is a slightly greasy feel afterwards, then all is well. Having bought my second bottle, I can&#x27;t give this a high enough recommendation.</li>
            <li> I work cleaning pools in Las Vegas. I get pretty chaffed sometimes. Tried other products but nothing keeps me from chaffing like this product. I recommend.</li>
            <li> As a long distance cyclist doing rides of 200-600 km regularly...a sore butt is something I&#x27;ve accepted as a given. Blue Steel anti-chafe cream is something I stumbled across on Amazon a couple of years ago...It&#x27;s been bye bye chafing ever since. Now a tube of this anti-chafe cream accompanies me on all my long rides, and my roadie buddies give me hell if I ever forget to carry it on a ride.</li>
            <li> I am a long distance unicyclist among other things. I have bad skin unfortunately around the same area chafing occurs for cyclists. This was a first attempt at finding a product I could apply to either keep my skin chafing to a minimum or to stop it altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used the product once since getting the cream. It was my longest ride yet on this particular unicycle which was 40 miles. I applied the cream about 30 minutes before the ride in ample enough amount. After the ride I seemed not to have developed any issues and was much more comfortable during the ride than I normally would have been without it.</li>
            <li> As a cyclist, I like Blue Steel. It is not greasy like other products that I have used in the past and the clean up is much easier. The performance is good on all lengths of rides. I have sensitive skin and have used chamois creams for over 10 years. Blue Steel is now my cream of choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m brand new to road bicycling and have been training to ride a century (100 miles). This cream is a godsend! I was trying other chamois creams and they were really bothering my nether-regions. The tea-tree oil really helps keep my \\&quot;lady parts\\&quot; from getting irritated while I ride. I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> Only thing I&#x27;ve tried that helps the chafing.</li>
            <li> The Blue Steel cream works. I use it on my feet for neuropathy . If you have this condition you know nothing cures it but this cream reduces the pain for a few hours. Buy it and you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Nice product but a very small tube. that being said, it fits well in a pocket when riding, so a convenient size although expensive.</li>
            <li> Terrific product.  Used it in Maui for snorkeling and scuba diving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many anti-chafing creams throughout my athletic career.  Blue Steel is by far the best on the market.  It&#x27;s not sticky, and has an amazing cooling effect. Blue Steel is now my \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my husband, Brett Milton, who is a National Title Holder for Scottish Hightland Heavy Events Athletics.  After he used this product, he raved about it.  It kept him from getting chafed and allowed for smooth-flowing motion.  He was also impressed that it did not disapate with sweat.</li>
            <li> Does not do the job it is suppose too.  Very disapointed in this product.  Does not do what it says it does.</li>
            <li> As a 60-year old cyclist riding 150 miles a week for the past few years, saddle soreness is a constant irritation. I have used everything from Bag Balm to Asics - and while these are good products...I use Blue Steel Anti-Chafe Cream 90% of the time. I use it before and after every ride...and even on my days off for \\&quot;preventative maintenance.\\&quot; If you haven&#x27;t tried it I strongly suggest you do. Blue Steel has an edge over all the other products. I gave a tube to my son recently who was complaining about chaffing after running...no more complaints. I can&#x27;t imagine my cycling routine without Blue Steel.</li>
            <li> Good product, works as advertised</li>
            <li> This arrived so quick! My son says the cream is exactly what he hoped it would be. Goes on smooth and washes off easily!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Smell is a little strong and it takes a minute to dry. Other than that it serves it&#x27;s purpose!</li>
            <li> Terrible. Did not work at all</li>
            <li> I have only a little experience riding with anti-chafe cream, and my distances are not long. So this review should be taken in that context. In all the rides I have done with the Blue Steel Sports cream, I have had no chafing. I like the smell, it is easy to apply and to wash off, and it seems to last well, although I have not ridden more than a few hours. So far, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have tried every kind of powder out there to relieve burning and chafe.&lt;br /&gt;Saw this on Amazon and read the reviews so i tried it.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely the best product ever i have tried.</li>
            <li> Just fairly adequate for walking in a dress in Disney.  As stated, nothing special. six more words required?  Really? Blah</li>
            <li> Having tried a few different types of anti-chafe cream in the past, I must say I&#x27;m the most impressed with this product. It was quickly shipped, and hasn&#x27;t failed me yet when running at the gym or outside. I usually suffer from really bad chafing on my runs, but this product does what it says, and isn&#x27;t greasy or oily like some products. I would definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Works great on long horseback rides.</li>
            <li> I was thoroughly surprised. My wife ordered some for me and I was skeptical. I tried it and it works wonderfully. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend who was complaining about having chaffing in the armpit area. He was originally using my Monistat Soothing Cream but he seemed to like that more than this product. He preferred the texture of the monistat product than the minting substance of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used BodyGlide for the past decade + for my chafing issues.  It works just fine, but I hate the smell of it.  I heard good things about Blue Steel, so decided to give it a try.  It&#x27;s everthing I was hoping for.  Eliminates thigh chafe, underarm chafe, and whatever else I&#x27;ve thrown at it.  It smells kind of mentholish and fresh, so if you get a whiff of it while you are running, it&#x27;s not unpleasant.  Also, if your skin is sensitive or slightly compromised from previous chafing, this doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate at all--it&#x27;s very gentle.  I&#x27;ve used it for 16 mile long runs, and haven&#x27;t had it fail yet.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of brands and types of creams. I happen to have really sensitive skin and I can guarantee to chafe anytime I run over a few miles. I run half marathons regularly so that is frequently. This stuff is awesome. Once you use it you wont use anything else! It is also great for after you chafe (if you forget to put it on before.) I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The cream is lightly scented, applies easily and prevents chafing as asserted.  Item was delivered quickly and packaged so as to prevent damage.  Excellent service, excellent product.</li>
            <li> Miracle in a tube. I have been struggling with chaffing for years I always changed the underwear thinking it was the pronblem I went from polyester to cotton to spandex. I lather areas needed  before I go to work and I don&#x27;t even think about it anymore. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> This chamois cream is good but I didn&#x27;t notice any significant difference from chamois butter or dznuts.  It is a little less greasy than some, similar to dznuts in that respect.</li>
            <li> What can I say? Prior run, after run, it just works and leaves no signs on my underwear. No significant smell too. I can see miself purchasing this regularly</li>
            <li> This wonder product got me through Ironman Canada without any issues or irritations. Easily the best anti-chaffing creme I&#x27;ve come across. I&#x27;ll be lathering up again for Ironman Coeur d&#x27;Alene.  Customer services is equally excellent.</li>
            <li> It honestly didn&#x27;t work. I was disappointed because I had heard such great reviews but I still ended up chaffing....</li>
            <li> This is the cream of choice for my husband&#x27;s 100 and 200 mile bike rides. He absolutely loves it! I just wish it were a bit cheaper or came in a bigger size. I can get 3x as much for the same price of my ladies-only Hoo Ha Ride Glide(you gotta love that name!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands of anti-chafe creams, and this one works really well. I also like that you can use it to soothe chafed areas, and it&#x27;s not greasy like some.</li>
            <li> Not inexpensive, but very effective.  I like the smell, though I admit it smells better on a man than on a woman.  I would recommend this, and purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Bad smell, kills the point.</li>
            <li> Best riding lube out there.</li>
            <li> Worked with shorts liner chafing but I also tried to reduce nipple chafing.  I sweat profusely and I am hirsute (hairy) so keeping nipples safe is difficult to manage with tapes and band-aids.  Used it twice on long runs. Unfortunately, this only lasted an hour each time and I was forced to run topless.  Not a pretty site.</li>
            <li> I used a different chamois cream for miles 1-100 of a double century, then switched to this for 101-200, so this isn&#x27;t a scientifically pure review. I found the Blue Steel cream to be a lot more soothing when I applied it, making already sore areas immediately feel better. It worked well, but I did have to apply it more often than the other brand (I also had to use a lot less, so take that as you will). I would definitely use it again. Also, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due to the relative thinness of this cream, but I had more of a problem with this stuff oozing through my shorts.</li>
            <li> Used before, great stuff...</li>
            <li> Use it for long runs, works great no chafing at all. Good product</li>
            <li> I am a seasoned bodybuilder (11 years), and looking at my thighs you can tell I can easily squat 500+ pounds.  I tried many different creams before Blue Steel but none lasts like this one. With some serious chafing   all the other creams dry or get \\&quot;chafed away\\&quot;, only Blue Steel, once applied, lasts forever!  I used to wear thighs shorts (under regular pants) even for walking and in the summer this was a great pain, now is just a memory!  This is really an awesome cream, thanks to bluesteel my life has def improved.</li>
            <li> I ran a half marathon and my friends told me that I was going to need some anti chafing cream so I tried this one. I was extremely impressed at how easy it was to apply and how good it felt once applied. No greasy feeling and certainly no chafing after the run was over. Great Product, worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have tried many anti-chafe creams and this one is head and shoulders above the others.  I don&#x27;t worry about chafing when I use Blue Steel.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BEST anti Chafe cream on the market. I received a few trial packets right before a 10k &amp; Half Challenge. Now I won&#x27;t run without it. I am so glad I found it on Amazon, as it is so wonderful that it is always sold out at my local Biking &amp; running stores. If you are looking to banish chafe from your life forever, you really need to try Blue Steel.</li>
            <li> Great for long distance cycling (100 miles) even when raining moderately. I also use it in armpits and dewlap to avoid the helmet strap rubbing. This has become an essential for me. Love it.</li>
            <li> This anti-chafe cream is my favorite on runs.  It does the job and adds a hint of tea tree oil that is very soothing.  Small tube, but lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot and am prone to both chafing and jock itch.  I&#x27;ve tried many brands of anti-chafe cream, and this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that seems to prevent/ minimize both.  It&#x27;s the tea oil, I guess.  Not overly-greasy, pleasant smell, lasts for hours.  Really glad I stumbled upon this stuff.</li>
            <li> great for Mountain biking.</li>
            <li> Worked well first time out and did a great job protecting against a troublesome pair of running shorts. Tea tree scent is light and didn&#x27;t cause any tingliness like some tea tree products can.</li>
            <li> I have upper thighs that touch just enough to cause chafing in the summer when I am wearing dresses or skirts.  Powder works quite well, but wears off after an hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;Based on the rave reviews, I bought this cream, and it actually made the problem much worse, not better!  Immediately upon application, my thighs (which normally just brush) feel like they are gunked together.  Perhaps the other reviewers were using this for skin/clothing chafing rather than skin/skin chafing?&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Monistat anti-chafing cream and it is quite a bit better (it feels quite silky, while this feels like a lotion).  Particularly if I apply powder over top of it, it lasts several hours.</li>
            <li> AMAZING. Seriously, if you struggle at all with chafing, you need this. It was my first try with a chafing product and I was so pleasantly surprised. This product lasted such a long time and you don&#x27;t need a huge amount during application. I was skeptical due to the price point, but it&#x27;s worth every penny, I promise you.</li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED ALOT OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS BUT THIS ONE ITS THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS WORKED. A LITTLE PRICED BUT I GUESS ITS WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> I have not used any other product as this was the first one I had bought to tackle armpit chaffing. During my longer runs I get chaffing under my armpits. I ve tried many options as changing the type of workout shirt i put on but nothing mattered. I came upon this item looking for a nice Anti chafe cream and  although I felt the product was a bit pricey it gives you the best value for your money. the smell at first is not something you&#x27;d fancy on a date night but once you get past it Blue Steel does its job. I ve not had chaffing and that makes me very very happy. Give this Product a shot and see for yourself. Peace!!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a sweaty runner with any amount of bounce to your chest like me, Blue Steel begins to break down at the 4-mile mark (a little sooner in hotter weather).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Blue Steel, at about the 4.5 mile mark, you become very aware of your chafing parts.  At the 6-mile mark and beyond, you are feeling the full-on sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result, I turn to body glide stick for anything greater than a 5K, but I use Blue Steel for 5Ks.  Body Glide Stick works for any half-marathon+ distance, but offers far fewer applications per package than blue steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Steel holds up well for the 5Ks.  There is enough in the tube for months of daily applications if you use it on the 3 spots I do (sensitive parts of chest and between the legs).  So while I recommend this for 5Ks, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for longer runs.  It offers a few miles of protection from chafing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your daily run consists of a few miles at a time, Blue Steel will work just fine.</li>
            <li> My wife and I recently ran a half marathon, and this anti-chafe cream was a life saver!  We had trouble with painful chafing during our training, but that all went away once we started using the Blue Steel.  We will definitely be using this again in the future!</li>
            <li> Luv this anti-chafe cream because it contains Tea Tree Oil. Mild smell but I don&#x27;t mind it. White cream, doesn&#x27;t stain clothing. Works great so worth the bucks. Ladies, I use this where bra rubs on skin and it is a big help.</li>
            <li> This is a must buy for anyone playing sports, or into sports or any fitness activity.&lt;br /&gt;I am prone to blisters and rashes and this is a perfect solution!</li>
            <li> I love tea tree oil!  It smells fantastic.  This product has been great!  I unfortunately could stand to lose a few pounds, so my thighs rub together when I walk.  This product has eliminated the chaffing and rubbing that would typically occur and it smells great to boot!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading the great reviews.I may sweat more than others idk but after about 3 miles I&#x27;d sweat it off and well I have a large chest and run ALOT and burn baby burn. used for about 2 months and now I am looking for something better.</li>
            <li> This actualy makes a difference on long rides, especially those of 50+ miles in hot weather. It also soothes after a long ride.</li>
            <li> Best product ever for runners, highly recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the solid reviews.. This was because I normally chafe within a few hours of walking in warm weather and I had an upcoming  7 day vacation to Disney World which I knew would consist of 30+ miles of walking in warm weather. Normally I will just use gold bond which works for a few hours....then I can barely walk... I then put on Vaseline and hope the chafing is gone by morning, only to be disappointed.  I just arrived home from Orlando and To my surprise I went 7 full days with no chafing using this cream. There were 5 days with 12-14 hours of walking, sitting, standing, repeat. I cannot give enough praise to this product. It made my vacation enjoyable and will recommend it to everyone. Thank you for helping make my vacation enjoyable</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff by far the best I have found</li>
            <li> I bought this product for its anti-blister properties, as the last time I went to disneyland, after just one day, my feet were covered in them, and I had a trip coming up to DisneyWorld for 8 days. I used this everyday and just one mild one developed toward the end of the trip. Really worked great!</li>
            <li> So much better than Lanacane!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different brands and varieties of chamois cream for cycling.  Some work great, some are no better than lotion.  This stuff works great.  I&#x27;ve done some pretty long rides (&gt;100 miles) and some pretty vigorous/sweaty races using this stuff and at the end of the day, it&#x27;s still there, still protecting the giblets.  Here&#x27;s what you need to know - it doesn&#x27;t wear off even after 8+ hours in the saddle.  If I know I&#x27;m going to go more than that, I&#x27;ll re-apply somewhere in the middle, but that&#x27;s more for my peace of mind.  It doesn&#x27;t stain the chamois.  It *feels* somewhat greasy when applied, but it leaves no greasy residue.  I often ride into work and change to regular undies there.  There&#x27;s no staining or residue on them either.  Great stuff.    ------UPDATE------    Product review video is located here:  [...]</li>
            <li> Good one...would recommend</li>
            <li> I plan on bringing this on my next cruise.  I use it for spending the day walking on the beach.  In the past the salt and sand used to give a rash.  Even for my son who was in and out of the water.  We are fit but the contest rub of shorts or a bathing suit with the sale and sand became uncomfortable.  I live in Florida and have tried the product at the beach.  It works great has a metallic smell though.  Plan on buying a lot more in the future.  Wish they had a bigger size.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for running for inner thighs and chest, as I have had the unfortunate occurence of irritation and bloody nipples at mileages more than 6 miles, especially when cold or wet outside.  I&#x27;ve used Body Glide in the past, but it doesn&#x27;t work that well after 6-8 miles and can be a little harder to apply.  This product can be brought along on the run for quick re-application (I use a small black twist pod that I think my wife had for makeup) and it does not melt in high temperatures.  The tea tree oil scent is a little overwhelming but dissipates after a while and I think the addition of that helps to heal wounds that break through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to why I rated 5 stars and not 4 like I was originally thinking (since it still causes some irritation for me at least, but no product is perfect and everyone is different).  The owner of the company contacted me immediately for feedback and got the main company Blue Steel to answer my questions on a Sunday!  Great customer service if you ask me!!!</li>
            <li> A very different feel from the waxy sports lubricants and nice tea tree scent.  Used it for a marathon and worked great.</li>
            <li> This literally saved my butt a few times!  Ok, so Grandma and Grandpa start bicycling again. Grandma&#x27;s thighs are bigger than they used to be. Grandma is suffering after a few miles of biking. Grandma buys this anti-chafe cream and is happy again. It does not feel wet or &amp;#34;icky&amp;#34; while on.  It really lasted in hot, humid weather and I recommend it to anyone, old or young.</li>
            <li> Love the product for biking. Would no leave home without it. Has saved many century rides for me in the past, infact had I not had it I would not have completed a 6 day ride as it healed my sore but over night.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have used thus far in my years of bicycling!&lt;br /&gt;I am now a fervent user.&lt;br /&gt;//JSangster</li>
            <li> Excellent product, lasts longer than most other products, even has a good fragrance (tea tree - if you like it). White coloured cream that needs to be spread evenly after applying. Does not go away with a little sweat but can be easily washed off with soap and water.</li>
            <li> This cream didn&#x27;t work for me at all and it also has an odd smell. I was expecting something a bit more lubricating to protect sensitive areas from chafing. This cream is similar to hand lotion in that once you rub it in, it absorbs into your skin and doesn&#x27;t do much to protect it or keep it dry.</li>
            <li> The cream definitely helped relieve my chafing issues in the groin area when running. However, on my long runs during the summer (16-20 milers), I still ended up with some chafing by the end of the run, despite applying the cream very liberally. But I&#x27;d estimate that it made a 90% improvement, which is well worth it. As other reviewers noted, there is a definite tea tree oil smell with the cream, but it&#x27;s neither unpleasant nor too strong and dissipates quickly after application.</li>
            <li> A friend and fellow triathlete recommended Blue Steel as the best anti-chafe cream she&#x27;d ever used so I tried it - I couldn&#x27;t agree more! Plus, my wetsuit literally slides off in T1!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a year at every race or long run! I love the smell and it isn&#x27;t greasy. I like the fact that it is a cream instead of a stick because I can more easily apply it all over. I just used it for a marathon in very hot weather and didn&#x27;t chafe one bit! I carried some extra with me in case I needed to re-apply, but it wasn&#x27;t necessary. What I applied in the morning lasted all day. Amazing stuff, a must have for runners!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for almost a year and it works great.  Pretty much standard equipment in my gym bag now.  Tried a few other brands but none have given me the results that this cream has. It keeps my feet chafe free throughout my workout and run.</li>
            <li> I suffered from horrible rash for months in my inner thighs and it made any workout hell. I use this cream everyday now and I have had 0 issues.</li>
            <li> I have a very hot, active job and sometimes experience painful chafing from my pants rubbing around my waistband and bikini area.  This stuff has been wonderful.  It is a little more expensive than some of the other products that I have tried but this really does work.  It has made working in the heat a lot easier for me.</li>
            <li> Works great.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a travel kit upon recommendation. Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but am confident it will do the job.</li>
            <li> Seriously - Blue Steel Sports Anti-Chafe  Cream is the greatest. I do a lot of trail hiking in hot weather, and massaging a tiny bit of this cream into a couple of spots that chafe with regularity has allowed me to go for substantially longer hikes.</li>
            <li> I had a persistent problem between my legs that has always given me problems, especially after jogging. Other creams simply did nothing for me. This cream got the job done.</li>
            <li> I love how this helps keep my legs from chaffing when I run. I also had a problem with my arms rubbing on my sports bra causing it to &amp;#34;rug burn&amp;#34; and this cream keeps that from happening. I will order again once I get low on this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap but if you have the dollars to spare, worth it. I wear dresses and skirts exclusively, commute on foot often, and have thunderous thighs, so in warmer months when tights and leggings are out, his stuff is a lifesaver; I never liked using the deodorant trick. It lasts awhile, which offsets the cost.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  I am one of those people that has just enough extra weight that my thighs rub together when I walk.  When this happens over the course of super long distances in warmer weather, issues happen.  I used this product daily when walking 10+ miles a day in Europe with not a single day of chafing.  Use a pea sized amount and it should last a long time.  Expensive but worth it!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! I was a little sceptic at first, since I had used a sample packets on a few rides earlier this year.  I decided to try it any way  I&#x27;m sure glad I did, I&#x27;ve done two very strenuous rides 70 &amp; 154 milers this cream worked great I never had to reapply. I will be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> Purchased because I work out in the heat all day and would chafe and get sores on my inner thighs.  Have been using this and have had NO problems since.</li>
            <li> I love the way it performs during walking and exercising. I used body glide before and it just could not last long enough. If you have experienced chaffing before I recommend this cream for the best results ever.Thank you blue steel!</li>
