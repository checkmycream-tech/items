            <li>It&#x27;s been really effective in removing particles from between teeth.</li>
            <li>what kind of service in our own land.</li>

            <li>It is better to use dental floss because it works 100x more effectively and does not hurt!</li>

            <li>This combo of Oral B Floss Action and a compatible Oral B power handle (8 or 9 thousand series) is the best I have used.</li>
            <li>These are by far the best brushheads you can get it.</li>
            <li>My kids also use this product with great success.</li>
            <li>These are by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Floss Action heads are the best!</li>
            <li>It is easier to use and more effective.</li>
            <li>I will now purchase the drug store brand of these brushes which will be considerably more cost effective.</li>
            <li>By far, this is the best tooth cleaning system out there...</li>
            <li>good and cheap.</li>
            <li>Perfect replacement brushes, these floss action brushes do the job.</li>
            <li>Floss action bristles are the best of the lot in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>but it sure is nice to use.</li>
            <li>They give a real clean feeling like you&#x27;ve been to the dentist for a cleaning.</li>
            <li>When I popped these out of the packaging, I was thrilled to have authentic brush heads.</li>
            <li>Finding brand name replacement Floss Action brush heads at this price was great!</li>
            <li>This toothbrush head beautifully cleans and flosses, leaving teeth &amp; gums fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li>I like the Oral B products a lot they are great and good for their money, I have the Oral B tooth brush, so I got this to replace the heads when I need a new one, it arrive on time and</li>
            <li>awesome clean feeling and do not be scared of how they feel at first.</li>
            <li>beside the fact that they raised the prices than originally started, its still a good buy.</li>
            <li>The 3 pack brush heads are another attachment for the great Oral B toothbrush which does such as great job on our teeth.</li>
            <li>Good deal, but they have I think better prices at Costco for these though if you want to get a huge supply, just saying.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are so good for getting my teeth clean and at a lot lower price through this seller than anywhere else I have compared prices for them.</li>
            <li>Pretty great replacements.</li>
            <li>As for the brush I could not ask for better preformance,my teeth feel real clean after use</li>
            <li>works great, super easy to change out</li>
            <li>These are good replacement brush heads (I have an Oral-B Healthy Clean Precision 1000).  </li>
            <li>good product, arrived quickly, would recommend</li>
            <li>This arrived quickly and was a good price for the amount or brush heads.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bristles rubs against your teeth very nicely and it gives you the feeling as if you first leave the dentist&#x27;s office after a cleaning.</li>
            <li>They were new, in perfect condition, and a fantastic value.</li>
            <li>This particular brush head is the best I have ever used for getting my teeth and gums really clean.</li>
            <li>heads a try using the Oral B Vitality motor unit and thought the Floss Action heads weren&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Well you know what, most people are \\&quot;average\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Finally, This head feels the best.</li>
            <li>However, I got used to it quite fast, and it does a great job of keeping the flossing requirements to a minimum.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel cleaner and my mouth is more refreshed.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this head but ordered it anyway.  </li>
            <li>however more than than i think</li>
            <li>This is a top quality product.</li>
            <li>Better keep flossing and brushing separate.</li>
            <li>Fits and cleans my teeth much better than Braun Oral-B Extrasoft,   &lt;br /&gt;Flexisoft and Interspace Brushheads.</li>
            <li>The wife likes more compact models, as this takes up more counter space than some of the others, but the others do not brush as well and others do not have replaceable brushes.</li>
            <li>i have much more control.</li>
            <li>Works great, teeth look whiter and feel super clean.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush</li>
            <li>Love Oral B, but</li>
            <li>these seem to be more of a gimmick than anything else and my dental hygienist agrees.  </li>
            <li>This one is just OK.</li>
            <li>I like the thought that I might be getting a better cleaning between the teeth, which is an area of concern to my hygienist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many of them thru Amazon</li>
            <li>love the tooth brush too.. used several electric tooth brushes this one does best cleaning</li>
            <li>I was just reading through tons of 1 star reviews on these because many, many people have received fakes.</li>
            <li>I think this is the most effective of the brush heads offered by Oral B that fit my unit.  </li>
            <li>As proof even my dental checkups have been better.  </li>
            <li>But I think the results are much more than what I may get by just paying more attention.    </li>
            <li>I exclusively used these heads for a year, though my dentist was happy with the cleanliness of my teeth, he noticed much faster gum loss.  </li>
            <li>Our teeth are cleaner and in much better health.</li>
            <li>They work well, and I love the oral B toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>With 3 heads in a pack and the change the head with the change of season guidelines, I end up with too many surplus heads.  </li>
            <li>They acted more like bumpers than anything else.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works well at cleaning my teeth, and it is compatible with most Oral B brush motors.</li>
            <li>They do a dramatically better job of brushing between teeth and up along the gum line.</li>
            <li>Healthy gums &#x3D; healthy teeth</li>
            <li>P&amp;G.  P&amp;G reimbursed me by sending me a coupon for some authentic brush heads.    </li>
            <li>Fantastic!    </li>
            <li>Have purchased this before, love the quality and the price.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of this item and I am very happy with the product, price and service.</li>
            <li>Glad we did, though.</li>
            <li>but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite heads for my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I love these brush heads.  </li>
            <li>But wait, there&#x27;s more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Triumph system for about 3 months now and during my dentist visit he said my gums are notably tighter then before.      </li>
            <li>Under the price, where it says \\&quot;Sold By\\&quot; make sure that it says \\&quot;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com.\\</li>
            <li>and I get mush better results.</li>
            <li>really much better than the OralB they replaced in getting the plaque off the lower teeth.     </li>
            <li>: I have continued to purchase the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brush heads in a 3-pack on a subscription basis and am quite pleased with that product and with the subscription service.</li>
            <li>Check out the pictures with the notes at the top of the page, the brush heads amazon sent me</li>
            <li>The hygenist even commented that I must be flossing better, which I haven&#x27;t been at all.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product and the price.</li>
            <li>this was a christmas gift for my son and he love the idea of floss brushes so he doesn&#x27;t have to use the wax string</li>
            <li>We have a DD w/braces &amp; have been concerned about her not being able to floss as often as she could w/out them</li>
            <li>What more can I say?  </li>
            <li>But this site requires more words</li>
            <li>That said, many of the brushes sold here as Oral-B have been fakes.  </li>
            <li>I may continue ordering these here, but I&#x27;m still not 100% confident Amazon shut out the fakes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be glad to update this review in a couple months if these heads don&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li>The more I use these \\&quot;gimmick\\&quot; attachments the more</li>
            <li>but I assume it covers more area and gets in between teeth.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with product....</li>
            <li>Make sure you buy the ones made by Oral B.</li>
            <li>As they say, \\&quot;two heads are better than one\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;this company when need more.</li>
            <li>I never did 600 manual strokes, more like 100.</li>
            <li>The amazon price is a lot better than what you&#x27;ll find in the store, especially with the subscribe and save discount, so these were a great find!</li>
            <li>I should have known better when I received the package.</li>
            <li>I noticed the brush head wiggled alot more.</li>
            <li>I love my Oral-B toothbrush</li>
            <li>I had to wonder if these were even authentic Oral-B products.  </li>
            <li>I switched to these about 3 years ago and my dentist visits get better each time.  </li>
            <li>They keep the gums healthy too.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love these flossing heads.  </li>
            <li>I love my Oral B.  </li>
            <li>, my husband asked me to get more so he can use them too.</li>
            <li>They do the job and more.  </li>
            <li>You are better off with these.</li>
            <li>Nothing more to say but, buy them.  </li>
            <li>I love it....</li>
            <li>SO MANY DO.</li>
            <li>I have purchased before and am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>but these are much better.</li>
            <li>Does an excellent job and will never go back to manual brushing again.  </li>
            <li>Those are easily my favorite replacement for my electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My favorite brush heads.</li>
            <li>6/13 just went to the dentist and without mentioning anything the hygienist said I appeared to be brushing better.  </li>
            <li>The floss action heads are incredible.</li>
            <li>I wish I should have bought more as the price has increased.</li>
            <li>Getting three heads at a time means I will probably replace the head as scheduled and not continue to use it after it has mostly worn out.  </li>
            <li>Love these brushes.</li>
            <li>Feels a lot more substantial than the std brush heads.</li>
            <li>I would buy more if my needs require it.</li>
            <li>but I do think (having used both kinds) that this brush reaches every part of the tooth better.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I needed more and they get the job done.  </li>
            <li>I am perfectly satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes.</li>
            <li>They fit the handle I own.  </li>
            <li>better than warehouse price.  </li>
            <li>They cost more but they work well.  </li>
            <li>My hubby and I love this.</li>
            <li>I think these brushes are a bit more thorough in the brushing process.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re way better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My gums and teeth appear to be in better shape.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?  </li>
            <li>Oral B is just better.</li>
            <li>The top of the brush head sticks</li>
            <li>100 times better than the default brush I got with mine.</li>
            <li>Make sure to check what you receive before opening your package of heads to use them.</li>
            <li>This 3 pack was a lot more pricier than the 5 pack I had purchased a year ago.</li>
            <li>Ok, frankly it is probably more having to do with the fact that i started brushing more, started brushing for 2 minutes with an electric vs. 30 seconds with a handheld, started a vigorous prescription mouthwash treatment, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are more oval shaped than the brush head that came with my tooth brush, but that&#x27;s not noticeable in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>These brush heads really make your teeth and the spaces between feel great.  </li>
            <li>Glad that Amazon carries them.</li>
            <li>I would still recommend them since Oral-B is at the top, but I wish they would lower the price a bit.</li>
            <li>Love this product and works like a charm.  </li>
            <li>My favorite replacement brushes for my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The price is way better than in stores and Amazon had a discount coupon making the deal even better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought these brush heads online before from a different seller and it went perfectly.  </li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll save an additional 15% and receive free shipping!  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Braces are obviously more of a challenge than I thought.</li>
            <li>I love them and my daughter loves them.</li>
            <li>The best thing about this toothbrush is that daily use of it shortens the time in the dentist chair.  </li>
            <li>is easier and better than just brushing myself.</li>
            <li>Used to be able to get these for about $3/head.</li>
            <li>Love This head the take away the all the plaque from your teeth</li>
            <li>These are much better.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad they are priced better here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I was not 100% sure whether it will</li>
            <li>These were reasonably priced and worked great.</li>
            <li>Awesome for the gums, you will need standard brush as well.</li>
            <li>Love these brush heads.  </li>
            <li>I love them...</li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>love this package of 3</li>
            <li>Love these flossing is easier.</li>
            <li>Better cleaning going on for sure.</li>
            <li>This product is well made and on top of that</li>
            <li>I love the way this product feels on my gums and it does the job that I purchased it for.  </li>
            <li>It is a toothbrush; what more can I say?</li>
            <li>Give them to Congress and Republicans and Democrats will work together with mutual respect to better our nation.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with this</li>
            <li>Love the price, would purchase again.</li>
            <li>I think it is much better than the non-electric manual flosser.</li>
            <li>The tooth brush with this head is doing most of it.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.  </li>
            <li>and I love them</li>
            <li>They just seem to lose the toothpaste easier more than anything.</li>
            <li>However I did notice a $5 off coupon which would put the price cheaper than S&amp;S.  Overall very happy with this</li>
            <li>My favorite dental cleaness.</li>
            <li>We all love praise from our dental hygienist, don&#x27;t we?</li>
            <li>Love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Love the toothbrush and these brush heads.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>Love the thorough cleaning I get with this brush</li>
            <li>I have had them before and was glad to find them again.....</li>
            <li>I love these heads.  </li>
            <li>Glad I took the chance on this product.  </li>
            <li>will purchase more as neeed.  </li>
            <li>and i love this things ..</li>
            <li>will and have purchase more heads ..</li>
            <li>These toothbrush heads are my favorite.</li>
            <li>better than paying more elsewhere...</li>
            <li>when I started using these I started bleeding - which makes me think that these bristles are getting below my gum line better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that it did any better at cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It is not a substitute for floss, however and I&#x27;m still able to get visible amounts of gunk from between my teeth after brushing.</li>
            <li>I was glad for the warning and pictures to check to make sure that the problem had been solved.  </li>
            <li>but i have purchased these more than once and have always received authentic toothbrush heads at a fraction of the drug store price.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Oral B brush for years and was very happy with the Oral B Pro White Head</li>
            <li>I bought these to go with the toothbrush I purchased which I love.  </li>
            <li>Have been using these for over 2 years and my teeth look visibly better and gets the food particles from the gaps.</li>
            <li>Much better than those cheaper copies.</li>
            <li>most stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used these brush heads for many years.</li>
            <li>Need to get some more</li>
            <li>I love the most</li>
            <li>more do you need?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>was amazed how much better my teeth were.  </li>
            <li>They do a better job of cleaning for me, penetrating deeper into the teeth gaps and gum layer.  </li>
            <li>Finally, This head feels the best.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite heads.  </li>
            <li>I plan on buying more, these seem to be my favorite</li>
            <li>Love this, have bought many times, cleans your teeth like a pro.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Feels like it does a better job than the toothbrush head that came with toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The 3 count replacement heads are more than $7 each.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;re doing a lot better on dental health with the Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an Oral-B toothbrush for years, and this is my favorite brush head.  </li>
            <li>I love these brush heads.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the product quality.</li>
            <li>I thought of sanitising the toothbrush by dipping in boiling water, or hydrogen peroxide or alcohol or using a UV or ultrasonic cleaner and called up the 1800 number on the website to check if this is a safe method.</li>
            <li>I have used my Oral B electric toothbrush for more than 10 years.  </li>
            <li>they did not appear to be authentic Oral-B product with no response.  </li>
            <li>Ok, the tooth brush heads are great and hold up very well even beyond the 3 month recommended changing cycle by dentists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much more efficient than hand brushing.</li>
            <li>Glad they come</li>
            <li>These are my favorite.  </li>
            <li>they fit my oral b professional toothbrush perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Always need more brushes.  </li>
            <li>I love these toothbrush heads for my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Makes it easier to reach all sides of teeth and it fit the Oral B toothbrush I own.</li>
            <li>Always love Oral B products</li>
            <li>Better check it out before commit to this offer.</li>
            <li>what more can I say except they do the job</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>However, I was able to find the product cheaper at Sam&#x27;s Club</li>
            <li>These are the real McCoy, works great, and the Dentist even thinks I floss.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use these on a daily basis, and they are awesome!</li>
            <li>Much better than ones that came with machine</li>
            <li>heartily recommend this for those people who have the appropriate Oral-B / Braun electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>The floss head works better than the stock all bristle head for the oral-B electric toothbrush (in my experience).</li>
            <li>I think they do the best job of cleaning teeth properly.</li>
            <li>but these are my favorite.</li>
            <li>Just make sure they have floss thing in the brush</li>

            <li>The floss action is not that great.</li>
            <li>floss action is a great brush head.  </li>

            <li>AND HE SAID THEY LOOKED FINE</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>The one I received fits my toothbrush just fine, so it turned out to not be a problem.</li>

            <li>Bottom line is, the brush heads I have purchased from Amazon work fine, appear to be identical to those that came with the toothbrush, and perform just as did those that came with the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and it still works fine.</li>
            <li>and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>but hey it works just fine.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>These brush heads are fine.  </li>

            <li>after I got there, even with the coupon, Amazon was MUCH lower in price, so I&#x27;m glad I checked!</li>
            <li>answer.&lt;br /&gt;I did buy new brush heads directly from Amazon and they are perfect.</li>
            <li>I had originally used the dual brush head that came with my Oral-B electric toothbrush and liked it very much.</li>
            <li>but if the budget is tight this will be the best choice.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, they are long-lasting, and fit my Oral-B electric toothbrush just fine.</li>
            <li>They fit the toothbrush and work just fine.</li>
            <li>Good bristles that last awhile and easy to apply to mostly any toothbrush head.</li>
            <li>But, Oral-B&#x27;s products quality is very good and all works as expected</li>
            <li>The refills slip on easily and fit just like the original.</li>
            <li>As others have said, research where you buy them because there is a HUGE counterfeit market for these.</li>
            <li>These floss actions bush heads have made a huge difference with my teeth cleaning.  </li>
            <li>THAT WAS HUGE TO ME</li>
            <li>To order from your chart is accurate.  </li>
            <li>Amazon will knock another 15% off plus give free shipping without having to hit the $25 mark.  </li>
            <li>After reading the comments after I had ordered, I was alarmed at the counterfeit market and hoping that I would receive genuine brush heads and not have to return some knock offs.</li>
            <li>These brushes fit my Oral B electric tooth cleaner.  </li>
            <li>All of the brush heads that I have received from Amazon have been genuine Oral-B products.</li>
            <li>great electronic toothbrush, will never go back</li>
            <li>I feel my teeth so smooth and polished after brushing.</li>
            <li>You can find brush heads that fit Oral-B&#x27;s fantastic line of electric toothbrushes cheaper on this website.</li>
            <li>I suggest that you buy these instead, as they&#x27;re the real-deal, Oral-B/Braun produced brush heads that will fit your toothbrush, do what they&#x27;re supposed to do, and won&#x27;t fall apart on you.</li>
            <li>It does do a great brushing and floss at the same time.</li>
            <li>I am not talented/coordinated enough to use floss and this head does a great job getting at bits of food, etc, that might be between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I checked and these appear to be the genuine Oral B.</li>
            <li>These replacements also have the gray, but pass the genuine test.    </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had ours for over ten years now and it still works great.</li>
            <li>Get the genuine item.    </li>
            <li>From what I can tell by inspecting them they appear to be genuine - there is no dye bleed, they have two rings, serial numbers are there, etc.  </li>
            <li>in all, I got 3 of these heads pretty cheap, and they were a pretty good deal, but they may not be for everyone.</li>
            <li>The brush head falls off the handle instead of snapping on like the genuine ones do.</li>
            <li>Received brush heads yesterday and they appear genuine.</li>
            <li>They size of the head is comfortable, compared to the others on the market.</li>
            <li>This is a very reliable effective product.  </li>

            <li>Your teeth feel as smooth as the day you get them cleaned by the dental hygienist!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So i compared it to a genuine one from walmart, and noticed some differences.  </li>
            <li>and I find it so comfortable.</li>
            <li>so I received free shipping.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price to have healthy gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>Avoid the cheap knockoffs.</li>
            <li>FOR THE 1ST TIME, I ACTUALLY ENJOY BRUSHING MY TEETH AND WITH THIS BRUSH, MY CARPAL TUNNEL DOESN&#x27;T BOTHER ME DURING OR AFTER BRUSHING MY TEETH</li>
            <li>I rarely give out 5-star ratings and with that being said, I am satisfied with these replacement heads.</li>
            <li>I am thankful these are available on line.</li>
            <li>Such a great price for overpriced replacement brush heads, I could not pass this up.</li>
            <li>The brush heads I received were definitely genuine Oral B heads.  </li>
            <li>Cheap made.</li>
            <li>They cost more than the &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; cheaper brushes, but they&#x27;re worth the money.</li>
            <li>As a retired surgeon I know how important that is.</li>

            <li>XD Thanks Corona for your amazing beer.</li>
            <li>Great brushes, It took me a while to get used to the smaller brush.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use because it didn&#x27;t fit with my machine.</li>
            <li>Genuine replacements for Oral-B Triumph toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I use this with my deep-cleaning setting on my toothbrush, and it does a great job of cleaning out plaque, and even seems to keep my teeth sparkling white even longer.</li>
            <li>I received genuine Braun brush heads that pass all of the counterfeit tests.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will note, my package was shipped from and sold by Amazon and I received genuine brush heads.</li>
            <li>Feels comfortable on your teeth.  </li>
            <li>They fit on my electric toothbrush and get to cleaning.</li>
            <li>They are somewhat pricey for a cheap guy like me</li>
            <li>two minutes twice daily greatly reduces the Godaweful misery of the biannual dental cleansing ritual.</li>
            <li>This is genuine product which was shipped and sold by Amazon.</li>
            <li>I received the genuine heads not like some people were getting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;they work great and last longer than what box states.</li>
            <li>Wish the dentist would give these away free after a visit.  </li>
            <li>enjoy brushing teeth with it.</li>
            <li>Well made product, fit and finish, works as described...</li>
            <li>To my mind, they are a tad pricey, but I would never go for the cheap ones again.</li>
            <li>It goes without saying that it is essential to get an Brush Head Replacement pack, as the Brush itself is great.</li>
            <li>Wont fit Oral B Pulsonic.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both use these toothbrush heads and since I had a free trial of Amazon Prime I wound up purchasing these.  </li>
            <li>Great product, cheaper then the local drug store.</li>
            <li>I bought mine &amp;#34;ships from Amazon.com&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s definitely genuine, made in Germany.</li>
            <li>The round brush heads are the best!!!</li>
            <li>I think their complaints were looked into by Amazon because the ones I received were genuine.  </li>
            <li>This is important to me because if the toothbrush breaks and I end up buying a non-Oral B toothbrush, I don&#x27;t have to worry about ending up with refill brush heads that I won&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li>I purchased Oral B Floss action 3 pack head refill thru Amazon, and was delighted with the care and delivery taken by them.</li>
            <li>It is a bit larger than the brush that came with my precision 1000 model toothbrush, it holds a bit more toothpaste &amp; does a superior job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>I tried them all, and this seems to be the most comfortable, and most gentle on the gum.</li>
            <li>The regular replacement brush is good but this is much better.</li>
            <li>I saw the floss action brush head and read a lot of good reviews.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Good replacement brushes for my old Oral-B.</li>
            <li>I also like the Oral B pro white brush heads, but feel these are superior for cleaning since they get between the teeth better and have stronger bristles for plaque removal.</li>
            <li>These are good cause they are soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Timer setting is very useful; great feature for kids to ensure proper cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other types of toothbrushes, but these really work best.</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t, look over on the right side of the page where it says, \\&quot;More Buying Choices,\\&quot; and see if you can find one that says Amazon.</li>
            <li>Right after I ordered this product at Amazon, I found a better deal at Costco; that is why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li>These heads clean just fine</li>
            <li>Electric toothbrushes really do provide a better and more efficient clean.</li>
            <li>Oral B Action 3 pack brush head refill are as good as the original ones that come with the machine</li>
            <li>These brush heads last longer than the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; brush head that comes with the Oral-B electric toothbrushes -- and longer-lasting means greater value !!</li>
            <li>For me, this is a very powerful whitening brush.    </li>
            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>fortunately I get the original refill</li>
            <li>It brushes better then the normal circle head brushes that comes with most Oral-B eletric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Oral-B is better then the normal circle head brushes that comes with most Oral-B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend is also starting to love this type and we need to order more often through the subcribe and save option here at Amazon that can save you more money + free shipping every 3 months, or 6 months.</li>
            <li>The Oral B Professional Floss Action replacement brushes are always my favorite, Still have to use floss, but they really work the best for my sonic tooth brush.</li>
            <li>so I am glad to still be able to buy new heads for it.  </li>
            <li>I went in for a cleaning and my hygienist was impressed, particularly since I&#x27;m now pregnant and pregnant women generally have problems with bleeding gums.  </li>
            <li>The new one seems to be able to clean your teeth much much much more efficiently, don&#x27;t skimp out on it.</li>
            <li>I prefer the original, this product, to the &amp;#34;compatible&amp;#34; ones.</li>
            <li>Was pleased with the price and they were exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>You can tell by the unique oscillating rotations that this is a brush with unique features.</li>
            <li>These brushes are identical to the ones packaged with the original Triumph Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>, permanent logo  THANKS AMAZON!  &#x3D; )</li>
            <li>It may be because its my first electric toothbrush and I pay more attention to my brushing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with my Oral B Floss Action 3.</li>
            <li>No difference from the original heads that came with the brush.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t click like the original one.</li>
            <li>As they say....an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure!  </li>
            <li>But they did have these, and at a significantly lower price compared to the Flexisofts, so I decided to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price (with coupon and subscription) is just a fraction what you would pay at retail store and the product is authentic, NOT Fake (</li>
            <li>When I used the original ones and the ones from P&amp;G store, it did not occur.</li>
            <li>My original toothbrush head came with oral B 1000.</li>
            <li>Original brushes never broke off.  </li>
            <li>Replacements came promptly, in original packaging.</li>

            <li>I just had my first checkup since I started wearing braces about 7 months ago and my dental hygienist said I needed to floss and brush more.</li>

            <li>Works as well as the original.</li>

            <li>The original head that came with the brush was wearing out</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t use it yet, but it looks like the original one that come with the Triomph toothbrush.</li>

            <li>They make your teeth feel almost as clean as if you&#x27;ve just come from the dentist.</li>
            <li>Package arrived quickly and secure.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean for hours.</li>
            <li>Before I tried the Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count), I thought I had clean teeth.</li>
            <li>As I gave it to him, I looked up and flashed him one of those Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count) clean smiles.</li>

            <li>In fact, I have been getting clean bills of health on my dental visits since switching to an electric toothbrush that uses these heads.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the precision clean and dual clean heads.</li>
            <li>Have been using for years and the dentist always comments about how clean my mouth is.</li>
            <li>but they clean my teeth well.</li>

            <li>I bought these for my 12 year old Oral B handle and all I can say is &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34;  The rubber paddles really do swat stuff out from between your teeth and the varied bristles do a great job.  </li>
            <li>They interchange for the type of clean you want.  </li>
            <li>teeth never felt so clean as they do using these heads.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Teeth feel clean after using it.  </li>

            <li>My mouth feels so clean</li>
            <li>These make me drool, I prefer the Precision Clean heads.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that my mouth feels clean after using it.</li>
            <li>It makes my teeth feel extremely clean.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist suggests that I switch to the Phillips electric brushes, though; she says that the round heads of the Oral-Bs generally do a good job, but aren&#x27;t as effective at removing plaque between the teeth.</li>
            <li>They are complementary, the Oral-B cleans better, the Sonicare is more gentle and still cleans pretty well.</li>
            <li>Really cleans teeth well and was a pretty good price to be delivered right to my door.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t fault these replacement heads they work very well indeed, the design has chaged from the original and this has in my opinion made them much better at cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li>These just work, they aren&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li>I love my Oral B toothbrush and this certainly cleans well.</li>
            <li>,I like this way of dealing specially online.</li>
            <li>What else could one want when it comes to manifesting happiness and clean teeth at the same time?</li>
            <li>The brush head is not as gentle and doesn&#x27;t appear to clean any better.</li>
            <li>These are our favorite of the brush heads, really gets into the grooves and makes out teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>I love these toothbrush heads because they really make your teeth feel squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>The floss action brush heads are the best for a person of decent to normal oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>I have used this kind of brushheads for years and the first 2 days I used my new  brushheads that I used ordered worked fine.</li>
            <li>These floss action brushes are amazing.</li>
            <li>Product was as expected and the convenience of purchasing on line helps a great deal.  </li>
            <li>Not really much else to say about brush heads lol</li>
            <li>At my last appointment my dentist was actually impressed with my apparent flossing skills.</li>
            <li>Great product, performs as expected.</li>
            <li>Feels good, but I think the regular brushes kept my mouth cleaner.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are so much cleaner and in much better shape since I started using these brush heads.  </li>
            <li>I love online shopping, they make my life so much easier.</li>
            <li>Ignore the \\&quot;floss\\&quot; part - that&#x27;s just marketing hype and you better still use a real dental floss.</li>
            <li>I reccomend these to others who need more gentle brushes.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 6 months now and find its&#x27; use very utilitarian and enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>I brush for a full 2 minutes (30 seconds as quadrant)and</li>
            <li>They show pictures of the true oral b tooth brush heads compared to the \\&quot;look alikes\\&quot; that are sold to unknowing customers like me.</li>
            <li>sure before you buy toothbrush heads to compare their product to the real thing, they may be selling a look alike.</li>
            <li>Got a good price on these and bought them instead of the &#x27;standard&#x27; brush heads.</li>
            <li>I have a mouth full of crowns and bridges (permanent)</li>
            <li>My teeth feel super clean after every brushing.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using these for several years; and, if you brush in the morning and before you go to bed and most importantly, FLOSS, that will avoid most dental problems.</li>
            <li>but these heads are different, in a good way</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terribly painful or anything</li>
            <li>Overall, good purchase.</li>
            <li>I ordered four 3 packs of these brushes because they were such a good deal.</li>
            <li>But overall it is good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product to daily clean.&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>decided to go with these official brush heads sold by Oral-B on Amazon because I have heard of too many horror stories of people buying knock-off brands that have been very disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good value - use daily</li>
            <li>good to buy this thing with such a price</li>
            <li>so you brush your teeth for the full recommended time.</li>
            <li>good to have a pack so you can replace brush on regular basis.</li>
            <li>Price seems good enough to try again.</li>
            <li>These work really well minimizing plaque buildup, cleaning gum pockets and keeping gums healthy etc.  </li>
            <li>I use because my teeth are in such good shape.</li>
            <li>These are good but they don&#x27;t last even 1 month</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>Not bad 3 heads for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>got extra 3 flossy action very nicely bundled with healthy clean brush head.</li>
            <li>Well, I was greatly dismayed to find that the brushes shipped to me did not fit my Oral B toothbrush so my advice to buyers is, BE SURE these are the right brushes for your Oral B.  </li>
            <li>First and foremost, you have to make sure you&#x27;re getting the right brush that you want/need.  </li>
            <li>amazon has made it super easy by allowing automatic re order at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The OE brand are much better, provide a better, deeper clean feeling than the generic brand heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazon offered these at a great price, only concern was that they were fake, got it in today and confirmed they were real, good luck to everyone else!</li>
            <li>They clean more aggressively than the normal ones.  </li>
            <li>: I choose this product for the affordability and flexibility and comfortable to use vice flossing and it is working just fine since I do not have to floss as much</li>
            <li>i was told there just wasnt any real work for the hygenist to do, my teeth were very clean.  </li>
            <li>I cannot compare them to other Oral-B brushes but they worked great for me!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great value for a fraction of the price of other electric toothbrushes and their replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>Great product that is extremely overpriced</li>
            <li>I decided to get the floss action replacement heads as opposed to the normal bristle heads to try them out and see if I liked them better.</li>
            <li>Yes the Oral B tooth brushes are quite unique, they do really leave my teeth feeling smooth and clean</li>
            <li>(Perhaps the price of the real ones is worth that alone!!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different heads including the Oral B Duel Clean; however, I find the Floss Action brush head really works best.  </li>
            <li>These are just fine for the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Triumph brush with the floss heads clean your teeth and massage your gums so much more thoroughly and efficiently than regular brushing, it really is quite amazing.</li>
            <li>They leave my teeth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush and have had comments by my dentist about just how immaculate my teeth remain, so I will definitely be purchasing more brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>The yellow rubber bits gives these heads a hardness that I love and I feel like it cleans my teeth better.</li>
            <li>Super quality.  </li>
            <li>Plaque seems to lessen with use although I am quick in its application.</li>
            <li>and it was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re much better than the regular brush head, which I was always satisfied with.</li>
            <li>For people with a nice, wide mouth and no gum problems, maybe these are OK.</li>
            <li>I love being able to solve a problem quickly and simply.</li>
            <li>, I think I found a simple winning combination for healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Also, it is much better to purchase there here, as they cost over $10 dollars more locally.</li>
            <li>knock-offs fall apart quickly.</li>
            <li>I find that the Oral-B replacement brush heads work better than the generic replacement brush heads that I have been able to buy.</li>
            <li>I love this particular Brush Head.  </li>
            <li>Both are good products and both are getting better every time I wear out one of the units and need to replace it, every few years when it won&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and somewhat of a discount price.</li>
            <li>they ship quickly and i can subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>The variety of bristle strengths and lengths lets it do a super job.</li>
            <li>Best to order extra replacement heads when ordering electric toothbrushes since they should be replaced regularly.</li>
            <li>Fits my oral B. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Quick way to replenish my brush heads.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was ordering more of the same but didn&#x27;t enlarge the picture for a better look.</li>
            <li>The floss action is great for getting a professional cleaning feel at home.</li>
            <li>The genuine item is great: bristles aren&#x27;t harsh, even on very first use.</li>
            <li>No other brand cleans as effectively.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them as a better alternative for your Oral B brush.  </li>
            <li>but sure does a better job than normal toothbrush, also better than regular or &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; brush heads.</li>
            <li>Well, your rechargeable toothbrush is only as good as it&#x27;s brush head, right?</li>
            <li>I was hoping for an even better clean than these standard heads because they certainly look more significant and if I can get close to flossing performance with this type of brush head</li>
            <li>Easy to use, brush is gentle, fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied and will replace these with same again.</li>
            <li>I like it very much!</li>
            <li>more concerned because I have been flossing and brushing more apparently to no avail.</li>
            <li>Make sure you floss normally though - it is not a substitute, just as they have indicated.</li>
            <li>can get for pretty cheap with coupons and subscribe and save</li>
            <li>very first brush head used and it feels almost like after a cleaning from the dentist.</li>
            <li>Do&#x27;t bother buying these the normal ones work better and dont make you feel like your gums have been damaged</li>
            <li>They came quickly and in great comdition, as is typical of Amazon purchases.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the floss action heads for 2 years and my teeth feel clean and refreshing every time.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m sure glad of your return policy, i finally got the right thing.  </li>
            <li>It may be that the \\&quot;paddles\\&quot; do get between teeth more effectively than the regular bristles, but only your dentist would be able to tell.</li>
            <li>I have also used the polishing ones and the floss action ones are way better as far as cleaning between your teeth and getting that nice fresh feeling everytime.</li>
            <li>Hard to tell which exact brush head works the best,</li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t used the newest set yet, but I am confident they are also genuine because they look identical to the last set of heads, which looked identical to the original heads that came with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>In addition, these Floss Action heads are far superior to the original brush heads.  </li>
            <li>I love my new OralB electric toothbrush replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li>You can select Amazon as the vendor on the right hand-side under More Buying Choicess if it is not already listed as the seller in the main section.  </li>
            <li>This is a joy to use and you will spend less time with your dentist if you use this unit.</li>
            <li>These are great and $10 less than even WalMart.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these for a year and a half, and am happy with the brushing experience.  </li>
            <li>, i will notify amazon and i am sure they will help like always, i will still love Amazon as long as they fix their mistakes.</li>
            <li>I would say but will be able to tell in long term if this one does any magic.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with my Oral-B electric toothbrush, and the floss action brushes really do loosen what might be stuck between your teeth.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty confident that this is the real one.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what the seller posted and claims - authentic and all, I just didn&#x27;t like them as much as the polishing ones.  </li>
            <li>this brush is more superior than the other models of brush especially when it is used on the latest Oral Triumph electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>This is the exact brush head that came with the original.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon !!</li>
            <li>order again when needed.&lt;br /&gt;Having to add an exact amount of words is a nuisance!</li>
            <li>first class transaction all the way!</li>
            <li>The wife and I both enjoy the new &amp;#34;Floss Action&amp;#34; design and the way the brush head feels comfortable in the mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had purchased other refill heads before, but these seemed to amp up the performance - left my mouth feeling really clean, a great buy!</li>
            <li>I had come from a Sonicare (battery model) and it was very comfortable in comparison to the Floss Action.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique design does, indeed, give it the superior cleaning action that the packaging says it does, and it cleans my teeth better than other toothbrush heads do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cleans very well, allows the head unit to be used by more than one person, and times your brushing to 2 minutes for the most effective time without excessive abrasion.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are very good at removing plaque in hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>After use this brush my teeth is so clean during whole day even after lunch!</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean for the first time ever with my Oral-B.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These also do seem to do a better job of getting between your teeth clean, and in general getting the majority of your teeth</li>
            <li>I truly appreciated the free shipping.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are longer lasting and more effective than the soft bristle brushes.</li>
            <li>I have been using these brush heads for a few years now and they are great.  </li>
            <li>They work great but took a few days for the guns to adjust.</li>
            <li>Came fast and free with Prime.  </li>
            <li>The Floss Action heads are effective and comfortable, even when my teeth are feeling sensitive.</li>
            <li>but after a few uses, really great.  </li>
            <li>As expected, great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Much better than the old manual tooth brushes I used as a kid.  </li>
            <li>, won&#x27;t try that again, generics are ok sometimes, but in this case there was a big difference from the genuine article.</li>
            <li>if so figure that it&#x27;s more likely to be genuine.</li>
            <li>And my old SoniCare was better yet</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know what the big deal is with these electrics.</li>
            <li>and I love the flossing action that I get from using it.  </li>
            <li>I have used these floss action brush heads for many years now.</li>
            <li>Each brush head is individually wrapped and contains its own color ring for those who share brush heads.</li>
            <li>More massage action</li>
            <li>The price of toothbrushes for oral B is out of sight,I was glad to see that amazon.com offers them at a lower price.</li>
            <li>In this case, the brand name is worth the 3X price.</li>
            <li>I had used the Oral B toothbrush for a long time and was very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Your bristles can look like that: pert, svelt, compact, in distinct bundles.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, they are a health hazard: the bristles are not molded with rounded tips, but are coarsely square cut ...</li>
            <li>The brush dosent even make the same noise as it does with a genuine head, it sounds more rattly.</li>
            <li>It took some time to get use to, but well worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Oral B Floss Action brushes for years, and have been extremely satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>yet invariably when I &#x27;smile&#x27; after I finish there is still stuff in between my teeth..  </li>
            <li>As of all Oral-B, worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li>It was worth trying</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what most people&#x27;s reviews on these floss action heads are so upset about cause</li>
            <li>but I like to change my brush head more frequently.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that any off-brand of the toothbrush heads just aren&#x27;t as good; either too soft, or don&#x27;t fit properly.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t own an electric toothbrush my entire life until now</li>
            <li>My dentist/hygienist are going to be thrilled at my next visit.</li>
            <li>As far as the refills, this price was much better than anything I saw at retail.</li>
            <li>You may find these work better for you, but I would not be surprised if they don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Despite others claiming they fit, they most definitely did not.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are my favorite so far.   </li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>They are well worth the price.</li>
            <li>health.and your own internal body health.</li>
            <li>Really glad I saved my old brush head.</li>
            <li>Love the floss action brushes.</li>
            <li>They work even better than the brush heads for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Which is great because I only ever buy the floss action brush</li>
            <li>Great double action.  </li>
            <li>It is an investment, but the benefits are worth it.</li>
            <li>is worth</li>
            <li>buying！I will continue to buy next time！a nice shopping！</li>
            <li>these are good and i received these on time when i need chang old oral B floss action brush head ............</li>
            <li>I do not think it is worth an on line order.  </li>
            <li>It has different settings for the kind of brushing you want.</li>
            <li>I feel more comfortable flossing just the deep areas between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>These replacement brushes are a nice way of having an array of brush heads to try out to see which type you personally prefer for your Oral-B Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Worth far more than we pay.</li>
            <li>Economically priced and hardy instrument.</li>
            <li>The floss action is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Just my preference, I like the old style better.  </li>
            <li>and I rarely get cavities now.</li>
            <li>It also makes your gums feel invigorated and fresh.</li>
            <li>My brush had been going strong for 4 years now so finding heads at a decent price was a must.</li>
            <li>This is a great product because the heads wear out long before the unit and it is like buying three new tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>and I would certainly recommend them over the original brushes.</li>
            <li>Some of the older reviews had me worried that there would be an issue, but they work just fine.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery was appreciated!</li>
            <li>These are my favorite style and they make my teeth feel extra clean.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these as a replacement head for the standard Precision Clean heads that come with many Oral-B toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>and they really leave my mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>This made my mouth felt much more cleaner than the standard precision clean.  </li>
            <li>and I think they clean much better than the standard head.</li>
            <li>I am pretty satisfied with the product, though cant feel a huge difference between the standard brush that it came with and</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say about these because they are the original product.</li>
            <li>2 rings, right bristle colors</li>
            <li>Upon receipt I noticed something didn&#x27;t look right.  </li>
            <li>- they snapped on right away and stay on when the brush is turned on.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s all right after I got used to it</li>
            <li>Will purchase from Amazon again as the price is right.</li>
            <li>My \\&quot;new\\&quot; toothbrush heads did not feel right (used for about a week)</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t cancel an order you have already placed and try to reorder right away thinking the coupon will be there for you.  </li>
            <li>right there</li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>I was worry if it is geneuin, but it is right from the manufacture.  </li>
            <li>The price was right with a coupon</li>
            <li>Great clean - no more problems with tea and coffee!</li>
            <li>It leaves my teeth really clean and my daughter claims that it makes her teeth much cleaner despite the braces.</li>
            <li>They seem to clean really well.</li>
            <li>They clean my teeth very thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>A MUST HAVE for anyone who wants teeth which are &#x27;dentist clean.&#x27;</li>
            <li>They fit multiple Oral-B&#x27;s well and seem to clean our teeth better than the normal brush heads.</li>
            <li>Really helps to keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>I had been using the off-brand cheap heads for years, but got these because of the high score.</li>
            <li>Makes teeth cleaning more enjoyable and less of a chore.  </li>
            <li>Some of the Third Party Vendors are quite good, but I don&#x27;t think they are carefully monitored so, when in doubt, stick with Mother Amazon.on the right side of the page where it says, \\&quot;More Buying Choices,\\&quot; and see if you can find one that says Amazon.</li>
            <li>They seem like they don&#x27;t clean as well as the normal head...and they hurt!</li>
            <li>The flossy bits are very effective, but pretty harsh.  </li>
            <li>I tried the floss brush and happily noticed that after my dental cleaning the usual staining of my teeth that happens over time never happened.</li>
            <li>Buy this filter once a year for our refrigerator....works great, beats hundreds  of bottles of water which is no better.....</li>
            <li>Great - last longer than the regular ones so well worth the money</li>
            <li>Not sure what else i can say but the oral b is a great product.  </li>
            <li>The cost of these things is like printer ink, not a bad price for the whole package</li>
            <li>Gets my teeth very clean, more so than any other brush in the Oral-B line up (and I&#x27;ve tried every one!).</li>
            <li>I inspected the original and this new one and they are alike, so there must be a product quality control problem, as the new one falls off quite easily.</li>
            <li>I have had others that don&#x27;t fit well or do not vibrate well or wear down more quickly.</li>
            <li>Oral-B is moving on with new design &amp; these won&#x27;t be available any longer.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brush heads over time: the Oral-B Floss Action, Oral-B Dual Clean, Oral-B Precision Clean, and Oral-B Pro White.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They clean very well, seemingly better than the smaller brush heads.</li>
            <li>Heads work great with the Oral B electric toothbrush but for regular use only.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve previously used the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; heads but these ones are good.  </li>
            <li>Fits nicely in the Oral-B Professional Floss Action.</li>
            <li>I have used the Oral-B toothbrush for many years, and I really like the Floss Action Replacement Brush Heads.  </li>
            <li>These are the only ones the actually work and they do a great job..</li>
            <li>Kind of strange when you first use it</li>
            <li>Bristles are falling out much too quickly.  </li>
            <li>Amazed to find replacement brush for my old Oral-B so easy.</li>
            <li>I love Oral-B toothbrushes and most brush heads, however, these seem too harsh for ANY teeth.</li>
            <li>These brushes are super; my husband and I both really like them.  </li>
            <li>I have lingual braces, so oral hygiene is not only super important, but it&#x27;s also SUCH a hassle (my braces are on the backs of my teeth); this brushhead makes brushing my teeth that much more efficient (and I&#x27;ve tried almost all the others), and my mouth is actually clean.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Heads are durable, effective, with a quality build.  </li>
            <li>so I forced one of the old brush heads onto this toothbrush and it works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>So far they seem as good as the standard heads.</li>
            <li>I bought them to supplement the single brush that comes with the Oral-B electric toothbrush so that my wife could have her own.  </li>
            <li>it cleans your teeth fine, but it is probably 5% better than the other O-ral B brushes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Oral-B electric toothbrush and this type of brush head for clean teeth fanatics.</li>
            <li>So, Amazon offers the bets pricing available and send the product right to your doorstep.</li>
            <li>Right heads, good packaging, saved a few bucks from buying in store.</li>
            <li>The dentist actually recommended against these; I picked these up just to try something new and found that they aren&#x27;t actually very good at cleaning teeth as the regular brush heads are.</li>
            <li>Its an awesome feeling, it really get down deep to the gums, I don&#x27;t know yet</li>
            <li>VERY GENTLE.  </li>
            <li>Plus they were very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I like the Oral B toothbrush and brush heads very much.  </li>
            <li>Misleading name “Floss action”: It does not replace flossing and on the product this is mentioned with an asterisk and fine subtext, so there should be no representation even in the name</li>
            <li>Manual flossing is still required for those of us with crowded mouths, but it is accomplished much more quickly than after using regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>They definitely remove more particles hidden between teeth, and seem to do a good job on tooth surfaces as well.</li>
            <li>The oval shape does not maneuver as well, they&#x27;re a bit more rough on your teeth/gums, and the bristles do not feel as though they clean as well either.</li>
            <li>These toothbrush heads are very thorough and really leave my teeth and gums feeling clean every time</li>
            <li>Frequently, the brush head would slip off the top of the main unit and remain in my mouth.</li>
            <li>These are a great value for the money and they are hard working brushes and bristles.</li>
            <li>They clean really well, are pretty gentle and get food out from between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I was so  happy to find them on Amazon since it is hard to find in drug stores.  </li>
            <li>At certain times you might also be able to grab it at a discounted price which will definitely make it worth it.</li>
            <li>The Flossing head cleans better than the standard head, it feels somewhat like a dentist cleaning.  </li>
            <li>- these are really making a difference!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised though to find out that with the help of the pictures to identify knockoffs on this site, that the product I received was indeed genuine and can not report any problems yet.</li>
            <li>I ordered these directly from Amazon and got genuine Oral B brush heads.  </li>
            <li>its not so soft as i expected it to be and as advertised...plus its making the gaps between my teeth even more and more .....</li>
            <li>They are slightly larger than the ones I had before, so I imagine they have more brushing power.</li>
            <li>This model of Oral B replacement brush heads makes my teeth feel exactly as if they were just cleaned by a hygienist.</li>
            <li>I like the pro white better.</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing any product from any online Company.</li>
            <li>I recommend ONLY purchasing these from Amazon as there is no guarantee you will receive authentic brush heads from anyone else.</li>
            <li>However, during the first week of use one of my kids</li>
            <li>pretty badly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this floss action brush head.</li>
            <li>Of course I will order more in the future.</li>
            <li>and it gets between teeth better than the standard Oral B brush.    </li>
            <li>This is exactly the product I ordered.  </li>
            <li>When the first brush head broke after two weeks of use I became suspicious.  </li>
            <li>All of my brush heads are fuzzy and shaded incorrectly, whereas all the ones in CVS are printed crisply.</li>
            <li>The only way to be sure</li>
            <li>The problem is that this first of the 3-pack falls off the spindle during brushing.</li>
            <li>The exact three pack at the local Walgreens is over $14.00 more.  </li>
            <li>in the ad it appeared that these would fit my Oral B Pulsonic &gt;not true, so I bought these for nothing&gt;paying shipping to get them back</li>
            <li>I subsequently purchased the Oral B Sensitive brush heads and found them to be much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>(I appreciate all the pictures that have been added to show the differences between the real ones and the frauds!)</li>
            <li>It first was a bit wobbly when in use, but actually thought that was to give it a more cleaning area.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased this from a marketplace reseller.</li>
            <li>I always wonder if I will get a knockoff, but this package is a real Oral B product!</li>
            <li>First brush head fell apart within minutes of use.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get in between the teeth as well as floss, but it cleans better than the regular heads</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first one</li>
            <li>The product arrived on time and it worked the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I will be using this brush in the future unless they introduce an even better one.</li>
            <li>What you get is a 15% discount off of a price that is raised 20-80% from what you payed the first time.   </li>
            <li>Am very disppointed in Amazon for allowing this type of business practice!</li>
            <li>Many of my local retail stores did not have the product.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the flossing action.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using electric toothbrush &amp; I am using this as well.</li>
            <li>We put these on auto ship to save extra money and to be sure that we changing out the toothbrush heads as suggested.</li>
            <li>You shouldn&#x27;t expect it to replace daily flossing for you, but it feels like it reaches deeper and cleans more thoroughly.</li>
            <li>And, being powered, it doesn&#x27;t require more effort on my part than simply holding the unit.</li>
            <li>but this was first time buying replacements from amazon.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I needed and work well.</li>
            <li>Arrived in a very timely manner!</li>
            <li>Works better than the generic ones that I picked up from Target.</li>
            <li>Better then the standard bristle types.</li>
            <li>the genuine Oral-B, mine are still completely intact and still plenty of life left on the indicator bristles after more than 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hygienist consistently compliments me on having the cleanest teeth she&#x27;s seen in awhile.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>funny business.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Now many decades later, when i must pay for all the work.</li>
            <li>These brush heads were exactly as indicated.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to those interested.</li>
            <li>My first time ever to use this &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; brush head and</li>
            <li>Exactly what was needed.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>The battery is dealing with a larger head (more friction) and a noticeably heavier head.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny, she is always pushing another brand.</li>
            <li>Both times we have received genuine heads, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Oral B consistently for quite some time; years in fact.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll never look back and your gum health and teeth health will be leaps and bounds better.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if it is any better than the standard head.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this type of brush head.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars because I am satisfied with what actually arrived in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recomended!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I hoped for.</li>
            <li>Another dentist said \\&quot;I wish all people took as good of care of their mouths as you do!\\&quot; and barely had to do any teeth cleaning-and that is when I was only flossing once a month or so.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as described and works well with my Oral B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>amazon indicated that the first step they take is to remove the product from their website.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT ORDER THESE WITHOUT CALLING AMAZON FIRST TO SEE IF THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They definitely feel better in the mouth</li>
            <li>and I think they do a better job than the regular non-floss models.</li>
            <li>I tried these brush heads because I thought the \\&quot;Floss Action\\&quot; would be better than just the standard brush head.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m going to buy more of the standard head.  </li>
            <li>But overall it provides a better tooth-brushing experience.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend these producs to anyone who is interested.</li>
            <li>I would recommend if your using this toothbrush, better than buying the individual packets in the store.</li>
            <li>For some reason the heads seem to not last as long, but still great buy.</li>
            <li>As with most items similar to these on Amazon (razors etc.), there are fakes that exist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these brushes since they first came out and believe they do a much better job that do regular brushe.</li>
            <li>I even bought myself a second one for when I travel. :)</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>EXACTLY</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised, and the 3-count saves me from having to reorder for over a year.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I needed for my Oral B .</li>
            <li>I am a constant user of electrical toothbrushes and oral b sells the more affordable replacement brush</li>
            <li>they work well, and for some reason are much higher quality than the store brand ones.</li>
            <li>First time using a toothbrush of this type.</li>
            <li>your teeth will thank you in the future :)</li>
            <li>But thanks to these, my dentist doesn&#x27;t know that!</li>
            <li>It serves the exact purpose for which it was purchased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure which head came standard with the brush</li>
            <li>Flossing is still required, but this head really does a lot of the job for you!</li>
            <li>Exactly as shown.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So why 4 stars, I only give 5 stars to truly outstanding products.  </li>
            <li>Product is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I have been using these since discovering them by accident, and although I have the regular heads, I buy more of these.</li>
            <li>This brush head also will help to floss your teeth much better than the traditional heads for Oral B.  </li>
            <li>Instructions are to replace the heads every 3 months or when the heads begin to deform whichever comes first.</li>
            <li>I have healthy gums and I alternate between a manual and power brush to prevent recession.</li>
            <li>My first time trying them</li>
            <li>They are considerably more aggressive that the regular heads.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good and firm.</li>
            <li>They cover a good amount of surface area and are fairly firm.  </li>
            <li>The spin brushes are not cheap but my dentist always comment on how good my oral hygiene is.</li>
            <li>These last a full three months or more, clean extremely well, and are comfortable.</li>
            <li>Nothing replaces daily flossing, but these brush heads do provided a deeper and more satisfying clean than other brush heads</li>
            <li>not much tooth paste needs to be used and my teeth feel very clean and shiny afterwards!</li>
            <li>then any brand new true Oral-B heads</li>
            <li>the quality is good, but the application is too stiff for me.</li>
            <li>They work great on my teeth, I like these (Floss Action) a little more than the standard heads.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed my Oral B electric toothbrush and found it easy and inexpensive to order refills from Amazon with the free shipping since I was ordering other items at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I guess the best way to describe it is - slower and larger vibrations vs. that of fast short ones with the standard head.  </li>
            <li>I debated whether to go for these larger brush heads for my beloved Oral B toothrush or to once again purchase the smaller more standard size.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this for 3 years, totally in love with this, small but smart, it is doing a great job cleaning every single tooth.</li>
            <li>whether one is a non-flosser, an occasional flosser, or one who flosses regularly, if you own an electric rechargeable toothbrush that is compatible with the Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush, then I recommend this addition for both better mouth hygiene and your own internal body</li>
            <li>AND I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED THAT THE BRUSHES IN COMBINATION REALLY DID MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN MY TEETH.  </li>
            <li>I normally clean toothbrushes by holding under running under water and agitating the bristles before and after use, however this is clearly insufficient.</li>
            <li>I like the floss action since they are really CLEAN up my teeth.</li>
            <li>the clean the tooth, gum, and produce flossing action between the teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched to this floss action head, because it works well and does what it is designed to do.. clean in between teeth</li>
            <li>my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean as they did with my old oral b.  </li>
            <li>Professional Precision clean  </li>
            <li>I find these toothbrushes with the built-in floss action are far better than the ones without.  </li>
            <li>i have been using them for over 12 years (not the same one, i do get replacements  :)  haha)</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, low price, completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Nice with floss action, makes a big difference!</li>
            <li>I realize the bristles are such better quality, and at varying heights - they really get in-between each tooth.</li>
            <li>I will choose the Floss Action heads every time because they get into the crevices quite nicely and distribute the toothpaste rather evenly (the Pro White heads would fling all of the toothpaste off before I finished brushing a quarter of my mouth).</li>
            <li>and it really does work better than the regular Oral B replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li>I love the oral-b professional floss action replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li>two month after this purchase, I gave up and went to the local Wal-Mart to buy the real thing (made in Germany) for $10 more.</li>
            <li>really like this cleaning head, and it performed better than the standard cleaning head,  </li>
            <li>They get into the narrow spaces between my teeth exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>I love the floss-action brush heads because, while I don&#x27;t think they actually &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; between my teeth, they do polish the surface of my teeth very well.  </li>
            <li>The Floss Action brush is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>A large chunk of tartar fell out on the first brush.</li>
            <li>This Oral-B brush head has very interesting design that contains two moving little brushes on the sides.</li>
            <li>The most obvious is the Oral-B branding is much lighter grey than the authentic.</li>
            <li>I think that one of the Oral-B&#x27;s great strengths is that the small heads can be maneuvered in such a way that you can clean every surface of every tooth.</li>
            <li>I never use the latter because the Oral B makes my teeth feel so squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t always floss, we always mean to though, these are the next best thing.</li>
            <li>They fit the brush properly and clean better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>these do NOT take the place of flossing, but they do seem to clean a little better between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It makes my teeth feel clean and comes with lovely little bands on the bottom to personalize.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say whether these are knock-offs or the real thing (although the ones I saw at Rite-aid look exactly like this), but I do notice that they don&#x27;t stay put all the way while brushing.  </li>
            <li>This is the first type of power toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever tried, so I can&#x27;t really compare it with others.  </li>
            <li>;) haha)    </li>
            <li>but i just could not believe they were not genuine since im buying from what i consider to be a very reputable seller (Amazon)</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>This is the original and worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>Also, the floss action is far superior to the regulars, and around the same price.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that the good reviews of the Oral-B floss brushes are from years ago and negative reviews are from more recent years:2011</li>
            <li>The action of this brush does very well to clean between teeth.</li>
            <li>I have been using these Floss Action brushheads for a couple of years and really like the way that they clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I think this brush head works better than the older simple heads I have been using.</li>
            <li>fits better than generic ones, and decent price</li>
            <li>I much prefer the Vitality Precision Clean heads to the Floss Action heads.  </li>
            <li>I believe so highly in this toothbrush that when I couldn&#x27;t find one to purchase without having to buy 2 or more regular brushes with it, I took the advice of a store clerk to check the internet.  </li>
            <li>Some of my teeth are pretty tight and this is a great &#x27;pre treatment&#x27; prior to flossing.  </li>
            <li>The stiff flossing points do feel pretty good on your gums but as far as actually mimicking the action of really flossing your teeth, I suspect they are not that effective.</li>
            <li>I bought another replacement pack from a big box retailer and it is easy to see the difference between these knock offs and an OEM brush.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line Oral B heads clean better and last up to 5 times longer with regular use.</li>
            <li>B0002KHU3I Oral-B Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)]] - especially the latter because it has greater surface area.</li>
            <li>The head is definitely larger which some people will not like because it is not as easy to maneuver inside the mouth.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased and if the need arises in the future I look forward to making further purchases.</li>
            <li>Dry satisfied by my purchases.</li>
            <li>These are really nice typical toothbrush replacements - they get the job done.</li>
            <li>Fits well, easy to attach, last longer than the generics.</li>
            <li>The replacement brushes last a long time and good quality.  </li>
            <li>They clean like no other brush/system I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I prefer the large headed brushes.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been using the Oral B Floss Action heads on my Oral B I&#x27;ve had for about 4 years now (still going strong!), and overall, I&#x27;ll say I like</li>
            <li>The product was shipped fast, it was brand new, and worth the money.</li>
            <li>This occurrence was precisely during the period when I used these new floss action brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love getting new toothbrush heads and there is only 3 people using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t have to pay more for replacement heads for my $150 electric toothbrush than I would pay for a new regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The new longer, yellow, plastic bristles took some getting used to but feel like they do a more thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are effective -- they get in tight spots and remove even the toughest deposits.  </li>
            <li>Pro White, Precision Clean, Sensitive Gum Care, Dual Clean.,</li>
            <li>As such, they seem to do an excellent job for me, but I could see how they&#x27;d be less beneficial for smaller teeth/</li>
            <li>These are perfect for my electric toothbrush, and much less than the cost of the same brush heads in my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li>The price is a very high for reppalcement brush heads.</li>
            <li>Finally, the most obvious tell is that you can easily scratch the logo off the counterfeit item with your fingernail but the real item has a completely glazed surface.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought the price was quite high for the refill, but that is because I did not realize I got 3 refills in the package.  </li>
            <li>The heads seem to be much sturdier than ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the past and seems to clean my teeth better and faster.</li>
            <li>Do not press hard let the rotating brush do the good work on your teeth.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the Brush heads as of yet, but have used the sam models purchased from other places, and the price was super cheap</li>
            <li>Also, the product I received wasn&#x27;t a cheap knockoff - although I may have gotten lucky based on reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li>The price looks great, but it&#x27;s a total waste of money.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean and it is easy to reach trouble spots in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>These brush heads are too big to be comfortable.</li>
            <li>They really hurt my gums.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s maybe too much to hope for.....</li>
            <li>All the bristles move in awkward ways, creating a sensation that leaves me happy!</li>
            <li>Thanks,</li>
            <li>Real ones lasts for months.</li>
            <li>Also, the &#x27;floss action&#x27; plastic tips around the perimeter don&#x27;t really seem to be flossing more than they are just contributing to the roughness of the overall brushing experience.</li>
            <li>They are something that I happen to know very well.</li>
            <li>I got all broke very soon after beginning to use them.</li>
            <li>This made the brush head much noisier and also caused it to pinch my lip form time to time while brushing.</li>
            <li>They are real.  </li>
            <li>My teeth and gums feel very invigorated after each use.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;indicator\\&quot; bristles will never change color, because they aren&#x27;t really indicator bristles... and because the head will start to fall apart after 3-4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know, I sound like a commercial.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>something a real Oral-B manufactured brushhead would never do.</li>
            <li>They show \\&quot;Oral B\\&quot; in Blue as the genuine ones, but mine that came with the brush have the gray \\&quot;Oral B\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>which will be very soon.</li>
            <li>etc....too much hassle.</li>
            <li>Really, the photos (here, on the package) tell you what you should be getting.</li>
            <li>That being said, this product was very defective.  </li>
            <li>I knew something was off with the package, but it met several of the criteria for genuine.</li>
            <li>Its the real the thing</li>
            <li>well, these hold up much longer than the knock off brands...</li>
            <li>I hope this means they got wind of the counterfeiting scams and are working to ensure they&#x27;re selling only the genuine article.  </li>
            <li>That just doesnt do anything unless you have real dental polishing paste maybe.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon automatic shipping, I will never be without my Oral B refills.</li>
            <li>I just purchased real ones from Walgreens</li>
            <li>So  much cheaper then at the store.</li>
            <li>So i examined it more carefully.  </li>
            <li>the quality is very good,worth to buy,and i wanna buy another for my family</li>
            <li>I give this 5 stars as it cleans my teeth really well</li>
            <li>I really like mine.</li>
            <li>It really seems to help with the flossing.  </li>
            <li>so they are the genuine product and not generic.  </li>
            <li>These work really well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if the \\&quot;flossaction\\&quot; feature really does anything, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>Should I really move on to hyperbole about a toothbrush head?</li>
            <li>I really like those replacements.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>I can say though my mouth feels MUCH cleaner.  </li>
            <li>My whole family has one.</li>
            <li>That will be the real report.</li>
            <li>The price of the knock-offs is so much cheaper...</li>
            <li>I have bought store brand products before, but this leaves teeth feeling much cleaner.</li>
            <li>They really work well.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are very thorough, but gentle.</li>
            <li>and it really does the job.</li>
            <li>They fit well in the storage compartment and are protected by a lid that swings open.</li>
            <li>After we brush our teeth, we feels much cleaner than Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I really like these brush heads.</li>
            <li>I can really feel the difference in the feel of the head itself.  </li>
            <li>I really like these heads.</li>
            <li>After brushing I feel like I get a very thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t praise a toothbrush much</li>
            <li>still, I really like these toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>This product used to have a much longer life.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x60;t floss as much as I should</li>
            <li>and I really like them.</li>
            <li>These did not look, feel or perform very well, bristles felt like they were fraying almost immediately, would not purchase again.</li>
            <li>but my dentist still wants to see me 4 times a year</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even really care about the money so much as I care about taking responsibility for it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks everyone.    </li>
            <li>So I decided to try an electronic toothbrush and thought since flossing is the really a challenge with braces</li>
            <li>These brush heads are very pricey in the store, so I&#x27;ve been looking for alternatives.  </li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s really all I need.</li>
            <li>Came fast &amp; saved a trip to town.</li>
            <li>Product as described fast shipment</li>
            <li>These are the real Oral-B brushes.  </li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;ve ended up purchasing these genuine Oral-B manufactured brushes and I alternate with the others.  </li>
            <li>There are several styles available and each has its benefits.  </li>
            <li>The moment I put this head on my Braun toothbrush I had the feeling there was more drag</li>
            <li>My whole family switched to Oral B power toothbrushes about a year ago.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural smiler, I laugh at anything including corny stuff,</li>
            <li>so often when i shop for it in real stores they are out of stock.</li>
            <li>They are working really well.</li>
            <li>I think the system is very convenient.</li>
            <li>Also gentle to gums.</li>
            <li>and I got real Oral-B brush heads and not knock-offs, which according to the reviews seems to be a problem.</li>
            <li>I bought this before, and really like it</li>
            <li>was very upset about it.  </li>
            <li>I use the heads much longer than the recommended amount because I don&#x27;t like being gouged.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li>Very efficient in using</li>
            <li>Very efficient in using</li>
            <li>When I placed an order about a week later, the coupon was available again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hooked on Oral-B so can only give an advanced guess that I&#x27;m going to like these</li>
            <li>Mine is really Oral-B</li>
            <li>If the generics weren&#x27;t available when I need them, I&#x27;d definitely buy these name brand ones again.  </li>
            <li>but they work very well.</li>
            <li>I figure that if it&#x27;s not broken, don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really like this brush head.  </li>
            <li>but they still perform really well.</li>
            <li>Teeth always fell so much cleaner with these.</li>
            <li>All the bristles move in awkward ways, creating a sensation that leaves me happy!</li>
            <li>Should have bought these sooner, they are very thorough.</li>
            <li>No issues with compatibility, as these are the real deal.</li>
            <li>not so much the handle that counts.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like this brushhead so much.</li>
            <li>and these are really pricey compared to the knock-ff alternative.</li>
            <li>The Dual-Clean heads have a rubber massage component which seems very beneficial to my gums.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon Prime</li>
            <li>Still not a replacement for real floss.</li>
            <li>The real deal.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for working Oral B replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had 3 of these head now and they work really well.  </li>
            <li>Worked very well on linoleum floor.  </li>
            <li>The units sent were what were advertized,  The product was shipped fast and the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the</li>
            <li>Much needed replacement parts!!&lt;br /&gt;Dr jace</li>
            <li>Thanks .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Recommend these brushes works very well...</li>
            <li>They work, and so much cheaper than buying at Target.</li>
            <li>I am a dental hygienist and would highly recommend electric toothbrushes for just about everyone!</li>
            <li>I have a real problem with plaque.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>I really like these brush heads.</li>
            <li>Fits my Oral-B and lasts a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re fantastic and come with extra color band identifiers.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>The replacement brush head really gets into all the nooks and crannies.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to them for keeping us alert to scams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it get in between my teeth really well.</li>
            <li>I really think these brushes make a difference no matter which of the handles you use them on.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying them in retail stores.</li>
            <li>COMPARISON WITH A GENUINE ORAL B FLOSS ACTION BRUSH HEAD OBTAINED DIRECTLY FROM ORAL B</li>
            <li>Some of the Third Party Vendors are quite good, but I don&#x27;t think they are carefully monitored so, when in doubt, stick with Mother Amazon.</li>
            <li>I like the floss action which is better than the regular heads.  </li>
            <li>The only think that I don&#x27;t like about them is that the plastic arms (which allows them to be marketed as &#x27;floss action&#x27;, I assume) are more rigid than I&#x27;d like for them to be.  </li>
            <li>I get these for my husband, he hasnt complained about them so they must work good.</li>
            <li>The dual action is my second favorite.</li>
            <li>They feel just right for my purpose, but no long term review at this time, but feel I have made the right choice</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a problem with counterfeit ones like other people on here, these worked perfectly fine!</li>
            <li>but it is ludicrous to spend more than $100 on the Oral B professional 5000, and find that it arrives with only a single brush, and your first action after purchase has to be to get more brushes so that your wife can use it too.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the Floss Action wasn&#x27;t right for me, but I&#x27;m much happier with the Sonicare now than when I had the Oral-B.</li>
            <li>At my dentist appointment--while I did get the usual lecture about flossing when I told her about my experiment--the hygenist did acknowledge that my gums were the best she saw that day and that I had less tartar than before.    </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, and is exactly the same as in the store, but at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get excited about a replacement brush, but I&#x27;m glad they exist because I don&#x27;t ever want to be without my electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li>But unfortunately electric brushes are much more effective than the traditional way to clean your teeth...</li>
            <li>I first used this brush head when it arrived with my newly purchased Oral B electric tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>They last as long as they should for sure!</li>
            <li>I know other reviewers posted they weren&#x27;t sure if this was the legitimate Oral B brand, but to me it seems like the real deal.</li>
            <li>The heads last so long that I don&#x27;t know when I will need to purchase more!</li>
            <li>Pictures comparing real and counterfeit are also misleading, Original Oral-B brush only has ONE color ring not 2.</li>
            <li>The heads seem to work OK and are lasting pretty well, but if if you are thinking this is a replacement for real flossing, think again, unless you have big spaces between your teeth.</li>
            <li>Oral-B Professional Floss Action Brush makes your teeth feel really clean.  </li>
            <li>We really like the deep clean that these give.</li>
            <li>The quality of the brush head is not the same as the ones that came with the original brush.</li>
            <li>The product that I received came in a packaging that while different from what I am used to, still had the OralB logo, that I was familiar with.</li>
            <li>At first i could not figure out why this didn&#x27;t fit properly and kept falling off, immediately i noticed that they looked cheaper than the ones that came with my professional care</li>
            <li>Only original oral B  brush heads works for me</li>
            <li>, I recently switched to the Original Precision brush heads</li>
            <li>It does feel a bit more aggressive than the other brush heads.</li>
            <li>This is not supposed replace your regular floss which you get from the threads but does a pretty good job if you dont want to floss everyday.</li>
            <li>They are better than the other brushheads from Oral-b.</li>
            <li>the replacement is larger than the original, and as a result it pounds against my teeth.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel better cleaned than with any other brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>so I have gone back to the original.</li>
            <li>If you get one or the other type on sale go for it, but don&#x27;t pay more for these</li>
            <li>They work better than the other heads.</li>
            <li>I love this because it may have my dental cleaned indeep rather than other brush head.</li>
            <li>If you bought Oral-B brush-driver you haven&#x27;t another option to buy brush from other brand:).</li>
            <li>These work amazingly well and last a long time.</li>
            <li>THE MOTION IN THESE HEADS ACTUALLY SEEMS TO DO SOMETHING TO CLEAN YOUR TEETH</li>
            <li>But these seem to give me a deeper clean than the standard oral B brush heads that come with the unit.</li>
            <li>The Pro White heads feel like I&#x27;m trying to scrape my teeth clean, not polish them.</li>
            <li>--my teeth just don&#x27;t feel clean with a regular toothbrush anymore.</li>
            <li>It makes me teeth clean and digs in deep to make my gums looks well.</li>
            <li>Hopefully this replacement Oral-B Floss Action Replacement Brush Head is the real thing, and not a fake.  </li>
            <li>I can fill the deep clean with these brush heads</li>
            <li>but I prefer the Precision Clean or Pro White heads.  </li>
            <li>Clean my teeth flosses at the same time.</li>
            <li>They make my teeth feel extra clean.</li>
            <li>I believe they really clean the teeth nicely especially in between the teeth.</li>
            <li>I was contemplating switching back to the Sonicare when they wore out but then saw the Precision Clean heads.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several different heads, including the dual clean and precision clean heads.</li>
            <li>Been using the Oral B Professional electric tooth brush for many years and am always amazed at how long the machine has lasted.  </li>
            <li>(they can feel quite clean, but you have to brush twice the recommended time, which is detrimental to enamel and gums), and this head makes a huge mess!</li>
            <li>These are very cool, and a little hard on my gums, but I do feel the floss action is effective, though not as effective as actually flossing.</li>
            <li>I really like and highly recommend this floss/action attachment from Oral B - HOWEVER</li>
            <li>No need running around to different stores looking, just order them right on Amazon!</li>
            <li>The base has an incredible battery life and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>I dont know if the little 4 yellow rubber \\&quot;thingi\\&quot; really work as a floss, or if they really clean better.  </li>
            <li>First, it gets between large gaps in the teeth like no other replacement head.</li>
            <li>First, it gets between large gaps in the teeth like no other replacement head.</li>
            <li>The product is good and as expected, the shipment arrived much before than expected date.</li>
            <li>I have been buying these Floss Action brushes for about 3 years (since they first came out) and I replace them every month,</li>
            <li>The Floss Action provides significantly better cleaning action than the standard brush.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, like many others who purchased this product, the item I received from Amazon was clearly a counterfeit replica that does not work effectively.  </li>
            <li>The Oral B Flos Action Replacement Head was exactly what I ordered and arrived a head of schedule.</li>
            <li>Apparently, this \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; dentistry is becoming more common.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Braun Oral B rechargable toothbrushes for over 24 years now, today was the first time I tried the floss action brush head</li>
            <li>I would strongly suggest not buying from this company, particularly not these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Removed 3 year old stubborn tartar on first brush.</li>
            <li>I ordered 1 of Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill at 12 $ first time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the oral-b toothbrush for about 10 years and the flossing action of these brush heads is evident at dentist visits.  </li>
            <li>So 2 out of 6 brushes defected is not bad, but regular.</li>
            <li>i think if i tried going back to the normal brushes, my teeth wouldnt &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; as clean.  </li>
            <li>They are like using a flat head manual toothbrush THAT DO CLEAN your teeth</li>
            <li>Well you know what, most people are &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; - this is the very definition of average!</li>
            <li>I know that, whenever I get my new shipment of heads, it&#x27;s time to switch them out!  </li>
            <li>They are small but very powerful and leave my teeth feeling so clean.</li>
            <li>My previous brushes (I have had a lot of them since I owned the toothbrush for many years) never had this problem, even if I used them beyond the recommended 3 months which Oral B recommends.      </li>
            <li>I think it cleans more thoroughly than any product I previously used and would not hesitate to purchase it again.  </li>
            <li>and I find that they are easy to manuever and aren&#x27;t rough on my teeth/gums.      </li>
            <li>, they work better than a manual brush and cost less than Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Fits all of our older model tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>Particularly if you are switching out your Sonicare tooth brush for an Oral B like I did.</li>
            <li>Quick to ship and the same product you get in stores for twice the price!</li>
            <li>I bought directly from amazon, not a 3rd party seller, hoping that amazon would send me genuine Oral B brush heads.</li>
            <li>I do not know if it is because of the material used in the brushes of this particular toothbrush, but I did not have it before.  </li>
            <li>The price is better than in the local stores and the product is just the same.</li>
            <li>If I could do it all over again, I&#x27;d stick with the classic brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s good if you don&#x27;t want to whiten your teeth and just want to improve your cleaning experience after your old common teethbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will be back for more definitely.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B offers a variety of toothbrush heads to fit your personal oral health needs.</li>
            <li>I recently tried another toothbrush with different heads and have to say that the Braun toothbrushes and brush heads seem to work better.</li>
            <li>But the main thing is price.</li>
            <li>Your dentist can recommend one for your particular dental needs.</li>
            <li>Decent price.</li>
            <li>I have been trying out cheaper options and those are just ok, but definitely not offering the same quality as the originals.</li>
            <li>Decent price compared to my friends sonicare replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li>Works as replacement heads for Braun Oral B with decent quality and value.</li>
            <li>So much better than the generic heads I bought last time!</li>
            <li>but you were quick enough to take our money</li>
            <li>These are larger, does more vibrating for cleaning teeth and getting to those back teeth.  </li>
            <li>This is easier said than done, first, it increases the total cost of ownership quite significantly and secondly, sore throats do not have a very well defined end point.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel like I have had a cleaning everyday!I highly recommend this toothbrush head for everyone.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brush heads</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend them despite the price.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have used this brush for a week, and have had gums bleeding and swelling (NEVER any problems before, and yes, I floss daily), teeth getting more sensitive and less clean feeling afterward</li>
            <li>I highly recommend changing the brush heads on your toothbrush every 3 months like it is advised.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend getting these if you don&#x27;t like flossing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;D HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANYONE</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend  giving them a try.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and highly recommend it to anyone anticipating buying it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>They are definitely high quality, I don&#x27;t remember them ever losing a bristle.</li>
            <li>Not the larger head with 2 distinct parts, but I actually like the smaller head better.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit on the brush quite right and don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li>my order was filled with no problems and will reorder again probably; did not particularly like the type brush I got but wanted to try it.  </li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned, these are the same quality and standards as the one that comes with the original toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Cleeans WWAAAAYYYY better than my old (other brand) toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I just bought the Oral B Professional Care Smart Series rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Just because it is listed on Amazon does not mean it is sold by Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The rubber nubs just give a little more penetration in between your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I choose to let a little machine do most of the work.  </li>
            <li>these are the best balance of having that &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling after brushing while still being small and maneuverable enough to get my wisdom teeth and other hard-to-reach areas.</li>
            <li>I bought mine a little over a year ago and immediately fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>If you have a choice, get the Floss Action Replacement Brush Heads!!</li>
            <li>but I love the feeling of clean that these leave behind.</li>
            <li>The only think I did was change from the Precision Clean to the Floss Action Oral B</li>
            <li>The electric really cuts down on time, and you know that you&#x27;ve done a good job due to the quadrant timer.  </li>
            <li>These do a little better job than normal bristled brush heads  for me.</li>
            <li>They said since I had purchased them so long ago this was a \\&quot;special exception\\&quot; they were making for me.  </li>
            <li>The brush heads are very good for cleaning your teeth, and, I have been using them over the past few years.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d think it&#x27;d go without saying, but no, no product really has proven itself to leave flossing completely</li>
            <li>I decided to try the Floss action Brush Head &amp; I really like it.</li>
            <li>am happy with brushes,  sorry that floss tips don&#x27;t hold up longer.</li>
            <li>These brush heads really do have a flossing action, but I would not forego using floss.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to buy them in multiples but wish they were not quite as expensive.</li>
            <li>They can be too much for someone with sensitive gums, however.</li>
            <li>Fit and function as as expected.</li>
            <li>No surprises really - they are exactly the same and work well.</li>
            <li>They are definitely worth the extra $$.</li>
            <li>but the extra cost is worth the benefit one gains by using this brush head.</li>
            <li>normally floss before brushing, so</li>
            <li>They are worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>and I have to say they dont brush as well as the normal brush heads</li>
            <li>i got these to replace normal brush head on my oral-b electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t notice much difference, but after extensive use, it didn&#x27;t trigger the change-head reminder on my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sold - we&#x27;ll see what the dentist says in a few months :)&lt;</li>
            <li>These worked really well, but I would say look for an off brand that works the same and doesn&#x27;t cost so much!</li>
            <li>The oral-b brushes get in between places that a normal brush would miss.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally change them out every three months</li>
            <li>It does not replace flossing, not by a long shot, but this is better than the standard brush that comes with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>These are basically inexpensive when compared buying them locally well worth it.</li>
            <li>worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>It fits my oral b toothbrush correctly, however ruled that must order $25.00 worth of martial to order it is a hassle.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as the regular tips.  </li>
            <li>They also come with a few assorted color plastic rings that can be added so you can tell the brushes apart if you have more than one user.</li>
            <li>The price is good but they are poorly made.</li>
            <li>In this time I have used the Floss Action, Dual Clean, Sensitive Clean, Power Tip, and a knock-off from China to save a few bucks (purchased on Amazon).</li>
            <li>In this time I have used the Floss Action, Dual Clean, Sensitive Clean, Power Tip, and a knock-off from China to save a few bucks (purchased on Amazon).</li>
            <li>The other 4 are working fine.  </li>
            <li>I also had a dual action head, and generally prefer this one, though the other one is good once in a while as well, as it is a fuller head and scrubs slightly differently.</li>
            <li>i normally love these brush heads but this set didn&#x27;t last very long, maybe a 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>and you can tell easily when it&#x27;s time to replace them when the brushes on the outside lose their blue color.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>This may be a deal breaker for some, since stiff brushes have many negatives.</li>
            <li>Had the right packaging, but it printing was blurry on the back.</li>
            <li>This item was priced right, so I bought it to replace my former Oral B brush head.</li>
            <li>One reviewer suggested that you go to the Oral B site to buy your heads rather than shopping at Amazon -- but guess what -- if you go to the Oral B site they provide you several links for retailers who sell their products, and one of them leads right here, to this product at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>will say though that if you have braces, the brush wears down pretty quick though.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Oral B electric toothbrush for many years now, but getting the new heads were always expensive, and not always easy to find for my model.</li>
            <li>Having braces, getting a good clean is difficult with just a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I know Amazon has a good price on them, but the price on these in general is just ridiculous.</li>
            <li>Not what I expected like the original brush head</li>
            <li>I find it not so good, it is a bit rough and didn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li>Please notice the little hole that exists near the top of the toothbrush head - on the neck of it.  </li>
            <li>This product does the job so well, that I think my Dentist is a little perplexed, as I \\&quot;have less tarter, than most women my age\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>New, as advertised.</li>
            <li>So we told him to use a new one and now the brush hair are falling out.</li>
            <li>My patience was sligtly stressed because I thougt that I woild have to purchase a new tooth brush to get a somplete unit.  </li>
            <li>Then I lost my charger and it was cheaper to buy a new toothbrush than replace the charger.</li>
            <li>He loves the electric toothbrush, and wanted him to have spare brush heads for the new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I bought a new Oral B pro brush that came with this head.  </li>
            <li>Within the month, you are reaching for a new head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Buying 3 along with the new brush means I am set for a year.</li>
            <li>3 days is the new norm.</li>
            <li>I live for that</li>
            <li>Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li>Purchased these heads to try with the new Oral-B 1000 Toothbrush I purchased to replace the Oral-B electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve been using for over 8 years now.  </li>
            <li>Nothing like a new tooth brush.</li>
            <li>When these arrived, I immediately snapped on a new head and it immediately worked as if nothing ever happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li>They fit on the brush head without slipping  the individual threads don&#x27;t come loose, and they get the choppers clean!</li>
            <li>There were several models but only one fit my unit.</li>
            <li>This item in particular should maybe be ordered directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It may be my overly sensitive teeth, but these are a lot more harsh than the one that comes with the brush.</li>
            <li>So, if you are older, and/or have sensitive teeth, I suggest you avoid this brush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice a difference between this and the regular head, but I guess that means it&#x27;s no worse.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to carefully compare your replacements to your current heads each time, given all the complaints about fakes.</li>
            <li>The reason I bought these is that they were the same brand available at a local chain store but at a 30% savings...  </li>
            <li>It SOUNDS like a very early dirigible motor.  </li>
            <li>I had recently bought the same exact 3-pack from a store, so I compared the ones I got to the genuine oral-B refills, and noticed the following:</li>
            <li>These replacement brushes are sturdy, strong, and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these brush heads myself for years and recently purchased them for my son, who does not always do stellar work when brushing his teeth.  </li>
            <li>First, throw the Chinese knock-offs in the garbage.</li>
            <li>Secondly, I find the Floss Action better by a wide margin over any of the others I have tried.</li>
            <li>The first thing that I noticed is that the blue color is darker.  </li>
            <li>Then the coefficient of friction moving from one tooth to the next tooth is much higher.  </li>
            <li>The Floss Action head is a must have!</li>
            <li>I purchased mine DIRECTLY from Amazon (not a third party seller) and mine are absolutely the real deal.</li>
            <li>I have a keen eye for small differences, and most people will be fooled by this.</li>
            <li>I saw that these were \\&quot;by OralB\\&quot; and usually Amazon is reputable.</li>
            <li>For the rest of us with sensitive gums, don&#x27;t buy them!</li>
            <li>i started purchasing this product and now it comes malfunction-ally built because the recently bought brush heads don&#x27;t operate as they were the first time</li>
            <li>They seem to last enough longer than the standard ones to more than make up for the difference in price.</li>
            <li>First the rubber pieces on the head starting falling apart in mouth while brushing.</li>
            <li>As I have a small mouth and receding gums, I don&#x27;t need any more agents of &#x27;attack&#x27; on my gumline.  </li>
            <li>Exact same product.</li>
            <li>I am on my second one the first lasted 8+ years.</li>
            <li>I opened the first pack and the 1st 2 brush heads only lasted a couple of days each!  </li>
            <li>Exact the same as came with my toothbrush</li>
            <li>I suggest using this in conjunction with the best toothpaste we&#x27;ve found: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I love the small rubber flossing bristle.  </li>
            <li>I have tried them all and only this original brand works properly in the toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>They are larger than the regular brush heads, so you can be done brushing faster or brush more thoroughly in the same amount of time.      </li>
            <li>It cleaned well, but disturbed the sensitive areas around the gums to the point where I thought I might need a root canal!  </li>
            <li>This is rip off of the original Oral B brush heads with far fewer filaments in the center.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t last as long when brushing with braces, but I don&#x27;t mind replacing the brush head every month or so to get that pretty smile.</li>
            <li>First I purchased the generic brushes and was not satified</li>
            <li>This product is a cheap knock-off - not worth the money.</li>
            <li>Made by the Oral-B people, so it&#x27;s the same quality as the original equipment, albeit an improvement over the standard brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I shopped othe websites such as the Oral-B replacement parts site and found much higher prices.  </li>
            <li>These are pretty simple.</li>
            <li>First, throw the Chinese knock-offs in the garbage.</li>
            <li>Secondly, I find the Floss Action better by a wide margin over any of the others I have tried.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I felt the &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; cleaned any differently than regular heads, so it might be more a matter of personal taste (and price).</li>
            <li>I have pretty solid teeth as well</li>
            <li>I thought the Oral-B cleaned pretty well, until I recently switched over to a Philips Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Now when I visit with my Dentist he stated that my teeth&#x27;s are better no more drilling...</li>
            <li>They are the Maytags of small appliances many of which are made for the kitchen.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the original round Oral B brush heads with no paddles.  </li>
            <li>It seemed ok, but after a week of normal usage, the head started vibrating, making a loud noise and also the head didn&#x27;t brush the same (very rough).  </li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s four star reviews are outdated and the older product reviews are much more positive than reviews from 2011-my purchase was 2013.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this completely eliminates any possible damage, but so far my gums/teeth feel fine, not beaten up, and doesn&#x27;t feel radically different from using a medium bristle</li>
            <li>secondly - they don&#x27;t even get my teeth as clean as a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This is a deep cleaning brush and your teeth feel extra clean.  </li>
            <li>All things being equal I will just get the Precision Clean heads and be done next time.  </li>
            <li>These do not leave my teeth smooth and clean and worse</li>
            <li>I feel like i get a deeper clean with these things then any other toothbrush I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>Clean teeth extremely well.</li>
            <li>Original product not the shabby imitation which disintegrated.</li>
            <li>And also, it&#x27;s healthier if you use more than one brush head every single day, so they have time to dry out after use.</li>
            <li>After getting a 2nd opinion from a far better dentist, I found out that the former one was simply attempting to line his pockets.</li>
            <li>They are larger than the original and have a different action.</li>
            <li>It makes flossing that much easier, and just works harder than many other brushheads.</li>
            <li>When I was purchasing the new toothbrush I also saw Oral B Floss Action 3 pack refills which I also purchased.  </li>
            <li>I do have two brushes that worked on my old unit but they will not work the new one</li>
            <li>I prefer the new flexible soft floss picks.</li>
            <li>These were easy--pry off the old one, pop on the new one, bam.</li>
            <li>so we can use newly designed heads with our old handles.</li>
            <li>This product&#x27;s bristles are much too stiff to clean my teeth thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Dont wast your money on cheap know offs that break and don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li>, I got my order within 48 hours, free shipping, at less than half the price of Walgreens, and it&#x27;s the genuine Oral-B replacement item, not a counterfeit</li>
            <li>1st - Floss Action, 2nd - Dual Clean and 3rd - ProWhite.</li>
            <li>Generally work fine - if they&#x27;re the same price as the regular heads</li>
            <li>The floss action head is a bit larger than the standard precision clean head</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t figure it out at first, then went back to the sensitive brush.  </li>
            <li>These are comfortable to use, though no more or less effective than the regular non-&amp;#34;flossing action &amp;#34; brush heads.</li>
            <li>These are the brush heads to get - I&#x27;ve tried the other varieties of Oral-B brush heads, but these floss action ones leave your teeth with that smooth/slick clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Pro White heads pretty much have this circular rubber piece in the middle</li>
            <li>Product came in time and performed as expected.&lt;br /&gt;Since this was the first time I was ordering the Floss Action head, instead of the regular one, I was surprised by the size of it</li>
            <li>Well -I&#x27;ll tell you what - first of all they do absolutely nothing that even remotely resembles &#x27;flossing action&#x27; and  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying new heads from local drugstore.</li>
            <li>first of all, they do not fit right...</li>
            <li>I bought these from Direct Super Center.  </li>
            <li>I bought these from Direct Super Center.  </li>
            <li>The brushes that I ordered from Direct Super Center were counterfeit.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product from Direct Super Center.</li>
            <li>DO NOT order from Direct Super Center.</li>
            <li>Bristles packed tightly and of the correct color, serial number intact, 2 color rings included with each brush and packaging checked out with what the genuine manufacturer produces.     </li>
            <li>The heads fit snugly, and the indicator rings (at the bottom) snap in tight.</li>
            <li>all those comparing this with the cheaper generic brands available on Amazon, DON&#x27;T!!!&lt;br /&gt;I tried the generic brands and the brush feathers came out piece by piece every time I brushed, you might save few bucks in price but Oral-B&#x27;s are the real deal and well worth it!  </li>
            <li>It can be done, but there&#x27;s more of a mess than with the smaller brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If your mouth tends to the larger side I certainly recommend trying these replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li>They fit really well on the brush base and they stay clean and clean my teeth and gums well.</li>
            <li>With these brush-heads and careful flossing with both cheap dental picks and Oral-B Satin floss, there&#x27;s very little build-up of tartar for the dental hygienist to clean, even when I missed a couple appointments, and went 1 1/2 years between cleaning.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;floss\\&quot; in the brush is quite stiff; it doesn&#x27;t seem to help flossing much, but rather makes brushing less effective.</li>
            <li>I purchased these along with the Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep + Smart Guide</li>
            <li>These have little yellow rubber bristles that vibrate when the toothbrush is engaged and they do an ok job of cleaning between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>My dentist would stress to me that I need to floss more to prevent tartar and gingivitis, but it was hard to remember to floss.  </li>
            <li>Oral B has come out with so many brush heads, it is hard to know what to buy anymore.  </li>
            <li>also did a better job of cleaning the hard to reach spots on the inside surface of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Make sure you replace them once they get soft; otherwise, they will not clean your teach well enough.  </li>
            <li>hard to say more than that - I like them.</li>
            <li>I think the wal-mart knock off brand is better in that the bristles aren&#x27;t has hard.</li>
            <li>and I fear too hard for most as well.</li>
            <li>I love little yellow bristles, they really work wonders with my braces, that my regular rite aid toothbrush never seemed to get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, as soon as I looked at the brushes through the clear package, I could tell that the brushes are knock-offs.  </li>
            <li>These are not genuine Oral B Floss Action brush heads, they are cheap knock offs as alot of the reviews are pointing out.</li>
            <li>This means I&#x27;m hacking at my gums less with floss, but feel just as clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Within just three days after switching to this Oral-B Floss Action Brush Head [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Head 3 Count]]</li>
            <li>Amazon provides oral B professional brushes as one needs with supply and prime shipping.  </li>
            <li>But it is definitely not a substitute for real flossing.  </li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]]  </li>
            <li>Though I buy them anyway because they work really well and last a while.</li>
            <li>I cant really aim properly because of all the vibration and my gums get sore.</li>
            <li>my hygenist actually asked me if i used an electric because she didnt see much tartar.</li>
            <li>I have used the Oral B Vitality toothbrush for nearly five years.</li>
            <li>This is my daily brush and really made a difference.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t have definitive results until I go back for my scheduled cleaning, but the size of the head is very compatible with my smaller-sized mouth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve discovered that the floss action heads don&#x27;t travel well.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that some customers complained about the quality of this brush, however, I have been using it for more than 2 weeks</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive gums, do not buy these.  </li>
            <li>My advice is to stay far away from this product.</li>
            <li>Oral B Floss Action heads</li>
            <li>I gave the Floss Action</li>
            <li>I cannot comment on whether the Floss Action heads can replace the act of flossing.</li>
            <li>However, I recommend you buy an updated unit and not try to use the Floss Action on a Vitality, low-end model, or something made a decade ago.</li>
            <li>I have heard some negative reviews, but I am enjoying these brushes.</li>
            <li>DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON, even direct.</li>
            <li>I used to use the soft oral B brushes.</li>
            <li>I thought I didn&#x27;t have sensitive gums....</li>
            <li>Let me start off by just saying WOW.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The chief drawback, as far as I am concerned, is that the brush head has been enlarged to accommodate the flossers.</li>
            <li>Everything handled professionally.    </li>
            <li>For the price I paid, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this was some type of knock off.  </li>
            <li>The brush looks nothing like the brush I got with my Professional Care 5000 series toothbrush or the brush heads I have purchased at Bed Bath and Beyond.</li>
            <li>They also are already frayed.[[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]]</li>
            <li>The second shipment was the real thing</li>
            <li>When I called the distributor directly, I was informed that they \\&quot;do not sell counterfeit items.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>They include the floss action, which pull particles out of your teeth.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my 10 year old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I noticed after using it, that I have some grooves in the tooth enamel near gums.  </li>
            <li>Originals were not floss action.</li>
            <li>They might be too aggressive for those with sensitive teeth or gums.  </li>
            <li>After comparing everything within the user submitted photos, I can say with some confidence that Amazon sent me legit Floss Action heads.</li>
            <li>So, I switch off between the two - couple of days with the Floss Action, then a couple of days with the Ultrasoft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]]</li>
            <li>The Floss Action seems to make a difference.</li>
            <li>After only a month of use, the head became very wobbly and seemed to start to detaching.</li>
            <li>Going to the sensitive heads.</li>
            <li>I learned my lesson and only will get the real Oral-B brands.</li>
            <li>I have an Oral B Professional.  </li>
            <li>I think I will call Oral-B &amp; see if they will replace my two incompatible brush heads with the floss action one that fits my precision 1000 model.</li>
            <li>These things clunk around in your mouth and are so loud</li>
            <li>I had earlier purchased the Oral B Triump electric toothbrush from Amazon and our family really likes it.    </li>
            <li>but i dont see any noticeable difference beetween the flosss action heads and regulr</li>
            <li>The old line of Braun brushes were cheaper and also worked well.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s part of the flossing action</li>
            <li>The flossing action of this Oral-B brush head is super-effective.</li>
            <li>I prefer the floss action brushes to the others.</li>

            <li>So far I have no complaints about this style head.  </li>
            <li>I find my teeth are much cleaner than with a traditional tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>They are the Oral-B Floss Action brush heads.</li>
            <li>The ones I received are definitely the real deal.</li>
            <li>(we also like the Sonicare Elite &amp; the Braun OralB Sonic Complete.)</li>
            <li>So instead of cleaning better than the regular heads, these are larger and harder to maneuver around your teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>They work very well though I do think that the brushes that are included with the toothbrush last longer than the replacements.</li>
            <li>Of course it fits my old Oral-B Braun toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My Braun/Oral B electric toothbrush is getting old now</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended these floss action heads and we have used them exclusively every since.</li>
            <li>especially  got this one with flossers really help</li>
            <li>The brush head being too big, puts too much pressure on the gums which is not recommended by dentists.</li>
            <li>After each use, your gums and teeth feel like you&#x27;ve had a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Have upgraded my Oral-B Professional system and purchased for grandkids.</li>
            <li>, I buy the these floss action brush heads.  </li>
            <li>The Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Heads leave my teeth</li>
            <li>I could never go back to a manual tooth brush knowing how much cleaner my teeth get with these.</li>
            <li>I like my Oral B electric toothbrush and the Floss Action Replacement Head works well for me.</li>
            <li>I got my adult bracez on a couple years ago and this toothbrush is all I need.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Oral-B Floss Action Brush Head helps to remove a substantial amount of plaque, which is the bacterium that attacks our teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>I use the Oral-B Floss Action Brush in conjunction with flossing.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B Floss Action Brush has a spinning and oscillating movement that helps to remove the excess plaque between teeth and at the gum line.  </li>
            <li>Although this is NOT a substitute for flossing, it will deliver much cleaner teeth and gums than a regular brushing.  </li>
            <li>Durable so far.</li>
            <li>My wife and I both use these Oral-B floss action brush heads.</li>
            <li>Im gonna keep my old brush head for cleaning my jewelry.</li>
            <li>The Floss Action is my fave of all the brush heads.</li>
            <li>My wife and I use a Braun Professional Care toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These heads are for a floss-like action.  </li>
            <li>It is too much hassle to ship it back now.</li>
            <li>I have had no cavities, and cleaner teeth since upgrading to the 9000 with the floss action, so I guess they do work well.</li>
            <li>and I ordered the Floss Action 3 pack to replace my old brush head.  </li>
            <li>also states that you should always use a soft brush.</li>
            <li>The Floss Action plastic bristles even broke off.  </li>
            <li>I do always choose this Oral B Floss Action 3pack brush head refill.</li>
            <li>But I guess the security of knowing that these are not knock offs is the only real price justification for these.</li>
            <li>B004U7RKYI Oral-B Professional Care 1000]].</li>
            <li>every tooth is cleaned completely.  </li>
            <li>though I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever noticed any &amp;#34;floss action.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve also recently discovered the Oral-B DualAction Premium Power Toothbrush Head Refills which are not only cheaper but also seem to do a more thorough job – perhaps simply because the brush head is bigger.</li>
            <li>in addition, oral B said you can also get them from theessentials.com and drugstore.com.[[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Head 3 Count]]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this floss action brushes with my triumph for years</li>
            <li>and this is now old technology.</li>
            <li>arrived at time, as advertise.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an old user of Oral B brush heads.</li>
            <li>So kudos to Oral-B for the innovation of the Floss Action.</li>
            <li>I use this head with my Oral-B Professional Care 5000.</li>
            <li>i did not need the floss action but, the smoother heads.</li>
            <li>so I bought this one, the Oral B Floss Action.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using Oral B Floss Action brush heads for years.  </li>
            <li>brush heads are like they state, a flossing action type brush head.</li>
            <li>recommend for people with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>It really is an improvement from the earlier versions I have been using.  </li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]]      </li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]]  </li>
            <li>Bought these directly from Amazon and ended up receiving counterfeit product.</li>
            <li>a smaller mouth, this seems to work real well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been ordering the Oral B Floss Action brush heads from Amazon for over a year.  </li>
            <li>my gums have entirely stopped bleeding and the gum condition looks much healthier.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap look alikes</li>
            <li>The floss action replacements are my preferred brush in the Oral-B Pro Series.</li>
            <li>this floss action toothbrush</li>
            <li>No issues with this product so far</li>
            <li>Says floss action</li>
            <li>I chose this because of the floss action and I would reccomend this to everyone.  </li>
            <li>I used the Floss Action for 6 months (replaced every 3 mos.)</li>
            <li>Wow - what a difference.  </li>
            <li>I believe these are a relative bargain in comparison to the Sonicare heads which are much pricier.</li>
            <li>The floss action brush was of no use since it won&#x27;t work on my brush</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t exactly soft sensitive.</li>
            <li>Just cover the areas of your teeth softly and repeatedly.</li>
            <li>So far, my teeth look cleaner</li>
            <li>Now that I have the  floss action brushes by mistake, I think I will stick with them.</li>
            <li>but i prefer the sensitive gum one.</li>
            <li>The real deal...not generic as some were saying they received</li>
            <li>Also, delivering time and packaging are indicate for those people are professional.</li>
            <li>and these brush heads are better than the round heads unless you have a very tiny mouth</li>
            <li>So i switched the configuration to this item, it is somewhat more expensive but worth</li>
            <li>I am very happy with brushes as well as the electronic base.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think the product is good</li>
            <li>Works great but will go back to what I was using as it is a little stiff and my gums need something softer but someone looking for firmer brush will probably like it.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes and my dentist can definitely tell a difference when compared to the plain old toothbrush.</li>
            <li>While they seem to get your teeth cleaner, and quicker, they can damage gums, possibly enamel, so many dentists do not recommend stiff bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well several months later and I was right.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not disappointed but will probably be going back to the easier to maneuver regular version next time.  </li>
            <li>I was a little excited by the price and missed the flossing bit.</li>
            <li>The other ones wear out immediately and also don&#x27;t fit the appliance well, so they pinched my lip as I brushed.</li>
            <li>I started using the standard Oral-B toothbrushes and even found that other manufacturers made toothbrushes that would fit at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>My original brush head seemed like they had harder bristles, which I personally like.  </li>
            <li>these work fine, but Oral-B keeps revising the toothbrush head line-up in ways that its hard to figure out what you&#x27;re buying, and how the new heads compare to the old ones I used to use.  </li>
            <li>They felt clean with the round head, but wow, they felt like I had just visited the dentist after using these.</li>
            <li>However, the product tends to wear down quickly.</li>
            <li>I have been using the brush for a few days and I have a doubt whether it is original.</li>
            <li>The mechanical rotary action wears out long before the bristles show any significant color change from blue to white.</li>
            <li>The problem only occurred when I used Direct Super Center which is offered thru Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I bought this 3-pack from DAB Nutrition (a.k.a. Direct Super Center or Potential Dynamix LLC), but they sold me knock-offs.  </li>
            <li>They took this much more seriously.  </li>
            <li>After market brushes do not fit well or clean as well.  </li>
            <li>And when I received them the main packaging was open.  </li>
            <li>Well, a few days ago,it first pinched the inside of my cheek,then the whole head fell apart in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>pretty sure I received fake ones.  </li>
            <li>The Floss Action heads are a bit larger than the normal heads</li>
            <li>I have been on automatic refills for 1 1/2 years and just noticed that the price they are charging for the next refill is much higher even with the 15% discount than for what I can order it for (from  the same seller offering the 15% discount).  </li>
            <li>These brush heads will get your teeth significantly cleaner than not only a manual toothbrush but also other electric tooth brush heads.</li>
            <li>I love how the small brushed allow you to manicure each tooth.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t seen them at CVS or similar stores, though this particular model was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li>Oral-B is same as Braun which is a German manufacturer of many electric appliances that last and last and last.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be nice if the price was a little less</li>
            <li>the font on the back of the package is much thicker than that on the real one, the \\&quot;2\\&quot; attached to the 2nd picture on the back of the package is lacking the shadow, and the pictures are fuzzy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush head as it helps act like a floss for those who don&#x27;t regularly floss.</li>
            <li>The things I like about it are: 1)the small brush makes it easy to reach way in the back area that&#x27;s hard to reach with a regular toothbrush; 2) I didn&#x27;t realize that I don&#x27;t have to use that much toothpaste as I did before; and 3) my teeth feels really clean!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to change them when the light blue color fades to about half way.</li>
            <li>Previously purchased some generic brand replacement brush heads for dirt cheap and</li>
            <li>With free shipping from Amazon, the price was about $0.30 less than the same product at Target.  </li>
            <li>you can easily get 6 months based on average usage as long as bristles not frayed.</li>
            <li>The yellow hard bristles get as far as possible in between your teeth to really help clean up well!</li>
            <li>I am now going to contact Direct Super Center and Amazon about this issue, but I have a feeling that Direct Super Center won&#x27;t help, after reading other comments posted here.    </li>
            <li>I learned how much I like my toothbrush when I dropped my last brush head in the toilet and my new ones were not here yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the fakes are off the market or not, but if you&#x27;re on the fence just order, then give Amazon a call if the ones you get aren&#x27;t genuine...</li>
            <li>/&gt;These ones say &#x27;floss action&#x27; which apparently equates to some rubber bristles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced it really matters what heads you have, as long as you have an Oral-B toothbrush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my first of these and they work as expected.</li>
            <li>Gonna get a normal brush head next time.</li>
            <li>This oral B replacement heads are a bit rough when you first start using them.</li>
            <li>Wow, I looked high and low for the refills to my Oral B Floss at my local drug store and other well known stores, as well as online stores, but could not find the this brand or the price was too high!!!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit tight enough.</li>
            <li>The construction of the toothbrush head is such that build-up of deposits is unavoidable, there is a big oblong cavity in the front and back of the toothbrush and also 6 smaller ones at back, where fluids while brushing can easily go in but cannot be flushed out.</li>
            <li>The heads clean well and lasts as long as expected.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how complicated it is dealing with Amazon to get the right ones which may actually may be of more interest to buyers than a review of the brushes themselves.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m single and there is no need to buy a large amount.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the extra brushes along with a new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product so I can have extra refills for the new Oral B 9400 Power Toothbrush I bought.</li>
            <li>Can go through them quickly, new to order about double the amount.  </li>
            <li>These are the same replacement heads that are on my new Oral B toothbrush.</li>
            <li>they are on sale for $18.99/3-pack, plus a $3 coupon on the order, plus a $3 instant rebate per pack,plus an additional 15% discount for new customers, plus no shipping charges on orders over $25, plus, no sales tax from NJ..</li>
            <li>Second one did not last much longer.</li>
            <li>I actually wanted the professional &#x27;precision clean&#x27; type which was not available on the website which was a shame.  </li>
            <li>I was using the standard brush that came with my professional care pack, but wanted to give the floss action a try.</li>
            <li>I also bleed when I floss for the first time in a long while (same idea).</li>
            <li>They also last pretty long.</li>
            <li>However, as a dental professional, I would advise that those with sensitive gums or receding gums alternate between a manual toothbrush and this power toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The plastic in these brush heads is breaking and they do not sit right on the brush handle, also the bristles are harder and of a different make than genuine heads, these things are already bothering my gums and have the potential of causing serious dental damage, this is a real shame Amazon...</li>
            <li>About a year later, I put the same Floss Action head on an Oral B Smart Series 5000 and it was totally different.</li>
            <li>After a few more uses the whole head feel apart as the small metal pieces came unscrewed.</li>
            <li>Major accomplishment.</li>
            <li>I have been using these for the past three years, as they originally came with my 9000 series.</li>
            <li>The product lasts long and it has a clear indicator of when to choose the new brush head.</li>
            <li>This three-pack typically lasts quite long and you can find a $5 coupon from Oral-B/Amazon(displayed on the page when available) to make the deal even sweeter.</li>
            <li>The first thing you need to get use to is the slightly \\&quot;rougher\\&quot; brushing action.  </li>
            <li>It was a little uncomfortable brushing at first, but now I look forward to brushing my teeth in the morning because the floss action does such a good job and my teeth look and feel cleaner.</li>
            <li>little pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>One photo of a putative fake is identical to the packaging used recently by Oral B, snd the genuine packaging has changed even more recently.  </li>
            <li>First time I used them, my gums were a little sore from the floss action.....</li>
            <li>The brush portion itself is slightly larger than on the &#x27;standard&#x27; ones, but not so large as to present a problem.</li>
            <li>My dentist warned me that if I keep brushing my teeth too hard, my gums will continue to bleed and I will experience many problems in the long term.</li>
            <li>With the chemical damage to my teeth from acids in the mouth apparently accelerated by the loss of enamel, today my dentist showed me current photographs of my teeth compared to 4 years ago, before using these floss action bristles.</li>
            <li>They have a serial number, the Oral B marking can&#x27;t be scratched off with a finger nail, the packaging is properly labeled with crystal clear lettering, the colors on the bristles are spot on - no dye smudging.  </li>
            <li>The generic heads are the ones you want to steer clear of....</li>
            <li>I also only use a dab of toothpaste, so it really lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>The device contains storage for 4 brushes and is clearly intended for use by multiple users.</li>
            <li>However, this seller sent me completely different brushes from what&#x27;s clearly being advertised on the page and in the photos.  </li>
            <li>They are the real thing that works and last relatively long unlike store name replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>I recommend getting the smaller brush heads for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather go with the regular brushes than the floss action ones -</li>
            <li>you can feel the deep cleaning action.</li>
            <li>They are, however, about 25% larger and the bristles are not as soft.</li>
            <li>I had intended to order this same brush head, but the reviews on the Floss Action brush head refill intrigued me.</li>
            <li>So, my fault for not noticing until I&#x27;d opened and actually started using one of these, but I received what looks to be the &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; heads instead of the floss action heads that are in the description.</li>
            <li>and i bought Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill, after looking up the same product at amazon.</li>
            <li>So now I have gone back to the softer heads without the floss action.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the last brush head and was not expecting to have to replenish my supply this early.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely buy the Floss Action heads in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the Oral B 5000, the RPM seemed faster and smoother, and the Floss Action heads felt the same as the Precision heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My purchase was from a 3rd party but it was direct from Amazon&#x27;s inventory.</li>
            <li>I think its floss action is an add to regular brushing</li>
            <li>I purchase them only when they come directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I prefer this over the standard head because of the floss action addition.</li>
            <li>I currently have them and am not returning them to Amazon, but am contacting Braun directly.  </li>
            <li>Bought this product last year from Direct Home and Garden.</li>
            <li>We use this brush along with the sensitive head brush to alternate.  </li>
            <li>I went with the Floss Action model just because it was $2 cheaper (gotta pinch those pennies nowadays) for the refill pack compared to the Precision head model that comes standard on the $12 Oral-B Vitality brush.  </li>
            <li>I had a floss action brush head and a regular flex head before</li>
            <li>This is definitely the way to go to replace the brush heads on the Oral-B Professional Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Tried buying an off brand and didn&#x27;t get anywhere near the same results.  </li>
            <li>THIS COMBINATION OF BRUSHES, THE FLOSS ACTION AND THE DEEP SWEEP LEAVES MY TEETH</li>
            <li>The Floss Action Brush Head is a terrific flossing agent.</li>
            <li>If you have an Oral-B Floss Action Electric Toothbrush, definitely buy these heads for it.</li>
            <li>(I suppose I used the soft ones the last time I ordered).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Floss Action works well for the back teeth.</li>
            <li>I will definitely reorder the floss action brushes.</li>
            <li>Flossing action yellow tabs give you a cleaner gum stimulated feeling!</li>
            <li>But I personally find that they do not last any where near as long as the real thing.</li>
            <li>so the flossing action is a big plus.</li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon and after 30 minutes and having to speak to the manager they refunded only the ones bought directly from Amazon.   </li>
            <li>Each Oral-B Floss action brush should last between 3 – 4 months, when the bristle colors start to fade and the bristles start to spread the brush is worn out</li>
            <li>When I ordered this one, I ordered directly from Amazon and did not look for generic or cheaper prices.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of different heads and theFloss Action</li>
            <li>Although they say they are floss action, they do not come close to using regular floss, as they can not get all the way between the teeth, and below the gum line.</li>
            <li>I noticed an improvement in plaque removal over time at dental cleanings, as compared to the brush head without the yellow floss action paddles.</li>
            <li>Wow, I am so amazed that I&#x27;m not the only person who has a problem with replacement brushes (RB) falling off and scratching one&#x27;s tongue/cheeks/lower face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are definitely more expensive than generic non-electric toothbrushes, but for the money they will save us on dental work in the long run, they are well worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same old thing, give them the razor and make them pay through the nose for blades.</li>
            <li>I floss regularly with dental floss, so it&#x27;s not like my gums are too sensitive.  </li>
            <li>My dentist noticed immediatly that my gumms were irrtated and recommended that I stop using this and switch back to Sonicare, which I had used for nearly 20 years until their planned obscelence ticked me off.  </li>
            <li>My shifting from manual to electric toothbrushes years ago helped keep my teeth ivory white and cavity-free and, for me, the simple rotating head with two types of bristles was very satisfactory, but when I switched to this head with paddles and three bristle types, dental hygiene actually improved.</li>
            <li>so you are not left holding an old yucky brush</li>
            <li>They work well on the Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep Brush.  </li>
            <li>Teeth feel cleaner and look whiter than the &#x27;professional&#x27; brush that comes as standard equipment.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought it was just something wrong with my toothbruth.  </li>
            <li>Can you believe how expensive the refills are for electric toothbrushes, but I am hooked on the electric kind.  </li>
            <li>It might be interesting to note that the periodontal disease isn&#x27;t getting worse, and on some teeth is even disappearing.</li>
            <li>Using the slightly larger brush on the floss action takes a little bit of getting used to, but my teeth felt cleaner right after brushing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For an item of personal sanitary use, I would have expected the refill brushes to have been delivered in their original packaging, Rather each was loose, in a baggie.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s quite a bit more drag and a stiff penalty to pay for potentially improved cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the floss action.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how the other reviewers got a sub-standard (read fake) product, but I made pretty sure that this was a genuine Oral B replacement.</li>
            <li>By &amp;#34;feel cleaner&amp;#34; I mean that my teeth feel totally smooth afterward, no rough deposits or anything else is missed by these heads.</li>
            <li>so I will replace them regularly rather than run out and wait until I drive over to the big box store, that way I always have a new brush.</li>
            <li>that do the &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; feel odd at first</li>
            <li>After using it for less than 6 months, it was the first time ever</li>
            <li>The first brush broke after less than a month.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if these are the same as the brushes that come with the original toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;These broke at the junction of the moving head and the extension that fits on the brush</li>
            <li>Flossing became difficult for when I lost most of the use of my right hand due to a stroke.</li>
            <li>We use several different Oral-B brush head types, and all meet the same high quality standards that come with the Oral-B brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was using the larger brush head with two parts, the Oral-B Dual Clean, for the past four months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had the need to floss my teeth in nearly a year thanks to the little (rubber?) strips in the brushhead.</li>
            <li>Price is also much cheaper on Amazon than in grocery or other stores</li>
            <li>due to not being to floss as much.  </li>
            <li>This product seems flimsy, but has lasted longer than the other brushheads I have purchased, so I would consider buying again so long as the price is right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned my lesson the hard way and will only order the genuine Oral-B from now on.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the posters who put up the pictures to know the difference between the fake and genuine brush heads.</li>
            <li>After switched, I brushed much cleaner and my gums are less sensitive.</li>
            <li>Oral B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Heads just as expected in photo!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>B003UKM90Q Oral-B Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush, Blue and White]].  </li>
            <li>I even stopped drinking red wine and tried everything to get the stains off that had become semi permanent but nothing worked except a professional cleaning, which then lasted only a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I might go to a local chain drugstore or the oral-B site directly for the next couple packs.</li>
            <li>After many years of getting the head shake from the dentist, I randomly swapped to electric toothbrush and these floss action heads.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing the extra soft heads to try next, after these three need to be replaced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a couple different Oral-B electric rechargeable toothbrushes over the years and am currently using the Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>With these here, the brush heads all started coming loose easily move back and forth after only a few weeks.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com\\&quot; is the only choice, no other vendors.  </li>
            <li>The jury is out on how well the bristles will hold up compared to the regular version which lasts me at least 4 months, I have a feeling it will not last quite as long because of the more intricate brush design.  </li>
            <li>I was a little worried to buy these based on other reviews, but I received genuine Oral-B replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>When I looked at it I thought it would not clean good in the corners of the teeth since the round brush is not fully round</li>
            <li>They have the same round top but they also have a down portion that makes the cleaning area much bigger.</li>
            <li>It says the only thing to use a medium or hard brush on are to clean car</li>
            <li>Floss Action heads are similar to the standard Precision heads, but have 4 extra rubber paddles for \\&quot;flossing action\\&quot;  or removing some stains.</li>
            <li>pretty firm but works well.</li>
            <li>Takes some getting used to at first, but after a few days, my teeth and gums got used to the &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; cleaning that these brushes provide.  </li>
            <li>Bought from &amp;#34;sold and shipped&amp;#34; by Amazon and I was comparing to my original one and looked the same but the new one doesn&#x27;t fit flush to the pole base.  </li>
            <li>Yes, the Floss Action heads are a bit bigger, but I think that suits me fine, and you&#x27;ll probably be down with it too unless you&#x27;ve got really small</li>
            <li>The floss action brush heads are advertised as being sold with the Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush; however, these brush heads DO NOT fit that particular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the less expensive Oral-B heads (minus the floss action) and these are far superior.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Actually, even buying from Oral-B&#x27;s Amazon listing was somewhat of a gamble because other reviewers for this particular listing said that they were sent fake/low quality brush heads as well.</li>
            <li>For starters, with any of the Oral B automatic toothbrushes, you let the brush do the work, so you really shouldn&#x27;t press this hard against your teeth like a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving them a 4 rather than 5 due to the high price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never purchased them from Amazon, but based on other reviews, if they are purchase from Amazon through another seller, there is a high risk of them being counterfeit.</li>
            <li>I have been using these oral b floss action brushes for a very long time.</li>
            <li>My dentist appointments are much shorter, I have a lot less plaque.</li>
            <li>Apparantly, the old one was lasting to long.</li>
            <li>Now if I could just find the thin brush tip heads just as easily.</li>
            <li>But if I can save a few bucks with Target&#x27;s generic, then that&#x27;ll be my first choice.</li>
            <li>The width is the same, but the height is about half again as large.</li>
            <li>His view was to go back to the older head due to</li>
            <li>A copy of the original product but not nearly as good.</li>
            <li>Heads began to get loose after a month and then fell off completely.  </li>
            <li>I feel the Floss action is a waste of money, just a way to get a little more out your pocket to brush less.</li>
            <li>I had been using the new Floss Action head only a few weeks when I went to my dentist.</li>
            <li>I really need to find a way to either get these for less or just switch back to regular</li>
            <li>With the Vitality brush, the RPMs weren&#x27;t fast enough or the oscillating action was slightly off causing the Floss Action heads to hurt my gums a little.</li>
            <li>- this is the very definition of average!</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for but little bits of plastic shouldn&#x27;t cost this much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The little paddle brushes in these heads really gets between the teeth</li>
            <li>I think they wear out a little fast, but they are cheaper than in store.</li>
            <li>The cheaper ones come off while brushing your teeth, do not rotate, and in general fail to complete the mission of getting your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;actually flossing between your teeth and the little rubber pieces seem to protect the bristles and make them last so much longer.</li>
            <li>For whatever reason these new brush heads aren&#x27;t lasting near as long as the previous.  </li>
            <li>The packaging clearly states that this does not fit the Vitality Sonic, Sonic Complete, Pulsonic, or CrossAction Power toothbrushes.  </li>

            <li> everthing is ok!</li>
            <li> Might as well get the most out of brushing teeth!</li>

            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> and we LOVE our electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Easy to purchase for a great price.</li>
            <li> it is very cheap and good</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves if they were genuine are great, I have used them for three years.    </li>
            <li> They do a great job, even longer than you&#x27;d expect (and even after the indicator bristles go light).</li>
            <li> and you honestly feel like you just came from the dentist its amazing.  </li>
            <li> your teeth feel amazing after brushing with these&lt;br</li>
            <li> They fit great and can be used for guests if they forgot their tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Great fit on my Oral-B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> these heads work great and can be used as your primary head.</li>
            <li> which is kind of a pain.  </li>
            <li> Upon arrival of UPS today, I was alarmed that I would received a knockoff since the return address on the Amazon box stated \\&quot;Rose Kiszner from KY\\&quot; instead of Amazon.     </li>
            <li> I just wish there was a cheaper alternative that was as effective.</li>
            <li> I would say that these brush heads were either some kind of knock-off, or maybe someone found a way to sell the brush heads that were rejected in production.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been really effective in removing particles from between teeth.</li>
            <li> what kind of service in our own land.</li>
            <li> If you own the Triumph Toothbrush -- you can&#x27;t beat this price for the refills.    </li>
            <li> I wonder if anyone would like this kind?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s doing a good job.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I each haave our own Oral Bs..</li>
            <li> The packaging was good, I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I was alway taught to brush my teeth for 2 min, to be effective.</li>
            <li> and I thought the \\&quot;flossing action\\&quot; would be a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li> Effective brush head for cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> I liked it so well</li>
            <li> Nice product and</li>
            <li> I wish I would have started using a good electronic toothbrush many years ago.  </li>
            <li> My Oral-B just keeps on going and these relacement heads are perfect and so reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I love these brush heads and this was a good price.</li>
            <li> The whole family uses these - these are the best.  </li>
            <li> This brush head is excellent because it really loosens up and removes between teeth particles.</li>
            <li> They also brush the gums nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice product, fits my Oral B Vitality.</li>
            <li> The goods arrived on time and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> Reliable and effective.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with that.</li>
            <li> To be honest</li>
            <li> I liked it.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re authentic and doing a good job.</li>
            <li> Nice replacement pack</li>

            <li> fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li> Even my dentists over the years are always asking what kind of electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> These really do a nice job of oral cleaning.</li>
            <li> I get the replacement brush heads through the Amazon Subscribe and Save program which makes it really nice, both in price and convenience.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and much cheaper than going to store to buy</li>
            <li> and this brush really cleans thing up for me better than anything I have used before!!!</li>
            <li> If you have used Oral-B electric brushes, you are already familiar with how it does its job which IMO is great for maintaining your dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> but if you have a decent size mouth (LOL!)</li>
            <li> It is better to use dental floss because it works 100x more effectively and does not hurt!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great and really clean well.</li>
            <li> These brush heads work great and leave your mouth feeling clean and refreshed.</li>

            <li> I can obtain a great clean feeling with these brush heads, and with that polished feeling of course comes whiter teeth.  </li>
            <li> Tho I think prices for these brushes are too high, regardless of where purchased, I found Amazon had the absolutely best price offered anywhere.  </li>
            <li> Awesome perfect fit as expected.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and does a good job.  </li>

            <li> As heads go for Oral B, I think they are the best as they have good strong brush action.  </li>

            <li> Of all the Oral-B brush head options, the floss action head seems to do the best job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> The Oral B brush head is the best \\&quot;floss action brushing\\&quot; tool on the market.  </li>
            <li> The Oral B Floss Action brush is not the greatest.</li>
            <li> These Floss Action heads are the perfect replacements for my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I am 30 yrs old and got my best checkup ever from my dentist after using these for 6 months.</li>
            <li> I will update more after her 1st check up since getting the braces on to review how effective they have been.</li>
            <li> I find the cleaning capability of the Floss Action brush to be excellent.</li>
            <li> This combo of Oral B Floss Action and a compatible Oral B power handle (8 or 9 thousand series) is the best I have used.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best brushheads you can get it.</li>
            <li> My kids also use this product with great success.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best.  </li>
            <li> Floss Action heads are the best!</li>
            <li> It is easier to use and more effective.</li>
            <li> I will now purchase the drug store brand of these brushes which will be considerably more cost effective.</li>
            <li> By far, this is the best tooth cleaning system out there...</li>
            <li> good and cheap.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement brushes, these floss action brushes do the job.</li>
            <li> Floss action bristles are the best of the lot in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> but it sure is nice to use.</li>
            <li> They give a real clean feeling like you&#x27;ve been to the dentist for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> When I popped these out of the packaging, I was thrilled to have authentic brush heads.</li>
            <li> Finding brand name replacement Floss Action brush heads at this price was great!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush head beautifully cleans and flosses, leaving teeth &amp; gums fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li> I like the Oral B products a lot they are great and good for their money, I have the Oral B tooth brush, so I got this to replace the heads when I need a new one, it arrive on time and</li>
            <li> awesome clean feeling and do not be scared of how they feel at first.</li>
            <li> beside the fact that they raised the prices than originally started, its still a good buy.</li>
            <li> The 3 pack brush heads are another attachment for the great Oral B toothbrush which does such as great job on our teeth.</li>
            <li> Good deal, but they have I think better prices at Costco for these though if you want to get a huge supply, just saying.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are so good for getting my teeth clean and at a lot lower price through this seller than anywhere else I have compared prices for them.</li>
            <li> Pretty great replacements.</li>
            <li> As for the brush I could not ask for better preformance,my teeth feel real clean after use</li>
            <li> works great, super easy to change out</li>
            <li> These are good replacement brush heads (I have an Oral-B Healthy Clean Precision 1000).  </li>
            <li> good product, arrived quickly, would recommend</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and was a good price for the amount or brush heads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bristles rubs against your teeth very nicely and it gives you the feeling as if you first leave the dentist&#x27;s office after a cleaning.</li>
            <li> They were new, in perfect condition, and a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> This particular brush head is the best I have ever used for getting my teeth and gums really clean.</li>
            <li> heads a try using the Oral B Vitality motor unit and thought the Floss Action heads weren&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Well you know what, most people are \\&quot;average\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Finally, This head feels the best.</li>
            <li> However, I got used to it quite fast, and it does a great job of keeping the flossing requirements to a minimum.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner and my mouth is more refreshed.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this head but ordered it anyway.  </li>
            <li> however more than than i think</li>
            <li> This is a top quality product.</li>
            <li> Better keep flossing and brushing separate.</li>
            <li> Fits and cleans my teeth much better than Braun Oral-B Extrasoft,   &lt;br /&gt;Flexisoft and Interspace Brushheads.</li>
            <li> The wife likes more compact models, as this takes up more counter space than some of the others, but the others do not brush as well and others do not have replaceable brushes.</li>
            <li> i have much more control.</li>
            <li> Works great, teeth look whiter and feel super clean.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush</li>
            <li> Love Oral B, but</li>
            <li> these seem to be more of a gimmick than anything else and my dental hygienist agrees.  </li>
            <li> This one is just OK.</li>
            <li> I like the thought that I might be getting a better cleaning between the teeth, which is an area of concern to my hygienist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many of them thru Amazon</li>
            <li> love the tooth brush too.. used several electric tooth brushes this one does best cleaning</li>
            <li> I was just reading through tons of 1 star reviews on these because many, many people have received fakes.</li>
            <li> I think this is the most effective of the brush heads offered by Oral B that fit my unit.  </li>
            <li> As proof even my dental checkups have been better.  </li>
            <li> But I think the results are much more than what I may get by just paying more attention.    </li>
            <li> I exclusively used these heads for a year, though my dentist was happy with the cleanliness of my teeth, he noticed much faster gum loss.  </li>
            <li> Our teeth are cleaner and in much better health.</li>
            <li> They work well, and I love the oral B toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> With 3 heads in a pack and the change the head with the change of season guidelines, I end up with too many surplus heads.  </li>
            <li> They acted more like bumpers than anything else.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works well at cleaning my teeth, and it is compatible with most Oral B brush motors.</li>
            <li> They do a dramatically better job of brushing between teeth and up along the gum line.</li>
            <li> Healthy gums &#x3D; healthy teeth</li>
            <li> P&amp;G.  P&amp;G reimbursed me by sending me a coupon for some authentic brush heads.    </li>
            <li> Fantastic!    </li>
            <li> Have purchased this before, love the quality and the price.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this item and I am very happy with the product, price and service.</li>
            <li> Glad we did, though.</li>
            <li> but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite heads for my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I love these brush heads.  </li>
            <li> But wait, there&#x27;s more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Triumph system for about 3 months now and during my dentist visit he said my gums are notably tighter then before.      </li>
            <li> Under the price, where it says \\&quot;Sold By\\&quot; make sure that it says \\&quot;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com.\\</li>
            <li> and I get mush better results.</li>
            <li> really much better than the OralB they replaced in getting the plaque off the lower teeth.     </li>
            <li> : I have continued to purchase the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brush heads in a 3-pack on a subscription basis and am quite pleased with that product and with the subscription service.</li>
            <li> Check out the pictures with the notes at the top of the page, the brush heads amazon sent me</li>
            <li> The hygenist even commented that I must be flossing better, which I haven&#x27;t been at all.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product and the price.</li>
            <li> this was a christmas gift for my son and he love the idea of floss brushes so he doesn&#x27;t have to use the wax string</li>
            <li> We have a DD w/braces &amp; have been concerned about her not being able to floss as often as she could w/out them</li>
            <li> What more can I say?  </li>
            <li> But this site requires more words</li>
            <li> That said, many of the brushes sold here as Oral-B have been fakes.  </li>
            <li> I may continue ordering these here, but I&#x27;m still not 100% confident Amazon shut out the fakes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be glad to update this review in a couple months if these heads don&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li> The more I use these \\&quot;gimmick\\&quot; attachments the more</li>
            <li> but I assume it covers more area and gets in between teeth.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with product....</li>
            <li> Make sure you buy the ones made by Oral B.</li>
            <li> As they say, \\&quot;two heads are better than one\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this company when need more.</li>
            <li> I never did 600 manual strokes, more like 100.</li>
            <li> The amazon price is a lot better than what you&#x27;ll find in the store, especially with the subscribe and save discount, so these were a great find!</li>
            <li> I should have known better when I received the package.</li>
            <li> I noticed the brush head wiggled alot more.</li>
            <li> I love my Oral-B toothbrush</li>
            <li> I had to wonder if these were even authentic Oral-B products.  </li>
            <li> I switched to these about 3 years ago and my dentist visits get better each time.  </li>
            <li> They keep the gums healthy too.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love these flossing heads.  </li>
            <li> I love my Oral B.  </li>
            <li> , my husband asked me to get more so he can use them too.</li>
            <li> They do the job and more.  </li>
            <li> You are better off with these.</li>
            <li> Nothing more to say but, buy them.  </li>
            <li> I love it....</li>
            <li> SO MANY DO.</li>
            <li> I have purchased before and am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> but these are much better.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job and will never go back to manual brushing again.  </li>
            <li> Those are easily my favorite replacement for my electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My favorite brush heads.</li>
            <li> 6/13 just went to the dentist and without mentioning anything the hygienist said I appeared to be brushing better.  </li>
            <li> The floss action heads are incredible.</li>
            <li> I wish I should have bought more as the price has increased.</li>
            <li> Getting three heads at a time means I will probably replace the head as scheduled and not continue to use it after it has mostly worn out.  </li>
            <li> Love these brushes.</li>
            <li> Feels a lot more substantial than the std brush heads.</li>
            <li> I would buy more if my needs require it.</li>
            <li> but I do think (having used both kinds) that this brush reaches every part of the tooth better.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I needed more and they get the job done.  </li>
            <li> I am perfectly satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.</li>
            <li> They fit the handle I own.  </li>
            <li> better than warehouse price.  </li>
            <li> They cost more but they work well.  </li>
            <li> My hubby and I love this.</li>
            <li> I think these brushes are a bit more thorough in the brushing process.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re way better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My gums and teeth appear to be in better shape.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?  </li>
            <li> Oral B is just better.</li>
            <li> The top of the brush head sticks</li>
            <li> 100 times better than the default brush I got with mine.</li>
            <li> Make sure to check what you receive before opening your package of heads to use them.</li>
            <li> This 3 pack was a lot more pricier than the 5 pack I had purchased a year ago.</li>
            <li> Ok, frankly it is probably more having to do with the fact that i started brushing more, started brushing for 2 minutes with an electric vs. 30 seconds with a handheld, started a vigorous prescription mouthwash treatment, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are more oval shaped than the brush head that came with my tooth brush, but that&#x27;s not noticeable in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> These brush heads really make your teeth and the spaces between feel great.  </li>
            <li> Glad that Amazon carries them.</li>
            <li> I would still recommend them since Oral-B is at the top, but I wish they would lower the price a bit.</li>
            <li> Love this product and works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> My favorite replacement brushes for my toothbrush.</li>

            <li> better than paying more elsewhere...</li>
            <li> when I started using these I started bleeding - which makes me think that these bristles are getting below my gum line better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that it did any better at cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It is not a substitute for floss, however and I&#x27;m still able to get visible amounts of gunk from between my teeth after brushing.</li>
            <li> I was glad for the warning and pictures to check to make sure that the problem had been solved.  </li>
            <li> but i have purchased these more than once and have always received authentic toothbrush heads at a fraction of the drug store price.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Oral B brush for years and was very happy with the Oral B Pro White Head</li>
            <li> I bought these to go with the toothbrush I purchased which I love.  </li>
            <li> Have been using these for over 2 years and my teeth look visibly better and gets the food particles from the gaps.</li>

            <li> most stores.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I love the most</li>
            <li> more do you need?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> was amazed how much better my teeth were.  </li>
            <li> They do a better job of cleaning for me, penetrating deeper into the teeth gaps and gum layer.  </li>
            <li> Finally, This head feels the best.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite heads.  </li>
            <li> I plan on buying more, these seem to be my favorite</li>
            <li> Love this, have bought many times, cleans your teeth like a pro.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Feels like it does a better job than the toothbrush head that came with toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The 3 count replacement heads are more than $7 each.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re doing a lot better on dental health with the Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an Oral-B toothbrush for years, and this is my favorite brush head.  </li>
            <li> I love these brush heads.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product quality.</li>
            <li> I thought of sanitising the toothbrush by dipping in boiling water, or hydrogen peroxide or alcohol or using a UV or ultrasonic cleaner and called up the 1800 number on the website to check if this is a safe method.</li>
            <li> I have used my Oral B electric toothbrush for more than 10 years.  </li>
            <li> they did not appear to be authentic Oral-B product with no response.  </li>
            <li> Ok, the tooth brush heads are great and hold up very well even beyond the 3 month recommended changing cycle by dentists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much more efficient than hand brushing.</li>
            <li> Glad they come</li>
            <li> These are my favorite.  </li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> However, I was able to find the product cheaper at Sam&#x27;s Club</li>
            <li> These are the real McCoy, works great, and the Dentist even thinks I floss.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use these on a daily basis, and they are awesome!</li>
            <li> Much better than ones that came with machine</li>
            <li> heartily recommend this for those people who have the appropriate Oral-B / Braun electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The floss head works better than the stock all bristle head for the oral-B electric toothbrush (in my experience).</li>
            <li> I think they do the best job of cleaning teeth properly.</li>
            <li> but these are my favorite.</li>

            <li> I made my very first internet purchase, when I ordered them and am very pleased.</li>

            <li> If you like the Oral B floss action heads this is a good deal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have the original kind.</li>
            <li> so my wife could use it as well as me, and I&#x27;d have refills handy in 3 months when the original heads wore</li>

            <li> , I&#x27;ll just pay a bit more for the precision clean ones because they&#x27;re far superior.</li>
            <li> Love the product, came quickly.</li>
            <li> Love that they ship so quickly.</li>
            <li> These brushes really clean much more than the original brushes that came with my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> after I got there, even with the coupon, Amazon was MUCH lower in price, so I&#x27;m glad I checked!</li>
            <li> answer.&lt;br /&gt;I did buy new brush heads directly from Amazon and they are perfect.</li>
            <li> I had originally used the dual brush head that came with my Oral-B electric toothbrush and liked it very much.</li>
            <li> but if the budget is tight this will be the best choice.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, they are long-lasting, and fit my Oral-B electric toothbrush just fine.</li>
            <li> They fit the toothbrush and work just fine.</li>
            <li> Good bristles that last awhile and easy to apply to mostly any toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> But, Oral-B&#x27;s products quality is very good and all works as expected</li>
            <li> The refills slip on easily and fit just like the original.</li>
            <li> As others have said, research where you buy them because there is a HUGE counterfeit market for these.</li>
            <li> These floss actions bush heads have made a huge difference with my teeth cleaning.  </li>
            <li> THAT WAS HUGE TO ME</li>
            <li> To order from your chart is accurate.  </li>
            <li> Amazon will knock another 15% off plus give free shipping without having to hit the $25 mark.  </li>
            <li> After reading the comments after I had ordered, I was alarmed at the counterfeit market and hoping that I would receive genuine brush heads and not have to return some knock offs.</li>
            <li> These brushes fit my Oral B electric tooth cleaner.  </li>
            <li> All of the brush heads that I have received from Amazon have been genuine Oral-B products.</li>
            <li> great electronic toothbrush, will never go back</li>
            <li> I feel my teeth so smooth and polished after brushing.</li>
            <li> You can find brush heads that fit Oral-B&#x27;s fantastic line of electric toothbrushes cheaper on this website.</li>
            <li> I suggest that you buy these instead, as they&#x27;re the real-deal, Oral-B/Braun produced brush heads that will fit your toothbrush, do what they&#x27;re supposed to do, and won&#x27;t fall apart on you.</li>
            <li> It does do a great brushing and floss at the same time.</li>
            <li> I am not talented/coordinated enough to use floss and this head does a great job getting at bits of food, etc, that might be between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I checked and these appear to be the genuine Oral B.</li>
            <li> These replacements also have the gray, but pass the genuine test.    </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had ours for over ten years now and it still works great.</li>
            <li> Get the genuine item.    </li>
            <li> From what I can tell by inspecting them they appear to be genuine - there is no dye bleed, they have two rings, serial numbers are there, etc.  </li>
            <li> in all, I got 3 of these heads pretty cheap, and they were a pretty good deal, but they may not be for everyone.</li>
            <li> The brush head falls off the handle instead of snapping on like the genuine ones do.</li>
            <li> Received brush heads yesterday and they appear genuine.</li>
            <li> They size of the head is comfortable, compared to the others on the market.</li>
            <li> This is a very reliable effective product.  </li>
            <li> They fit and they work.  </li>
            <li> Your teeth feel as smooth as the day you get them cleaned by the dental hygienist!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So i compared it to a genuine one from walmart, and noticed some differences.  </li>
            <li> and I find it so comfortable.</li>
            <li> so I received free shipping.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price to have healthy gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> Avoid the cheap knockoffs.</li>
            <li> FOR THE 1ST TIME, I ACTUALLY ENJOY BRUSHING MY TEETH AND WITH THIS BRUSH, MY CARPAL TUNNEL DOESN&#x27;T BOTHER ME DURING OR AFTER BRUSHING MY TEETH</li>
            <li> I rarely give out 5-star ratings and with that being said, I am satisfied with these replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I am thankful these are available on line.</li>
            <li> Such a great price for overpriced replacement brush heads, I could not pass this up.</li>
            <li> The brush heads I received were definitely genuine Oral B heads.  </li>
            <li> Cheap made.</li>
            <li> They cost more than the &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; cheaper brushes, but they&#x27;re worth the money.</li>
            <li> As a retired surgeon I know how important that is.</li>
            <li> this Brush heads are great, after brushing it literally gives feeling of super clean teeth and yes floss action do happens since before buying</li>
            <li> Item arrived and fit as it should.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and get&#x27;s the job done.  </li>
            <li> :) They make me smile.</li>
            <li> omg I can&#x27;t stop laughing writing this review, Thanks Colgates for your amazing toothpaste.</li>
            <li> XD Thanks Corona for your amazing beer.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, It took me a while to get used to the smaller brush.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use because it didn&#x27;t fit with my machine.</li>
            <li> Genuine replacements for Oral-B Triumph toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I use this with my deep-cleaning setting on my toothbrush, and it does a great job of cleaning out plaque, and even seems to keep my teeth sparkling white even longer.</li>
            <li> I received genuine Braun brush heads that pass all of the counterfeit tests.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will note, my package was shipped from and sold by Amazon and I received genuine brush heads.</li>
            <li> Feels comfortable on your teeth.  </li>
            <li> They fit on my electric toothbrush and get to cleaning.</li>
            <li> They are somewhat pricey for a cheap guy like me</li>
            <li> two minutes twice daily greatly reduces the Godaweful misery of the biannual dental cleansing ritual.</li>
            <li> This is genuine product which was shipped and sold by Amazon.</li>
            <li> I received the genuine heads not like some people were getting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;they work great and last longer than what box states.</li>
            <li> Wish the dentist would give these away free after a visit.  </li>
            <li> enjoy brushing teeth with it.</li>
            <li> Well made product, fit and finish, works as described...</li>
            <li> To my mind, they are a tad pricey, but I would never go for the cheap ones again.</li>
            <li> It goes without saying that it is essential to get an Brush Head Replacement pack, as the Brush itself is great.</li>
            <li> Wont fit Oral B Pulsonic.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use these toothbrush heads and since I had a free trial of Amazon Prime I wound up purchasing these.  </li>
            <li> Great product, cheaper then the local drug store.</li>
            <li> I bought mine &amp;#34;ships from Amazon.com&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s definitely genuine, made in Germany.</li>
            <li> The round brush heads are the best!!!</li>
            <li> I think their complaints were looked into by Amazon because the ones I received were genuine.  </li>
            <li> This is important to me because if the toothbrush breaks and I end up buying a non-Oral B toothbrush, I don&#x27;t have to worry about ending up with refill brush heads that I won&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> I purchased Oral B Floss action 3 pack head refill thru Amazon, and was delighted with the care and delivery taken by them.</li>
            <li> It is a bit larger than the brush that came with my precision 1000 model toothbrush, it holds a bit more toothpaste &amp; does a superior job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> I tried them all, and this seems to be the most comfortable, and most gentle on the gum.</li>
            <li> The regular replacement brush is good but this is much better.</li>
            <li> I saw the floss action brush head and read a lot of good reviews.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Good replacement brushes for my old Oral-B.</li>
            <li> I also like the Oral B pro white brush heads, but feel these are superior for cleaning since they get between the teeth better and have stronger bristles for plaque removal.</li>
            <li> These are good cause they are soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Timer setting is very useful; great feature for kids to ensure proper cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other types of toothbrushes, but these really work best.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t, look over on the right side of the page where it says, \\&quot;More Buying Choices,\\&quot; and see if you can find one that says Amazon.</li>
            <li> Right after I ordered this product at Amazon, I found a better deal at Costco; that is why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> These heads clean just fine</li>
            <li> Electric toothbrushes really do provide a better and more efficient clean.</li>
            <li> Oral B Action 3 pack brush head refill are as good as the original ones that come with the machine</li>
            <li> These brush heads last longer than the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; brush head that comes with the Oral-B electric toothbrushes -- and longer-lasting means greater value !!</li>
            <li> For me, this is a very powerful whitening brush.    </li>
            <li> Very useful.</li>
            <li> fortunately I get the original refill</li>
            <li> It brushes better then the normal circle head brushes that comes with most Oral-B eletric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Oral-B is better then the normal circle head brushes that comes with most Oral-B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is also starting to love this type and we need to order more often through the subcribe and save option here at Amazon that can save you more money + free shipping every 3 months, or 6 months.</li>
            <li> The Oral B Professional Floss Action replacement brushes are always my favorite, Still have to use floss, but they really work the best for my sonic tooth brush.</li>
            <li> so I am glad to still be able to buy new heads for it.  </li>
            <li> I went in for a cleaning and my hygienist was impressed, particularly since I&#x27;m now pregnant and pregnant women generally have problems with bleeding gums.  </li>
            <li> The new one seems to be able to clean your teeth much much much more efficiently, don&#x27;t skimp out on it.</li>
            <li> I prefer the original, this product, to the &amp;#34;compatible&amp;#34; ones.</li>
            <li> Was pleased with the price and they were exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> You can tell by the unique oscillating rotations that this is a brush with unique features.</li>
            <li> These brushes are identical to the ones packaged with the original Triumph Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> , permanent logo  THANKS AMAZON!  &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> It may be because its my first electric toothbrush and I pay more attention to my brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my Oral B Floss Action 3.</li>
            <li> No difference from the original heads that came with the brush.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t click like the original one.</li>
            <li> As they say....an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure!  </li>
            <li> But they did have these, and at a significantly lower price compared to the Flexisofts, so I decided to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price (with coupon and subscription) is just a fraction what you would pay at retail store and the product is authentic, NOT Fake (</li>
            <li> When I used the original ones and the ones from P&amp;G store, it did not occur.</li>
            <li> My original toothbrush head came with oral B 1000.</li>
            <li> Original brushes never broke off.  </li>
            <li> Replacements came promptly, in original packaging.</li>

            <li> In fact, I have been getting clean bills of health on my dental visits since switching to an electric toothbrush that uses these heads.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the precision clean and dual clean heads.</li>
            <li> Have been using for years and the dentist always comments about how clean my mouth is.</li>

            <li> I bought these for my 12 year old Oral B handle and all I can say is &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34;  The rubber paddles really do swat stuff out from between your teeth and the varied bristles do a great job.  </li>
            <li> They interchange for the type of clean you want.  </li>
            <li> teeth never felt so clean as they do using these heads.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> My dental hygienist suggests that I switch to the Phillips electric brushes, though; she says that the round heads of the Oral-Bs generally do a good job, but aren&#x27;t as effective at removing plaque between the teeth.</li>

            <li> I love these toothbrush heads because they really make your teeth feel squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> The floss action brush heads are the best for a person of decent to normal oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> I have used this kind of brushheads for years and the first 2 days I used my new  brushheads that I used ordered worked fine.</li>
            <li> These floss action brushes are amazing.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected and the convenience of purchasing on line helps a great deal.  </li>
            <li> Not really much else to say about brush heads lol</li>
            <li> At my last appointment my dentist was actually impressed with my apparent flossing skills.</li>
            <li> Great product, performs as expected.</li>
            <li> Feels good, but I think the regular brushes kept my mouth cleaner.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are so much cleaner and in much better shape since I started using these brush heads.  </li>
            <li> I love online shopping, they make my life so much easier.</li>
            <li> Ignore the \\&quot;floss\\&quot; part - that&#x27;s just marketing hype and you better still use a real dental floss.</li>
            <li> I reccomend these to others who need more gentle brushes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months now and find its&#x27; use very utilitarian and enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> I brush for a full 2 minutes (30 seconds as quadrant)and</li>
            <li> They show pictures of the true oral b tooth brush heads compared to the \\&quot;look alikes\\&quot; that are sold to unknowing customers like me.</li>
            <li> sure before you buy toothbrush heads to compare their product to the real thing, they may be selling a look alike.</li>
            <li> Got a good price on these and bought them instead of the &#x27;standard&#x27; brush heads.</li>
            <li> I have a mouth full of crowns and bridges (permanent)</li>
            <li> My teeth feel super clean after every brushing.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using these for several years; and, if you brush in the morning and before you go to bed and most importantly, FLOSS, that will avoid most dental problems.</li>
            <li> but these heads are different, in a good way</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terribly painful or anything</li>
            <li> Overall, good purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered four 3 packs of these brushes because they were such a good deal.</li>
            <li> But overall it is good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product to daily clean.&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> decided to go with these official brush heads sold by Oral-B on Amazon because I have heard of too many horror stories of people buying knock-off brands that have been very disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good value - use daily</li>
            <li> good to buy this thing with such a price</li>
            <li> so you brush your teeth for the full recommended time.</li>
            <li> good to have a pack so you can replace brush on regular basis.</li>
            <li> Price seems good enough to try again.</li>
            <li> These work really well minimizing plaque buildup, cleaning gum pockets and keeping gums healthy etc.  </li>
            <li> I use because my teeth are in such good shape.</li>
            <li> These are good but they don&#x27;t last even 1 month</li>
            <li> Not bad</li>
            <li> Not bad 3 heads for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> got extra 3 flossy action very nicely bundled with healthy clean brush head.</li>
            <li> Well, I was greatly dismayed to find that the brushes shipped to me did not fit my Oral B toothbrush so my advice to buyers is, BE SURE these are the right brushes for your Oral B.  </li>
            <li> First and foremost, you have to make sure you&#x27;re getting the right brush that you want/need.  </li>
            <li> amazon has made it super easy by allowing automatic re order at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The OE brand are much better, provide a better, deeper clean feeling than the generic brand heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazon offered these at a great price, only concern was that they were fake, got it in today and confirmed they were real, good luck to everyone else!</li>
            <li> They clean more aggressively than the normal ones.  </li>
            <li> : I choose this product for the affordability and flexibility and comfortable to use vice flossing and it is working just fine since I do not have to floss as much</li>
            <li> i was told there just wasnt any real work for the hygenist to do, my teeth were very clean.  </li>
            <li> I cannot compare them to other Oral-B brushes but they worked great for me!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great value for a fraction of the price of other electric toothbrushes and their replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> Great product that is extremely overpriced</li>
            <li> I decided to get the floss action replacement heads as opposed to the normal bristle heads to try them out and see if I liked them better.</li>
            <li> Yes the Oral B tooth brushes are quite unique, they do really leave my teeth feeling smooth and clean</li>
            <li> (Perhaps the price of the real ones is worth that alone!!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different heads including the Oral B Duel Clean; however, I find the Floss Action brush head really works best.  </li>
            <li> These are just fine for the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Triumph brush with the floss heads clean your teeth and massage your gums so much more thoroughly and efficiently than regular brushing, it really is quite amazing.</li>
            <li> They leave my teeth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush and have had comments by my dentist about just how immaculate my teeth remain, so I will definitely be purchasing more brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li> The yellow rubber bits gives these heads a hardness that I love and I feel like it cleans my teeth better.</li>
            <li> Super quality.  </li>
            <li> Plaque seems to lessen with use although I am quick in its application.</li>
            <li> and it was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re much better than the regular brush head, which I was always satisfied with.</li>
            <li> For people with a nice, wide mouth and no gum problems, maybe these are OK.</li>
            <li> I love being able to solve a problem quickly and simply.</li>
            <li> , I think I found a simple winning combination for healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Also, it is much better to purchase there here, as they cost over $10 dollars more locally.</li>
            <li> knock-offs fall apart quickly.</li>
            <li> I find that the Oral-B replacement brush heads work better than the generic replacement brush heads that I have been able to buy.</li>
            <li> I love this particular Brush Head.  </li>
            <li> Both are good products and both are getting better every time I wear out one of the units and need to replace it, every few years when it won&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and somewhat of a discount price.</li>
            <li> they ship quickly and i can subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> The variety of bristle strengths and lengths lets it do a super job.</li>
            <li> Best to order extra replacement heads when ordering electric toothbrushes since they should be replaced regularly.</li>
            <li> Fits my oral B. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Quick way to replenish my brush heads.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering more of the same but didn&#x27;t enlarge the picture for a better look.</li>
            <li> The floss action is great for getting a professional cleaning feel at home.</li>
            <li> The genuine item is great: bristles aren&#x27;t harsh, even on very first use.</li>
            <li> No other brand cleans as effectively.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them as a better alternative for your Oral B brush.  </li>
            <li> but sure does a better job than normal toothbrush, also better than regular or &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; brush heads.</li>
            <li> Well, your rechargeable toothbrush is only as good as it&#x27;s brush head, right?</li>
            <li> I was hoping for an even better clean than these standard heads because they certainly look more significant and if I can get close to flossing performance with this type of brush head</li>
            <li> Easy to use, brush is gentle, fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied and will replace these with same again.</li>
            <li> I like it very much!</li>
            <li> more concerned because I have been flossing and brushing more apparently to no avail.</li>
            <li> Make sure you floss normally though - it is not a substitute, just as they have indicated.</li>
            <li> can get for pretty cheap with coupons and subscribe and save</li>
            <li> very first brush head used and it feels almost like after a cleaning from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Do&#x27;t bother buying these the normal ones work better and dont make you feel like your gums have been damaged</li>
            <li> They came quickly and in great comdition, as is typical of Amazon purchases.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the floss action heads for 2 years and my teeth feel clean and refreshing every time.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m sure glad of your return policy, i finally got the right thing.  </li>
            <li> It may be that the \\&quot;paddles\\&quot; do get between teeth more effectively than the regular bristles, but only your dentist would be able to tell.</li>
            <li> I have also used the polishing ones and the floss action ones are way better as far as cleaning between your teeth and getting that nice fresh feeling everytime.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell which exact brush head works the best,</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t used the newest set yet, but I am confident they are also genuine because they look identical to the last set of heads, which looked identical to the original heads that came with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> In addition, these Floss Action heads are far superior to the original brush heads.  </li>
            <li> I love my new OralB electric toothbrush replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> You can select Amazon as the vendor on the right hand-side under More Buying Choicess if it is not already listed as the seller in the main section.  </li>
            <li> This is a joy to use and you will spend less time with your dentist if you use this unit.</li>
            <li> These are great and $10 less than even WalMart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a year and a half, and am happy with the brushing experience.  </li>
            <li> , i will notify amazon and i am sure they will help like always, i will still love Amazon as long as they fix their mistakes.</li>
            <li> I would say but will be able to tell in long term if this one does any magic.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my Oral-B electric toothbrush, and the floss action brushes really do loosen what might be stuck between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty confident that this is the real one.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what the seller posted and claims - authentic and all, I just didn&#x27;t like them as much as the polishing ones.  </li>
            <li> this brush is more superior than the other models of brush especially when it is used on the latest Oral Triumph electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> This is the exact brush head that came with the original.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon !!</li>
            <li> order again when needed.&lt;br /&gt;Having to add an exact amount of words is a nuisance!</li>
            <li> first class transaction all the way!</li>
            <li> The wife and I both enjoy the new &amp;#34;Floss Action&amp;#34; design and the way the brush head feels comfortable in the mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had purchased other refill heads before, but these seemed to amp up the performance - left my mouth feeling really clean, a great buy!</li>
            <li> I had come from a Sonicare (battery model) and it was very comfortable in comparison to the Floss Action.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unique design does, indeed, give it the superior cleaning action that the packaging says it does, and it cleans my teeth better than other toothbrush heads do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cleans very well, allows the head unit to be used by more than one person, and times your brushing to 2 minutes for the most effective time without excessive abrasion.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are very good at removing plaque in hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> After use this brush my teeth is so clean during whole day even after lunch!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean for the first time ever with my Oral-B.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These also do seem to do a better job of getting between your teeth clean, and in general getting the majority of your teeth</li>
            <li> I truly appreciated the free shipping.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are longer lasting and more effective than the soft bristle brushes.</li>
            <li> I have been using these brush heads for a few years now and they are great.  </li>
            <li> They work great but took a few days for the guns to adjust.</li>
            <li> Came fast and free with Prime.  </li>
            <li> The Floss Action heads are effective and comfortable, even when my teeth are feeling sensitive.</li>
            <li> but after a few uses, really great.  </li>
            <li> As expected, great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Much better than the old manual tooth brushes I used as a kid.  </li>
            <li> , won&#x27;t try that again, generics are ok sometimes, but in this case there was a big difference from the genuine article.</li>
            <li> if so figure that it&#x27;s more likely to be genuine.</li>
            <li> And my old SoniCare was better yet</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know what the big deal is with these electrics.</li>
            <li> and I love the flossing action that I get from using it.  </li>
            <li> I have used these floss action brush heads for many years now.</li>
            <li> Each brush head is individually wrapped and contains its own color ring for those who share brush heads.</li>
            <li> More massage action</li>
            <li> The price of toothbrushes for oral B is out of sight,I was glad to see that amazon.com offers them at a lower price.</li>
            <li> In this case, the brand name is worth the 3X price.</li>
            <li> I had used the Oral B toothbrush for a long time and was very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Your bristles can look like that: pert, svelt, compact, in distinct bundles.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, they are a health hazard: the bristles are not molded with rounded tips, but are coarsely square cut ...</li>
            <li> The brush dosent even make the same noise as it does with a genuine head, it sounds more rattly.</li>
            <li> It took some time to get use to, but well worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral B Floss Action brushes for years, and have been extremely satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> yet invariably when I &#x27;smile&#x27; after I finish there is still stuff in between my teeth..  </li>
            <li> As of all Oral-B, worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li> It was worth trying</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what most people&#x27;s reviews on these floss action heads are so upset about cause</li>
            <li> but I like to change my brush head more frequently.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that any off-brand of the toothbrush heads just aren&#x27;t as good; either too soft, or don&#x27;t fit properly.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t own an electric toothbrush my entire life until now</li>
            <li> My dentist/hygienist are going to be thrilled at my next visit.</li>
            <li> As far as the refills, this price was much better than anything I saw at retail.</li>
            <li> You may find these work better for you, but I would not be surprised if they don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Despite others claiming they fit, they most definitely did not.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are my favorite so far.   </li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> They are well worth the price.</li>
            <li> health.and your own internal body health.</li>
            <li> Really glad I saved my old brush head.</li>
            <li> Love the floss action brushes.</li>
            <li> They work even better than the brush heads for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Which is great because I only ever buy the floss action brush</li>
            <li> Great double action.  </li>
            <li> It is an investment, but the benefits are worth it.</li>
            <li> is worth</li>
            <li> buying！I will continue to buy next time！a nice shopping！</li>
            <li> these are good and i received these on time when i need chang old oral B floss action brush head ............</li>
            <li> I do not think it is worth an on line order.  </li>
            <li> It has different settings for the kind of brushing you want.</li>
            <li> I feel more comfortable flossing just the deep areas between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> These replacement brushes are a nice way of having an array of brush heads to try out to see which type you personally prefer for your Oral-B Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Worth far more than we pay.</li>
            <li> Economically priced and hardy instrument.</li>
            <li> The floss action is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Just my preference, I like the old style better.  </li>
            <li> and I rarely get cavities now.</li>
            <li> It also makes your gums feel invigorated and fresh.</li>
            <li> My brush had been going strong for 4 years now so finding heads at a decent price was a must.</li>
            <li> This is a great product because the heads wear out long before the unit and it is like buying three new tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> and I would certainly recommend them over the original brushes.</li>
            <li> Some of the older reviews had me worried that there would be an issue, but they work just fine.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery was appreciated!</li>
            <li> These are my favorite style and they make my teeth feel extra clean.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these as a replacement head for the standard Precision Clean heads that come with many Oral-B toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> and they really leave my mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> This made my mouth felt much more cleaner than the standard precision clean.  </li>
            <li> and I think they clean much better than the standard head.</li>
            <li> I am pretty satisfied with the product, though cant feel a huge difference between the standard brush that it came with and</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about these because they are the original product.</li>
            <li> 2 rings, right bristle colors</li>
            <li> Upon receipt I noticed something didn&#x27;t look right.  </li>
            <li> - they snapped on right away and stay on when the brush is turned on.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s all right after I got used to it</li>
            <li> Will purchase from Amazon again as the price is right.</li>
            <li> My \\&quot;new\\&quot; toothbrush heads did not feel right (used for about a week)</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t cancel an order you have already placed and try to reorder right away thinking the coupon will be there for you.  </li>
            <li> right there</li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> I was worry if it is geneuin, but it is right from the manufacture.  </li>
            <li> The price was right with a coupon</li>
            <li> Great clean - no more problems with tea and coffee!</li>
            <li> It leaves my teeth really clean and my daughter claims that it makes her teeth much cleaner despite the braces.</li>
            <li> They seem to clean really well.</li>
            <li> They clean my teeth very thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> A MUST HAVE for anyone who wants teeth which are &#x27;dentist clean.&#x27;</li>
            <li> They fit multiple Oral-B&#x27;s well and seem to clean our teeth better than the normal brush heads.</li>
            <li> Really helps to keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I had been using the off-brand cheap heads for years, but got these because of the high score.</li>
            <li> Makes teeth cleaning more enjoyable and less of a chore.  </li>
            <li> Some of the Third Party Vendors are quite good, but I don&#x27;t think they are carefully monitored so, when in doubt, stick with Mother Amazon.on the right side of the page where it says, \\&quot;More Buying Choices,\\&quot; and see if you can find one that says Amazon.</li>
            <li> They seem like they don&#x27;t clean as well as the normal head...and they hurt!</li>
            <li> The flossy bits are very effective, but pretty harsh.  </li>
            <li> I tried the floss brush and happily noticed that after my dental cleaning the usual staining of my teeth that happens over time never happened.</li>
            <li> Buy this filter once a year for our refrigerator....works great, beats hundreds  of bottles of water which is no better.....</li>
            <li> Great - last longer than the regular ones so well worth the money</li>
            <li> Not sure what else i can say but the oral b is a great product.  </li>
            <li> The cost of these things is like printer ink, not a bad price for the whole package</li>
            <li> Gets my teeth very clean, more so than any other brush in the Oral-B line up (and I&#x27;ve tried every one!).</li>
            <li> I inspected the original and this new one and they are alike, so there must be a product quality control problem, as the new one falls off quite easily.</li>
            <li> I have had others that don&#x27;t fit well or do not vibrate well or wear down more quickly.</li>
            <li> Oral-B is moving on with new design &amp; these won&#x27;t be available any longer.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brush heads over time: the Oral-B Floss Action, Oral-B Dual Clean, Oral-B Precision Clean, and Oral-B Pro White.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They clean very well, seemingly better than the smaller brush heads.</li>
            <li> Heads work great with the Oral B electric toothbrush but for regular use only.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve previously used the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; heads but these ones are good.  </li>
            <li> Fits nicely in the Oral-B Professional Floss Action.</li>
            <li> I have used the Oral-B toothbrush for many years, and I really like the Floss Action Replacement Brush Heads.  </li>
            <li> These are the only ones the actually work and they do a great job..</li>
            <li> Kind of strange when you first use it</li>
            <li> Bristles are falling out much too quickly.  </li>
            <li> Amazed to find replacement brush for my old Oral-B so easy.</li>
            <li> I love Oral-B toothbrushes and most brush heads, however, these seem too harsh for ANY teeth.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super; my husband and I both really like them.  </li>
            <li> I have lingual braces, so oral hygiene is not only super important, but it&#x27;s also SUCH a hassle (my braces are on the backs of my teeth); this brushhead makes brushing my teeth that much more efficient (and I&#x27;ve tried almost all the others), and my mouth is actually clean.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Heads are durable, effective, with a quality build.  </li>
            <li> so I forced one of the old brush heads onto this toothbrush and it works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> So far they seem as good as the standard heads.</li>
            <li> I bought them to supplement the single brush that comes with the Oral-B electric toothbrush so that my wife could have her own.  </li>
            <li> it cleans your teeth fine, but it is probably 5% better than the other O-ral B brushes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Oral-B electric toothbrush and this type of brush head for clean teeth fanatics.</li>
            <li> So, Amazon offers the bets pricing available and send the product right to your doorstep.</li>
            <li> Right heads, good packaging, saved a few bucks from buying in store.</li>
            <li> The dentist actually recommended against these; I picked these up just to try something new and found that they aren&#x27;t actually very good at cleaning teeth as the regular brush heads are.</li>
            <li> Its an awesome feeling, it really get down deep to the gums, I don&#x27;t know yet</li>
            <li> VERY GENTLE.  </li>
            <li> Plus they were very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I like the Oral B toothbrush and brush heads very much.  </li>
            <li> Misleading name “Floss action”: It does not replace flossing and on the product this is mentioned with an asterisk and fine subtext, so there should be no representation even in the name</li>
            <li> Manual flossing is still required for those of us with crowded mouths, but it is accomplished much more quickly than after using regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> They definitely remove more particles hidden between teeth, and seem to do a good job on tooth surfaces as well.</li>
            <li> The oval shape does not maneuver as well, they&#x27;re a bit more rough on your teeth/gums, and the bristles do not feel as though they clean as well either.</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads are very thorough and really leave my teeth and gums feeling clean every time</li>
            <li> Frequently, the brush head would slip off the top of the main unit and remain in my mouth.</li>
            <li> These are a great value for the money and they are hard working brushes and bristles.</li>
            <li> They clean really well, are pretty gentle and get food out from between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I was so  happy to find them on Amazon since it is hard to find in drug stores.  </li>
            <li> At certain times you might also be able to grab it at a discounted price which will definitely make it worth it.</li>
            <li> The Flossing head cleans better than the standard head, it feels somewhat like a dentist cleaning.  </li>
            <li> - these are really making a difference!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised though to find out that with the help of the pictures to identify knockoffs on this site, that the product I received was indeed genuine and can not report any problems yet.</li>
            <li> I ordered these directly from Amazon and got genuine Oral B brush heads.  </li>
            <li> its not so soft as i expected it to be and as advertised...plus its making the gaps between my teeth even more and more .....</li>
            <li> They are slightly larger than the ones I had before, so I imagine they have more brushing power.</li>
            <li> This model of Oral B replacement brush heads makes my teeth feel exactly as if they were just cleaned by a hygienist.</li>
            <li> I like the pro white better.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing any product from any online Company.</li>
            <li> I recommend ONLY purchasing these from Amazon as there is no guarantee you will receive authentic brush heads from anyone else.</li>
            <li> However, during the first week of use one of my kids</li>
            <li> pretty badly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this floss action brush head.</li>
            <li> Of course I will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> and it gets between teeth better than the standard Oral B brush.    </li>
            <li> This is exactly the product I ordered.  </li>
            <li> When the first brush head broke after two weeks of use I became suspicious.  </li>
            <li> All of my brush heads are fuzzy and shaded incorrectly, whereas all the ones in CVS are printed crisply.</li>
            <li> The only way to be sure</li>
            <li> The problem is that this first of the 3-pack falls off the spindle during brushing.</li>
            <li> The exact three pack at the local Walgreens is over $14.00 more.  </li>
            <li> in the ad it appeared that these would fit my Oral B Pulsonic &gt;not true, so I bought these for nothing&gt;paying shipping to get them back</li>
            <li> I subsequently purchased the Oral B Sensitive brush heads and found them to be much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> (I appreciate all the pictures that have been added to show the differences between the real ones and the frauds!)</li>
            <li> It first was a bit wobbly when in use, but actually thought that was to give it a more cleaning area.  </li>
            <li> I first purchased this from a marketplace reseller.</li>
            <li> I always wonder if I will get a knockoff, but this package is a real Oral B product!</li>
            <li> First brush head fell apart within minutes of use.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get in between the teeth as well as floss, but it cleans better than the regular heads</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first one</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and it worked the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I will be using this brush in the future unless they introduce an even better one.</li>
            <li> What you get is a 15% discount off of a price that is raised 20-80% from what you payed the first time.   </li>
            <li> Am very disppointed in Amazon for allowing this type of business practice!</li>
            <li> Many of my local retail stores did not have the product.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the flossing action.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using electric toothbrush &amp; I am using this as well.</li>
            <li> We put these on auto ship to save extra money and to be sure that we changing out the toothbrush heads as suggested.</li>
            <li> You shouldn&#x27;t expect it to replace daily flossing for you, but it feels like it reaches deeper and cleans more thoroughly.</li>
            <li> And, being powered, it doesn&#x27;t require more effort on my part than simply holding the unit.</li>
            <li> but this was first time buying replacements from amazon.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I needed and work well.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a very timely manner!</li>
            <li> Works better than the generic ones that I picked up from Target.</li>
            <li> Better then the standard bristle types.</li>
            <li> the genuine Oral-B, mine are still completely intact and still plenty of life left on the indicator bristles after more than 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hygienist consistently compliments me on having the cleanest teeth she&#x27;s seen in awhile.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> funny business.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Now many decades later, when i must pay for all the work.</li>
            <li> These brush heads were exactly as indicated.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to those interested.</li>
            <li> My first time ever to use this &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; brush head and</li>
            <li> Exactly what was needed.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> The battery is dealing with a larger head (more friction) and a noticeably heavier head.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny, she is always pushing another brand.</li>
            <li> Both times we have received genuine heads, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Oral B consistently for quite some time; years in fact.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never look back and your gum health and teeth health will be leaps and bounds better.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it is any better than the standard head.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this type of brush head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars because I am satisfied with what actually arrived in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Highly recomended!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I hoped for.</li>
            <li> Another dentist said \\&quot;I wish all people took as good of care of their mouths as you do!\\&quot; and barely had to do any teeth cleaning-and that is when I was only flossing once a month or so.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described and works well with my Oral B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> amazon indicated that the first step they take is to remove the product from their website.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT ORDER THESE WITHOUT CALLING AMAZON FIRST TO SEE IF THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They definitely feel better in the mouth</li>
            <li> and I think they do a better job than the regular non-floss models.</li>
            <li> I tried these brush heads because I thought the \\&quot;Floss Action\\&quot; would be better than just the standard brush head.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going to buy more of the standard head.  </li>
            <li> But overall it provides a better tooth-brushing experience.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend these producs to anyone who is interested.</li>
            <li> I would recommend if your using this toothbrush, better than buying the individual packets in the store.</li>
            <li> For some reason the heads seem to not last as long, but still great buy.</li>
            <li> As with most items similar to these on Amazon (razors etc.), there are fakes that exist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes since they first came out and believe they do a much better job that do regular brushe.</li>
            <li> I even bought myself a second one for when I travel. :)</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> EXACTLY</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised, and the 3-count saves me from having to reorder for over a year.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I needed for my Oral B .</li>
            <li> I am a constant user of electrical toothbrushes and oral b sells the more affordable replacement brush</li>
            <li> they work well, and for some reason are much higher quality than the store brand ones.</li>
            <li> First time using a toothbrush of this type.</li>
            <li> your teeth will thank you in the future :)</li>
            <li> But thanks to these, my dentist doesn&#x27;t know that!</li>
            <li> It serves the exact purpose for which it was purchased.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure which head came standard with the brush</li>
            <li> Flossing is still required, but this head really does a lot of the job for you!</li>
            <li> Exactly as shown.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So why 4 stars, I only give 5 stars to truly outstanding products.  </li>
            <li> Product is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I have been using these since discovering them by accident, and although I have the regular heads, I buy more of these.</li>
            <li> This brush head also will help to floss your teeth much better than the traditional heads for Oral B.  </li>
            <li> Instructions are to replace the heads every 3 months or when the heads begin to deform whichever comes first.</li>
            <li> I have healthy gums and I alternate between a manual and power brush to prevent recession.</li>
            <li> My first time trying them</li>
            <li> They are considerably more aggressive that the regular heads.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good and firm.</li>
            <li> They cover a good amount of surface area and are fairly firm.  </li>
            <li> The spin brushes are not cheap but my dentist always comment on how good my oral hygiene is.</li>
            <li> These last a full three months or more, clean extremely well, and are comfortable.</li>
            <li> Nothing replaces daily flossing, but these brush heads do provided a deeper and more satisfying clean than other brush heads</li>
            <li> not much tooth paste needs to be used and my teeth feel very clean and shiny afterwards!</li>
            <li> then any brand new true Oral-B heads</li>
            <li> the quality is good, but the application is too stiff for me.</li>
            <li> They work great on my teeth, I like these (Floss Action) a little more than the standard heads.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed my Oral B electric toothbrush and found it easy and inexpensive to order refills from Amazon with the free shipping since I was ordering other items at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I guess the best way to describe it is - slower and larger vibrations vs. that of fast short ones with the standard head.  </li>
            <li> I debated whether to go for these larger brush heads for my beloved Oral B toothrush or to once again purchase the smaller more standard size.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this for 3 years, totally in love with this, small but smart, it is doing a great job cleaning every single tooth.</li>
            <li> whether one is a non-flosser, an occasional flosser, or one who flosses regularly, if you own an electric rechargeable toothbrush that is compatible with the Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush, then I recommend this addition for both better mouth hygiene and your own internal body</li>
            <li> AND I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED THAT THE BRUSHES IN COMBINATION REALLY DID MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN MY TEETH.  </li>
            <li> I normally clean toothbrushes by holding under running under water and agitating the bristles before and after use, however this is clearly insufficient.</li>
            <li> I like the floss action since they are really CLEAN up my teeth.</li>
            <li> the clean the tooth, gum, and produce flossing action between the teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched to this floss action head, because it works well and does what it is designed to do.. clean in between teeth</li>
            <li> my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean as they did with my old oral b.  </li>
            <li> Professional Precision clean  </li>
            <li> I find these toothbrushes with the built-in floss action are far better than the ones without.  </li>
            <li> i have been using them for over 12 years (not the same one, i do get replacements  :)  haha)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, low price, completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Nice with floss action, makes a big difference!</li>
            <li> I realize the bristles are such better quality, and at varying heights - they really get in-between each tooth.</li>
            <li> I will choose the Floss Action heads every time because they get into the crevices quite nicely and distribute the toothpaste rather evenly (the Pro White heads would fling all of the toothpaste off before I finished brushing a quarter of my mouth).</li>
            <li> and it really does work better than the regular Oral B replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> I love the oral-b professional floss action replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> two month after this purchase, I gave up and went to the local Wal-Mart to buy the real thing (made in Germany) for $10 more.</li>
            <li> really like this cleaning head, and it performed better than the standard cleaning head,  </li>
            <li> They get into the narrow spaces between my teeth exceptionally well.</li>
            <li> I love the floss-action brush heads because, while I don&#x27;t think they actually &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; between my teeth, they do polish the surface of my teeth very well.  </li>
            <li> The Floss Action brush is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> A large chunk of tartar fell out on the first brush.</li>
            <li> This Oral-B brush head has very interesting design that contains two moving little brushes on the sides.</li>
            <li> The most obvious is the Oral-B branding is much lighter grey than the authentic.</li>
            <li> I think that one of the Oral-B&#x27;s great strengths is that the small heads can be maneuvered in such a way that you can clean every surface of every tooth.</li>
            <li> I never use the latter because the Oral B makes my teeth feel so squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t always floss, we always mean to though, these are the next best thing.</li>
            <li> They fit the brush properly and clean better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> these do NOT take the place of flossing, but they do seem to clean a little better between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It makes my teeth feel clean and comes with lovely little bands on the bottom to personalize.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say whether these are knock-offs or the real thing (although the ones I saw at Rite-aid look exactly like this), but I do notice that they don&#x27;t stay put all the way while brushing.  </li>
            <li> This is the first type of power toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever tried, so I can&#x27;t really compare it with others.  </li>
            <li> ;) haha)    </li>
            <li> but i just could not believe they were not genuine since im buying from what i consider to be a very reputable seller (Amazon)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This is the original and worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> Also, the floss action is far superior to the regulars, and around the same price.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the good reviews of the Oral-B floss brushes are from years ago and negative reviews are from more recent years:2011</li>
            <li> The action of this brush does very well to clean between teeth.</li>
            <li> I have been using these Floss Action brushheads for a couple of years and really like the way that they clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I think this brush head works better than the older simple heads I have been using.</li>
            <li> fits better than generic ones, and decent price</li>
            <li> I much prefer the Vitality Precision Clean heads to the Floss Action heads.  </li>
            <li> I believe so highly in this toothbrush that when I couldn&#x27;t find one to purchase without having to buy 2 or more regular brushes with it, I took the advice of a store clerk to check the internet.  </li>
            <li> Some of my teeth are pretty tight and this is a great &#x27;pre treatment&#x27; prior to flossing.  </li>
            <li> The stiff flossing points do feel pretty good on your gums but as far as actually mimicking the action of really flossing your teeth, I suspect they are not that effective.</li>
            <li> I bought another replacement pack from a big box retailer and it is easy to see the difference between these knock offs and an OEM brush.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line Oral B heads clean better and last up to 5 times longer with regular use.</li>
            <li> B0002KHU3I Oral-B Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)]] - especially the latter because it has greater surface area.</li>
            <li> The head is definitely larger which some people will not like because it is not as easy to maneuver inside the mouth.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased and if the need arises in the future I look forward to making further purchases.</li>
            <li> Dry satisfied by my purchases.</li>
            <li> These are really nice typical toothbrush replacements - they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Fits well, easy to attach, last longer than the generics.</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes last a long time and good quality.  </li>
            <li> They clean like no other brush/system I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I prefer the large headed brushes.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using the Oral B Floss Action heads on my Oral B I&#x27;ve had for about 4 years now (still going strong!), and overall, I&#x27;ll say I like</li>
            <li> The product was shipped fast, it was brand new, and worth the money.</li>
            <li> This occurrence was precisely during the period when I used these new floss action brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love getting new toothbrush heads and there is only 3 people using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have to pay more for replacement heads for my $150 electric toothbrush than I would pay for a new regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The new longer, yellow, plastic bristles took some getting used to but feel like they do a more thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are effective -- they get in tight spots and remove even the toughest deposits.  </li>
            <li> Pro White, Precision Clean, Sensitive Gum Care, Dual Clean.,</li>
            <li> As such, they seem to do an excellent job for me, but I could see how they&#x27;d be less beneficial for smaller teeth/</li>
            <li> These are perfect for my electric toothbrush, and much less than the cost of the same brush heads in my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> The price is a very high for reppalcement brush heads.</li>
            <li> Finally, the most obvious tell is that you can easily scratch the logo off the counterfeit item with your fingernail but the real item has a completely glazed surface.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought the price was quite high for the refill, but that is because I did not realize I got 3 refills in the package.  </li>
            <li> The heads seem to be much sturdier than ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the past and seems to clean my teeth better and faster.</li>
            <li> Do not press hard let the rotating brush do the good work on your teeth.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the Brush heads as of yet, but have used the sam models purchased from other places, and the price was super cheap</li>
            <li> Also, the product I received wasn&#x27;t a cheap knockoff - although I may have gotten lucky based on reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li> The price looks great, but it&#x27;s a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean and it is easy to reach trouble spots in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> These brush heads are too big to be comfortable.</li>
            <li> They really hurt my gums.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s maybe too much to hope for.....</li>
            <li> All the bristles move in awkward ways, creating a sensation that leaves me happy!</li>
            <li> Thanks,</li>
            <li> Real ones lasts for months.</li>
            <li> Also, the &#x27;floss action&#x27; plastic tips around the perimeter don&#x27;t really seem to be flossing more than they are just contributing to the roughness of the overall brushing experience.</li>
            <li> They are something that I happen to know very well.</li>
            <li> I got all broke very soon after beginning to use them.</li>
            <li> This made the brush head much noisier and also caused it to pinch my lip form time to time while brushing.</li>
            <li> They are real.  </li>
            <li> My teeth and gums feel very invigorated after each use.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;indicator\\&quot; bristles will never change color, because they aren&#x27;t really indicator bristles... and because the head will start to fall apart after 3-4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know, I sound like a commercial.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> something a real Oral-B manufactured brushhead would never do.</li>
            <li> They show \\&quot;Oral B\\&quot; in Blue as the genuine ones, but mine that came with the brush have the gray \\&quot;Oral B\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> which will be very soon.</li>
            <li> etc....too much hassle.</li>
            <li> Really, the photos (here, on the package) tell you what you should be getting.</li>
            <li> That being said, this product was very defective.  </li>
            <li> I knew something was off with the package, but it met several of the criteria for genuine.</li>
            <li> Its the real the thing</li>
            <li> well, these hold up much longer than the knock off brands...</li>
            <li> I hope this means they got wind of the counterfeiting scams and are working to ensure they&#x27;re selling only the genuine article.  </li>
            <li> That just doesnt do anything unless you have real dental polishing paste maybe.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon automatic shipping, I will never be without my Oral B refills.</li>
            <li> I just purchased real ones from Walgreens</li>
            <li> So  much cheaper then at the store.</li>
            <li> So i examined it more carefully.  </li>
            <li> the quality is very good,worth to buy,and i wanna buy another for my family</li>
            <li> I give this 5 stars as it cleans my teeth really well</li>
            <li> I really like mine.</li>
            <li> It really seems to help with the flossing.  </li>
            <li> so they are the genuine product and not generic.  </li>
            <li> These work really well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if the \\&quot;flossaction\\&quot; feature really does anything, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Should I really move on to hyperbole about a toothbrush head?</li>
            <li> I really like those replacements.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast.</li>
            <li> I can say though my mouth feels MUCH cleaner.  </li>
            <li> My whole family has one.</li>
            <li> That will be the real report.</li>
            <li> The price of the knock-offs is so much cheaper...</li>
            <li> I have bought store brand products before, but this leaves teeth feeling much cleaner.</li>
            <li> They really work well.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are very thorough, but gentle.</li>
            <li> and it really does the job.</li>
            <li> They fit well in the storage compartment and are protected by a lid that swings open.</li>
            <li> After we brush our teeth, we feels much cleaner than Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I really like these brush heads.</li>
            <li> I can really feel the difference in the feel of the head itself.  </li>
            <li> I really like these heads.</li>
            <li> After brushing I feel like I get a very thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t praise a toothbrush much</li>
            <li> still, I really like these toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> This product used to have a much longer life.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x60;t floss as much as I should</li>
            <li> and I really like them.</li>
            <li> These did not look, feel or perform very well, bristles felt like they were fraying almost immediately, would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> but my dentist still wants to see me 4 times a year</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even really care about the money so much as I care about taking responsibility for it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks everyone.    </li>
            <li> So I decided to try an electronic toothbrush and thought since flossing is the really a challenge with braces</li>
            <li> These brush heads are very pricey in the store, so I&#x27;ve been looking for alternatives.  </li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s really all I need.</li>
            <li> Came fast &amp; saved a trip to town.</li>
            <li> Product as described fast shipment</li>
            <li> These are the real Oral-B brushes.  </li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve ended up purchasing these genuine Oral-B manufactured brushes and I alternate with the others.  </li>
            <li> There are several styles available and each has its benefits.  </li>
            <li> The moment I put this head on my Braun toothbrush I had the feeling there was more drag</li>
            <li> My whole family switched to Oral B power toothbrushes about a year ago.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural smiler, I laugh at anything including corny stuff,</li>
            <li> so often when i shop for it in real stores they are out of stock.</li>
            <li> They are working really well.</li>
            <li> I think the system is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Also gentle to gums.</li>
            <li> and I got real Oral-B brush heads and not knock-offs, which according to the reviews seems to be a problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this before, and really like it</li>
            <li> was very upset about it.  </li>
            <li> I use the heads much longer than the recommended amount because I don&#x27;t like being gouged.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> Very efficient in using</li>
            <li> Very efficient in using</li>
            <li> When I placed an order about a week later, the coupon was available again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on Oral-B so can only give an advanced guess that I&#x27;m going to like these</li>
            <li> Mine is really Oral-B</li>
            <li> If the generics weren&#x27;t available when I need them, I&#x27;d definitely buy these name brand ones again.  </li>
            <li> but they work very well.</li>
            <li> I figure that if it&#x27;s not broken, don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really like this brush head.  </li>
            <li> but they still perform really well.</li>
            <li> Teeth always fell so much cleaner with these.</li>
            <li> All the bristles move in awkward ways, creating a sensation that leaves me happy!</li>
            <li> Should have bought these sooner, they are very thorough.</li>
            <li> No issues with compatibility, as these are the real deal.</li>
            <li> not so much the handle that counts.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like this brushhead so much.</li>
            <li> and these are really pricey compared to the knock-ff alternative.</li>
            <li> The Dual-Clean heads have a rubber massage component which seems very beneficial to my gums.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon Prime</li>
            <li> Still not a replacement for real floss.</li>
            <li> The real deal.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for working Oral B replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 of these head now and they work really well.  </li>
            <li> Worked very well on linoleum floor.  </li>
            <li> The units sent were what were advertized,  The product was shipped fast and the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the</li>
            <li> Much needed replacement parts!!&lt;br /&gt;Dr jace</li>
            <li> Thanks .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recommend these brushes works very well...</li>
            <li> They work, and so much cheaper than buying at Target.</li>
            <li> I am a dental hygienist and would highly recommend electric toothbrushes for just about everyone!</li>
            <li> I have a real problem with plaque.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I really like these brush heads.</li>
            <li> Fits my Oral-B and lasts a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fantastic and come with extra color band identifiers.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> The replacement brush head really gets into all the nooks and crannies.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to them for keeping us alert to scams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it get in between my teeth really well.</li>
            <li> I really think these brushes make a difference no matter which of the handles you use them on.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying them in retail stores.</li>
            <li> COMPARISON WITH A GENUINE ORAL B FLOSS ACTION BRUSH HEAD OBTAINED DIRECTLY FROM ORAL B</li>
            <li> Some of the Third Party Vendors are quite good, but I don&#x27;t think they are carefully monitored so, when in doubt, stick with Mother Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like the floss action which is better than the regular heads.  </li>
            <li> The only think that I don&#x27;t like about them is that the plastic arms (which allows them to be marketed as &#x27;floss action&#x27;, I assume) are more rigid than I&#x27;d like for them to be.  </li>
            <li> I get these for my husband, he hasnt complained about them so they must work good.</li>
            <li> The dual action is my second favorite.</li>
            <li> They feel just right for my purpose, but no long term review at this time, but feel I have made the right choice</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a problem with counterfeit ones like other people on here, these worked perfectly fine!</li>
            <li> but it is ludicrous to spend more than $100 on the Oral B professional 5000, and find that it arrives with only a single brush, and your first action after purchase has to be to get more brushes so that your wife can use it too.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the Floss Action wasn&#x27;t right for me, but I&#x27;m much happier with the Sonicare now than when I had the Oral-B.</li>
            <li> At my dentist appointment--while I did get the usual lecture about flossing when I told her about my experiment--the hygenist did acknowledge that my gums were the best she saw that day and that I had less tartar than before.    </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, and is exactly the same as in the store, but at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get excited about a replacement brush, but I&#x27;m glad they exist because I don&#x27;t ever want to be without my electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately electric brushes are much more effective than the traditional way to clean your teeth...</li>
            <li> I first used this brush head when it arrived with my newly purchased Oral B electric tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> They last as long as they should for sure!</li>
            <li> I know other reviewers posted they weren&#x27;t sure if this was the legitimate Oral B brand, but to me it seems like the real deal.</li>
            <li> The heads last so long that I don&#x27;t know when I will need to purchase more!</li>
            <li> Pictures comparing real and counterfeit are also misleading, Original Oral-B brush only has ONE color ring not 2.</li>
            <li> The heads seem to work OK and are lasting pretty well, but if if you are thinking this is a replacement for real flossing, think again, unless you have big spaces between your teeth.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Professional Floss Action Brush makes your teeth feel really clean.  </li>
            <li> We really like the deep clean that these give.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brush head is not the same as the ones that came with the original brush.</li>
            <li> The product that I received came in a packaging that while different from what I am used to, still had the OralB logo, that I was familiar with.</li>
            <li> At first i could not figure out why this didn&#x27;t fit properly and kept falling off, immediately i noticed that they looked cheaper than the ones that came with my professional care</li>
            <li> Only original oral B  brush heads works for me</li>
            <li> , I recently switched to the Original Precision brush heads</li>
            <li> It does feel a bit more aggressive than the other brush heads.</li>
            <li> This is not supposed replace your regular floss which you get from the threads but does a pretty good job if you dont want to floss everyday.</li>
            <li> They are better than the other brushheads from Oral-b.</li>
            <li> the replacement is larger than the original, and as a result it pounds against my teeth.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel better cleaned than with any other brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> so I have gone back to the original.</li>
            <li> If you get one or the other type on sale go for it, but don&#x27;t pay more for these</li>
            <li> They work better than the other heads.</li>
            <li> I love this because it may have my dental cleaned indeep rather than other brush head.</li>
            <li> If you bought Oral-B brush-driver you haven&#x27;t another option to buy brush from other brand:).</li>
            <li> These work amazingly well and last a long time.</li>
            <li> THE MOTION IN THESE HEADS ACTUALLY SEEMS TO DO SOMETHING TO CLEAN YOUR TEETH</li>
            <li> But these seem to give me a deeper clean than the standard oral B brush heads that come with the unit.</li>
            <li> The Pro White heads feel like I&#x27;m trying to scrape my teeth clean, not polish them.</li>
            <li> --my teeth just don&#x27;t feel clean with a regular toothbrush anymore.</li>
            <li> It makes me teeth clean and digs in deep to make my gums looks well.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this replacement Oral-B Floss Action Replacement Brush Head is the real thing, and not a fake.  </li>
            <li> I can fill the deep clean with these brush heads</li>
            <li> but I prefer the Precision Clean or Pro White heads.  </li>
            <li> Clean my teeth flosses at the same time.</li>
            <li> They make my teeth feel extra clean.</li>
            <li> I believe they really clean the teeth nicely especially in between the teeth.</li>
            <li> I was contemplating switching back to the Sonicare when they wore out but then saw the Precision Clean heads.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several different heads, including the dual clean and precision clean heads.</li>
            <li> Been using the Oral B Professional electric tooth brush for many years and am always amazed at how long the machine has lasted.  </li>
            <li> (they can feel quite clean, but you have to brush twice the recommended time, which is detrimental to enamel and gums), and this head makes a huge mess!</li>
            <li> These are very cool, and a little hard on my gums, but I do feel the floss action is effective, though not as effective as actually flossing.</li>
            <li> I really like and highly recommend this floss/action attachment from Oral B - HOWEVER</li>
            <li> No need running around to different stores looking, just order them right on Amazon!</li>
            <li> The base has an incredible battery life and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I dont know if the little 4 yellow rubber \\&quot;thingi\\&quot; really work as a floss, or if they really clean better.  </li>
            <li> First, it gets between large gaps in the teeth like no other replacement head.</li>
            <li> First, it gets between large gaps in the teeth like no other replacement head.</li>
            <li> The product is good and as expected, the shipment arrived much before than expected date.</li>
            <li> I have been buying these Floss Action brushes for about 3 years (since they first came out) and I replace them every month,</li>
            <li> The Floss Action provides significantly better cleaning action than the standard brush.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, like many others who purchased this product, the item I received from Amazon was clearly a counterfeit replica that does not work effectively.  </li>
            <li> The Oral B Flos Action Replacement Head was exactly what I ordered and arrived a head of schedule.</li>
            <li> Apparently, this \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; dentistry is becoming more common.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Braun Oral B rechargable toothbrushes for over 24 years now, today was the first time I tried the floss action brush head</li>
            <li> I would strongly suggest not buying from this company, particularly not these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Removed 3 year old stubborn tartar on first brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered 1 of Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill at 12 $ first time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the oral-b toothbrush for about 10 years and the flossing action of these brush heads is evident at dentist visits.  </li>
            <li> So 2 out of 6 brushes defected is not bad, but regular.</li>
            <li> i think if i tried going back to the normal brushes, my teeth wouldnt &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; as clean.  </li>
            <li> They are like using a flat head manual toothbrush THAT DO CLEAN your teeth</li>
            <li> Well you know what, most people are &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; - this is the very definition of average!</li>
            <li> I know that, whenever I get my new shipment of heads, it&#x27;s time to switch them out!  </li>
            <li> They are small but very powerful and leave my teeth feeling so clean.</li>
            <li> My previous brushes (I have had a lot of them since I owned the toothbrush for many years) never had this problem, even if I used them beyond the recommended 3 months which Oral B recommends.      </li>
            <li> I think it cleans more thoroughly than any product I previously used and would not hesitate to purchase it again.  </li>
            <li> and I find that they are easy to manuever and aren&#x27;t rough on my teeth/gums.      </li>
            <li> , they work better than a manual brush and cost less than Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Fits all of our older model tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> Particularly if you are switching out your Sonicare tooth brush for an Oral B like I did.</li>
            <li> Quick to ship and the same product you get in stores for twice the price!</li>
            <li> I bought directly from amazon, not a 3rd party seller, hoping that amazon would send me genuine Oral B brush heads.</li>
            <li> I do not know if it is because of the material used in the brushes of this particular toothbrush, but I did not have it before.  </li>
            <li> The price is better than in the local stores and the product is just the same.</li>
            <li> If I could do it all over again, I&#x27;d stick with the classic brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s good if you don&#x27;t want to whiten your teeth and just want to improve your cleaning experience after your old common teethbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will be back for more definitely.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B offers a variety of toothbrush heads to fit your personal oral health needs.</li>
            <li> I recently tried another toothbrush with different heads and have to say that the Braun toothbrushes and brush heads seem to work better.</li>
            <li> But the main thing is price.</li>
            <li> Your dentist can recommend one for your particular dental needs.</li>
            <li> Decent price.</li>
            <li> I have been trying out cheaper options and those are just ok, but definitely not offering the same quality as the originals.</li>
            <li> Decent price compared to my friends sonicare replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> Works as replacement heads for Braun Oral B with decent quality and value.</li>
            <li> So much better than the generic heads I bought last time!</li>
            <li> but you were quick enough to take our money</li>
            <li> These are larger, does more vibrating for cleaning teeth and getting to those back teeth.  </li>
            <li> This is easier said than done, first, it increases the total cost of ownership quite significantly and secondly, sore throats do not have a very well defined end point.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like I have had a cleaning everyday!I highly recommend this toothbrush head for everyone.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brush heads</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend them despite the price.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for a week, and have had gums bleeding and swelling (NEVER any problems before, and yes, I floss daily), teeth getting more sensitive and less clean feeling afterward</li>
            <li> I highly recommend changing the brush heads on your toothbrush every 3 months like it is advised.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend getting these if you don&#x27;t like flossing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;D HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANYONE</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend  giving them a try.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and highly recommend it to anyone anticipating buying it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> They are definitely high quality, I don&#x27;t remember them ever losing a bristle.</li>
            <li> Not the larger head with 2 distinct parts, but I actually like the smaller head better.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit on the brush quite right and don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> my order was filled with no problems and will reorder again probably; did not particularly like the type brush I got but wanted to try it.  </li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned, these are the same quality and standards as the one that comes with the original toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Cleeans WWAAAAYYYY better than my old (other brand) toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I just bought the Oral B Professional Care Smart Series rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Just because it is listed on Amazon does not mean it is sold by Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The rubber nubs just give a little more penetration in between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I choose to let a little machine do most of the work.  </li>
            <li> these are the best balance of having that &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling after brushing while still being small and maneuverable enough to get my wisdom teeth and other hard-to-reach areas.</li>
            <li> I bought mine a little over a year ago and immediately fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> If you have a choice, get the Floss Action Replacement Brush Heads!!</li>
            <li> but I love the feeling of clean that these leave behind.</li>
            <li> The only think I did was change from the Precision Clean to the Floss Action Oral B</li>
            <li> The electric really cuts down on time, and you know that you&#x27;ve done a good job due to the quadrant timer.  </li>
            <li> These do a little better job than normal bristled brush heads  for me.</li>
            <li> They said since I had purchased them so long ago this was a \\&quot;special exception\\&quot; they were making for me.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads are very good for cleaning your teeth, and, I have been using them over the past few years.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think it&#x27;d go without saying, but no, no product really has proven itself to leave flossing completely</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Floss action Brush Head &amp; I really like it.</li>
            <li> am happy with brushes,  sorry that floss tips don&#x27;t hold up longer.</li>
            <li> These brush heads really do have a flossing action, but I would not forego using floss.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to buy them in multiples but wish they were not quite as expensive.</li>
            <li> They can be too much for someone with sensitive gums, however.</li>
            <li> Fit and function as as expected.</li>
            <li> No surprises really - they are exactly the same and work well.</li>
            <li> They are definitely worth the extra $$.</li>
            <li> but the extra cost is worth the benefit one gains by using this brush head.</li>
            <li> normally floss before brushing, so</li>
            <li> They are worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> and I have to say they dont brush as well as the normal brush heads</li>
            <li> i got these to replace normal brush head on my oral-b electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t notice much difference, but after extensive use, it didn&#x27;t trigger the change-head reminder on my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold - we&#x27;ll see what the dentist says in a few months :)&lt;</li>
            <li> These worked really well, but I would say look for an off brand that works the same and doesn&#x27;t cost so much!</li>
            <li> The oral-b brushes get in between places that a normal brush would miss.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally change them out every three months</li>
            <li> It does not replace flossing, not by a long shot, but this is better than the standard brush that comes with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These are basically inexpensive when compared buying them locally well worth it.</li>
            <li> worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> It fits my oral b toothbrush correctly, however ruled that must order $25.00 worth of martial to order it is a hassle.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as the regular tips.  </li>
            <li> They also come with a few assorted color plastic rings that can be added so you can tell the brushes apart if you have more than one user.</li>
            <li> The price is good but they are poorly made.</li>
            <li> In this time I have used the Floss Action, Dual Clean, Sensitive Clean, Power Tip, and a knock-off from China to save a few bucks (purchased on Amazon).</li>
            <li> In this time I have used the Floss Action, Dual Clean, Sensitive Clean, Power Tip, and a knock-off from China to save a few bucks (purchased on Amazon).</li>
            <li> The other 4 are working fine.  </li>
            <li> I also had a dual action head, and generally prefer this one, though the other one is good once in a while as well, as it is a fuller head and scrubs slightly differently.</li>
            <li> i normally love these brush heads but this set didn&#x27;t last very long, maybe a 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> and you can tell easily when it&#x27;s time to replace them when the brushes on the outside lose their blue color.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> This may be a deal breaker for some, since stiff brushes have many negatives.</li>
            <li> Had the right packaging, but it printing was blurry on the back.</li>
            <li> This item was priced right, so I bought it to replace my former Oral B brush head.</li>
            <li> One reviewer suggested that you go to the Oral B site to buy your heads rather than shopping at Amazon -- but guess what -- if you go to the Oral B site they provide you several links for retailers who sell their products, and one of them leads right here, to this product at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> will say though that if you have braces, the brush wears down pretty quick though.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Oral B electric toothbrush for many years now, but getting the new heads were always expensive, and not always easy to find for my model.</li>
            <li> Having braces, getting a good clean is difficult with just a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I know Amazon has a good price on them, but the price on these in general is just ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected like the original brush head</li>
            <li> I find it not so good, it is a bit rough and didn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> Please notice the little hole that exists near the top of the toothbrush head - on the neck of it.  </li>
            <li> This product does the job so well, that I think my Dentist is a little perplexed, as I \\&quot;have less tarter, than most women my age\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> New, as advertised.</li>
            <li> So we told him to use a new one and now the brush hair are falling out.</li>
            <li> My patience was sligtly stressed because I thougt that I woild have to purchase a new tooth brush to get a somplete unit.  </li>
            <li> Then I lost my charger and it was cheaper to buy a new toothbrush than replace the charger.</li>
            <li> He loves the electric toothbrush, and wanted him to have spare brush heads for the new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought a new Oral B pro brush that came with this head.  </li>
            <li> Within the month, you are reaching for a new head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Buying 3 along with the new brush means I am set for a year.</li>
            <li> 3 days is the new norm.</li>
            <li> I live for that</li>
            <li> Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li> Purchased these heads to try with the new Oral-B 1000 Toothbrush I purchased to replace the Oral-B electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve been using for over 8 years now.  </li>
            <li> Nothing like a new tooth brush.</li>
            <li> When these arrived, I immediately snapped on a new head and it immediately worked as if nothing ever happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li> They fit on the brush head without slipping  the individual threads don&#x27;t come loose, and they get the choppers clean!</li>
            <li> There were several models but only one fit my unit.</li>
            <li> This item in particular should maybe be ordered directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It may be my overly sensitive teeth, but these are a lot more harsh than the one that comes with the brush.</li>
            <li> So, if you are older, and/or have sensitive teeth, I suggest you avoid this brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice a difference between this and the regular head, but I guess that means it&#x27;s no worse.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to carefully compare your replacements to your current heads each time, given all the complaints about fakes.</li>
            <li> The reason I bought these is that they were the same brand available at a local chain store but at a 30% savings...  </li>
            <li> It SOUNDS like a very early dirigible motor.  </li>
            <li> I had recently bought the same exact 3-pack from a store, so I compared the ones I got to the genuine oral-B refills, and noticed the following:</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes are sturdy, strong, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these brush heads myself for years and recently purchased them for my son, who does not always do stellar work when brushing his teeth.  </li>
            <li> First, throw the Chinese knock-offs in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Secondly, I find the Floss Action better by a wide margin over any of the others I have tried.</li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed is that the blue color is darker.  </li>
            <li> Then the coefficient of friction moving from one tooth to the next tooth is much higher.  </li>
            <li> The Floss Action head is a must have!</li>
            <li> I purchased mine DIRECTLY from Amazon (not a third party seller) and mine are absolutely the real deal.</li>
            <li> I have a keen eye for small differences, and most people will be fooled by this.</li>
            <li> I saw that these were \\&quot;by OralB\\&quot; and usually Amazon is reputable.</li>
            <li> For the rest of us with sensitive gums, don&#x27;t buy them!</li>
            <li> i started purchasing this product and now it comes malfunction-ally built because the recently bought brush heads don&#x27;t operate as they were the first time</li>
            <li> They seem to last enough longer than the standard ones to more than make up for the difference in price.</li>
            <li> First the rubber pieces on the head starting falling apart in mouth while brushing.</li>
            <li> As I have a small mouth and receding gums, I don&#x27;t need any more agents of &#x27;attack&#x27; on my gumline.  </li>
            <li> Exact same product.</li>
            <li> I am on my second one the first lasted 8+ years.</li>
            <li> I opened the first pack and the 1st 2 brush heads only lasted a couple of days each!  </li>
            <li> Exact the same as came with my toothbrush</li>
            <li> I suggest using this in conjunction with the best toothpaste we&#x27;ve found: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I love the small rubber flossing bristle.  </li>
            <li> I have tried them all and only this original brand works properly in the toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> They are larger than the regular brush heads, so you can be done brushing faster or brush more thoroughly in the same amount of time.      </li>
            <li> It cleaned well, but disturbed the sensitive areas around the gums to the point where I thought I might need a root canal!  </li>
            <li> This is rip off of the original Oral B brush heads with far fewer filaments in the center.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last as long when brushing with braces, but I don&#x27;t mind replacing the brush head every month or so to get that pretty smile.</li>
            <li> First I purchased the generic brushes and was not satified</li>
            <li> This product is a cheap knock-off - not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Made by the Oral-B people, so it&#x27;s the same quality as the original equipment, albeit an improvement over the standard brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I shopped othe websites such as the Oral-B replacement parts site and found much higher prices.  </li>
            <li> These are pretty simple.</li>
            <li> First, throw the Chinese knock-offs in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Secondly, I find the Floss Action better by a wide margin over any of the others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I felt the &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; cleaned any differently than regular heads, so it might be more a matter of personal taste (and price).</li>
            <li> I have pretty solid teeth as well</li>
            <li> I thought the Oral-B cleaned pretty well, until I recently switched over to a Philips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Now when I visit with my Dentist he stated that my teeth&#x27;s are better no more drilling...</li>
            <li> They are the Maytags of small appliances many of which are made for the kitchen.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the original round Oral B brush heads with no paddles.  </li>
            <li> It seemed ok, but after a week of normal usage, the head started vibrating, making a loud noise and also the head didn&#x27;t brush the same (very rough).  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s four star reviews are outdated and the older product reviews are much more positive than reviews from 2011-my purchase was 2013.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this completely eliminates any possible damage, but so far my gums/teeth feel fine, not beaten up, and doesn&#x27;t feel radically different from using a medium bristle</li>
            <li> secondly - they don&#x27;t even get my teeth as clean as a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This is a deep cleaning brush and your teeth feel extra clean.  </li>
            <li> All things being equal I will just get the Precision Clean heads and be done next time.  </li>
            <li> These do not leave my teeth smooth and clean and worse</li>
            <li> I feel like i get a deeper clean with these things then any other toothbrush I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> Clean teeth extremely well.</li>
            <li> Original product not the shabby imitation which disintegrated.</li>
            <li> And also, it&#x27;s healthier if you use more than one brush head every single day, so they have time to dry out after use.</li>
            <li> After getting a 2nd opinion from a far better dentist, I found out that the former one was simply attempting to line his pockets.</li>
            <li> They are larger than the original and have a different action.</li>
            <li> It makes flossing that much easier, and just works harder than many other brushheads.</li>
            <li> When I was purchasing the new toothbrush I also saw Oral B Floss Action 3 pack refills which I also purchased.  </li>
            <li> I do have two brushes that worked on my old unit but they will not work the new one</li>
            <li> I prefer the new flexible soft floss picks.</li>
            <li> These were easy--pry off the old one, pop on the new one, bam.</li>
            <li> so we can use newly designed heads with our old handles.</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s bristles are much too stiff to clean my teeth thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Dont wast your money on cheap know offs that break and don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> , I got my order within 48 hours, free shipping, at less than half the price of Walgreens, and it&#x27;s the genuine Oral-B replacement item, not a counterfeit</li>
            <li> 1st - Floss Action, 2nd - Dual Clean and 3rd - ProWhite.</li>
            <li> Generally work fine - if they&#x27;re the same price as the regular heads</li>
            <li> The floss action head is a bit larger than the standard precision clean head</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure it out at first, then went back to the sensitive brush.  </li>
            <li> These are comfortable to use, though no more or less effective than the regular non-&amp;#34;flossing action &amp;#34; brush heads.</li>
            <li> These are the brush heads to get - I&#x27;ve tried the other varieties of Oral-B brush heads, but these floss action ones leave your teeth with that smooth/slick clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Pro White heads pretty much have this circular rubber piece in the middle</li>
            <li> Product came in time and performed as expected.&lt;br /&gt;Since this was the first time I was ordering the Floss Action head, instead of the regular one, I was surprised by the size of it</li>
            <li> Well -I&#x27;ll tell you what - first of all they do absolutely nothing that even remotely resembles &#x27;flossing action&#x27; and  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying new heads from local drugstore.</li>
            <li> first of all, they do not fit right...</li>
            <li> I bought these from Direct Super Center.  </li>
            <li> I bought these from Direct Super Center.  </li>
            <li> The brushes that I ordered from Direct Super Center were counterfeit.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Direct Super Center.</li>
            <li> DO NOT order from Direct Super Center.</li>
            <li> Bristles packed tightly and of the correct color, serial number intact, 2 color rings included with each brush and packaging checked out with what the genuine manufacturer produces.     </li>
            <li> The heads fit snugly, and the indicator rings (at the bottom) snap in tight.</li>
            <li> all those comparing this with the cheaper generic brands available on Amazon, DON&#x27;T!!!&lt;br /&gt;I tried the generic brands and the brush feathers came out piece by piece every time I brushed, you might save few bucks in price but Oral-B&#x27;s are the real deal and well worth it!  </li>
            <li> It can be done, but there&#x27;s more of a mess than with the smaller brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your mouth tends to the larger side I certainly recommend trying these replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> They fit really well on the brush base and they stay clean and clean my teeth and gums well.</li>
            <li> With these brush-heads and careful flossing with both cheap dental picks and Oral-B Satin floss, there&#x27;s very little build-up of tartar for the dental hygienist to clean, even when I missed a couple appointments, and went 1 1/2 years between cleaning.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;floss\\&quot; in the brush is quite stiff; it doesn&#x27;t seem to help flossing much, but rather makes brushing less effective.</li>
            <li> I purchased these along with the Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep + Smart Guide</li>
            <li> These have little yellow rubber bristles that vibrate when the toothbrush is engaged and they do an ok job of cleaning between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> My dentist would stress to me that I need to floss more to prevent tartar and gingivitis, but it was hard to remember to floss.  </li>
            <li> Oral B has come out with so many brush heads, it is hard to know what to buy anymore.  </li>
            <li> also did a better job of cleaning the hard to reach spots on the inside surface of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Make sure you replace them once they get soft; otherwise, they will not clean your teach well enough.  </li>
            <li> hard to say more than that - I like them.</li>
            <li> I think the wal-mart knock off brand is better in that the bristles aren&#x27;t has hard.</li>
            <li> and I fear too hard for most as well.</li>
            <li> I love little yellow bristles, they really work wonders with my braces, that my regular rite aid toothbrush never seemed to get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, as soon as I looked at the brushes through the clear package, I could tell that the brushes are knock-offs.  </li>
            <li> These are not genuine Oral B Floss Action brush heads, they are cheap knock offs as alot of the reviews are pointing out.</li>
            <li> This means I&#x27;m hacking at my gums less with floss, but feel just as clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Within just three days after switching to this Oral-B Floss Action Brush Head [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Head 3 Count]]</li>
            <li> Amazon provides oral B professional brushes as one needs with supply and prime shipping.  </li>
            <li> But it is definitely not a substitute for real flossing.  </li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]]  </li>
            <li> Though I buy them anyway because they work really well and last a while.</li>
            <li> I cant really aim properly because of all the vibration and my gums get sore.</li>
            <li> my hygenist actually asked me if i used an electric because she didnt see much tartar.</li>
            <li> I have used the Oral B Vitality toothbrush for nearly five years.</li>
            <li> This is my daily brush and really made a difference.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t have definitive results until I go back for my scheduled cleaning, but the size of the head is very compatible with my smaller-sized mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve discovered that the floss action heads don&#x27;t travel well.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that some customers complained about the quality of this brush, however, I have been using it for more than 2 weeks</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive gums, do not buy these.  </li>
            <li> My advice is to stay far away from this product.</li>
            <li> Oral B Floss Action heads</li>
            <li> I gave the Floss Action</li>
            <li> I cannot comment on whether the Floss Action heads can replace the act of flossing.</li>
            <li> However, I recommend you buy an updated unit and not try to use the Floss Action on a Vitality, low-end model, or something made a decade ago.</li>
            <li> I have heard some negative reviews, but I am enjoying these brushes.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON, even direct.</li>
            <li> I used to use the soft oral B brushes.</li>
            <li> I thought I didn&#x27;t have sensitive gums....</li>
            <li> Let me start off by just saying WOW.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The chief drawback, as far as I am concerned, is that the brush head has been enlarged to accommodate the flossers.</li>
            <li> Everything handled professionally.    </li>
            <li> For the price I paid, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this was some type of knock off.  </li>
            <li> The brush looks nothing like the brush I got with my Professional Care 5000 series toothbrush or the brush heads I have purchased at Bed Bath and Beyond.</li>
            <li> They also are already frayed.[[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]]</li>
            <li> The second shipment was the real thing</li>
            <li> When I called the distributor directly, I was informed that they \\&quot;do not sell counterfeit items.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> They include the floss action, which pull particles out of your teeth.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 10 year old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I noticed after using it, that I have some grooves in the tooth enamel near gums.  </li>
            <li> Originals were not floss action.</li>
            <li> They might be too aggressive for those with sensitive teeth or gums.  </li>
            <li> After comparing everything within the user submitted photos, I can say with some confidence that Amazon sent me legit Floss Action heads.</li>
            <li> So, I switch off between the two - couple of days with the Floss Action, then a couple of days with the Ultrasoft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]]</li>
            <li> The Floss Action seems to make a difference.</li>
            <li> After only a month of use, the head became very wobbly and seemed to start to detaching.</li>
            <li> Going to the sensitive heads.</li>
            <li> I learned my lesson and only will get the real Oral-B brands.</li>
            <li> I have an Oral B Professional.  </li>
            <li> I think I will call Oral-B &amp; see if they will replace my two incompatible brush heads with the floss action one that fits my precision 1000 model.</li>
            <li> These things clunk around in your mouth and are so loud</li>
            <li> I had earlier purchased the Oral B Triump electric toothbrush from Amazon and our family really likes it.    </li>
            <li> but i dont see any noticeable difference beetween the flosss action heads and regulr</li>
            <li> The old line of Braun brushes were cheaper and also worked well.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s part of the flossing action</li>
            <li> The flossing action of this Oral-B brush head is super-effective.</li>
            <li> I prefer the floss action brushes to the others.</li>
            <li> The picture shows 4 count brush heads, and the title says &amp;#34;Oral-B Floss Action Replacement Electric Toothbrush Head 4 Count&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Head</li>
            <li> I like the smaller size so you can get around the whole mouth.</li>
            <li> I completely see why now.  </li>
            <li> Looking for a sensitive version for my youngest daughter.</li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B professional tooth brush for a while.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time to replace some old heads.</li>
            <li> So far I have no complaints about this style head.  </li>
            <li> I find my teeth are much cleaner than with a traditional tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> They are the Oral-B Floss Action brush heads.</li>
            <li> The ones I received are definitely the real deal.</li>
            <li> (we also like the Sonicare Elite &amp; the Braun OralB Sonic Complete.)</li>
            <li> So instead of cleaning better than the regular heads, these are larger and harder to maneuver around your teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> They work very well though I do think that the brushes that are included with the toothbrush last longer than the replacements.</li>
            <li> Of course it fits my old Oral-B Braun toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My Braun/Oral B electric toothbrush is getting old now</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended these floss action heads and we have used them exclusively every since.</li>
            <li> especially  got this one with flossers really help</li>
            <li> The brush head being too big, puts too much pressure on the gums which is not recommended by dentists.</li>
            <li> After each use, your gums and teeth feel like you&#x27;ve had a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Have upgraded my Oral-B Professional system and purchased for grandkids.</li>
            <li> , I buy the these floss action brush heads.  </li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Heads leave my teeth</li>
            <li> I could never go back to a manual tooth brush knowing how much cleaner my teeth get with these.</li>
            <li> I like my Oral B electric toothbrush and the Floss Action Replacement Head works well for me.</li>
            <li> I got my adult bracez on a couple years ago and this toothbrush is all I need.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Oral-B Floss Action Brush Head helps to remove a substantial amount of plaque, which is the bacterium that attacks our teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> I use the Oral-B Floss Action Brush in conjunction with flossing.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B Floss Action Brush has a spinning and oscillating movement that helps to remove the excess plaque between teeth and at the gum line.  </li>
            <li> Although this is NOT a substitute for flossing, it will deliver much cleaner teeth and gums than a regular brushing.  </li>
            <li> Durable so far.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both use these Oral-B floss action brush heads.</li>
            <li> Im gonna keep my old brush head for cleaning my jewelry.</li>
            <li> The Floss Action is my fave of all the brush heads.</li>
            <li> My wife and I use a Braun Professional Care toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These heads are for a floss-like action.  </li>
            <li> It is too much hassle to ship it back now.</li>
            <li> I have had no cavities, and cleaner teeth since upgrading to the 9000 with the floss action, so I guess they do work well.</li>
            <li> and I ordered the Floss Action 3 pack to replace my old brush head.  </li>
            <li> also states that you should always use a soft brush.</li>
            <li> The Floss Action plastic bristles even broke off.  </li>
            <li> I do always choose this Oral B Floss Action 3pack brush head refill.</li>
            <li> But I guess the security of knowing that these are not knock offs is the only real price justification for these.</li>
            <li> B004U7RKYI Oral-B Professional Care 1000]].</li>
            <li> every tooth is cleaned completely.  </li>
            <li> though I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever noticed any &amp;#34;floss action.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve also recently discovered the Oral-B DualAction Premium Power Toothbrush Head Refills which are not only cheaper but also seem to do a more thorough job – perhaps simply because the brush head is bigger.</li>
            <li> in addition, oral B said you can also get them from theessentials.com and drugstore.com.[[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Head 3 Count]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this floss action brushes with my triumph for years</li>
            <li> and this is now old technology.</li>
            <li> arrived at time, as advertise.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an old user of Oral B brush heads.</li>
            <li> So kudos to Oral-B for the innovation of the Floss Action.</li>
            <li> I use this head with my Oral-B Professional Care 5000.</li>
            <li> i did not need the floss action but, the smoother heads.</li>
            <li> so I bought this one, the Oral B Floss Action.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Oral B Floss Action brush heads for years.  </li>
            <li> brush heads are like they state, a flossing action type brush head.</li>
            <li> recommend for people with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> It really is an improvement from the earlier versions I have been using.  </li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]]      </li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]]  </li>
            <li> Bought these directly from Amazon and ended up receiving counterfeit product.</li>
            <li> a smaller mouth, this seems to work real well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering the Oral B Floss Action brush heads from Amazon for over a year.  </li>
            <li> my gums have entirely stopped bleeding and the gum condition looks much healthier.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap look alikes</li>
            <li> The floss action replacements are my preferred brush in the Oral-B Pro Series.</li>
            <li> this floss action toothbrush</li>
            <li> No issues with this product so far</li>
            <li> Says floss action</li>
            <li> I chose this because of the floss action and I would reccomend this to everyone.  </li>
            <li> I used the Floss Action for 6 months (replaced every 3 mos.)</li>
            <li> Wow - what a difference.  </li>
            <li> I believe these are a relative bargain in comparison to the Sonicare heads which are much pricier.</li>
            <li> The floss action brush was of no use since it won&#x27;t work on my brush</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t exactly soft sensitive.</li>
            <li> Just cover the areas of your teeth softly and repeatedly.</li>
            <li> So far, my teeth look cleaner</li>
            <li> Now that I have the  floss action brushes by mistake, I think I will stick with them.</li>
            <li> but i prefer the sensitive gum one.</li>
            <li> The real deal...not generic as some were saying they received</li>
            <li> Also, delivering time and packaging are indicate for those people are professional.</li>
            <li> and these brush heads are better than the round heads unless you have a very tiny mouth</li>
            <li> So i switched the configuration to this item, it is somewhat more expensive but worth</li>
            <li> I am very happy with brushes as well as the electronic base.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think the product is good</li>
            <li> Works great but will go back to what I was using as it is a little stiff and my gums need something softer but someone looking for firmer brush will probably like it.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes and my dentist can definitely tell a difference when compared to the plain old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> While they seem to get your teeth cleaner, and quicker, they can damage gums, possibly enamel, so many dentists do not recommend stiff bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well several months later and I was right.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not disappointed but will probably be going back to the easier to maneuver regular version next time.  </li>
            <li> I was a little excited by the price and missed the flossing bit.</li>
            <li> The other ones wear out immediately and also don&#x27;t fit the appliance well, so they pinched my lip as I brushed.</li>
            <li> I started using the standard Oral-B toothbrushes and even found that other manufacturers made toothbrushes that would fit at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> My original brush head seemed like they had harder bristles, which I personally like.  </li>
            <li> these work fine, but Oral-B keeps revising the toothbrush head line-up in ways that its hard to figure out what you&#x27;re buying, and how the new heads compare to the old ones I used to use.  </li>
            <li> They felt clean with the round head, but wow, they felt like I had just visited the dentist after using these.</li>
            <li> However, the product tends to wear down quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using the brush for a few days and I have a doubt whether it is original.</li>
            <li> The mechanical rotary action wears out long before the bristles show any significant color change from blue to white.</li>
            <li> The problem only occurred when I used Direct Super Center which is offered thru Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I bought this 3-pack from DAB Nutrition (a.k.a. Direct Super Center or Potential Dynamix LLC), but they sold me knock-offs.  </li>
            <li> They took this much more seriously.  </li>
            <li> After market brushes do not fit well or clean as well.  </li>
            <li> And when I received them the main packaging was open.  </li>
            <li> Well, a few days ago,it first pinched the inside of my cheek,then the whole head fell apart in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> pretty sure I received fake ones.  </li>
            <li> The Floss Action heads are a bit larger than the normal heads</li>
            <li> I have been on automatic refills for 1 1/2 years and just noticed that the price they are charging for the next refill is much higher even with the 15% discount than for what I can order it for (from  the same seller offering the 15% discount).  </li>
            <li> These brush heads will get your teeth significantly cleaner than not only a manual toothbrush but also other electric tooth brush heads.</li>
            <li> I love how the small brushed allow you to manicure each tooth.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen them at CVS or similar stores, though this particular model was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> Oral-B is same as Braun which is a German manufacturer of many electric appliances that last and last and last.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be nice if the price was a little less</li>
            <li> the font on the back of the package is much thicker than that on the real one, the \\&quot;2\\&quot; attached to the 2nd picture on the back of the package is lacking the shadow, and the pictures are fuzzy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush head as it helps act like a floss for those who don&#x27;t regularly floss.</li>
            <li> The things I like about it are: 1)the small brush makes it easy to reach way in the back area that&#x27;s hard to reach with a regular toothbrush; 2) I didn&#x27;t realize that I don&#x27;t have to use that much toothpaste as I did before; and 3) my teeth feels really clean!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to change them when the light blue color fades to about half way.</li>
            <li> Previously purchased some generic brand replacement brush heads for dirt cheap and</li>
            <li> With free shipping from Amazon, the price was about $0.30 less than the same product at Target.  </li>
            <li> you can easily get 6 months based on average usage as long as bristles not frayed.</li>
            <li> The yellow hard bristles get as far as possible in between your teeth to really help clean up well!</li>
            <li> I am now going to contact Direct Super Center and Amazon about this issue, but I have a feeling that Direct Super Center won&#x27;t help, after reading other comments posted here.    </li>
            <li> I learned how much I like my toothbrush when I dropped my last brush head in the toilet and my new ones were not here yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the fakes are off the market or not, but if you&#x27;re on the fence just order, then give Amazon a call if the ones you get aren&#x27;t genuine...</li>
            <li> /&gt;These ones say &#x27;floss action&#x27; which apparently equates to some rubber bristles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced it really matters what heads you have, as long as you have an Oral-B toothbrush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my first of these and they work as expected.</li>
            <li> Gonna get a normal brush head next time.</li>
            <li> This oral B replacement heads are a bit rough when you first start using them.</li>
            <li> Wow, I looked high and low for the refills to my Oral B Floss at my local drug store and other well known stores, as well as online stores, but could not find the this brand or the price was too high!!!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit tight enough.</li>
            <li> The construction of the toothbrush head is such that build-up of deposits is unavoidable, there is a big oblong cavity in the front and back of the toothbrush and also 6 smaller ones at back, where fluids while brushing can easily go in but cannot be flushed out.</li>
            <li> The heads clean well and lasts as long as expected.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how complicated it is dealing with Amazon to get the right ones which may actually may be of more interest to buyers than a review of the brushes themselves.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m single and there is no need to buy a large amount.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the extra brushes along with a new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product so I can have extra refills for the new Oral B 9400 Power Toothbrush I bought.</li>
            <li> Can go through them quickly, new to order about double the amount.  </li>
            <li> These are the same replacement heads that are on my new Oral B toothbrush.</li>
            <li> they are on sale for $18.99/3-pack, plus a $3 coupon on the order, plus a $3 instant rebate per pack,plus an additional 15% discount for new customers, plus no shipping charges on orders over $25, plus, no sales tax from NJ..</li>
            <li> Second one did not last much longer.</li>
            <li> I actually wanted the professional &#x27;precision clean&#x27; type which was not available on the website which was a shame.  </li>
            <li> I was using the standard brush that came with my professional care pack, but wanted to give the floss action a try.</li>
            <li> I also bleed when I floss for the first time in a long while (same idea).</li>
            <li> They also last pretty long.</li>
            <li> However, as a dental professional, I would advise that those with sensitive gums or receding gums alternate between a manual toothbrush and this power toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The plastic in these brush heads is breaking and they do not sit right on the brush handle, also the bristles are harder and of a different make than genuine heads, these things are already bothering my gums and have the potential of causing serious dental damage, this is a real shame Amazon...</li>
            <li> About a year later, I put the same Floss Action head on an Oral B Smart Series 5000 and it was totally different.</li>
            <li> After a few more uses the whole head feel apart as the small metal pieces came unscrewed.</li>
            <li> Major accomplishment.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for the past three years, as they originally came with my 9000 series.</li>
            <li> The product lasts long and it has a clear indicator of when to choose the new brush head.</li>
            <li> This three-pack typically lasts quite long and you can find a $5 coupon from Oral-B/Amazon(displayed on the page when available) to make the deal even sweeter.</li>
            <li> The first thing you need to get use to is the slightly \\&quot;rougher\\&quot; brushing action.  </li>
            <li> It was a little uncomfortable brushing at first, but now I look forward to brushing my teeth in the morning because the floss action does such a good job and my teeth look and feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> little pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> One photo of a putative fake is identical to the packaging used recently by Oral B, snd the genuine packaging has changed even more recently.  </li>
            <li> First time I used them, my gums were a little sore from the floss action.....</li>
            <li> The brush portion itself is slightly larger than on the &#x27;standard&#x27; ones, but not so large as to present a problem.</li>
            <li> My dentist warned me that if I keep brushing my teeth too hard, my gums will continue to bleed and I will experience many problems in the long term.</li>
            <li> With the chemical damage to my teeth from acids in the mouth apparently accelerated by the loss of enamel, today my dentist showed me current photographs of my teeth compared to 4 years ago, before using these floss action bristles.</li>
            <li> They have a serial number, the Oral B marking can&#x27;t be scratched off with a finger nail, the packaging is properly labeled with crystal clear lettering, the colors on the bristles are spot on - no dye smudging.  </li>
            <li> The generic heads are the ones you want to steer clear of....</li>
            <li> I also only use a dab of toothpaste, so it really lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> The device contains storage for 4 brushes and is clearly intended for use by multiple users.</li>
            <li> However, this seller sent me completely different brushes from what&#x27;s clearly being advertised on the page and in the photos.  </li>
            <li> They are the real thing that works and last relatively long unlike store name replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> I recommend getting the smaller brush heads for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather go with the regular brushes than the floss action ones -</li>
            <li> you can feel the deep cleaning action.</li>
            <li> They are, however, about 25% larger and the bristles are not as soft.</li>
            <li> I had intended to order this same brush head, but the reviews on the Floss Action brush head refill intrigued me.</li>
            <li> So, my fault for not noticing until I&#x27;d opened and actually started using one of these, but I received what looks to be the &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; heads instead of the floss action heads that are in the description.</li>
            <li> and i bought Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill, after looking up the same product at amazon.</li>
            <li> So now I have gone back to the softer heads without the floss action.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the last brush head and was not expecting to have to replenish my supply this early.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely buy the Floss Action heads in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the Oral B 5000, the RPM seemed faster and smoother, and the Floss Action heads felt the same as the Precision heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My purchase was from a 3rd party but it was direct from Amazon&#x27;s inventory.</li>
            <li> I think its floss action is an add to regular brushing</li>
            <li> I purchase them only when they come directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I prefer this over the standard head because of the floss action addition.</li>
            <li> I currently have them and am not returning them to Amazon, but am contacting Braun directly.  </li>
            <li> Bought this product last year from Direct Home and Garden.</li>
            <li> We use this brush along with the sensitive head brush to alternate.  </li>
            <li> I went with the Floss Action model just because it was $2 cheaper (gotta pinch those pennies nowadays) for the refill pack compared to the Precision head model that comes standard on the $12 Oral-B Vitality brush.  </li>
            <li> I had a floss action brush head and a regular flex head before</li>
            <li> This is definitely the way to go to replace the brush heads on the Oral-B Professional Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Tried buying an off brand and didn&#x27;t get anywhere near the same results.  </li>
            <li> THIS COMBINATION OF BRUSHES, THE FLOSS ACTION AND THE DEEP SWEEP LEAVES MY TEETH</li>
            <li> The Floss Action Brush Head is a terrific flossing agent.</li>
            <li> If you have an Oral-B Floss Action Electric Toothbrush, definitely buy these heads for it.</li>
            <li> (I suppose I used the soft ones the last time I ordered).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Floss Action works well for the back teeth.</li>
            <li> I will definitely reorder the floss action brushes.</li>
            <li> Flossing action yellow tabs give you a cleaner gum stimulated feeling!</li>
            <li> But I personally find that they do not last any where near as long as the real thing.</li>
            <li> so the flossing action is a big plus.</li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon and after 30 minutes and having to speak to the manager they refunded only the ones bought directly from Amazon.   </li>
            <li> Each Oral-B Floss action brush should last between 3 – 4 months, when the bristle colors start to fade and the bristles start to spread the brush is worn out</li>
            <li> When I ordered this one, I ordered directly from Amazon and did not look for generic or cheaper prices.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different heads and theFloss Action</li>
            <li> Although they say they are floss action, they do not come close to using regular floss, as they can not get all the way between the teeth, and below the gum line.</li>
            <li> I noticed an improvement in plaque removal over time at dental cleanings, as compared to the brush head without the yellow floss action paddles.</li>
            <li> Wow, I am so amazed that I&#x27;m not the only person who has a problem with replacement brushes (RB) falling off and scratching one&#x27;s tongue/cheeks/lower face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are definitely more expensive than generic non-electric toothbrushes, but for the money they will save us on dental work in the long run, they are well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same old thing, give them the razor and make them pay through the nose for blades.</li>
            <li> I floss regularly with dental floss, so it&#x27;s not like my gums are too sensitive.  </li>
            <li> My dentist noticed immediatly that my gumms were irrtated and recommended that I stop using this and switch back to Sonicare, which I had used for nearly 20 years until their planned obscelence ticked me off.  </li>
            <li> My shifting from manual to electric toothbrushes years ago helped keep my teeth ivory white and cavity-free and, for me, the simple rotating head with two types of bristles was very satisfactory, but when I switched to this head with paddles and three bristle types, dental hygiene actually improved.</li>
            <li> so you are not left holding an old yucky brush</li>
            <li> They work well on the Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep Brush.  </li>
            <li> Teeth feel cleaner and look whiter than the &#x27;professional&#x27; brush that comes as standard equipment.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought it was just something wrong with my toothbruth.  </li>
            <li> Can you believe how expensive the refills are for electric toothbrushes, but I am hooked on the electric kind.  </li>
            <li> It might be interesting to note that the periodontal disease isn&#x27;t getting worse, and on some teeth is even disappearing.</li>
            <li> Using the slightly larger brush on the floss action takes a little bit of getting used to, but my teeth felt cleaner right after brushing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For an item of personal sanitary use, I would have expected the refill brushes to have been delivered in their original packaging, Rather each was loose, in a baggie.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s quite a bit more drag and a stiff penalty to pay for potentially improved cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the floss action.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how the other reviewers got a sub-standard (read fake) product, but I made pretty sure that this was a genuine Oral B replacement.</li>
            <li> By &amp;#34;feel cleaner&amp;#34; I mean that my teeth feel totally smooth afterward, no rough deposits or anything else is missed by these heads.</li>
            <li> so I will replace them regularly rather than run out and wait until I drive over to the big box store, that way I always have a new brush.</li>
            <li> that do the &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; feel odd at first</li>
            <li> After using it for less than 6 months, it was the first time ever</li>
            <li> The first brush broke after less than a month.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if these are the same as the brushes that come with the original toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;These broke at the junction of the moving head and the extension that fits on the brush</li>
            <li> Flossing became difficult for when I lost most of the use of my right hand due to a stroke.</li>
            <li> We use several different Oral-B brush head types, and all meet the same high quality standards that come with the Oral-B brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was using the larger brush head with two parts, the Oral-B Dual Clean, for the past four months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had the need to floss my teeth in nearly a year thanks to the little (rubber?) strips in the brushhead.</li>
            <li> Price is also much cheaper on Amazon than in grocery or other stores</li>
            <li> due to not being to floss as much.  </li>
            <li> This product seems flimsy, but has lasted longer than the other brushheads I have purchased, so I would consider buying again so long as the price is right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned my lesson the hard way and will only order the genuine Oral-B from now on.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the posters who put up the pictures to know the difference between the fake and genuine brush heads.</li>
            <li> After switched, I brushed much cleaner and my gums are less sensitive.</li>
            <li> Oral B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Heads just as expected in photo!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> B003UKM90Q Oral-B Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush, Blue and White]].  </li>
            <li> I even stopped drinking red wine and tried everything to get the stains off that had become semi permanent but nothing worked except a professional cleaning, which then lasted only a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I might go to a local chain drugstore or the oral-B site directly for the next couple packs.</li>
            <li> After many years of getting the head shake from the dentist, I randomly swapped to electric toothbrush and these floss action heads.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing the extra soft heads to try next, after these three need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple different Oral-B electric rechargeable toothbrushes over the years and am currently using the Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> With these here, the brush heads all started coming loose easily move back and forth after only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com\\&quot; is the only choice, no other vendors.  </li>
            <li> The jury is out on how well the bristles will hold up compared to the regular version which lasts me at least 4 months, I have a feeling it will not last quite as long because of the more intricate brush design.  </li>
            <li> I was a little worried to buy these based on other reviews, but I received genuine Oral-B replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> When I looked at it I thought it would not clean good in the corners of the teeth since the round brush is not fully round</li>
            <li> They have the same round top but they also have a down portion that makes the cleaning area much bigger.</li>
            <li> It says the only thing to use a medium or hard brush on are to clean car</li>
            <li> Floss Action heads are similar to the standard Precision heads, but have 4 extra rubber paddles for \\&quot;flossing action\\&quot;  or removing some stains.</li>
            <li> pretty firm but works well.</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to at first, but after a few days, my teeth and gums got used to the &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; cleaning that these brushes provide.  </li>
            <li> Bought from &amp;#34;sold and shipped&amp;#34; by Amazon and I was comparing to my original one and looked the same but the new one doesn&#x27;t fit flush to the pole base.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the Floss Action heads are a bit bigger, but I think that suits me fine, and you&#x27;ll probably be down with it too unless you&#x27;ve got really small</li>
            <li> The floss action brush heads are advertised as being sold with the Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush; however, these brush heads DO NOT fit that particular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the less expensive Oral-B heads (minus the floss action) and these are far superior.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Actually, even buying from Oral-B&#x27;s Amazon listing was somewhat of a gamble because other reviewers for this particular listing said that they were sent fake/low quality brush heads as well.</li>
            <li> For starters, with any of the Oral B automatic toothbrushes, you let the brush do the work, so you really shouldn&#x27;t press this hard against your teeth like a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving them a 4 rather than 5 due to the high price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased them from Amazon, but based on other reviews, if they are purchase from Amazon through another seller, there is a high risk of them being counterfeit.</li>
            <li> I have been using these oral b floss action brushes for a very long time.</li>
            <li> My dentist appointments are much shorter, I have a lot less plaque.</li>
            <li> Apparantly, the old one was lasting to long.</li>
            <li> Now if I could just find the thin brush tip heads just as easily.</li>
            <li> But if I can save a few bucks with Target&#x27;s generic, then that&#x27;ll be my first choice.</li>
            <li> The width is the same, but the height is about half again as large.</li>
            <li> His view was to go back to the older head due to</li>
            <li> A copy of the original product but not nearly as good.</li>
            <li> Heads began to get loose after a month and then fell off completely.  </li>
            <li> I feel the Floss action is a waste of money, just a way to get a little more out your pocket to brush less.</li>
            <li> I had been using the new Floss Action head only a few weeks when I went to my dentist.</li>
            <li> I really need to find a way to either get these for less or just switch back to regular</li>
            <li> With the Vitality brush, the RPMs weren&#x27;t fast enough or the oscillating action was slightly off causing the Floss Action heads to hurt my gums a little.</li>
            <li> - this is the very definition of average!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for but little bits of plastic shouldn&#x27;t cost this much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The little paddle brushes in these heads really gets between the teeth</li>
            <li> I think they wear out a little fast, but they are cheaper than in store.</li>
            <li> The cheaper ones come off while brushing your teeth, do not rotate, and in general fail to complete the mission of getting your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;actually flossing between your teeth and the little rubber pieces seem to protect the bristles and make them last so much longer.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason these new brush heads aren&#x27;t lasting near as long as the previous.  </li>
            <li> The packaging clearly states that this does not fit the Vitality Sonic, Sonic Complete, Pulsonic, or CrossAction Power toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I was very much in need of new brush heads and was not happy with the cost at one of my local stores.  </li>
            <li> just so you know, if you are a hard brusher it wont last super long.</li>
            <li> They seem to clean as well as the other heads but no better in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I thought that had happened through the handling process, but after all 3 heads broke down with in one week of normal use, I figured the package had been tampered</li>
            <li> Finding the right replacement heads in the drugstore or at Walmart is sometimes hard.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the bristles are stiff, much stiffer than even the regular replacement heads.</li>
            <li> This one is harder than the original one - I know it&#x27;s supposed to be hard -</li>
            <li> You use it in a very sensitive area of your body, and it&#x27;s not worth the risk of injury even if the knock-off is similar in quality.</li>
            <li> The bristles are too stiff and the whole assembly doesn&#x27;t even snap in place as it should.</li>
            <li> Although price is clearly cheaper than other places, your brush will break after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> I ordered the other set directly from P&amp;G store, which is manufacturer&#x27;s store.  </li>
            <li> she uses the Floss Action (due to size).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> I will probably stick with this design although Oral B offers other types of heads.</li>
            <li> In fact because the flossing paddles take up so much space on the head they brush less efficiently than the regular Oral B round sensitive heads.  </li>
            <li> After testing out the regular brush heads and these Floss Action heads, I think it just comes down to personal preference.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush performs well for cleaning teeth as advertised; however IMHO there are two issues with the product one major, health related issue and the other related to marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bristles were noticeably sloppy, particularly when compared to the real thing</li>
            <li> I hope they last long until the next time we need replacement.</li>
            <li> The next oral b I get will not be the floss action if they still make the other style!</li>
            <li> My only wish is that Amazon would allow for a less frequent auto purchase.  </li>
            <li> I compared these new ones to one of my older replacement brushheads and you can clearly tell they are fake.</li>
            <li> I would warn the average person to completely stay away from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update april 2014:</li>
            <li> I had read about third party seller selling fake brush head refills, but since the price wasn&#x27;t ridiculously low, I thought that they had to be genuine oral-B brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how much they do in the flossing realm</li>
            <li> Expensive but the only ones that fit properly.</li>
            <li> The heads last about 3 months as long as you aren&#x27;t pushing the bristles too forcefully.</li>
            <li> i need to see how long it is going to last.</li>
            <li> for several months, and the bristles change color LONG BEFORE the head loosens up from wear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, these are big, much bigger than the normal Oral B heads, and small teeth/mouths may not find these as functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of Oral B&#x27;s (have 2 different units)</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Oral B\\&quot; is grey on the ones I just purchased, and the blue part of the brushhead is darker!!</li>
            <li> They last a long time too.</li>
            <li> I just decided to try this configuration (for some strange reason) instead of the standard one that came with the unit.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long they will last as I just bought them.</li>
            <li> Do the job well and last long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clearly not the same.  </li>
            <li> I hate paying retail for these, but I went back to biting the bullet on price to make sure I bought the real deal.</li>
            <li> I floss everyday with normal floss, a toothbrush cannot do that.</li>
            <li> After coaching for years, I finally broke down and purchased an Oral-B toothbrush (with regular and Floss Action heads) and actually eliminated the need for minor oral surgery after using it for a few months [probably not typical].</li>
            <li> but this particular pack did come with one head that failed during first use.</li>
            <li> Some of the brushheads are loose right out of the pack, the others becomes loose after very little use.</li>
            <li> These brushes work well and last well, but it really hard to see why they should cost so much.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long!</li>
            <li> I was using the other major device.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Heads last just as long as a toothbrush!</li>
            <li> My only advice is to go for the Oral-B brush heads and avoid the generics which do not even hold up for very long.</li>
            <li> It also vibrates against my teeth easily making it uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> For an item that needs to be replaced quite frequently they should be less.</li>
            <li> still floss after brushing, and I noticed that there was alot less plaque between my teeth and the floss action brush</li>
            <li> Product - I got a different package than expected, but the product inside looked the same.</li>
            <li> My dentist is critical of the harsh action on the gums, but my hygienist likes my results, so decide for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , she&#x27;ll send the floss police after me), especially when coupled with a manual Proxabrush that goes between the teeth where the space is wide enough to accept it.</li>
            <li> Several messages here have alleged that Amazon is selling replacement heads that said to have been made by Oral B (Braun) but are actually fakes.  </li>
            <li> The little floss tabs are the first to go - usually in less than a week I am spitting out bits, Then you start losing bristles.</li>
            <li> the bristles are not really standing straight up like the real ones, the center bristles are of different color, and even the \\&quot;oral-B\\&quot; trademark on the brushes are of different color (the trademark should be blue, but the one on the fake brushes are gray) and small than the real ones.  </li>
            <li> BUT ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE WITH LIMITED WRIST MOTION.</li>
            <li> out for the sale I got, which is $7 off Oral-B&#x27;s entire line, including single replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Did not fit my old unit!</li>
            <li> When the burshheads are loose, they don&#x27;t rotate back and forth the way they are supposed to when you hold the brushhead against your teeth; they can picnch your lip or cheek, and they can come apart in your mouth.</li>
            <li> The alternative is to lean over the sink so that gravity will pull this flow down into the sink, not down on to yourself.  </li>
            <li> Recently I have to hold the toothbrush upside down or at a slight angle w/ a decent amount of pressure of the RB falls off</li>
            <li> If you like the small head of the standard round brush, be aware that these have a much larger head.</li>
            <li> How long the heads last is a matter of opinion, they lose their initial stiffness in a couple weeks, then takes a couple months for the blue to wear down.  </li>
            <li> But I will never purchase from Direct Super Center again, since they seem to sell fake items without revealing it in their advertisement.</li>
            <li> The fake had a smaller gray oval, more fuzzy lettering, and the gray was slightly lighter in shade.</li>
            <li> Took a couple of brushing to get used to the slightly different feel, (the flossing tips have a different depth and texture), but once I did I felt like my teeth felt slightly cleaner than with with standard heads.</li>
            <li> Not much more to say other than it does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> I threw the second and third away only a couple of weeks later and bought the \\&quot;plain Jane\\&quot; version.  </li>
            <li> The fakes are also getting very hard to spot apparently, because none of the \\&quot;real vs fake\\</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying this, but these are a little too soft for my taste.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much aboout dislodging stuff between teeth, and shape makes it somewhat hard to navigate around irregular teeth.  </li>
            <li> but I really appreciate that they massage my gums while keeping me from brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> I do have a couple teeth in each quadrant that are very close and hard to floss.  </li>
            <li> The flossing action tends to be a little rough, I think I will return to the regular brush when it is time to replace.</li>
            <li> Can feel a little bit of the floss action - not sure how much it&#x27;s actually doing but can feel some action there.  </li>
            <li> AS LONG AS THE ORIGINAL, TOO SMALL, VERY OVER PRICED AND VERY POOR QUQLITY.  </li>
            <li> Then I looked at customer posted pictures and notes on genuine &amp; fake comparison,</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly no worrying if it&#x27;s going to fit or not.</li>
            <li> Amazon should be at least somewhere responsible for the quality of their products and even of the resellers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm guy, thus I prefer the Floss Action heads.</li>
            <li> (Grey oral-b markings etc.)</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a long time without any problem.  </li>
            <li> My Triumph Toothbrush started making strange noises</li>
            <li> No action was ever taken.  </li>
            <li> I expected a different type of brush.</li>
            <li> they go a long way toward making up for it</li>
            <li> I come from a long line of dental professionals.</li>
            <li> out/ too long in depth.</li>
            <li> Actually, it felt like it was too rough on my gums.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;worked well and lasted long.  </li>
            <li> The time to fix this problem is long overdue, Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be curious what they say at my next cleaning in a couple of weeks!  </li>
            <li> (Curiously, this statement is on the back of the package rather than on the front, and the packaging does not list the toothbrush models that it does</li>
            <li> Have used for years and will continue to do so as long as I have teeth  </li>
            <li> They also last longer than I expected.  </li>
            <li> On the third day it feels very strange when I&#x27;m using it, as if it&#x27;s not really brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I would try and find something less expensive that works just as well or better no matter if it&#x27;s a manual or electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, these fakes were slightly better than some of the previous fakes people posted, but still fake nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Bristles are neither too soft nor too stiff.</li>
            <li> Had different color logo along with other minor differences.  </li>
            <li> There is less bristle, so it doesn&#x27;t take as much toothpaste and it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the stock head (i probably push too hard</li>
            <li> You do need to change them every 3-6 months, the difference between one that I used for longer and one of the new ones was very stark.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a little larger than the regular heads).</li>
            <li> It feels a little larger than the regular Oral B brush</li>
            <li> Seeing other 1 star reviews though it would appear that Amazon buys fakes from the same supplier as well.</li>
            <li> I changed to these brush heads after using the other basic type for years and what a difference.  </li>
            <li> So I contacted Amazon, was told to send them back on my expense for partial refund, I say NO!</li>
            <li> AND THE DEEP SWEEP TO USE INTERCHANGEABLY EVERY OTHER NIGHT</li>
            <li> Head a little bigger than Oral-B&#x27;s standard head, but I like the size.  </li>
            <li> Reviews of other products suggest not all are equal.</li>
            <li> Just through 20 bucks down the toilet since i had to open package to find out.  </li>
            <li> It feels very rough on the mouth and especially the gums.</li>
            <li> Fewer bacteria grow on your bush if the bristles have time to dry out between uses.</li>
            <li> Even after using these heads, real flossing still picks up gunk left behind.  </li>
            <li> Would not live without it.</li>
            <li> Suggest you try a single brush head before you commit to the hype.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, but nothing wrong.</li>
            <li> They come in a single convenient package.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking for this product in local retail stores with no success.</li>
            <li> THE FLOSS ACTION IS POINTLESS, since it WON&#x27;T get in between your teeth.     </li>
            <li> It even tells you when it&#x27;s time to replace by starting with blue bristles that slowly turn to white as it&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li> As yet we have still not received this item so cannot review which I feel is pretty poor when we ordered it over six weeks ago</li>
            <li> so I am stuck with two brand new expensive brushes that are not compatible with my new precision 1000 toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They were very hard to soften even under hot water so they were somewhat rough on the gums.  </li>
            <li> and the the head comes loose.</li>
            <li> The rotating head comes loose and doesn&#x27;t work well after that.  </li>
            <li> The flossy bits don&#x27;t function well once the head is loose.  </li>
            <li> After that the heads become loose and wobbly.</li>
            <li> The loose parts could injure you.  </li>
            <li> (This is what comes loose and causes the head to move erratic) on the inside</li>
            <li> All three heads became loose after 3 or 4 weeks and then would pinch my lip at times.  </li>
            <li> After brushing with the Floss Action Brush Head, I spend less time flossing since the brush head removes a substantial amount of plaque, and the result is less time in the dentist chair, all my teeth intact, and</li>
            <li> They do not get down into the areas between my teeth like my former brush head did.</li>
            <li> The blue indicator bristles do not wear down in color like they should.  </li>
            <li> The only adequate remedy now is extensive, and very expensive, cosmetic dentistry.  </li>
            <li> I know that I, as had many of the other reviewers, received fake replacement brush heads a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> That is slightly (but only slightly) compromised here because of the larger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> considering previous appointments had always included a bit of scraping off plaque, i would say these brushes have made a big difference, for me anyway.</li>
            <li> Brush was bigger than previously</li>
            <li> 1 June 2015 - on my 2nd one of these, and have found that the small blue plastic(?)</li>
            <li> A lot of stores don&#x27;t sell them in odd numbers unless you buy them individually.</li>
            <li> There seem be some extra scrubbing bristles as well (yellow) - I am not sure what they do</li>
            <li> It hits our teeth when brushing in an average way; be prepared to open wide to avoid the tooth hitting.</li>
            <li> They are larger which was weird at first</li>
            <li> I checked my past orders on Amazon and ordered the same replacement brush head currently on my toothbrush</li>
            <li> a side note, these brush heads are slightly bulkier than the standard models.</li>
            <li> Costs about five bucks less than this standard pack.  </li>
            <li> Both times I got legit, long-lasting brush heads (with imprinted serial number on the back, and each head coming with 2 color rings) for almost half the price of what they are in</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure this does enough flossing, so I do floss the regular way, and also use a waterpik,  </li>
            <li> I sometimes find entire Oral-B electric toothbrushes for less than these replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> Now you need to look at the brushes and change them when the blue part is half way faded.</li>
            <li> (the bristles came out on one, the others started out stiff and didn&#x27;t last as long).  </li>
            <li> This new one is a little too stiff for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using them for at least 4 years and let me tell you, the dental hygenist spends a lot less time in my mouth - and doesn&#x27;t have to scrape and dig around the gumline so much anymore.</li>
            <li> Secondly, it gets deeper into tight spaces as well.</li>
            <li> Secondly, it gets deeper into tight spaces as well.</li>
            <li> I read a few of the reviews both positive and negative before I bought this.  </li>
            <li> they are loose not only where the head attaches to the brush, but the brushhead itself is also very loose, and all 3 of them eventually lost the little screws in them and they fell off in our mouths while we were brushing.</li>
            <li> With the subscription discounts and coupons, it was around half as expensive as the local store - well worth the risk.</li>
            <li> After only a few weeks use, the head of the brush is so loose it pinches the inside of your mouth.</li>
            <li> My hygienist always says that there is little left for her to do.</li>
            <li> A little big</li>
            <li> These have numerous little brush heads in varying sizes and density.</li>
            <li> The little piece in the middle acts and feels like what they use at the dentist to polish your teeth during cleanings.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little larger than the original/classic brush head that comes with the electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apparently the little plastic whips built into these brush heads actually change the experience from a soft brushing experience to a hard one, and in my case seem to have done permanent damage.  </li>
            <li> It seems today everyone thinks they have soft or hard gums.</li>
            <li> It says a medium or hard brush can cause immediate damage to the soft tissues surrounding the teeth as well as severe damage to the teeth over time.</li>
            <li> It seems today everyone thinks they have soft or hard gums.</li>
            <li> These things are too hard and make my gums and teeth sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are far to hard and hurt my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It was missing a serial number through the little window on the back, and the plastic piece up in the inside was different as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothbrush for several years, and along with daily flossing and Waterpix, I hardly have any tarter build up at my semiannual teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li> A few bad spots are still visible but the lighter spots are all gone and the floor has a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush was expensive enough, I don&#x27;t know why the replacement heads must cost so much.</li>
            <li> A simple google search reveals how to distinguish between real and fake brush heads.  </li>
            <li> However, there seems to be a general consensus in the reviews that that is a thing of the past, and that all the brush heads bought from this listing are all real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Regular flossing is difficult so this product really helps.</li>
            <li> These brushes work well and last awhile, my only complaint is they stopped including the sensor which would flash and tell you it needed changing.  </li>
            <li> For example, I have a wide gap between two teeth caused by a dental root canal.</li>
            <li> the product packaging was somewhat crushed when i got .....  </li>
            <li> and I received it when expected.</li>
            <li> Shipping - The order was delivered in expected time frame.    </li>
            <li> I would suggest 3 types of brush heads (use different everyday for a change..</li>
            <li> After years of using a vitality oralB brush with traditional soft round heads, I was unable to find those in the store and bought these floss action heads.  </li>
            <li> After a few months of use I noticed that I could no longer remove red wine stains from my teeth, which had never been a problem before.  </li>
            <li> Lesson here is to be careful when ordering these brush heads from online retailers.  </li>
            <li> I bought direct, not through a 3rd party seller, and I received a fake product both for this head, and for the pro white as well.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the real OralB brush heads, they fall apart, the bristles are poor quality, and so on.</li>
            <li> The bristles felt much harder</li>
            <li> Really not much to say.  </li>
            <li> Worked exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> The advertised \\&quot;floss action\\&quot; comes at the expense of somewhat rough treatment.  </li>
            <li> Be careful yourself and watch your children closely if they are using them.  </li>
            <li> This would be too rough for them.</li>
            <li> The paddles on these oval-shaped brush heads are rough on my gums.  </li>
            <li> Not much else to say; if you can afford them then buy them.</li>
            <li> Product is as expected.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected to get.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.  </li>
            <li> Bristles were a bit harder than I expected</li>
            <li> They work exactly as expected, and hold up just like the originals.</li>
            <li> Still have used only one and I&#x27;ve had them  a few months.</li>
            <li> OEM brushes, work as expected.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected</li>
            <li> And the remote control.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush, ashtray, and the matches, and the remote control and the paddle ball.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> Product works as expected.</li>
            <li> I already knew this product and it was the quality I expected.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t waste your money on generic replacement heads.</li>
            <li> They work as expected.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this after I read some reviews by people who gave this product one star ratings, complaining that the product they received was not a real Oral-B, though it said it was..</li>
            <li> I still floss, as these brush heads are not a real substitute.  </li>
            <li> For example, I have a wide gap between two teeth caused by a dental root canal.</li>
            <li> I bought an Oral B/ Braun electric toothbrush package and it came with the regular round heads.</li>
            <li> Since I suffer from periodontal disease, my doctor recommended that I use this head instead of the regular round head.</li>
            <li> This brush head is really no substitute for flossing.</li>
            <li> Not much moreto tell.</li>
            <li> work as expected.  </li>
            <li> A bit expensive, but health is worth it.</li>
            <li> Not a huge difference, but enough that I decided to go for it to take advantage of the Prime.  </li>
            <li> but like other people have said they felt loose.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted but much less expensive than at local stores!</li>
            <li> Fits my Oral-B power base perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;I feel this really getting up into the gum line of my teeth (where I commonly suffer from caries {those lead to cavities btw})&lt;br /&gt;Leaves me with a very clean feeling mouth!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Toothbrush leaves behind a clean feeling and gives plenty of indication to replacement times (or if you are brushing too hard).</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered, but I find it strange that replacement brushes are always sold in packages of odd numbers.  </li>
            <li> This has happened in the past where the brushheads don&#x27;t last longer than 1 month because the brushheads comes loose and breaks off.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the generic brand heads that pretty much fit my Oral B, but they&#x27;re terrible and literally fall apart after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Be very careful, these are much harder on your gums, would not recommend, does not go between teeth.</li>
            <li> It broke off, falling into my hand, as I was very gently trying to inspect it to see what was wrong.</li>
            <li> I find that it really beats down on my teath and the brush seems very stiff and small.</li>
            <li> those little yellow things are more annoying than functional.</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive for toothbrush heads, though.</li>
            <li> Since I used these I don&#x27;t like the other one anymore</li>
            <li> I like it because I can reach into back areas with the small brush,</li>
            <li> A bit too small, I prefer the Deep Sweep heads.</li>
            <li> It is noisier than other brush heads and there is a lot going on in your mouth when you use it.</li>
            <li> The damage is so extreme</li>
            <li> she asked if she could use them as a case study for other dentists.  </li>
            <li> I still recommend following your hygienist&#x27;s recommendations, which is usually to floss before brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not like it as well a simple heat and then using a small head for gums</li>
            <li> I see Amazon has removed all other buying options for this product.  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews warning about unknowingly purchasing a knock-off, and then it happened to me.</li>
            <li> I checked mine based on the reviews of other customers who have received fakes.</li>
            <li> I have been using various oral-b brushes for the past 10-12 years.  </li>
            <li> do however floss almost every other day with Reach Access flossers so combined with these brushes</li>
            <li> Performs as expected!</li>
            <li> They have spoiled me for any other Oral-B brush heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d agree with the other reviews that 2 minutes with this thing</li>
            <li> I usually use the regular heads and ordered these on sale and with a coupon by mistake.</li>
            <li> and they are rough!</li>
            <li> Pretty lame Oral B.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need one other thing, not one.</li>
            <li> Although genetically speaking some people are prone to have ‘weak teeth’, extensive damage can be prevented by proper dental hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product matches exactly with the description of the fake brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve saved the other two for myself.</li>
            <li> I had read reviews from other people about these heads and thought I&#x27;d give them a try.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know why the other reviews have a lot of complaints about authenticity.</li>
            <li> Any other suggestions?</li>
            <li> I noticed that I could not feel plaque along the gum line like I could other brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is the head or the actual unit</li>
            <li> The other indicator is each brushhead replacement should come with 2 colored rings.</li>
            <li> I was informed that removing the brush head and holding under running water is the only recommended method of cleaning, and they were unable to recommend any other method of getting rid of the deposits, but said they may call back if there is further information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used other versions of brush for this handle, however i was dissatisfied with the results</li>
            <li> I use it every other day as I also like the stain removing head.</li>
            <li> bigger is not better</li>
            <li> Works fine as is but just a tiny gap between the color ring and the base.  </li>
            <li> Hence I would caution others to be very careful about using these - indeed  </li>
            <li> expected nothing less.</li>
            <li> And even worse, the wobbly head becomes kind of dangerous: it can pinch your lips</li>
            <li> I expected less plaque after 3 months of use</li>
            <li> and I expected less battery life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands, and the bristles started falling out after a few uses.</li>
            <li> And they fit the least expensive Oral B Electric Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Having been sans dental insurance off and on over the past decade, whenever I do get in for a cleaning, the hygienist is usually amazed that I&#x27;ve gone 12+ months without a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> years ago these tooth brush heads were harder, but now they are a little bit softer and the flossing parts are a little loose.</li>
            <li> In the past I have only used the traditional small, round brush head.</li>
            <li> The other day I was driving down the street</li>
            <li> This is a well mad set of brush heads, that really does act a lot like floss, getting into the nooks and crannies that a regular head may not manage.</li>
            <li> The price is a bit expensive but not as much at Amazon as at other stores.</li>
            <li> They are out there, just have to search a little harder.</li>
            <li> These brush heads feel a little rough on my gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> A little rougher than expected.  </li>
            <li> It is a little big for kids and medium to small size people</li>
            <li> The yellow flossing pieces are hard plastic and just beat on your teeth.</li>
            <li> the yellow pieces are hard plastic, but i don&#x27;t notice it when i brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> I dread buying the Oral-B replacement brushes in local stores because of the cost and because they can be hard to find.</li>
            <li> I think using this constantly is too hard on the gums.</li>
            <li> These are too aggressive and hard on the gums and the heads are larger</li>
            <li> I have average teeth and gums in regards to sensitivity.</li>
            <li> This brush is intended for the 80-90% of us who have average gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the shipment, very convenient.</li>
            <li> Probably what happened is that the fake brush has cut bristles and the real thing has rounded bristles.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not worth paying over $6 a brush head anymore for them.</li>
            <li> Usually, I buy the regular, round Flexisoft brush heads.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that they are a bit rougher on the gum line than the Ultrasoft Oral-B model.</li>
            <li> So, sorry, there isn&#x27;t too much to say about them</li>
            <li> That is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Like I said I didn&#x27;t really care about the money, but rather that I&#x27;ve been using fake brushheads for a year and</li>
            <li> I came here to see if the Target Oral-B RBs are shoddy, but I think it&#x27;s a bigger issue.</li>
            <li> The ones that are sold by Amazon are 100% real and not the fake ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long it takes.  </li>
            <li> Some have provided photos with claims that this is what the fake packaging looks like and that is what the real thing looks like.  </li>
            <li> I have average teeth and gums in regards to sensitivity.</li>
            <li> This brush is intended for the 80-90% of us who have average gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> Just common sense to purchase the extra heads</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand why these are so expensive.  </li>
            <li> So was much too expensive.</li>
            <li> I really love having an electric toothbrush, but I hate buying these replacements.  </li>
            <li> Now the Oral-B handle counts down 2 min as well, but it&#x27;s the equivalent of 600 manual strokes.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B toothbrush is the winner hands down.</li>
            <li> The heads have to be replaced when they wear down over 6-12 weeks.</li>
            <li> they will track down the offender through their distributors who supply the product.  </li>
            <li> So wouldn&#x27;t that mean I only need to use the Oral-B for about 20 seconds?</li>
            <li> plus its alottttt cheaper here on amazon than other places!</li>
            <li> The result is a flow of toothpaste and saliva all over your brand new shirts - this sucks unless you like paying for unnecessary dry cleaning.  </li>
            <li> If someone has produced a fake and conned Amazon into selling it (highly unlikely, IMHO), the fake is of such good quality that it is a non-issue.</li>
            <li> They include little plastic rings, so if more than one person uses the base, you can tell whose is whose.</li>
            <li> There are small metal rods that are inside which became loose in my mouth, plus the plastic head fell off the arm...</li>
            <li> In this regard, they are at least the equivalent of the Flexisofts, and they may even be slightly superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun embeds 4 little rubber \\&quot;paddles\\&quot; into the brush head to, according to them, get between the teeth giving the same benefit as Dental Floss.</li>
            <li> The heads are expensive (like replacement cartridges for your ink-jet printer) and should be replaced when the blue indicator is worn down half way, but they do work and coupled with the timer-electric toothbrush unit, the daily routine becomes easier and healthier.</li>
            <li> The final proof that these are fake was the brush head fell off the shaft after only 3 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> A pack of 3 is convenient and less costly than singles.</li>
            <li> i actually got them because they were less expensive than the regular replacement heads at the time.  </li>
            <li> Previous gum issues that I was having are now all resolved.  </li>
            <li> Looks less substantial.        </li>
            <li> It is easier to maintain with less fungal growth on the heads and handle.</li>
            <li> See previous answer.  </li>
            <li> I still floss but less often.  </li>
            <li> I was using the sensitivity brush heads previously,</li>
            <li> Amazon also has the refile floss heads for half of the price of any where elsed.</li>
            <li> I wish they would just sell for less</li>
            <li> Less time at the dentist.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Final Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;These are a bit expensive but I highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it feels hard on my teeth even when I am brushing softly so as not to trigger the pressure alert on my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;fake\\&quot; ones would rust, the little yellow flossers would fall off the head, and the entire head holding the bristles would disconnect from the mechanism that moves it rendering it useless.  </li>
            <li> I compared my toothbrush heads to the pictures online and have discovered they are not true oral b brand toothbrush heads</li>
            <li> Just a little bit less than you can buy at Walmart for.</li>
            <li> I do additionally floss, because I have tight teeth and the bristles of this brush can&#x27;t reach between them.</li>
            <li> So this weekend I began to look into buying a new toothbruth when I came across all the articles about the fake brushheads.  </li>
            <li> invest in this simple little gadget!!!   </li>
            <li> Luckily, I didn&#x27;t swallow any of the parts, but would have been bad IF I had.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t last long, and quite expensive.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks half of the bristles wore away or fell out or something.  </li>
            <li> I realize this pretty much makes me a horrible person.</li>
            <li> when I wake up no matter how little pressure I use to brush.</li>
            <li> a little bit softer though.</li>
            <li> So be aware, and be wary!</li>
            <li> Our hygentist ALWAYS comments on how little plaque build up we have.  </li>
            <li> they were a little lower in cost</li>
            <li> &amp; I saved a little $$$S</li>
            <li> I figured it was just a little off and causing damage to the heads.  </li>
            <li> , so I get a little discount.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought they were fake -- now I know!</li>
            <li> While cleaning, the head seems to  hang upon my teeth because of the little rubber pieces.</li>
            <li> I use the other brush heads too because I am not sure whether these create gum wear.  </li>
            <li> I just wish they were a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> but, it is a little pricey for replacements.</li>
            <li> the name might be a little misleading.</li>
            <li> Just had a 6 month cleaning, and the hygienist was commenting on how little plaque she had to remove.</li>
            <li> Maybe a little overpriced for replacements...</li>
            <li> Sometimes I feel it is a little harsh on the gums</li>
            <li> Just like any tooth brush that is harder they feel hard on the teeth.</li>
            <li> Clearly, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> There are a few reasons why.</li>
            <li> My husband found a piece in his mouth after brushing a few days ago.</li>
            <li> substitute brand that DO NOT FIT at all.</li>
            <li> So perhaps Amazon has fixed the problem with fake brush heads.  </li>
            <li> I find that Costco has the lowest price for these heads (they also go on sale there a few times a year)</li>
            <li> Nothing is left behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve damaged quite a few of these heads whenever I travel.  </li>
            <li> Feels like they are about to fall off in your mouth so you are forced to replace it with the next head, which will undoubtedly also fail you shortly.</li>
            <li> Its actually worse than that because i only use each head type once per day.  </li>
            <li> They raised the price after a few shipments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all of this firm and returned to her.</li>
            <li> w/floss thread after using this brush head &amp; hasn&#x27;t gotten anything left behind yet.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses (about 10 or so), the brush head started coming apart.</li>
            <li> They did not fit propery and made a lot of noise.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the set of brushes and they arrived within a few days.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re OEM and not cheap imitations from Taiwan.</li>
            <li> This is incorrect product--does not fit my device.  </li>
            <li> You can save a few bucks if you use Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save like I do.</li>
            <li> I just came from the dentist a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I will again in a few months</li>
            <li> I used it for a few days and found that my teeth were killing me.  </li>
            <li> I opened the flossers to discover it did not fit my oral-b.  </li>
            <li> as it will save you a few bucks and also include another \\&quot;tip head\\&quot; at no increase in price!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> We ordered a few of these for the family, they came on time and sealed like they should be.</li>
            <li> They did not fit my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Do you like the sensation of running your tongue behind your teeth and actually feeling each and everyone?  </li>
            <li> At night, the smaller head is easier to maneuver when I am tired.  </li>
            <li> There are few type of toothbrush head for my Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Electric Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These are not cheap when you consider cost per brush head</li>
            <li> and I have a dried film on my teeth</li>
            <li> I figured I would not know for a few months.</li>
            <li> They can be a bit harsh</li>
            <li> There are a few reasons why.</li>
            <li> However they are not cheap knockoffs.</li>
            <li> I thought I had a few stockpiled</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently, my gums would bleed a few times a week after brushing and flossing.  </li>
            <li> But since I bought the Floss Actions, I didn&#x27;t want to waste them</li>
            <li> I have to return the ones I bought at the store which do not fit.</li>
            <li> But it turns out this is a false advertising, a total scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate to floss and my last dentist check up went really well.</li>
            <li> The work really well and would hate to ever have to go back to a manual toothbrush ever again.</li>
            <li> The brush is a little stiff too.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like a hard brush, you may want to choose other brush heads.</li>
            <li> The brushes that come with the other ones are to hard for me.  </li>
            <li> The cost is a edging on ridiculous, however, so lately we&#x27;ve been using the generic version from Target.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think that I need to be worried about whether the product is fake or not on Amazon!</li>
            <li> When it rotates the little brushes do their job by cleaning the small gaps between teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were less expensive but only in price not in quality.</li>
            <li> These have some plastic bristles that I find rather painful &amp; you must be aware of this before deciding if you want this type of</li>
            <li> After trying these I do prefer the small round heads to these ones.</li>
            <li> The packaging for this product was very questionable, making me question if this is a real Oral-B product or some knock off.  </li>
            <li> They felt very uncomfortable in my mouth and with the little flossing tips it is hard to keep the brush on your teeth because it keeps trying to, for lack of a better word, bounce off so steadying it was difficult for me.  </li>
            <li> difficult to purchase in drugstores because they are constantly of stock due to their high&lt;br /&gt;popularity &amp; use!!  </li>
            <li> Those little rubber paddles must be removing the stains before they start!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll go for something that doesn&#x27;t have the little rubber swatters in there!</li>
            <li> A little hard though.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth getting the name brand in this case based on reviews I read of very disappointing knock-offs.</li>
            <li> The sets sold in stores usually include a brush or brushes I  don&#x27;t use or want.</li>
            <li> I usually just look to see if the item qualifies for Prime and</li>
            <li> I usually get about three months from each brush head as is indicated on the packaging for the heads.</li>
            <li> he was not able to use it.</li>
            <li> Usually replace every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer</li>
            <li> Do you usually prefer soft/medium bristle toothbrushes, or do you tend to seek out the firms?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although initially skeptical, after cleaning my teeth again today, my hygienist agreed that my teeth have recently become roughened on the surface in a way they never were for all the past years she has cleaned them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether to return to Amazon or to call OralB.    Not pleased at all.</li>
            <li> In my opinion these are not authentic Oral-B toothbrushs.</li>
            <li> I used to go on dates with the confidence of a nerdy insecure loser; picture Woody Allen, but with bigger glasses.</li>
            <li> Not sure if these are counterfeit.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews, I figured the problem with Amazon sending out counterfeit(fake)replacement heads was a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> I have in the past received counterfeit brush heads from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not sure why</li>
            <li> that you can see through those three small windows.</li>
            <li> Just been brushing as usual with electric brush</li>
            <li> AS IN THE PAST</li>
            <li> What a waste!  </li>
            <li> When I manually floss there is no more blood when I spit.  </li>
            <li> Not much more to say about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; a toothbrush head, but I like this one, for use with my many-years-old-now Braun/Oral-B electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush, ashtray, the paddle game, and the remote control, and that&#x27;s all I need.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush, ashtray, the paddle game and the remote control and the lamp</li>
            <li> The toothbrush, ashtray, the remote control, the paddle game, the magazine and the chair...</li>
            <li> , I usually wait about 4 to 5 months.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth (no comments from relatives or spouse please)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I get the \\&quot;Floss</li>
            <li> I have usually purchased this type of toothbrush head as a replacement and find that I replace brush heads every month</li>
            <li> Unbelievable product.</li>
            <li> did purchase one brush on the replacement whereas I usually have a twin brush.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Expensive, but necessary for your electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> I usually bought these from costco.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they are %100 legit</li>
            <li> Usually when I have a coupon I don&#x27;t need a replacement and when I need one there are no coupons around.  </li>
            <li> I did not experience the issues other reviewers posted about fake or imitation products.  </li>
            <li> These are very harsh on teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Very firm brush head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to get the floss type Oral Brush head refill without being forced to additionally buy the standard brush heads.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they are quite expensive.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical after reading some reviews about fake brush heads, but what I received, works very well.</li>
            <li> Irritate: Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Head are terrible.</li>
            <li> , After doing research i realized Amazon sent me a fake product, the item i received does not have a serial number in the back, look at this pictures in this listing to see what i mean</li>
            <li> the packaging looks almost the same (the fake package even says the brushes were \\&quot;made in Germany\\&quot;), but there are subtle differences:</li>
            <li> Very stiff hurts my gums  </li>
            <li> This type of brush head has little plastic paddles which were very hard on my gums.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully our toothbrush lets us know when we are pushing too hard.</li>
            <li> And the reason I decided to purchase one is because my dentist keeps telling me that I&#x27;m brushing too hard</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell from the picture, but the text and graphics were noticeably fuzzy.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> and I hardly had any plaque buildup.  </li>
            <li> Bought six so as not to run out since they are so hard to find.  </li>
            <li> they are too hard.</li>
            <li> Just need to not push too hard on the toothbrush to avoid irritation.</li>
            <li> I do not have to work hard at flossing now.  </li>
            <li> He told me that my toothbrush was too hard and I was going to damage my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just threw away a $20 three-pack of brush heads because they the bristles are really hard.</li>
            <li> my country is too hard to find it.&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
            <li> Gets the hard to reach food particles out of my teeth.</li>
            <li> No reason to push hard.</li>
            <li> Too hard for my gums</li>
            <li> I like that the brush is designed to help one get to hard to get to places in one&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
            <li> Factory replacements, hard to complain about these.  </li>
            <li> so when I saw that these were supposed to imitate the flossing action I figured \\&quot;what could be bad about that?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind that you should replace your brush head at least once every three months.</li>
            <li> at least the one I got).</li>
            <li> oh well beter late than never</li>
            <li> Refunding or contacting the reseller is the least they can do in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I tried the cheap off brand ones and they were horrible.  </li>
            <li> Then maybe we would not have to see people with offensive nasty teeth with brown rings near the gums, brown stains, and white plaque</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they are quite expensive and you need to exchange them quite frequently for hygiene reasons.</li>
            <li> I have never liked</li>
            <li> can not honestly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I realized it too late too return them.</li>
            <li> Well it may be just me, but these floss-like thingies are way too thick to get between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Only docking one point because these are expensive!</li>
            <li> That was not enjoyable!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count) for about a month now and the difference is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> In this case newer was not better!</li>
            <li> I mean the brush head still functions well,</li>
            <li> I came to check if other buyers have this problem, and I saw some have the suspicion that they are fake brushheads.</li>
            <li> Other than how expensive they are, I have no complaints on this product.</li>
            <li> AS I HATE THE NEW CLEANING PROCESS!</li>
            <li> I tried the imitation brush heads as these always seemed so expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been told by multiple dental assistants it is very difficult to floss me because the teeth are located close together.</li>
            <li> I have been told by multiple dental assistants it is very difficult to floss me because the teeth are located close together.</li>
            <li> But off-brand replacement heads I&#x27;ve tried are even worse, usually being abrasive to the lips or crudding-up around the moving brush.</li>
            <li> The subtle difference was in the gray Oral-B logo.</li>
            <li> They seriously need to change this design.</li>
            <li> I tried a lesser head recently, and was miserable for three months, until it wore out.  </li>
            <li> I just wish they were less pricey but compared to expensive trips to the dentist</li>
            <li> once I really looked at my gum health and realized it was bad (embarrassing, ich!).</li>
            <li> but for people with tight teeth these structure are, in my opinion, useless.</li>
            <li> Little did I know that brush heads can be fake.</li>
            <li> Everyone who bought counterfeit here should complain to Oral-B and push them to take action on this stupid counterfeit madness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, with that, you&#x27;d think these are the worst brushes in the world, right?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly disappointed with amazon&#x27;s quality control for third party sellers.</li>
            <li> The projectile saliva/toothpaste mix is an inevitability with this design - it sucks!  </li>
            <li> It has small plastic blades within the bristles and is really uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> You are then forced to throw them away after discarding wrapper &amp; receipt like I did!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not pressing very hard</li>
            <li> I have a tough time finding these heads in the stores when I need it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;that usually carry the Oral B Brand Brush Heads!!  </li>
            <li> The brush heads, however, are hard to find and expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have been using an Oral B electric toothbrush for approximately 8 years.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re all broken at the head.</li>
            <li> After one weeks use the bristles are sticking out and irritating .</li>
            <li> Not happy with replacement brusheads.  </li>
            <li> The hardest area to hit is behind the front teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen knockoffs that are of this poor quality.</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY.</li>
            <li> Not a great design.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> And the paddle game.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush, ashtray, and the paddle game</li>
            <li> My hands are poorly coordinated because of MS and arthritis.  </li>
            <li> The manufacturer is either making shoddy products or someone is making a lot of fake Oral-B replacement brushes and selling them to legitimate businesses.</li>
            <li> In addition to bristles, there are four thin rubber \\&quot;pads\\&quot; on the brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using an Oral B electric toothbrush for approximately 8 years.</li>
            <li> but, rather falsely advirtized as such.~*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> The flossaction is a false advertisement.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the plastic floss bristles are very hard.</li>
            <li> After I tried the ones I bought here, i can tell immediately these are FAKE - really poor quality.</li>
            <li> After years of no cavities, I ran into one young dentist (trying to drum up business) who grimly informed me that I had FIVE.</li>
            <li> the yellow rubber bristles the &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; irritate the gums very bad.  </li>
            <li> Be careful, there&#x27;s a lot of fake crap out there.  </li>
            <li> No more cavities, bad check ups or added expense.  </li>
            <li> but apparently they don&#x27;t think that way, very disappointed!</li>
            <li> They are useless compared to any of the Oral B brushes.</li>
            <li> i had no idea they even sold fake ones, which i have received.</li>
            <li> I am unable to rate the product as it was not recieved.  </li>
            <li> Amazon is shipping the wrong product.</li>
            <li> Expensive...</li>
            <li> A FAKE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> After about a month, the screws fell out of 2 of the brush heads leaving them useless.  </li>
            <li> These fakes are made with a plastic that wears out from the friction, and the brush head loosens up to a point where it starts to become useless after about 60 brushing cycles.</li>
            <li> &quot; pictures given on the product page were helpful in spotting the fake in my case.</li>
            <li> I took the fake to CVS and compared to the originals.</li>
            <li> As always, too expensive, but they do the job.  </li>
            <li> After reading about all the fake versions of these heads, we almost didn&#x27;t order them.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, the heads we got weren&#x27;t fake - they had the serial numbers, two colored rings and no color bleeding.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Con: Expensive.</li>
            <li> I can not detect any \\&quot;flossing\\&quot; from the brush, but that would be difficult to assess.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> I received the fake ones people have been complaining about.</li>
            <li> The brush head is oval and it rattles against my teeth, which I find uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like they put in a fake brand.  </li>
            <li> These seem fake.  </li>
            <li> IT IS FAKE AND COUNTERFEIT.</li>
            <li> I have tried using the generic ones and they are awful</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I just ordered the wrong item.</li>
            <li> Expensive and the plastic under the bristles hits my teeth.</li>
            <li> Too expensive-</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using fake heads for a year.  </li>
            <li> A bit expensive for a plastic consumable, wish it was cheaper</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fake.</li>
            <li> but I think it is really expensive.</li>
            <li> The brush bristles are coming off after just 4 days of use, Possibly a fake being sold.</li>
            <li> I was worried by the fact I could get a fake brush head refill...</li>
            <li> But, both are expensive.  </li>
            <li> Ill buy it again.  </li>
            <li> I assumed because these were expensive Oral-B brand they&#x27;d work well.  </li>
            <li> WRONG.  </li>
            <li> They are 3 times as expensive as non-flossing heads.  </li>
            <li> They are useless compared to any of the Oral B brushes.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are expensive, and so are these.</li>
            <li> litter expensive, but acceptable.</li>
            <li> and I found them to be extremely uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B replacement brush heads are ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li> so unfortunately these won&#x27;t give you a shortcut to the finish line in the bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> reviewers claim that this toothbrush head is fake, that it doesn&#x27;t stay on their toothbrush or it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> However, they may have been using it on the wrong electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews saying people received fake product.</li>
            <li> Awful actually hurts to brush.</li>
            <li> What go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> This is rather uncomfortable after about 2-3 minutes of standing in this awkward position.  </li>
            <li> The cost is a little outrageous.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the point of buying an expensive electric toothbrush when you&#x27;re going to use bad brush heads on them?</li>
            <li> I am however not to crazy about these toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> My mouth will feel numb around the teeth</li>
            <li> It vibrates like crazy and beats up your teeth.</li>
            <li> My teeth have dirty spots on them in the crevice corners and this never happened before.</li>
            <li> #34;Always replace your toothbrush head after you have had a cold, sore throat or infection.</li>
            <li> I used to hate the dentist, not because of anything that he did, but because of my poor brushing habits.  </li>
            <li> WRONG!  </li>
            <li> They are outrageously expensive!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of researching before buying an electric toothbrush because let&#x27;s face it - these babies are expensive!</li>
            <li> Must be a bad batch...</li>
            <li> I got some, and they were bad.  </li>
            <li> No idea if this is intentional or i just received a bad batch, but it is making me consider switching tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> So i though maybe it was just a bad one.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t feels bad.</li>
            <li> i have had oral -b for years but nothing like this kin of brush to bad</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say anything bad about it, but i still prefer Prowhite ones.</li>
            <li> pass up this deal because of bad reviews.</li>
            <li> a bit frustrated bust</li>
            <li> In summary:  BAD, FAKE, POORLY CONSTRUCTED, STAY AWAY!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed about this information</li>
            <li> Rather disappointed.</li>

            <li> but I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> And they are outrageous expensive.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product, the brush head features these stupid rubber spikes that are supposed to provide a \\&quot;flossing action\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Crap product.</li>
            <li> I hate to floss</li>
            <li> I hate this product and will never buy it again.  </li>

            <li> Truth: they make brushing your teeth a painful endeavor!</li>

            <li> Very disappointed with Amazon</li>
            <li> they are terrible!!!</li>
            <li> That is just disgusting.  </li>
            <li> Decided to give them a try since I am terrible about flossing.</li>
            <li> These are horrible.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE DESIGN!</li>
            <li> well, they were horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great!&lt;br /&gt;I expected nothing less. I cannot compare them to other Oral-B brushes but they worked great for me!&lt;br /&gt;They are soft enough so they dont hurt my teeth and clean great!</li>
            <li> Good value for these rotating toothbrush replacements</li>
            <li> Pretty great replacements.</li>
            <li> The only brush heads I use with the Oral-B toothbrush.  They work great.</li>
            <li> They fit and work perfectly!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;compatible&amp;#34; heads sold by group-on just dont cut it.  I didnt realize how well these worked until I needed to buy replacements.&lt;br /&gt;These are great, my teeth feel noticably cleaner after brushing (when compared to a manual brush).</li>
            <li> Excellent product, and excellent way to order it on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> Love it. It works as advertised. I bought it with Subscribe &amp; Save, great deal!</li>
            <li> Fits all of our older model tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> What it&#x27;s supported to be.  I prefer the original, this product, to the &amp;#34;compatible&amp;#34; ones.</li>
            <li> Very nice product with good deal.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are too big to be comfortable. They really hurt my gums. I recommend getting the smaller brush heads for sensitive teeth. Particularly if you are switching out your Sonicare tooth brush for an Oral B like I did.</li>
            <li> Purchased these online after having difficulty finding them in local drugstores.  Was pleased with the price and they were exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I put my tongue on the inside of my teeth while brushing the outside and could feel the bristles coming through between the teeth. I wonder if the dentists will tell us users we can stop flossing manually by using these brush heads? That&#x27;s maybe too much to hope for.....</li>
            <li> The standard repalcement for Oral B electric toothbrushes.  Works well.</li>
            <li> This is a well mad set of brush heads, that really does act a lot like floss, getting into the nooks and crannies that a regular head may not manage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these brush heads myself for years and recently purchased them for my son, who does not always do stellar work when brushing his teeth.  Our dentists says he sees a great improvement in his teeth. Pretty expensive for toothbrush heads, though.</li>
            <li> too big andhardfor my mouth</li>
            <li> Amazon provides oral B professional brushes as one needs with supply and prime shipping.  We switch between Oral B Floss and oral B Precision Clean routinely.</li>
            <li> I have been using an Oral B electric toothbrush for approximately 8 years. In this time I have used the Floss Action, Dual Clean, Sensitive Clean, Power Tip, and a knock-off from China to save a few bucks (purchased on Amazon). I figured I should try them all so I could identify what works best. First, throw the Chinese knock-offs in the garbage. They are useless compared to any of the Oral B brushes. Secondly, I find the Floss Action better by a wide margin over any of the others I have tried. There are a few reasons why. First, it gets between large gaps in the teeth like no other replacement head. For example, I have a wide gap between two teeth caused by a dental root canal. This brush cleans in the space in a way the others don&#x27;t. I do not have to worry about bad breathe from the root canal anymore! Secondly, it gets deeper into tight spaces as well. I have been told by multiple dental assistants it is very difficult to floss me because the teeth are located close together. With these heads there is no issue! Third, The brush is not too rough or soft. I have average teeth and gums in regards to sensitivity. It seems today everyone thinks they have soft or hard gums. Well you know what, most people are \\&quot;average\\&quot; - this is the very definition of average! This brush is intended for the 80-90% of us who have average gums and teeth. My teeth aren&#x27;t left slimy from a too soft brush and my gums don&#x27;t hurt from a too rough one. Finally, This head feels the best. You can tell by the unique oscillating rotations that this is a brush with unique features. It doesn&#x27;t do in a circle like others. All the bristles move in awkward ways, creating a sensation that leaves me happy!</li>
            <li> Product came in time and performed as expected.&lt;br /&gt;Since this was the first time I was ordering the Floss Action head, instead of the regular one, I was surprised by the size of it (it&#x27;s a little larger than the regular heads). However, I got used to it quite fast, and it does a great job of keeping the flossing requirements to a minimum.</li>
            <li> This was a good value and I like that I got the brushes I actually use. The sets sold in stores usually include a brush or brushes I  don&#x27;t use or want.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to setup / use.&lt;br /&gt;Good &#x27;cleaning power&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Each brush comes with multiple color bands for identification (my wife and I have identical toothbrushes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A bit expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:&lt;br /&gt;These are great tooth brush heads.  I replace them every 4 months or so and they always leave my mouth feeling clean and refreshed.  Much better than the old manual tooth brushes I used as a kid.  I use these twice a day (and floss once) and had zero cavities after going 3 years without a dentist visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;These are a bit expensive but I highly recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Sammy_K</li>
            <li> These floss action brushes are amazing. I have also used the polishing ones and the floss action ones are way better as far as cleaning between your teeth and getting that nice fresh feeling everytime. Haven&#x27;t had an issue with any of the bristles falling off while brushing either.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for years and still do, and started alternating between Sonicare and the Oral-B about a year ago. They are complementary, the Oral-B cleans better, the Sonicare is more gentle and still cleans pretty well. I initially had this brush head, and then bought a standard head.  The Flossing head cleans better than the standard head, it feels somewhat like a dentist cleaning.  But it is definitely not a substitute for real flossing.  I use a Waterpic as well, which also is not a substitute for flossing, rather complementary.  I just alternate between all of these items, that works well for me.  I expect that Amazon has straightened out the issue of generic brush heads being sent by mistake.  I purchased some generics for my Sonicare once, won&#x27;t try that again, generics are ok sometimes, but in this case there was a big difference from the genuine article.</li>
            <li> Good and firm. They do the trick.</li>
            <li> Since I used these I don&#x27;t like the other one anymore - these are really making a difference!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]]  This is an excellent brush for cleaning between teeth. It seems as though the toothpaste is actually working in the crevices. My teeth feel cleaner and my mouth is more refreshed.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD BRUSH HEADS.  BRUSH AND FLOSS AT THE SAME TIME.  VERY GENTLE.  ONLY BRUSH WE USE.</li>
            <li> These brushes are identical to the ones packaged with the original Triumph Toothbrush.  No surprises really - they are exactly the same and work well.</li>
            <li> Te brush head separates from the stem.  This creates a gap and one&#x27;s tongue and/or lip can be damaged</li>
            <li> I use the Oral B Triumph, and found these replacement heads cheaper than you can get them in any store.  Because I have Prime, I got them in 2 days without shipping fees.  Great product and no issues, the way it should be!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say whether these are knock-offs or the real thing (although the ones I saw at Rite-aid look exactly like this), but I do notice that they don&#x27;t stay put all the way while brushing.  I have to keep jamming it back in - which is kind of a pain.  I&#x27;d rather go with the regular brushes than the floss action ones - those little yellow things are more annoying than functional.</li>
            <li> I had purchased other refill heads before, but these seemed to amp up the performance - left my mouth feeling really clean, a great buy!</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the Brush heads as of yet, but have used the sam models purchased from other places, and the price was super cheap, This was a great deal, compared to the retial price!   Thanks,</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long! Bought 3 of these in Jan and they&#x27;re all broken at the head. They would work fine for a week or so and the the head comes loose. Must be a bad batch...</li>
            <li> After reading the comments after I had ordered, I was alarmed at the counterfeit market and hoping that I would receive genuine brush heads and not have to return some knock offs. Upon arrival of UPS today, I was alarmed that I would received a knockoff since the return address on the Amazon box stated \\&quot;Rose Kiszner from KY\\&quot; instead of Amazon.     I was pleasantly surprised though to find out that with the help of the pictures to identify knockoffs on this site, that the product I received was indeed genuine and can not report any problems yet. Bristles packed tightly and of the correct color, serial number intact, 2 color rings included with each brush and packaging checked out with what the genuine manufacturer produces.     I know amazon can have multiple vendors for one listing and the subheading should disclose the info at time of order. I usually just look to see if the item qualifies for Prime and if so figure that it&#x27;s more likely to be genuine. If the people who reported FAKES could also disclose the RETURN ADDRESS on the boxes we could identify whose distributing the fakes and report to Amazon. Hope this info helps.</li>
            <li> i was online looking to re-order these brushes, since the ones i ordered in january stopped spinning within a week, and even the pieces of the brush were falling apart. My husband found a piece in his mouth after brushing a few days ago. i definitely noticed a difference in the cleanliness of my mouth from these brush heads compared to the ones i received in the initial electric toothbrush package. i had no idea they even sold fake ones, which i have received. i compared the packages and writing on the brush. My window for a refund for a return has expired so i guess i&#x27;ll buy them elsewhere. I&#x27;m really disappointed about this information</li>
            <li> Great brush head replacements. Only docking one point because these are expensive! I know Amazon has a good price on them, but the price on these in general is just ridiculous. Though I buy them anyway because they work really well and last a while. I would rather spend the money on this than spend the money on fixing something with my teeth! I just wish there was a cheaper alternative that was as effective.</li>
            <li> Crap product. In 1 month I went through 2 brush heads. Real ones lasts for months. Spend the Xtra $.</li>
            <li> I like it. you can feel the deep cleaning action.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this head but ordered it anyway.  I can feel the floss action when I&#x27;m using it and am happy with the product. I recommend this to others thinking about trying it.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using these brush heads, I have found inner peace in my life. What else could one want when it comes to manifesting happiness and clean teeth at the same time? Also, the product I received wasn&#x27;t a cheap knockoff - although I may have gotten lucky based on reading the other reviews. I like to roll the dice - it paid off.</li>
            <li> Fits the toothbrushes fine (we have 2 versions of Braun compatible with this head). Nothing wrong with the shipment, very convenient.</li>
            <li> works perfectly; we use these all the time.</li>
            <li> just got mine today, paid about $14 with s/s and coupon.  2 rings, right bristle colors, well/clearly layed out, defined, serial no on back, permanent logo  THANKS AMAZON!  &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!  I ordered the 3 pack thinking it was a great deal.  Upon receipt I noticed something didn&#x27;t look right.  The color of the bristles are not the same as the brush that came with the Oral B toothbrush.  I bought another replacement pack from a big box retailer and it is easy to see the difference between these knock offs and an OEM brush.  The final proof that these are fake was the brush head fell off the shaft after only 3 weeks of use.  OEM brush heads easily last 6 months between dental visits and cleanings.  In summary:  BAD, FAKE, POORLY CONSTRUCTED, STAY AWAY!!!!</li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d. Oral B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Heads just as expected in photo!&lt;br /&gt;Very difficult to purchase in drugstores because they are constantly of stock due to their high&lt;br /&gt;popularity &amp; use!!  Price is also much cheaper on Amazon than in grocery or other stores&lt;br /&gt;that usually carry the Oral B Brand Brush Heads!!  Don&#x27;t make the mistake I did by purchasing&lt;br /&gt;a substitute brand that DO NOT FIT at all. You are then forced to throw them away after discarding wrapper &amp; receipt like I did!</li>
            <li> My dentist warned me that if I keep brushing my teeth too hard, my gums will continue to bleed and I will experience many problems in the long term. I like it because I can reach into back areas with the small brush, not much tooth paste needs to be used and my teeth feel very clean and shiny afterwards! Brushing my teeth is no longer a chore.</li>
            <li> These are comfortable to use, though no more or less effective than the regular non-&amp;#34;flossing action &amp;#34; brush heads.</li>
            <li> We have used these before and have been satified with them</li>
            <li> I ordered these directly from Amazon and got genuine Oral B brush heads.  So perhaps Amazon has fixed the problem with fake brush heads.  Thanks to the posters who put up the pictures to know the difference between the fake and genuine brush heads.</li>
            <li> These brushes fit my Oral B electric tooth cleaner.  I am very happy with brushes as well as the electronic base.</li>
            <li> These work very well, can get behind your back teeth and are soft enough even for sensitive teeth/gums.</li>
            <li> Of all the Oral-B brush head options, the floss action head seems to do the best job of cleaning my teeth. However despite the same, it doesn&#x27;t replace having to actually floss. The heads last about 3 months as long as you aren&#x27;t pushing the bristles too forcefully. Thankfully our toothbrush lets us know when we are pushing too hard. I find that Costco has the lowest price for these heads (they also go on sale there a few times a year) but Amazon is the second cheapest place to buy them. All of the brush heads that I have received from Amazon have been genuine Oral-B products.</li>
            <li> the product packaging was somewhat crushed when i got .....  however more than than i think the floss action brush head itself is not a that great product to be praised on.  its not so soft as i expected it to be and as advertised...plus its making the gaps between my teeth even more and more .....so overall i would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I like these tooth brush heads the best as my teeth feel cleaner then when using the other Oral B heads.</li>
            <li> This is a top quality product.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;floss\\&quot; in the brush is quite stiff; it doesn&#x27;t seem to help flossing much, but rather makes brushing less effective. Don&#x27;t like the idea of this product. Better keep flossing and brushing separate. Will buy the regular brush heads next time.</li>
            <li> This is the first type of power toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever tried, so I can&#x27;t really compare it with others.  And the reason I decided to purchase one is because my dentist keeps telling me that I&#x27;m brushing too hard and my gums are starting to recede.  I&#x27;ll see if he&#x27;ll notices any difference on my next visit. The things I like about it are: 1)the small brush makes it easy to reach way in the back area that&#x27;s hard to reach with a regular toothbrush; 2) I didn&#x27;t realize that I don&#x27;t have to use that much toothpaste as I did before; and 3) my teeth feels really clean!</li>
            <li> Fits and cleans my teeth much better than Braun Oral-B Extrasoft,   &lt;br /&gt;Flexisoft and Interspace Brushheads. Didn&#x27;t cause bleeding. Contra: incompatibility with SmartDisplay function of Triumph 9400. Interactive feedback display didn&#x27;t indicate when it was time to replace this brushhead even when it looked like it was overworn (blue bristles turned curly and almost completely white).</li>
            <li> This is probably the best electric toothbrush on the market. It cleans very well, allows the head unit to be used by more than one person, and times your brushing to 2 minutes for the most effective time without excessive abrasion. The wife likes more compact models, as this takes up more counter space than some of the others, but the others do not brush as well and others do not have replaceable brushes. This is a joy to use and you will spend less time with your dentist if you use this unit.</li>
            <li> These 3 brushes were original mfg&#x27;s product replacement and work perfectly with the power handle.  The price was the best I could find on the internet or in the stores.  Product was shipped on time and I received it when expected.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for now 5-6 weeks and must say this is the best brush head Oral-B ever made.    It brushes better then the normal circle head brushes that comes with most Oral-B eletric toothbrush. My teeth are also brighter.</li>
            <li> Been using for 2 yrs now excellent product</li>
            <li> Feels good, but I think the regular brushes kept my mouth cleaner.  And my old SoniCare was better yet (but now they are Chinese-breakables).</li>
            <li> I find these toothbrushes with the built-in floss action are far better than the ones without.  They are definitely worth the extra $$.</li>
            <li> I am unable to rate the product as it was not recieved.  Package contained Oral B Dual Clean 6 count.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know what the big deal is with these electrics. I just bought these refills for my oralB electric. I find that it really beats down on my teath and the brush seems very stiff and small. I cant really aim properly because of all the vibration and my gums get sore. i used it once or twice and just cant handle it.    I&#x27;ve always used a regular toothbrush and floss and i&#x27;m sticking to that. i have much more control. my hygenist actually asked me if i used an electric because she didnt see much tartar. i&#x27;m doing fine without the electric.</li>
            <li> If you like the Oral B floss action heads this is a good deal! Quick to ship and the same product you get in stores for twice the price!</li>
            <li> I have used the Oral B Vitality toothbrush for nearly five years. In the past I have only used the traditional small, round brush head. I saw these on Amazon and decided to pick them up. They clean very well, seemingly better than the smaller brush heads. They are, however, about 25% larger and the bristles are not as soft. Also, the &#x27;floss action&#x27; plastic tips around the perimeter don&#x27;t really seem to be flossing more than they are just contributing to the roughness of the overall brushing experience. Overall, I give them 3.5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After using these for a month now, I have to say that the bristles do become softer over time yet giving you a good cleaning. I give them 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and delivery at a very fair price. New, as advertised. Works great, teeth look whiter and feel super clean. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have used the Oral B Triumph toothbrush for about 3 years.  I love this toothbrush and I love the flossing action that I get from using it.  The brush heads, however, are hard to find and expensive.  I was very pleased to find them on amazon.......and, even better, at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This is my daily brush and really made a difference. Because of this, I decided to abandon traditional brushes.</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads are awesome! They are slightly larger than the ones I had before, so I imagine they have more brushing power. My mouth feels fresh and clean. :D</li>
            <li> I chose the flossing brush head to use with my rechargeable toothbrush because flossing is essential to dental health and it&#x27;s wise  to have extras on hand.  A pack of 3 is convenient and less costly than singles.</li>
            <li> the order was received promptly and I am very satisfied with the quality and the price</li>
            <li> The package came on time, in good shape and was reasonably priced. Have not had to used it yet.</li>
            <li> Very stiff hurts my gums  and I&#x27;m not pressing very hard</li>
            <li> GET THESE AND YOU WILL SEE AND FEEL WHY THESE ARE THE BEST BRUSH HEADS!!!!    I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM!!!!!!!!!!    JESUS LOVES YOU...JOHN 3:16</li>
            <li> The product came in good condition, it is what I ordered. I am however not to crazy about these toothbrush heads. After trying these I do prefer the small round heads to these ones. -my personal preference</li>
            <li> The Oral B brush head is the best \\&quot;floss action brushing\\&quot; tool on the market.  It is a bit \\&quot;pricy,\\&quot; but the extra cost is worth the benefit one gains by using this brush head.</li>
            <li> A bit too small, I prefer the Deep Sweep heads.</li>
            <li> Love Oral B, but these seem to be more of a gimmick than anything else and my dental hygienist agrees.  Even after using these heads, real flossing still picks up gunk left behind.  In fact because the flossing paddles take up so much space on the head they brush less efficiently than the regular Oral B round sensitive heads.  Don&#x27;t throw away your floss just yet.</li>
            <li> I bought these from Direct Super Center.  And when I received them the main packaging was open.  I opened the inner packaging to one brush and tried it.  It seemed ok, but after a week of normal usage, the head started vibrating, making a loud noise and also the head didn&#x27;t brush the same (very rough).  Also, the bristles are wearing very quickly.  My previous brushes (I have had a lot of them since I owned the toothbrush for many years) never had this problem, even if I used them beyond the recommended 3 months which Oral B recommends.      I am now going to contact Direct Super Center and Amazon about this issue, but I have a feeling that Direct Super Center won&#x27;t help, after reading other comments posted here.    I love this toothbrush and have had comments by my dentist about just how immaculate my teeth remain, so I will definitely be purchasing more brush heads.  But I will never purchase from Direct Super Center again, since they seem to sell fake items without revealing it in their advertisement.</li>
            <li> I have not used these brushes yet but have used the one that came with the toothbrush. My teeth are definately cleaner.</li>
            <li> After checking several stores and kinds of oral B brush head refills, I settled for this from Amazon. Never regretted my decision. It leaves my teeth really clean and my daughter claims that it makes her teeth much cleaner despite the braces.</li>
            <li> The price is good. I have a mechanic oral B toothbrush and these are perfect for it. I like the floss action since they are really CLEAN up my teeth. The shipping was on time and in good condition. I would buy this set again.</li>
            <li> Heads work great with the Oral B electric toothbrush but for regular use only. The floss action is not that great.</li>
            <li> This model of Oral B replacement brush heads makes my teeth feel exactly as if they were just cleaned by a hygienist.I have tried most of the replacements and these are the best.</li>
            <li> I like the pro white better. This one is just OK.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect.  This is the exact brush head that came with the original.  Also saved a lot of money by purchasing on line.</li>
            <li> They work as part of a good brushing system.</li>
            <li> This is in my opinion the best tip on these Oral B brushes. It is a little big for kids and medium to small size people but if you have a decent size mouth (LOL!) this brush tip is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I purchased Oral B Floss action 3 pack head refill thru Amazon, and was delighted with the care and delivery taken by them. This was my first time purchasing any product from any online Company. The brush heads are very good for cleaning your teeth, and, I have been using them over the past few years. Also cheaper to buy online than in our Canadian stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different heads including the Oral B Duel Clean; however, I find the Floss Action brush head really works best.  I can&#x27;t see using anything else at this time.</li>
            <li> Shipping - The order was delivered in expected time frame.    Product - I got a different package than expected, but the product inside looked the same. I have been using the brush for a few days and I have a doubt whether it is original. The quality of the brush head is not the same as the ones that came with the original brush.</li>
            <li> I had originally used the dual brush head that came with my Oral-B electric toothbrush and liked it very much. I had intended to order this same brush head, but the reviews on the Floss Action brush head refill intrigued me. I won&#x27;t have definitive results until I go back for my scheduled cleaning, but the size of the head is very compatible with my smaller-sized mouth. I like the thought that I might be getting a better cleaning between the teeth, which is an area of concern to my hygienist. Stay tuned!</li>
            <li> So, my fault for not noticing until I&#x27;d opened and actually started using one of these, but I received what looks to be the &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; heads instead of the floss action heads that are in the description. As I already started using one (hey, I need to brush my teeth!), I can&#x27;t return it, but caveat emptor--Amazon is shipping the wrong product.</li>
            <li> I bought these from Direct Super Center.  They are definitely counterfeit.  The first thing that I noticed is that the blue color is darker.  Then the coefficient of friction moving from one tooth to the next tooth is much higher.  Probably what happened is that the fake brush has cut bristles and the real thing has rounded bristles.  Finally, the most obvious tell is that you can easily scratch the logo off the counterfeit item with your fingernail but the real item has a completely glazed surface.  I have been buying these Floss Action brushes for about 3 years (since they first came out) and I replace them every month, so I&#x27;ve bought a lot of them.  I&#x27;ve bought many of them thru Amazon and I have never had a problem.  The problem only occurred when I used Direct Super Center which is offered thru Amazon.  I contacted DSC but never got a response.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find replacement heads anywhere locally.  After they came, i saw them in several stores.  What can I say?  They get my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Product was just what I was looking for at a fair price.  Arrived on time</li>
            <li> My teeth are so much cleaner and in much better shape since I started using these brush heads.  I don&#x27;t know how the brush does it but they are great and much better than the standard brush heads.</li>
            <li> replacements , cheaper on amazon with prime than in stores.. love the tooth brush too.. used several electric tooth brushes this one does best cleaning</li>
            <li> These are very effective toothbrush heads. the clean the tooth, gum, and produce flossing action between the teeth. The all-purpose heads are also excellent alternative to this one.</li>
            <li> I just bought the Oral B Professional Care Smart Series rechargeable toothbrush. The Floss Action head is a must have! I already notice the differnce along the gum lines. Nothing is left behind. My teeth have never been so clean! Great product!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. I have a good story to share. I went to Walmart and i bought Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill, after looking up the same product at amazon. I was amazed of  the difference. I decided to refund the product to walmart and i bought it from amazon instead. I was very happy when I got it. It was the same thing.</li>
            <li> great electronic toothbrush, will never go back</li>
            <li> The product was shipped fast, it was brand new, and worth the money. Floss the ish out of that pizza fo dinner. I like this product.</li>
            <li> I first used this brush head when it arrived with my newly purchased Oral B electric tooth brush.  I think it cleans more thoroughly than any product I previously used and would not hesitate to purchase it again.  I truly appreciated the free shipping.</li>
            <li> I have used these floss action brush heads for many years now. They are something that I happen to know very well. The product that I received came in a packaging that while different from what I am used to, still had the OralB logo, that I was familiar with. I figured that maybe there was just a difference in packaging for online markets. Well I guess that I should have questioned things more because I am convinced that I could not have received authentic OralB Floss Action brush heads. The brush heads I got all broke very soon after beginning to use them. I usually get about three months from each brush head as is indicated on the packaging for the heads. With these here, the brush heads all started coming loose easily move back and forth after only a few weeks. This made the brush head much noisier and also caused it to pinch my lip form time to time while brushing. That was not enjoyable! I would say that these brush heads were either some kind of knock-off, or maybe someone found a way to sell the brush heads that were rejected in production. I guess that the lower than usual price for them should have been the first thing to question. I won&#x27;&#x27;t make the same mistake again.</li>
            <li> I was just reading through tons of 1 star reviews on these because many, many people have received fakes. I purchased mine DIRECTLY from Amazon (not a third party seller) and mine are absolutely the real deal. They work great and I got a 3 pack for under $19.00. I recommend ONLY purchasing these from Amazon as there is no guarantee you will receive authentic brush heads from anyone else.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement.  Quick shipping.  Comparable price!</li>
            <li> I have used several different kinds of electronic tooth brushes. This particular brush head is the best I have ever used for getting my teeth and gums really clean. It does take some getting used to. It is noisier than other brush heads and there is a lot going on in your mouth when you use it. You can actually feel the rubber tips going under your gums to remove plaque as you use it. I am amazed at how well it works!</li>
            <li> These work great. Each brush head is individually wrapped and contains its own color ring for those who share brush heads.</li>
            <li> The Oral B Floss Action brush is not the greatest. The price is Ok and they look like the original as the seller mentioned.  However, during the first week of use one of my kids brush head starts to wobble so withing the next week he was not able to use it. So we told him to use a new one and now the brush hair are falling out. I hope they last long until the next time we need replacement. So 2 out of 6 brushes defected is not bad, but regular. The other 4 are working fine.  Original is the best but if the budget is tight this will be the best choice.</li>
            <li> These Floss Action heads are the perfect replacements for my [[ASIN:B003UKM90Q Oral-B Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush, Blue and White]].  The flossy bits are very effective, but pretty harsh.  My dentist is critical of the harsh action on the gums, but my hygienist likes my results, so decide for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT (10/6):  I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for over a year now and have had very good checkups at the dentist.  I&#x27;m very pleased.  HOWEVER...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve discovered that the floss action heads don&#x27;t travel well.  I&#x27;ve damaged quite a few of these heads whenever I travel.  The rotating head comes loose and doesn&#x27;t work well after that.  The flossy bits don&#x27;t function well once the head is loose.  And even worse, the wobbly head becomes kind of dangerous: it can pinch your lips pretty badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a different toothbrush for travel now.</li>
            <li> I think this is the most effective of the brush heads offered by Oral B that fit my unit.  As proof even my dental checkups have been better.  Good value compared to a retail store price.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this floss action brush head. It&#x27;s been really effective in removing particles from between teeth. Great compliment to manual flossing.</li>
            <li> Purchased based off dentist&#x27;s recommendation..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great toothbrush; teeth definitely feel cleaner afterwards compared to regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Timer setting is very useful; great feature for kids to ensure proper cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is the cost of the replacement heads. Expensive... Usually replace every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer may want to research and consider this prior to purchase.</li>
            <li> Hmm.. what can I say! these refill design is awesome! I dont know if the little 4 yellow rubber \\&quot;thingi\\&quot; really work as a floss, or if they really clean better.  But, mouth feels great after brushing. It may be because its my first electric toothbrush and I pay more attention to my brushing. But I think the results are much more than what I may get by just paying more attention.    I would suggest 3 types of brush heads (use different everyday for a change.. ;) haha)    1st - Floss Action, 2nd - Dual Clean and 3rd - ProWhite.</li>
            <li> I exclusively used these heads for a year, though my dentist was happy with the cleanliness of my teeth, he noticed much faster gum loss.  So now I have gone back to the softer heads without the floss action.</li>
            <li> So, Amazon offers the bets pricing available and send the product right to your doorstep. Why not? I love online shopping, they make my life so much easier. these brush heads came in perfect condition and fit the handle perfectly. no compalints</li>
            <li> I noticed that some customers complained about the quality of this brush, however, I have been using it for more than 2 weeks and it is just perfect. It feels a little larger than the regular Oral B brush but I do not mind as it does a wonderful job on flossing. I feel my teeth so smooth and polished after brushing. Of course I will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product, the brush head features these stupid rubber spikes that are supposed to provide a \\&quot;flossing action\\&quot;. Truth: they make brushing your teeth a painful endeavor! It is better to use dental floss because it works 100x more effectively and does not hurt!</li>
            <li> No compatibility issues, this fits perfectly with my toothbrush and word great.  I did not experience the issues other reviewers posted about fake or imitation products.  They say Oral-B on them and come in an Oral-B package.  As far as I am concerned, these are the same quality and standards as the one that comes with the original toothbrush.  No reason to be worried or concerned about quality or authenticity.</li>
            <li> As adevrtised.  They have held up like the ones I have bought before.  No need to go to store. the end.</li>
            <li> These are just fine for the first couple of weeks. After that the heads become loose and wobbly. Feels like they are about to fall off in your mouth so you are forced to replace it with the next head, which will undoubtedly also fail you shortly. The price is good but they are poorly made. I would not recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome perfect fit as expected.</li>
            <li> After testing out the regular brush heads and these Floss Action heads, I think it just comes down to personal preference. Ignore the \\&quot;floss\\&quot; part - that&#x27;s just marketing hype and you better still use a real dental floss. Yes, the Floss Action heads are a bit bigger, but I think that suits me fine, and you&#x27;ll probably be down with it too unless you&#x27;ve got really small teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is the question you should ask yourself: Do you usually prefer soft/medium bristle toothbrushes, or do you tend to seek out the firms? I&#x27;m a firm guy, thus I prefer the Floss Action heads. The yellow rubber bits gives these heads a hardness that I love and I feel like it cleans my teeth better. I also feel like these heads last longer. If you&#x27;re a softie, stick with the regular heads.</li>
            <li> Work great but need to change more often than 3 months.</li>
            <li> Product was as promised.</li>
            <li> Super quality.  Our teeth are cleaner and in much better health.</li>
            <li> These go great with the Oral B toothbrush. They make your teeth feel almost as clean as if you&#x27;ve just come from the dentist.</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM WAS COUNTERFEIT. A FAKE PRODUCT. COMPARISON WITH A GENUINE ORAL B FLOSS ACTION BRUSH HEAD OBTAINED DIRECTLY FROM ORAL B REVEALED THIS IMMEDIATELY.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. I just wish they were cheaper.</li>
            <li> This product was as described and I have been very pleased with it&#x27;s performance. I would certainly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly simple, you want a brush head that gets any type of build up eradicated and that is what Oral-B puts forth.  I ordered the heads ironically around the same time that the one that came with the unit I purchased had worn out.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> you can feel the difference between this type of head and others. i need to see how long it is going to last.</li>
            <li> Although price is clearly cheaper than other places, your brush will break after 3 uses. Either the brush head will fall or your brush will fall apart. DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive gums, do not buy these.  But for the rest of us they work great.  More massage action and it gets between teeth better than the standard Oral B brush.    Warning: There are a lot of counterfeit brushes being sold on the internet.  These were purchased through Amazon as recommended by the Oral B website so I felt the odds were in my favor.  They are real.  I suggest looking for a sales partner on Oral B website.</li>
            <li> Its an awesome feeling, it really get down deep to the gums, I don&#x27;t know yet if it replaces flossing but its the best tooth brush attachment.</li>
            <li> I love these brush heads they make your teeth and gums feel clean, plus stimulates the gums.</li>
            <li> Good product as I want, but the USPS shipped the item that you never belive, 10 days from the shipping day... My God..what kind of service in our own land.</li>
            <li> Package arrived quickly and secure.  It&#x27;s recommended to change out brush heads every three months so this pack will keep you fulfilled for some time.</li>
            <li> The price of toothbrushes for oral B is out of sight,I was glad to see that amazon.com offers them at a lower price. They work well, and I love the oral B toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I thought each Oral B brush head was supposed to last 3 months.  After about a month, the screws fell out of 2 of the brush heads leaving them useless.  I&#x27;m on the last brush head and was not expecting to have to replenish my supply this early.  Rather disappointed.</li>
            <li> This instrument in extremely effective in removing particles, flossing the teeth very effectively. Plaque seems to lessen with use although I am quick in its application.</li>
            <li> These are great \\&quot;Oral B\\&quot; brushes. I like the softer bristles which are easier on my gums and teeth. I reccomend these to others who need more gentle brushes.</li>
            <li> Well, your rechargeable toothbrush is only as good as it&#x27;s brush head, right? You can find brush heads that fit Oral-B&#x27;s fantastic line of electric toothbrushes cheaper on this website. But these are Oral-B toothbrushes. They are quality. There&#x27;s a thriving market of off-brand, fakes, and knockoff brush heads for these products. I suggest that you buy these instead, as they&#x27;re the real-deal, Oral-B/Braun produced brush heads that will fit your toothbrush, do what they&#x27;re supposed to do, and won&#x27;t fall apart on you. Keep in mind that you should replace your brush head at least once every three months. And also, it&#x27;s healthier if you use more than one brush head every single day, so they have time to dry out after use. Fewer bacteria grow on your bush if the bristles have time to dry out between uses.</li>
            <li> Great brushes. They do their job and are very strong. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> The best brush I&#x27;ve ever tried. It does do a great brushing and floss at the same time.</li>
            <li> floss action is a great brush head.  I am not talented/coordinated enough to use floss and this head does a great job getting at bits of food, etc, that might be between my teeth.  I use this head at night and the Pro-White in the morning.    My only wish is that Amazon would allow for a less frequent auto purchase.  With 3 heads in a pack and the change the head with the change of season guidelines, I end up with too many surplus heads.  Its actually worse than that because i only use each head type once per day.  So, based on usage, I should only have to replace the head 2 times a year. Might have to sell them...</li>
            <li> After years of using a vitality oralB brush with traditional soft round heads, I was unable to find those in the store and bought these floss action heads.  After a few months of use I noticed that I could no longer remove red wine stains from my teeth, which had never been a problem before.  I even stopped drinking red wine and tried everything to get the stains off that had become semi permanent but nothing worked except a professional cleaning, which then lasted only a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although initially skeptical, after cleaning my teeth again today, my hygienist agreed that my teeth have recently become roughened on the surface in a way they never were for all the past years she has cleaned them.  This occurrence was precisely during the period when I used these new floss action brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently the little plastic whips built into these brush heads actually change the experience from a soft brushing experience to a hard one, and in my case seem to have done permanent damage.  Hence I would caution others to be very careful about using these - indeed  I would warn the average person to completely stay away from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update april 2014: With the chemical damage to my teeth from acids in the mouth apparently accelerated by the loss of enamel, today my dentist showed me current photographs of my teeth compared to 4 years ago, before using these floss action bristles. The damage is so extreme she asked if she could use them as a case study for other dentists.  The only thing comparable she has seen is in children born with a defect preventing formation of enamel.  The only adequate remedy now is extensive, and very expensive, cosmetic dentistry.  If you are using these, at a minimum I advise having your dentist monitor your tooth enamel.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months now and find its&#x27; use very utilitarian and enjoyable.  Makes teeth cleaning more enjoyable and less of a chore.  My teeth and gums feel very invigorated after each use.  I have decided upon the flossing heads because they seem to do an admirable job cleaning with the added bonus of flossing at the same time.  I also take my unit with me whenever I travel.  Great product and I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> My advice is to stay far away from this product. This type of brush head has little plastic paddles which were very hard on my gums.  I used this type brush head for several months.  I think it caused some gum recession.  I asked my dentist about this type brush head and he was very critical of the design.</li>
            <li> Oral B Floss Action heads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the regular Oral B precision brushes for well over a decade. I gave the Floss Action heads a try using the Oral B Vitality motor unit and thought the Floss Action heads weren&#x27;t very good. About a year later, I put the same Floss Action head on an Oral B Smart Series 5000 and it was totally different. I&#x27;d definitely buy the Floss Action heads in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Floss Action heads are similar to the standard Precision heads, but have 4 extra rubber paddles for \\&quot;flossing action\\&quot;  or removing some stains. With the Vitality brush, the RPMs weren&#x27;t fast enough or the oscillating action was slightly off causing the Floss Action heads to hurt my gums a little. They acted more like bumpers than anything else. With the Oral B 5000, the RPM seemed faster and smoother, and the Floss Action heads felt the same as the Precision heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally floss before brushing, so I cannot comment on whether the Floss Action heads can replace the act of flossing. I still recommend following your hygienist&#x27;s recommendations, which is usually to floss before brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well at cleaning my teeth, and it is compatible with most Oral B brush motors. However, I recommend you buy an updated unit and not try to use the Floss Action on a Vitality, low-end model, or something made a decade ago. The 4 extra paddles don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re doing anything, but I can see them oscillating on my teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 4/5 stars</li>
            <li> The cheaper store-brand replacement heads just don&#x27;t work as well as the reliable Oral-B heads. The other ones wear out immediately and also don&#x27;t fit the appliance well, so they pinched my lip as I brushed. Good price on these Oral-B heads from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I subscribed this item, and received a %15 off discount. They raised the price after a few shipments. I just found out today, and i will no longer trust Amazon.com</li>
            <li> These are NOT Braun replacements. They do not have molded/stamped numbers inside the rear oval window on the rear of the brush head. These fakes are made with a plastic that wears out from the friction, and the brush head loosens up to a point where it starts to become useless after about 60 brushing cycles. The \\&quot;indicator\\&quot; bristles will never change color, because they aren&#x27;t really indicator bristles... and because the head will start to fall apart after 3-4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REAL ORAL B REPLACEMENTS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a number stamped or molded inside the oval window on the rear of the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;Come with TWO color rings (not one)&lt;br /&gt;Last for several months, and the bristles change color LONG BEFORE the head loosens up from wear.</li>
            <li> I started using the standard Oral-B toothbrushes and even found that other manufacturers made toothbrushes that would fit at a cheaper price. Then I tried these floss-action Oral-B toothbrushes. They do a dramatically better job of brushing between teeth and up along the gum line. My teeth are whiter and my gums healthier with these brushes. I know, I sound like a commercial. But the proof is in the pudding, as they say. Try them yourself. They are worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> These are very harsh on teeth and gums. I thought the bristles would soften up after a week or two but they did not. The yellow flossing pieces are hard plastic and just beat on your teeth. I ended up tossing the one I was using in the trash and bought something else. Maybe the leftover two can be used for cleaning grout or something.</li>
            <li> I have heard some negative reviews, but I am enjoying these brushes. They were to replace the ones that came with the system, and I think they are a big improvement over the standard brush.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve bought these type of brush heads many times and they are great. but we have never bought them from this dealer and never will again. they are terrible!!! first of all, they do not fit right...they are loose not only where the head attaches to the brush, but the brushhead itself is also very loose, and all 3 of them eventually lost the little screws in them and they fell off in our mouths while we were brushing. I will NEVER buy these from amazon again...when I tried to contact the seller, I got an email back saying they are just the distributer and can&#x27;t do anything about it.  stay away!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my Oral B Floss Action 3. It cleans my teeth well and I get compriments from my dentist.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described. Very good. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I believe so highly in this toothbrush that when I couldn&#x27;t find one to purchase without having to buy 2 or more regular brushes with it, I took the advice of a store clerk to check the internet.  I was delighted to find the offer of 3 Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills for a very resonable price.  I made my very first internet purchase, when I ordered them and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> No difference from the original heads that came with the brush.  I didn&#x27;t have any issues with any of them either.</li>
            <li> These are the best I have ever used. Shopping for it on this website was awesome. The best price I have ever gotten it at and it was delivered quickly. Mahalo</li>
            <li> Works well and feels like I just got back from dentist after brushing. This does not replace flossing if thats what you&#x27;re looking for but the rubber bristles are great for massaging your gums and improving circulation. Healthy gums &#x3D; healthy teeth</li>
            <li> This is exactly the product I ordered.  Still, it took three shipments to receive the correct product. There were several models but only one fit my unit. My patience was sligtly stressed because I thougt that I woild have to purchase a new tooth brush to get a somplete unit.  Thanks</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves if they were genuine are great, I have used them for three years.    The brushes that I ordered from Direct Super Center were counterfeit.  When the first brush head broke after two weeks of use I became suspicious.  Looked up some complaints on the internet and found that these brushes are indeed counterfeit.  Here are the differences:  The Oral-B logo on the brush is gray not blue.   A serial number is nowhere to be found.   The bristle colors are darker than they should be.   The metal piece in the hole is squared off instead of rounded off.    Instead of dealing with the seller I sent the brushes off to P&amp;G.  P&amp;G reimbursed me by sending me a coupon for some authentic brush heads.    Lesson here is to be careful when ordering these brush heads from online retailers.  This item in particular should maybe be ordered directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li> At first i could not figure out why this didn&#x27;t fit properly and kept falling off, immediately i noticed that they looked cheaper than the ones that came with my professional care 4000 but i just could not believe they were not genuine since im buying from what i consider to be a very reputable seller (Amazon), After doing research i realized Amazon sent me a fake product, the item i received does not have a serial number in the back, look at this pictures in this listing to see what i mean, i will notify amazon and i am sure they will help like always, i will still love Amazon as long as they fix their mistakes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy Oral-B brush heads from Amazon. I bought direct, not through a 3rd party seller, and I received a fake product both for this head, and for the pro white as well. The fakes are also getting very hard to spot apparently, because none of the \\&quot;real vs fake\\&quot; pictures given on the product page were helpful in spotting the fake in my case. The bristles were similar, as was the packaging. There was a serial number on the back, and the metal piece inside the head was not square.   The subtle difference was in the gray Oral-B logo. I took the fake to CVS and compared to the originals. The fake had a smaller gray oval, more fuzzy lettering, and the gray was slightly lighter in shade. All of my brush heads are fuzzy and shaded incorrectly, whereas all the ones in CVS are printed crisply. I have a keen eye for small differences, and most people will be fooled by this. The only way to be sure (I hope) is to buy from a brick and mortar store, i.e Walgreens, CVS...etc. DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON, even direct. You use it in a very sensitive area of your body, and it&#x27;s not worth the risk of injury even if the knock-off is similar in quality.</li>
            <li> Good replacement brushes.  As always, too expensive, but they do the job.  I bought some off-brand ones at a wholesale store, and they literally fell apart after about a month......so Oral-B is probably the only way to go</li>
            <li> If you own the Triumph Toothbrush -- you can&#x27;t beat this price for the refills.    I looked around on line, and even in the stores during sales...this price (including shipping) still beat them all.</li>
            <li> I saw that these were \\&quot;by OralB\\&quot; and usually Amazon is reputable. These aren&#x27;t the real OralB brush heads, they fall apart, the bristles are poor quality, and so on. I&#x27;m not sure whether to return to Amazon or to call OralB.    Not pleased at all.</li>
            <li> very effective at cleaning and removing plaque when used with a high end electric brush.</li>
            <li> In my opinion these are not authentic Oral-B toothbrushs. I have been using Oral B powerbrush for probably 7 years now and I have never had these problems with the brushes.  These that I purchased through Amazon/Trend Marketing slide off the powerhead unit while brushing your teeth.  The bristles felt much harder then any brand new true Oral-B heads I have ever purchased.  After about 3 weeks of use one of the brushes fell apart in my wife&#x27;s mouth...something a real Oral-B manufactured brushhead would never do.</li>
            <li> Amazon offered these at a great price, only concern was that they were fake, got it in today and confirmed they were real, good luck to everyone else!</li>
            <li> I used to use the soft oral B brushes. I tried the floss brush and happily noticed that after my dental cleaning the usual staining of my teeth that happens over time never happened. Those little rubber paddles must be removing the stains before they start! Fantastic!    For me, this is a very powerful whitening brush.    Caveat: You must still floss. No brush replaces flossing.</li>
            <li> Only original oral B  brush heads works for me&lt;br /&gt;These Are the best !</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for cleaning your teeth, although I like the dual head ones better. But still, very good toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Have purchased this before, love the quality and the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months, and they are too big and hurt.  I would never buy this again.  I wonder if anyone would like this kind?  I would rather get the one that came with it</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this item and I am very happy with the product, price and service.</li>
            <li> After reading about all the fake versions of these heads, we almost didn&#x27;t order them. Glad we did, though. With the subscription discounts and coupons, it was around half as expensive as the local store - well worth the risk. Thankfully, the heads we got weren&#x27;t fake - they had the serial numbers, two colored rings and no color bleeding. I&#x27;m not sure if the fakes are off the market or not, but if you&#x27;re on the fence just order, then give Amazon a call if the ones you get aren&#x27;t genuine...</li>
            <li> My purchase was from a 3rd party but it was direct from Amazon&#x27;s inventory. Seeing other 1 star reviews though it would appear that Amazon buys fakes from the same supplier as well. The plastic in these brush heads is breaking and they do not sit right on the brush handle, also the bristles are harder and of a different make than genuine heads, these things are already bothering my gums and have the potential of causing serious dental damage, this is a real shame Amazon...</li>
            <li> I purchased an Oral B Floss action3 pack brush head refill pack and one of the heads did not rotate and could not be used.  I believe it was a manufacturing problem. I have been using Oral B for several years and never had a head not work before.</li>
            <li> I have tried several of the bursh heads: Pro White, Precision Clean, Sensitive Gum Care, Dual Clean., but this is my favorite. These in my opinion cleans the best and i don&#x27;t have to floss as often.</li>
            <li> It works.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s doing a good job.  It SOUNDS like a very early dirigible motor.  You can&#x27;t have everything, I guess.</li>
            <li> Best price on replacement heads! These are my favorite heads for my toothbrush.  No need running around to different stores looking, just order them right on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure these are great for some people. For the rest of us with sensitive gums, don&#x27;t buy them! I thought I didn&#x27;t have sensitive gums....so I didn&#x27;t heed the warning, so I bought them and after using them for a couple of days, I had to stop. Just buy the precision ones.</li>
            <li> Pro: The boothbrushs work great with my RIUMPH Pro Care 9000. &lt;br /&gt;Con: Expensive.</li>
            <li> Be very careful, these are much harder on your gums, would not recommend, does not go between teeth.</li>
            <li> You put &#x27;em in your mouth and you brush your teeth. Nuff said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these. After I tried the ones I bought here, i can tell immediately these are FAKE - really poor quality.</li>
            <li> I checked and these appear to be the genuine Oral B. There may be some misleading information in the pictures. They show \\&quot;Oral B\\&quot; in Blue as the genuine ones, but mine that came with the brush have the gray \\&quot;Oral B\\&quot;. These replacements also have the gray, but pass the genuine test.    The problem is that this first of the 3-pack falls off the spindle during brushing. It doesn&#x27;t fit tight enough. I inspected the original and this new one and they are alike, so there must be a product quality control problem, as the new one falls off quite easily. It doesn&#x27;t click like the original one.</li>
            <li> I tried a no-name version that was unacceptable on numerous levels.  In this case, the brand name is worth the 3X price.</li>
            <li> I think its floss action is an add to regular brushing but it definitely doesn&#x27;t replace flossing.</li>
            <li> this brush is more superior than the other models of brush especially when it is used on the latest Oral Triumph electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> I had used the Oral B toothbrush for a long time and was very satisfied.  Then I lost my charger and it was cheaper to buy a new toothbrush than replace the charger. When I was purchasing the new toothbrush I also saw Oral B Floss Action 3 pack refills which I also purchased.  The price was good and they appeared to be better than the regular brushhead, which I&#x27;ve always been satisfied with.  I love these brush heads.  They&#x27;re great and really clean well. They&#x27;re much better than the regular brush head, which I was always satisfied with. My teeth feel clean for hours.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by just saying WOW. Before I tried the Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count), I thought I had clean teeth. Clearly, I was wrong. I have been using the Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count) for about a month now and the difference is unbelievable! It&#x27;s like instead of taking a quick dip in a community swimming pool, my teeth are being treated to a luxury bath with bubbles and a massage, EVERY DAY! Sometimes even twice a day. If the effects of the Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count) stopped there, I would be merely satisfied, but as you may pick up from my tone and use of exclamation points, I am ecstatic! I used to go on dates with the confidence of a nerdy insecure loser; picture Woody Allen, but with bigger glasses. Now I have the confidence to take on anything! It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m Rambo but not a psychopath and with the cleanest teeth EVER. But wait, there&#x27;s more. The other day I was driving down the street and I got pulled over by a cop for speeding. He got out of his car, came up to my window, and asked me for my license and registration. As I gave it to him, I looked up and flashed him one of those Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count) clean smiles. It just so happened that he was a user too. He instantly realized, gave me a nod and a wink, and ripped up my ticket. Thanks, Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Seems good.  My mouth will feel numb around the teeth when I wake up no matter how little pressure I use to brush.</li>
            <li> Recently had a substantial amount of periodontal dental work completed and added these to my modified home care regimen.  Implants are the STANDARD OF CARE but not covered by insurance.  As they say....an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure!  It seems that there is a &amp;#34;black market&amp;#34; for these so pay attention!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had ours for over ten years now and it still works great. The only problem is that the brush heads keep going up and up. The last time I purchased some they were $13.47 for the three pack, and I bought a bunch of them. If they go up anymore, we&#x27;re going to have to find some another alternitive instead after we run out of brush heads. which will be very soon. Like going back to using a regular toothbrush instead of these or something else! It&#x27;s just not worth paying over $6 a brush head anymore for them. They don&#x27;t work that well! I would try and find something less expensive that works just as well or better no matter if it&#x27;s a manual or electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This product cleans. Using it with the Oral B Triumph brush unit get a dentist clean feel every time. First electric I really liked.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a problem with counterfeit ones like other people on here, these worked perfectly fine! I will be repurchasing again soon.</li>
            <li> Really not much to say.  There are three options and my dentist suggested going with this one since it gives some benefits to preventing gum disease.  I&#x27;ve been using the Triumph system for about 3 months now and during my dentist visit he said my gums are notably tighter then before.      I can&#x27;t brush at 1000 rpm, so why not let a machine do it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush for the last 10+ years. Usually, I buy the regular, round Flexisoft brush heads. The last time I tried to purchase them, however, the store was out of stock. But they did have these, and at a significantly lower price compared to the Flexisofts, so I decided to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work well. They deliver that nice, absolutely clean feeling that we all love and expect from our Oral-B&#x27;s. In this regard, they are at least the equivalent of the Flexisofts, and they may even be slightly superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun embeds 4 little rubber \\&quot;paddles\\&quot; into the brush head to, according to them, get between the teeth giving the same benefit as Dental Floss. I can not detect any \\&quot;flossing\\&quot; from the brush, but that would be difficult to assess. It may be that the \\&quot;paddles\\&quot; do get between teeth more effectively than the regular bristles, but only your dentist would be able to tell. They cause no discomfort. The brushing feels slightly different, but not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chief drawback, as far as I am concerned, is that the brush head has been enlarged to accommodate the flossers. Rather than being circular, like the regular heads, it is an oval. The width is the same, but the height is about half again as large. I think that one of the Oral-B&#x27;s great strengths is that the small heads can be maneuvered in such a way that you can clean every surface of every tooth. That is slightly (but only slightly) compromised here because of the larger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I need to replace these, I will look for the regular Oral-B Flexisoft replacement heads. In my opinion, those are the best. But if I can&#x27;t find them, I would not hesitate to buy these again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE 2/2011: It amazes me, but there appears to be a *thriving* market in counterfeit Oral-B Brush Heads! I purchase them only when they come directly from Amazon. Under the price, where it says \\&quot;Sold By\\&quot; make sure that it says \\&quot;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com.\\&quot; If it doesn&#x27;t, look over on the right side of the page where it says, \\&quot;More Buying Choices,\\&quot; and see if you can find one that says Amazon. Some of the Third Party Vendors are quite good, but I don&#x27;t think they are carefully monitored so, when in doubt, stick with Mother Amazon.on the right side of the page where it says, \\&quot;More Buying Choices,\\&quot; and see if you can find one that says Amazon.

            <li> Product was as expected and the convenience of purchasing on line helps a great deal.  Everything handled professionally.    Clayton Bartlett</li>
            <li> These are good replacement brushs for the Oran-B.  I like the way that they go around each tooth to get a nice clean brushing.</li>
            <li> I have been using these heads for about a year now and I have to say they dont brush as well as the normal brush heads, I recently switched to the Original Precision brush heads and I get mush better results. I feel the Floss action is a waste of money, just a way to get a little more out your pocket to brush less.</li>
            <li> The packaging for this product was very questionable, making me question if this is a real Oral-B product or some knock off.  For the price I paid, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this was some type of knock off.  This product seems flimsy, but has lasted longer than the other brushheads I have purchased, so I would consider buying again so long as the price is right.</li>
            <li> These work well - I&#x27;ve previously used the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; heads but these ones are good.  Can feel a little bit of the floss action - not sure how much it&#x27;s actually doing but can feel some action there.  Generally work fine - if they&#x27;re the same price as the regular heads I&#x27;d probably choose these.</li>
            <li> The work great with my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Not sure if these are counterfeit. After one weeks use the bristles are sticking out and irritating . I have never had this issue after years of using.</li>
            <li> Great product for everyone. After use this brush my teeth is so clean during whole day even after lunch!</li>
            <li> I am 30 yrs old and got my best checkup ever from my dentist after using these for 6 months.</li>
            <li> Refills fit perfectly and work well. No issues with shipping.  Good product and great price.</li>
            <li> I bought this 3-pack from DAB Nutrition (a.k.a. Direct Super Center or Potential Dynamix LLC), but they sold me knock-offs.  I had read about third party seller selling fake brush head refills, but since the price wasn&#x27;t ridiculously low, I thought that they had to be genuine oral-B brush heads.  However, as soon as I looked at the brushes through the clear package, I could tell that the brushes are knock-offs.  I had recently bought the same exact 3-pack from a store, so I compared the ones I got to the genuine oral-B refills, and noticed the following: the bristles are not really standing straight up like the real ones, the center bristles are of different color, and even the \\&quot;oral-B\\&quot; trademark on the brushes are of different color (the trademark should be blue, but the one on the fake brushes are gray) and small than the real ones.  the packaging looks almost the same (the fake package even says the brushes were \\&quot;made in Germany\\&quot;), but there are subtle differences: the font on the back of the package is much thicker than that on the real one, the \\&quot;2\\&quot; attached to the 2nd picture on the back of the package is lacking the shadow, and the pictures are fuzzy. I can&#x27;t believe that amazon.com would allow a seller to sell knock-offs. I&#x27;m highly disappointed with amazon&#x27;s quality control for third party sellers.</li>
            <li> What a great deal! The exact three pack at the local Walgreens is over $14.00 more.  I had not opened the pack I purchased at Walgreens so I returned it for a refund,  ordered one from Amazon, and then signed up for the automatic quarterly order refill  prograam at Amazon My wife and I each haave our own Oral Bs..</li>
            <li> I prefer this over the standard head because of the floss action addition. The product lasts long and it has a clear indicator of when to choose the new brush head. Great price too!</li>
            <li> in the ad it appeared that these would fit my Oral B Pulsonic &gt;not true, so I bought these for nothing&gt;paying shipping to get them back etc....too much hassle.Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Look the photo above. Now peer into the package you&#x27;ve just received. Now look back. Your bristles can look like that: pert, svelt, compact, in distinct bundles. Get the genuine item.    Looks aren&#x27;t the only concern. The genuine item is great: bristles aren&#x27;t harsh, even on very first use. They do a great job, even longer than you&#x27;d expect (and even after the indicator bristles go light). The heads fit snugly, and the indicator rings (at the bottom) snap in tight. The brush heads do a great job on the teeth and gums ... really much better than the OralB they replaced in getting the plaque off the lower teeth.     The counterfeit items, such as we received from NAB Nutrition, are none of these things. Most importantly, they are a health hazard: the bristles are not molded with rounded tips, but are coarsely square cut ... leaving hundreds of knife edges to abrade and cut your gums. NAB was prompt in sending a prepaid return label; Amazon was prompt in arranging the refund ... just make sure you look closely before you put it into your mouth! Really, the photos (here, on the package) tell you what you should be getting. Also at: [...].</li>
            <li> i got these to replace normal brush head on my oral-b electric toothbrush.  i actually got them because they were less expensive than the regular replacement heads at the time.  plus they had pretty good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the different bristles on there that do the &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; feel odd at first but it was easy to get used to.  i think if i tried going back to the normal brushes, my teeth wouldnt &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; as clean.  these do NOT take the place of flossing, but they do seem to clean a little better between my teeth.  last appointment at the dentist i was told there just wasnt any real work for the hygenist to do, my teeth were very clean.  considering previous appointments had always included a bit of scraping off plaque, i would say these brushes have made a big difference, for me anyway. i would recommend them.</li>
            <li> Worked exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Electric toothbrushes seem to improve each time a newer model hits the market.  So too, do the replacement heads, and this version is the best yet.  Durability is the most important quality, and these hold up well.  Try &#x27;em, you&#x27;ll buy &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> The advertised \\&quot;floss action\\&quot; comes at the expense of somewhat rough treatment.  I subsequently purchased the Oral B Sensitive brush heads and found them to be much more comfortable.  05-17-2014: I have continued to purchase the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brush heads in a 3-pack on a subscription basis and am quite pleased with that product and with the subscription service.</li>
            <li> i started purchasing this product and now it comes malfunction-ally built because the recently bought brush heads don&#x27;t operate as they were the first time</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from Amazon this week.  From what I can tell by inspecting them they appear to be genuine - there is no dye bleed, they have two rings, serial numbers are there, etc.  (I appreciate all the pictures that have been added to show the differences between the real ones and the frauds!)</li>
            <li> The price (with coupon and subscription) is just a fraction what you would pay at retail store and the product is authentic, NOT Fake (at least the one I got). So Im very satisfied. As for the product, I been using Oral-B electric tooth brush for 5 years now, and very happy with it.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite style and they make my teeth feel extra clean.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The 3 pack brush heads are another attachment for the great Oral B toothbrush which does such as great job on our teeth.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using the Oral B Floss Action heads on my Oral B I&#x27;ve had for about 4 years now (still going strong!), and overall, I&#x27;ll say I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the bristles are stiff, much stiffer than even the regular replacement heads. This may be a deal breaker for some, since stiff brushes have many negatives. While they seem to get your teeth cleaner, and quicker, they can damage gums, possibly enamel, so many dentists do not recommend stiff bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second thing to note, this shouldn&#x27;t be a flossing replacement. You&#x27;d think it&#x27;d go without saying, but no, no product really has proven itself to leave flossing completely unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, these are big, much bigger than the normal Oral B heads, and small teeth/mouths may not find these as functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, with that, you&#x27;d think these are the worst brushes in the world, right? Well, maybe not. For starters, with any of the Oral B automatic toothbrushes, you let the brush do the work, so you really shouldn&#x27;t press this hard against your teeth like a normal toothbrush. I don&#x27;t know if this completely eliminates any possible damage, but so far my gums/teeth feel fine, not beaten up, and doesn&#x27;t feel radically different from using a medium bristle brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These also do seem to do a better job of getting between your teeth clean, and in general getting the majority of your teeth clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, these heads seem to fit my teeth perfect, but I should note, I have a large mouth and large teeth. As such, they seem to do an excellent job for me, but I could see how they&#x27;d be less beneficial for smaller teeth/mouths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I got 3 of these heads pretty cheap, and they were a pretty good deal, but they may not be for everyone.</li>
            <li> The brush looks nothing like the brush I got with my Professional Care 5000 series toothbrush or the brush heads I have purchased at Bed Bath and Beyond. They also are already frayed.[[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]]</li>
            <li> I have gone through all three of the refills in four months.  The mechanical rotary action wears out long before the bristles show any significant color change from blue to white.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used Braun for years and have purchased most of our products from Amazon with no bad or faulty products.  That being said, this product was very defective.  It first was a bit wobbly when in use, but actually thought that was to give it a more cleaning area.  Well, a few days ago,it first pinched the inside of my cheek,then the whole head fell apart in my mouth.  There are small metal rods that are inside which became loose in my mouth, plus the plastic head fell off the arm...all in my mouth.  Luckily, I didn&#x27;t swallow any of the parts, but would have been bad IF I had.  I currently have them and am not returning them to Amazon, but am contacting Braun directly.  Be careful yourself and watch your children closely if they are using them.  Will continue to use Braun, but maybe they need closer quality monitoring!!!&lt;br /&gt;T. Dalla, Tx.</li>
            <li> I bought directly from amazon, not a 3rd party seller, hoping that amazon would send me genuine Oral B brush heads. These are not genuine Oral B Floss Action brush heads, they are cheap knock offs as alot of the reviews are pointing out. The brush head falls off the handle instead of snapping on like the genuine ones do. The brush dosent even make the same noise as it does with a genuine head, it sounds more rattly. I&#x27;ve been reading that these heads fall apart in your mouth while brushing so I&#x27;m returning mine before they have a chance to do that. Check out the pictures with the notes at the top of the page, the brush heads amazon sent me look identical the the knock-off ones. (Grey oral-b markings etc.)</li>
            <li> I first purchased this from a marketplace reseller. It&#x27;s counterfeit. Fine. I would just return and purchase it from Amazon itself. Again it&#x27;s counterfeit.    I don&#x27;t understand why Oral-B is still listing Amazon as sort of a recommended reseller on their website. Everyone who bought counterfeit here should complain to Oral-B and push them to take action on this stupid counterfeit madness.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews, I figured the problem with Amazon sending out counterfeit(fake)replacement heads was a thing of the past. Wrong. I received the fake ones people have been complaining about. I called Amazon and spoke with their rep and was told to ship the brush heads back to Amazon and they would be sending out a replacement. I asked what I was to do if I again received counterfeits. He said if that happened, my money would be refunded and Amazon would look into this problem. The second shipment was the real thing so my problem was solved. Amazon was great but they are still sending out counterfeits.</li>
            <li> The Floss Action provides significantly better cleaning action than the standard brush. They seem to last enough longer than the standard ones to more than make up for the difference in price. I always wonder if I will get a knockoff, but this package is a real Oral B product!</li>
            <li> Received brush heads yesterday and they appear genuine. I checked my packaging and product against the photos and info provided by Amazon customers. I have in the past received counterfeit brush heads from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Well, I knew about the problem with fakes but when ahead and risked the purchase because of the low price. I knew something was off with the package, but it met several of the criteria for genuine. It wasn&#x27;t until I picked-up another set at Target that I noticed that I indeed had received fakes from Amazon. Some items to note of my fakes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Had the right packaging, but it printing was blurry on the back. It&#x27;s hard to tell from the picture, but the text and graphics were noticeably fuzzy.&lt;br /&gt;- The logo did not scratch-off and there was an engraved serial number&lt;br /&gt;- The package only had 1 ring&lt;br /&gt;- Bristles were noticeably sloppy, particularly when compared to the real thing&lt;br /&gt;- There was blue dye leaking onto the yellow piece&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these fakes were slightly better than some of the previous fakes people posted, but still fake nonetheless.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite brush! I&#x27;ve tried all of this firm and returned to her. Great clean - no more problems with tea and coffee!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush head!  It took some time to get use to, but well worth the effort.  Recently had a cleening and I hardly had any plaque buildup.  Previous gum issues that I was having are now all resolved.  The hygenist even commented that I must be flossing better, which I haven&#x27;t been at all.  My teeth feel like I have had a cleaning everyday!I highly recommend this toothbrush head for everyone.  I will never go back to manuel brushing.</li>
            <li> I find it not so good, it is a bit rough and didn&#x27;t last that long. Want to return it.</li>
            <li> awesome clean feeling and do not be scared of how they feel at first. Just like any tooth brush that is harder they feel hard on the teeth. They really do clean the teeth well. We have been buying oral B tooth brushes for my wife and I for over 5 years. Electric tooth brush is the way to go. I would however suggest a softer tooth brush head for a child. This would be too rough for them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral B Floss Action brushes for years, and have been extremely satisfied with the product.  Unfortunately, like many others who purchased this product, the item I received from Amazon was clearly a counterfeit replica that does not work effectively.  When I called the distributor directly, I was informed that they \\&quot;do not sell counterfeit items.\\&quot;  Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bought this product last year from Direct Home and Garden. First brush head fell apart within minutes of use.  Second one did not last much longer. The loose parts could injure you.  Found out that it is a counterfeit product. Do not buy!!!  I will buy my next Oral B brush heads at a local store.</li>
            <li> The braun toothbrush heads are great. They size of the head is comfortable, compared to the others on the market.</li>
            <li> Really cleans teeth well and was a pretty good price to be delivered right to my door.</li>
            <li> Its the real the thing and it&#x27;s cheaper than the retail store.  I will buy again and recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, brush is gentle, fresh and clean. will recommended friends if there are looking for electronic brush .</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes with the Braun Triumph Toothbrush. After using it for less than 6 months, it was the first time ever I did not have to have any treatment at the Dentist. Not even a scale and polish. It will save me shed loads of money.</li>
            <li> So-So product. Do not like it as well a simple heat and then using a small head for gums</li>
            <li> I have used the &#x27;regular&#x27; oral b brush heads for years and had very good results.  I am a daily flosser so when I saw that these were supposed to imitate the flossing action I figured \\&quot;what could be bad about that?\\&quot;  Well -I&#x27;ll tell you what - first of all they do absolutely nothing that even remotely resembles &#x27;flossing action&#x27; and  secondly - they don&#x27;t even get my teeth as clean as a regular toothbrush.  I brush for a full 2 minutes (30 seconds as quadrant)and yet invariably when I &#x27;smile&#x27; after I finish there is still stuff in between my teeth..  That is just disgusting.  I NEVER had that happen w/ the regular Oral B brush heads. I will definitely never buy these \\&quot;floss heads\\&quot; again.</li>
            <li> Amazon keeps customers informed of the progress of the order.  Order arrived earlier than projected.  I am pleased with the product and the price.</li>
            <li> this was a christmas gift for my son and he love the idea of floss brushes so he doesn&#x27;t have to use the wax string</li>
            <li> Use these brushes with my SonicCare brush, they are very good.  I am having difficulty finding them locally and have to order them.</li>
            <li> I changed to these brush heads after using the other basic type for years and what a difference.  I highly recommend these brush heads - I do see a difference and especially if you brush for the recommended two minutes.  Wish I&#x27;d changed sooner.</li>
            <li> We have a DD w/braces &amp; have been concerned about her not being able to floss as often as she could w/out them so I bought these.  It literally takes 30 minutes to floss w/braces so it doesn&#x27;t get done 1-2xs per day like ti used to.  DD said the heads work GREAT &amp; that she has gone over her teeth w/floss thread after using this brush head &amp; hasn&#x27;t gotten anything left behind yet.  Makes me feel relief that she won&#x27;t get cavities w/braces on due to not being to floss as much.  I will update more after her 1st check up since getting the braces on to review how effective they have been.</li>
            <li> It may be my overly sensitive teeth, but these are a lot more harsh than the one that comes with the brush. If I had a choice, I would return these for a softer one.</li>
            <li> glad I found these, they really clean my teeth well, these hold up much longer than the knock off brands...while they may be more $$ than the knock offs, the quality and durability make them more worth the cost</li>
            <li> These are great replacement heads. They include the floss action, which pull particles out of your teeth. They work great and are at a great price!</li>
            <li> I bought this product using subscribe an save, what a great deal!  This is a very reliable effective product.  I bought these for my 10 year old toothbrush.  Love it  still!</li>
            <li> The product is good and as expected, the shipment arrived much before than expected date. The packaging was good, I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> They fit and they work.  What more can I say?  But this site requires more words so I&#x27;ll keep on typing until I fulfill the minimum.</li>
            <li> After a few uses (about 10 or so), the brush head started coming apart. First the rubber pieces on the head starting falling apart in mouth while brushing. After a few more uses the whole head feel apart as the small metal pieces came unscrewed. Same thing happened to all the 3 heads in the pack. I don&#x27;t have any proof, but felt like counterfeit material.</li>
            <li> They did not fit propery and made a lot of noise.  I ordered the other set directly from P&amp;G store, which is manufacturer&#x27;s store.  The one that arrived from P&amp;G was similar to the ones that I recieved with the unit.  The one that I ordered from Amazon was different.  Had different color logo along with other minor differences.  I noticed after using it, that I have some grooves in the tooth enamel near gums.  I do not know if it is because of the material used in the brushes of this particular toothbrush, but I did not have it before.  When I used the original ones and the ones from P&amp;G store, it did not occur.</li>
            <li> I purchased these toothbrush replacements for my Braun and my husband liked them much better than the original replacements. Very Happy!!</li>
            <li> My original toothbrush head came with oral B 1000. This one is harder than the original one - I know it&#x27;s supposed to be hard - and it took me sometime to use to it. If you don&#x27;t like a hard brush, you may want to choose other brush heads.</li>
            <li> Not happy with replacement brusheads.  Heads began to get loose after a month and then fell off completely.  Same thing happened on both brushes.  Original brushes never broke off.  Originals were not floss action.</li>
            <li> These are great and $10 less than even WalMart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a year and a half, and am happy with the brushing experience.  They might be too aggressive for those with sensitive teeth or gums.  That said, many of the brushes sold here as Oral-B have been fakes.  They look the same, but they&#x27;re junky.  They don&#x27;t last.  I got some, and they were bad.  However, the latest pack I got are genuine (ordered three weeks ago).  I see Amazon has removed all other buying options for this product.  \\&quot;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com\\&quot; is the only choice, no other vendors.  I hope this means they got wind of the counterfeiting scams and are working to ensure they&#x27;re selling only the genuine article.  I buy tons of stuff from Amazon, as well as \\&quot;Amazon Marketplace\\&quot; vendors and have never had a problem before.  I may continue ordering these here, but I&#x27;m still not 100% confident Amazon shut out the fakes. I might go to a local chain drugstore or the oral-B site directly for the next couple packs.</li>
            <li> Like many others here, I believe Amazon sent me the fake ones.  At first I didn&#x27;t notice much difference, but after extensive use, it didn&#x27;t trigger the change-head reminder on my electric toothbrush. Then I looked at customer posted pictures and notes on genuine &amp; fake comparison, pretty sure I received fake ones.  So I contacted Amazon, was told to send them back on my expense for partial refund, I say NO! I&#x27;m keeping them and let all my friends know, I thought we deserved an apology from Amazon but apparently they don&#x27;t think that way, very disappointed!</li>
            <li> After comparing everything within the user submitted photos, I can say with some confidence that Amazon sent me legit Floss Action heads. They arrived today, 14Dec, 2011. They have a serial number, the Oral B marking can&#x27;t be scratched off with a finger nail, the packaging is properly labeled with crystal clear lettering, the colors on the bristles are spot on - no dye smudging.  I&#x27;ll be glad to update this review in a couple months if these heads don&#x27;t stay on like they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are longer lasting and more effective than the soft bristle brushes.</li>
            <li> Best brush heads on the market.</li>
            <li> We use this brush along with the sensitive head brush to alternate.  This is a deep cleaning brush and your teeth feel extra clean.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> The more I use these \\&quot;gimmick\\&quot; attachments the more I think the best move is to use the regular heads or maybe the dual action. The stiff flossing points do feel pretty good on your gums but as far as actually mimicking the action of really flossing your teeth, I suspect they are not that effective. Definitily stay away from the heads with the polishing cup. That just doesnt do anything unless you have real dental polishing paste maybe.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush.  It doesn&#x27;t get in between the teeth as well as floss, but it cleans better than the regular heads I think.  I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> If you have used the precision clean brush heads, then this may apply. The brush head is not as gentle and doesn&#x27;t appear to clean any better. The brush head is oval and it rattles against my teeth, which I find uncomfortable. I made the mistake of buying a multi-pack. Suggest you try a single brush head before you commit to the hype. In this case newer was not better!</li>
            <li> Oral B floss action heads are very good for the toothbrush, and has a very high quality, cant get any better than that, I would recommend this set to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  It arrived quickly, and is exactly the same as in the store, but at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> did not order them and I returned them. CEvans</li>
            <li> I got a legit Oral-B replacement and the heads work well. I&#x27;m still on my first one but it&#x27;s only been a month.</li>
            <li> The paddles on these oval-shaped brush heads are rough on my gums.  As I have a small mouth and receding gums, I don&#x27;t need any more agents of &#x27;attack&#x27; on my gumline.  I much prefer the original round Oral B brush heads with no paddles.  I feel like they clean my teeth much better and my gums are not sore afterwards.  For people with a nice, wide mouth and no gum problems, maybe these are OK.</li>
            <li> Received and they work fine, good price and since it is the brand the quality is there.  It doesn&#x27;t look like they put in a fake brand.  The price beat out Walmart and the Bed Bath and Beyond with a coupon.</li>
            <li> Well, I was greatly dismayed to find that the brushes shipped to me did not fit my Oral B toothbrush so my advice to buyers is, BE SURE these are the right brushes for your Oral B.  We&#x27;ll see how complicated it is dealing with Amazon to get the right ones which may actually may be of more interest to buyers than a review of the brushes themselves.</li>
            <li> Just so you know, these do NOT take the place of flossing.  The rubber nubs just give a little more penetration in between your teeth.  That being said, they are a big improvement of the standard heads.  I have been using them since they came out and wont change until a newer version comes out.  Your teeth feel near-dentist clean after brushing and I highly recommend them despite the price.  As others have said, research where you buy them because there is a HUGE counterfeit market for these.</li>
            <li> I find the cleaning capability of the Floss Action brush to be excellent. Gets my teeth very clean, more so than any other brush in the Oral-B line up (and I&#x27;ve tried every one!). The size is a bit larger than the regular model, but still remains sufficiently maneuverable. The hardest area to hit is behind the front teeth. It can be done, but there&#x27;s more of a mess than with the smaller brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that they are a bit rougher on the gum line than the Ultrasoft Oral-B model. So, I switch off between the two - couple of days with the Floss Action, then a couple of days with the Ultrasoft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price if you catch it on one of the price dips. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> You will love this electric toothbrush head with its dual action clean!!! Your teeth feel as smooth as the day you get them cleaned by the dental hygienist!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~*This is the second time I have contacted this seller about the defective toothbrush heads I received. I have done some research on Amazon about the toothbrush heads I ordered from them and there is a \\&quot;buyer beware\\&quot; site that identify&#x27;s fraudulant oral b tooth brush heads. They show pictures of the true oral b tooth brush heads compared to the \\&quot;look alikes\\&quot; that are sold to unknowing customers like me. I compared my toothbrush heads to the pictures online and have discovered they are not true oral b brand toothbrush heads but, rather falsely advirtized as such.~*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure before you buy toothbrush heads to compare their product to the real thing, they may be selling a look alike.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]] Flossing became difficult for when I lost most of the use of my right hand due to a stroke. The Floss Action seems to make a difference.</li>
            <li> Brush was bigger than previously but I assume it covers more area and gets in between teeth. Satisfied with product....</li>
            <li> Wow, I looked high and low for the refills to my Oral B Floss at my local drug store and other well known stores, as well as online stores, but could not find the this brand or the price was too high!!!  Thanks to Amazon automatic shipping, I will never be without my Oral B refills.</li>
            <li> I really like and highly recommend this floss/action attachment from Oral B - HOWEVER, I purchased this product on Amazon and I do believe it was a KNOCK-OFF and not made by Oral B. I read other reviews warning about unknowingly purchasing a knock-off, and then it happened to me. After only a month of use, the head became very wobbly and seemed to start to detaching. It broke off, falling into my hand, as I was very gently trying to inspect it to see what was wrong. I hate paying retail for these, but I went back to biting the bullet on price to make sure I bought the real deal. I am happy I did. Make sure you buy the ones made by Oral B. You will like them. I have been using them for at least 4 years and let me tell you, the dental hygenist spends a lot less time in my mouth - and doesn&#x27;t have to scrape and dig around the gumline so much anymore. (Perhaps the price of the real ones is worth that alone!!)</li>
            <li> As of all Oral-B, worth the purchase.  I have been using it for a long time without any problem.  Always have a good dentist visit.</li>
            <li> I checked mine based on the reviews of other customers who have received fakes. This one has a the serial number on the back. It does feel a bit more aggressive than the other brush heads.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and it worked the first time I used it. That is a great product. What else do I need to say?</li>
            <li> For whatever reason these new brush heads aren&#x27;t lasting near as long as the previous.  No idea if this is intentional or i just received a bad batch, but it is making me consider switching tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband.  He has not said that he does not like them so I take it they are good.</li>
            <li> Fits nicely in the Oral-B Professional Floss Action. As I guess it should as it is made for it. Great product that I will keep buying as they wear out.</li>
            <li> These brushes are just what you need when you purchase the electric tooth brush.  The two go perfect together. GREAT</li>
            <li> Could not find replacements at any store so had to go on line. Works as it should. No complaints for now</li>
            <li> If you have used Oral-B electric brushes, you are already familiar with how it does its job which IMO is great for maintaining your dental hygiene. This three-pack typically lasts quite long and you can find a $5 coupon from Oral-B/Amazon(displayed on the page when available) to make the deal even sweeter.</li>
            <li> These seem fake.  I just purchased real ones from Walgreens so I can actually compare them now.  The \\&quot;fake\\&quot; ones would rust, the little yellow flossers would fall off the head, and the entire head holding the bristles would disconnect from the mechanism that moves it rendering it useless.  But hey, I just went to my dentist and they said everything with my mouth/gums got better!  I just wanted to note that there&#x27;s a difference between these and the ones you purchase from the store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite happy with the floss action brush heads i ordered for my Oral B rechargeable toothbrush. The price was cheaper than Wal-Mart&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and was everything I wanted.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on with the reviews here. Check out the ones on the Target website. My dentist sold me a toothbrush with two of these heads for 25 dollars, and now I know why. The plastic paddles in this head&#x27;s bristles are like a jackhammer on your teeth and gums. I have used this brush for a week, and have had gums bleeding and swelling (NEVER any problems before, and yes, I floss daily), teeth getting more sensitive and less clean feeling afterward (they can feel quite clean, but you have to brush twice the recommended time, which is detrimental to enamel and gums), and this head makes a huge mess! Toothpaste splashing everywhere. Very unhappy. Going to the sensitive heads.</li>
            <li> I love being able to solve a problem quickly and simply. The price is better than in the local stores and the product is just the same.</li>
            <li> Always keep extra heads for brush.  As they say, \\&quot;two heads are better than one\\&quot;.  The Oral-b heads are best don&#x27;t buy imatation heads, the orignal are better made.</li>
            <li> Great brush heads at a very good price. Would buy again when the time comes!</li>
            <li> So  much cheaper then at the store. Exact same product. Will buy again. I learned my lesson and only will get the real Oral-B brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some comments about counterfeit refills, but the ones from the &#x27;Oral-B&#x27; seller seem to be legit.  The product packaging is labeled Procter/Gamble and I&#x27;ve had no problem in replacing the refill heads - they snapped on right away and stay on when the brush is turned on.  The Floss Action heads are a bit larger than the normal heads so if you are worried about size, that may be a factor.  However, they do seem to do a good job in cleaning between the teeth and reaching spaces.</li>
            <li> Great transaction, good price.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this product in local retail stores with no success. By chance, I tried Amazon.com and lo and behold there is was.  I ordered the set of brushes and they arrived within a few days.  Both my wife are very satisfied with the products and the service.</li>
            <li> Replacements came promptly, in original packaging. Will order from &lt;br /&gt;this company when need more.</li>
            <li> There are tons of knock offs out there and yes I&#x27;ve tried them. Bottom line Oral B heads clean better and last up to 5 times longer with regular use. Not much else to say; if you can afford them then buy them.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted but much less expensive than at local stores!</li>
            <li> Stiffer than generics.  I like.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality brush head. Brush head cleans well and holds its shape without the bristles becoming stubs with use. Leaves my teeth feeling nice and clean. Good quality at a good value. Recommend.</li>
            <li> Fair deal for replacement heads. Appears to work well. Hard to tell which exact brush head works the best, but I have no qualms with this one at all.</li>
            <li> The heads seem to be much sturdier than ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the past and seems to clean my teeth better and faster.</li>
            <li> I have an Oral B Professional.  I also have a Sonicare.  I never use the latter because the Oral B makes my teeth feel so squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> I have been using an Oral-B rechargable toothbrush for several years. I am on my second one the first lasted 8+ years. I decided to try the Floss action Brush Head &amp; I really like it. It is a bit larger than the brush that came with my precision 1000 model toothbrush, it holds a bit more toothpaste &amp; does a superior job of cleaning. I will be using this brush in the future unless they introduce an even better one. They are pricey but they do a good job. I do have two brushes that worked on my old unit but they will not work the new one so I am stuck with two brand new expensive brushes that are not compatible with my new precision 1000 toothbrush. I think I will call Oral-B &amp; see if they will replace my two incompatible brush heads with the floss action one that fits my precision 1000 model.</li>
            <li> These have worked great over the years. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s our genetics or the effectiveness of these brushes, but our teeth are in really good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let me ask you something.&lt;br /&gt;As a kid (30 yrs ago) I was alway taught to brush my teeth for 2 min, to be effective. Now the Oral-B handle counts down 2 min as well, but it&#x27;s the equivalent of 600 manual strokes. Well, in 2 min as a kid I never did 600 manual strokes, more like 100. So wouldn&#x27;t that mean I only need to use the Oral-B for about 20 seconds?</li>
            <li> Tho I think prices for these brushes are too high, regardless of where purchased, I found Amazon had the absolutely best price offered anywhere.  Quick delivery was appreciated!</li>
            <li> This brushhead performs well and I haven&#x27;t had the need to floss my teeth in nearly a year thanks to the little (rubber?) strips in the brushhead. I&#x27;m not saying I haven&#x27;t flossed, but when I have, the floss comes out clean.  I have had some troubles with the toothbrush itself, but unplugging/plugging it into the dock always fixes the bug.</li>
            <li> These are the best brush heads out there for Oral B power toothbrushes. You may be tempted by&lt;br /&gt;Precision Clean [[ASIN:B000RSITSK Oral B Precision Clean 3 pack brush head refill]] or&lt;br /&gt;Dual Clean [[ASIN:B0002KHU3I Oral-B Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)]] - especially the latter because it has greater surface area. However, only FlossAction brush heads have the yellow floss removing bristle - they make a big difference in the overall experience (performing floss like function).</li>
            <li> I have been using these brush heads for a few years now and they are great.  The amazon price is a lot better than what you&#x27;ll find in the store, especially with the subscribe and save discount, so these were a great find!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Direct Super Center. Little did I know that brush heads can be fake. I should have known better when I received the package. 3 individually packaged heads in one opened package. I thought that had happened through the handling process, but after all 3 heads broke down with in one week of normal use, I figured the package had been tampered with.&lt;br /&gt;This seller is giving me the run around. As of yet, I have not received a refund. Good luck if you try to call them! No answer.&lt;br /&gt;I did buy new brush heads directly from Amazon and they are perfect.</li>
            <li> This is my third set purchased here at Amazon, because it is the (see title of review). They&#x27;re OEM and not cheap imitations from Taiwan.</li>
            <li> I opened the first pack and the 1st 2 brush heads only lasted a couple of days each!  My Triumph Toothbrush started making strange noises and I noticed that the noise was coming from the brush heads, they stopped \\&quot;oscillating\\&quot; like they should.  Not sure why but I am attempting to return as defective!</li>
            <li> When i started using these it seemed fine, then after about one week i noticed it was not brushing as well.  So i examined it more carefully.  I noticed the brush head wiggled alot more. No longer did it just go in a circular motion. The head now moved side to side and kinda flailed around while on.  So its intended circular motion no longer worked well.  So i though maybe it was just a bad one.  I got out the next one, and 2 weeks latter. Same thing happened.       So i compared it to a genuine one from walmart, and noticed some differences.  It was missing a serial number through the little window on the back, and the plastic piece up in the inside was different as well. Also pivoting piece attached to the head (This is what comes loose and causes the head to move erratic) on the inside that you can see through those three small windows. Looks less substantial.        So DO NOT BUY.  IT IS FAKE AND COUNTERFEIT.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product so I rate it 5 stars.  I rate the seller 0 stars.  DO NOT sign up for automatic refills.  The seller promises a 15% discount if you sign up.  What you get is a 15% discount off of a price that is raised 20-80% from what you payed the first time.   I have been on automatic refills for 1 1/2 years and just noticed that the price they are charging for the next refill is much higher even with the 15% discount than for what I can order it for (from  the same seller offering the 15% discount).  Am very disppointed in Amazon for allowing this type of business practice!</li>
            <li> These brushes work great.  I have tried using the generic ones and they are awful, You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love my Oral-B toothbrush and I thought the \\&quot;flossing action\\&quot; would be a nice bonus.  WRONG!  These things clunk around in your mouth and are so loud it&#x27;s embarrassing - even when you&#x27;re alone!  It almost felt like they were incorrectly assembled with parts that weren&#x27;t designed to go together.  I had to wonder if these were even authentic Oral-B products.  The first brush broke after less than a month.  I threw the second and third away only a couple of weeks later and bought the \\&quot;plain Jane\\&quot; version.  The price looks great, but it&#x27;s a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Best Oral-B brushes in my opinion.  I have been using various oral-b brushes for the past 10-12 years.  I switched to these about 3 years ago and my dentist visits get better each time.  My gums no longer bleed as often and my teeth are doing great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do however floss almost every other day with Reach Access flossers so combined with these brushes, I think I found a simple winning combination for healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I learned how much I like my toothbrush when I dropped my last brush head in the toilet and my new ones were not here yet. I hope not to let that happen again.</li>
            <li> Performs as expected!</li>
            <li> I dont mind going to the dentist anymore.</li>
            <li> Great price and great product.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fine.  Good price.</li>
            <li> good item,and the quality is very good,worth to buy,and i wanna buy another for my family</li>
            <li> These refills arrived quickly and excellent quality.  They are long-lasting and get your teeth clean.  They keep the gums healthy too.</li>
            <li> I love my Oral B Triumph and was happy I could get refills on Amazon.  Many of my local retail stores did not have the product.</li>
            <li> They are replacement heads.  If you like Oral-B you will like these heads.  Seem sturdy, clean well.  I enjoy the flossing action.</li>
            <li> I had earlier purchased the Oral B Triump electric toothbrush from Amazon and our family really likes it.    The replacement brush heads were the cheapest at Amazon.  The delivery time was great also.</li>
            <li> I went with the Floss Action model just because it was $2 cheaper (gotta pinch those pennies nowadays) for the refill pack compared to the Precision head model that comes standard on the $12 Oral-B Vitality brush.  The head is definitely larger which some people will not like because it is not as easy to maneuver inside the mouth.  The jury is out on how well the bristles will hold up compared to the regular version which lasts me at least 4 months, I have a feeling it will not last quite as long because of the more intricate brush design.  It was worth trying and I&#x27;m not disappointed but will probably be going back to the easier to maneuver regular version next time.  I won&#x27;t be going back to regular toothbrush&#x27;s anytime soon after using the Oral-B Vitality brush with the various head refills.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use with my Oral B triumph toothbrush. I had a floss action brush head and a regular flex head before but i dont see any noticeable difference beetween the flosss action heads and regulr head.&lt;br /&gt;Its a little bit softer though. This is not supposed replace your regular floss which you get from the threads but does a pretty good job if you dont want to floss everyday.</li>
            <li> Have been using these for over 1 year.  Best version of the brush head to date.</li>
            <li> THESE GUYS ARE THE BEST.</li>
            <li> Effective brush head for cleaning teeth. As with any electric toothbrush, personal preference is uppermost. This combo of Oral B Floss Action and a compatible Oral B power handle (8 or 9 thousand series) is the best I have used.</li>
            <li> this is a great product and better than the polishers, do not buy the polishers, even my dentist said not to, use these, very good!  i have been using them for over 12 years (not the same one, i do get replacements  :)  haha)</li>
            <li> I give this 5 stars as it cleans my teeth really well and I find it so comfortable. You cannot go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Fits and operates perfectly. Some of the older reviews had me worried that there would be an issue, but they work just fine.</li>
            <li> Love it. Exact the same as came with my toothbrush</li>
            <li> I love these flossing heads.  Ever since I&#x27;ve used these, my dentist comments on how clean my teeth are!  They are small but very powerful and leave my teeth feeling so clean.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count)]]    The best brush heads for Oral-B 9000 Serie. Fast shipping, low price, completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using electric toothbrush &amp; I am using this as well. Not bad I would say but will be able to tell in long term if this one does any magic. Just been brushing as usual with electric brush and it doesn&#x27;t feels bad.</li>
            <li> This item was priced right, so I bought it to replace my former Oral B brush head. This product&#x27;s bristles are much too stiff to clean my teeth thoroughly. They do not get down into the areas between my teeth like my former brush head did. It also vibrates against my teeth easily making it uncomfortable to use. the quality is good, but the application is too stiff for me. Oral-B® FlexiSoft(tm) Brushhead works best for me. Maybe that is why it costs $12 each at Walgreen/CVS.</li>
            <li> If you own an oral-B Triumph this is the best head to use. Even after flossing it manages to pull stuff out from between your teeth. The results at the dentist do no lie. Unless I have a coupon the price here on Amazon is the best you will find.</li>
            <li> This is incorrect product--does not fit my device.  No action was ever taken.  Money thrown out the window!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The brush head is really excellent at cleaning around the gums. If you have crowns and need to get below the surface this is also very good. Do not press hard let the rotating brush do the good work on your teeth.</li>
            <li> These brushes work well and last well, but it really hard to see why they should cost so much.  The old line of Braun brushes were cheaper and also worked well.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the way to go to replace the brush heads on the Oral-B Professional Toothbrush. I am very pleased with this purchase and the price. I combined it with another purchase so I received free shipping. Oral-B also had a coupon that I redeemed that gave me another $5.00 off.</li>
            <li> Bought these on a special sale and the price was amazing.  Will use them in my existing oral b toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend changing the brush heads on your toothbrush every 3 months like it is advised.  It truly makes a difference.  These brush heads work great and leave your mouth feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I love my Oral B.  Amazon has best prices on replacement heads.  Your teeth will thank you for buying this product.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count)]] These are the only brushes for one of the best electric tooth brushes available. Good durability and fine performance.</li>
            <li> Easy to purchase for a great price.</li>
            <li> The Oral B Flos Action Replacement Head was exactly what I ordered and arrived a head of schedule. I expected a different type of brush. this is of no fault of the vendor I just ordered the wrong item. I am trying the brush ordered and finding it meeting all my needs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my first of these and they work as expected. I only change them every 3 months, so will be awhile before any others are tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 1 June 2015 - on my 2nd one of these, and have found that the small blue plastic(?) part that&#x27;s part of the flossing action doesn&#x27;t hold up well. 2 months into this brush head, and all 4 of them have come off and been spit out with the toothpaste. You can see it in the attached picture on the yellow parts of the brush head.</li>
            <li> Tried buying an off brand and didn&#x27;t get anywhere near the same results.  Won&#x27;t make that mistake again.  Well worth the price to have healthy gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what most people&#x27;s reviews on these floss action heads are so upset about cause mine are the same as the ones that came with my brush. And, they are awesome! Give them a try I really like mine.</li>
            <li> Good product. Great to get with auto fulfillment. No worries on running out now. Nice with floss action, makes a big difference!</li>
            <li> use this product for 6 months. went to the dentist and she was happy that i use it. great product to reduce plague and whiten teeth.</li>
            <li> Great value for a fraction of the price of other electric toothbrushes and their replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> For an item of personal sanitary use, I would have expected the refill brushes to have been delivered in their original packaging, Rather each was loose, in a baggie.</li>
            <li> Great product, I have been using this brand for many years.</li>
            <li> This is the second set of brush heads. They are so good that the dentist wanted to know what I was using since there wasn&#x27;t much for them to do.</li>
            <li> I love my new OralB electric toothbrush replacement brush heads. My dentist said my teeth are very clean and my gums look great.</li>
            <li> It really seems to help with the flossing.  Some of my teeth are pretty tight and this is a great &#x27;pre treatment&#x27; prior to flossing.  I liked it so well, my husband asked me to get more so he can use them too.</li>
            <li> am happy with brushes,  sorry that floss tips don&#x27;t hold up longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched to this floss action head, because it works well and does what it is designed to do.. clean in between teeth</li>
            <li> I have attempted to substitute these with a generic brand, and there is no comparison! Also, it is much better to purchase there here, as they cost over $10 dollars more locally. The flossing action of this Oral-B brush head is super-effective. Dental hygienists give me a gold star for clean teeth every time. I suggest using this in conjunction with the best toothpaste we&#x27;ve found: [[ASIN:B001E77OCU Arm &amp; Hammer PeroxiCare, Baking Soda &amp; Peroxide Toothpaste with Tartar Control]]. No other brand cleans as effectively. This toothbrush head beautifully cleans and flosses, leaving teeth &amp; gums fresh and healthy. Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I&#x27;m blessed with good, strong chompers (had fluoride as a kid). After years of no cavities, I ran into one young dentist (trying to drum up business) who grimly informed me that I had FIVE. After getting a 2nd opinion from a far better dentist, I found out that the former one was simply attempting to line his pockets. Apparently, this \\&quot;aggressive\\&quot; dentistry is becoming more common. So be aware, and be wary!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how these were going to work at first &#x27;cause I bought them to replace another type...Now I love these the best!  They do the job and more.  Very satisfied and will replace these with same again.</li>
            <li> I feel like i get a deeper clean with these things then any other toothbrush I have ever had.  I love the small rubber flossing bristle.  I will buy these again.</li>
            <li> good choice&lt;br /&gt;good price.&lt;br /&gt;the indicator on the brushe head reminds me that the brsh head needs replacement in 3 months.</li>
            <li> These floss actions bush heads have made a huge difference with my teeth cleaning.  My dentist would stress to me that I need to floss more to prevent tartar and gingivitis, but it was hard to remember to floss.  I hate to floss and this just gets the job done faster/easier than brushing and then flossing.  Two birds with one stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist has given me praise for my flossing, so I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.  I am going to continue to buy these and the price is similar to standard brush heads without the flossers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons they are a bit pricey, but these are from Oral-B so they are the genuine product and not generic.  I&#x27;ve purchased generic brush heads and the quality isn&#x27;t always there.  You are better off with these.</li>
            <li> Tried these out as a replacement for the precision clean brush head. The oval shape does not maneuver as well, they&#x27;re a bit more rough on your teeth/gums, and the bristles do not feel as though they clean as well either. The difference is like night and day. I doubt I&#x27;ll even use the remaining brush heads, I&#x27;ll just pay a bit more for the precision clean ones because they&#x27;re far superior.</li>
            <li> Our entire family enjoys speedy 2x a year cleanings at the denist as a result of these.  Our hygentist ALWAYS comments on how little plaque build up we have.  We put these on auto ship to save extra money and to be sure that we changing out the toothbrush heads as suggested.</li>
            <li> its good, I like it, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Pros: provides deep and thorough teeth cleaning, my dentist praises my home oral care&lt;br /&gt;Cons: bit expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No doubt about it, these work great.  I haven&#x27;t had any oral issues since using these and I like how the fading of the blue bristles gives you an indication that it&#x27;s about time to replace brush heads.  Nothing more to say but, buy them.  You can save a few bucks if you use Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save like I do.</li>
            <li> Avoid the cheap knockoffs. I have tried them all and only this original brand works properly in the toothbrushes. The cheaper ones come off while brushing your teeth, do not rotate, and in general fail to complete the mission of getting your teeth clean. These work amazingly well and last a long time. Love my Oral B Triumph!</li>
            <li> I just came from the dentist a few days ago. No cavities and she said my flossing looked great. On my visit before she found 5 cavities when i used a manual brush. Highly recommend getting these if you don&#x27;t like flossing.</li>
            <li> It helps to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> they work like they should! I would recommend this to anyone! check them out now I am just looking for words.</li>
            <li> I prefer the floss action brushes to the others. They seem to clean really well.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter she finally loves to brush her teeth. Major accomplishment.</li>
            <li> I brush after breakfast and at be time.  I also use a water pick.  My hygienist always says that there is little left for her to do.</li>
            <li> I love getting new toothbrush heads and there is only 3 people using this toothbrush. A lot of stores don&#x27;t sell them in odd numbers unless you buy them individually. Good price and works well is toothbrush handle.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for a friend, to give to her fiance&#x27; for Christmas.  He loves the electric toothbrush, and wanted him to have spare brush heads for the new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> theproduct came promptly and at a good price  &lt;br /&gt;the cleaning action of the brush is great</li>
            <li> Ordered them for holiday gift and they arrived in plenty of time.  Used as a gift and my daughter loves them and her electric toothbrush which she uses all the time.</li>
            <li> They have given me the healthiest gums and teeth that I&#x27;ve ever had . The dentist asked  what I was using , to care for my teeth, since there was no tartar or plaque on my teeth.</li>
            <li> A little big and I have a big mouth. They take some getting used to. If I could do it all over again, I&#x27;d stick with the classic brushes. They keep my teeth in great shape and no need to change.</li>
            <li> the flossaction Oral-b brushheads work great. My teeth feel very clean after using it. They are better than the other brushheads from Oral-b.</li>
            <li> Product works as intended and leaves you with a really clean mouth.  These work really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of these refills.  They clean more aggressively than the normal ones.  Some might like this, but I find the brushing action too harsh to use on my sensitive gums.  YMMV.</li>
            <li> Some of the brush heads didn&#x27;t even work.  I use these all the time and really like the brush heads, just that this batch wasn&#x27;t good all the way thru.</li>
            <li> I could not wait to try these brush heads but I was disappointed.  They were very hard to soften even under hot water so they were somewhat rough on the gums.  They felt very uncomfortable in my mouth and with the little flossing tips it is hard to keep the brush on your teeth because it keeps trying to, for lack of a better word, bounce off so steadying it was difficult for me.  No, I would not recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Each toothbrush head lasts about three weeks to a month and they get my teeth really clean.  Hubby uses them for about six weeks...but I like to change my brush head more frequently. It&#x27;s also a great price for three brush heads.</li>
            <li> Some of the brushheads are loose right out of the pack, the others becomes loose after very little use. When the burshheads are loose, they don&#x27;t rotate back and forth the way they are supposed to when you hold the brushhead against your teeth; they can picnch your lip or cheek, and they can come apart in your mouth. And they can even come apart in your mouth. I&#x27;ve seen knockoffs that are of this poor quality. Either these are counterfeit Oral Bs or Oral B has let the quality degrade substantially.</li>
            <li> Just what I need for my electric toothbrush. So, sorry, there isn&#x27;t too much to say about them You either need &#x27;em or you don&#x27;t. Good quality.</li>
            <li> OEM brushheads that work well</li>
            <li> Good product that I have used for years.</li>
            <li> good product, arrived quickly, would recommend</li>
            <li> The picture shows 4 count brush heads, and the title says &amp;#34;Oral-B Floss Action Replacement Electric Toothbrush Head 4 Count&amp;#34;. But the item received is only 3 Brush Heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it under the impression that I would receive 4 heads. The price would be a good deal if I were receiving 4 count. But it turns out this is a false advertising, a total scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on Amazon</li>
            <li> Nice product and I love it....</li>
            <li> ONLY RECEIVED A THREE COUNT AND I DONT HAVE TIME TO RETURN SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS TOOTHBRUSH HEADS. NOT HAPPY.</li>
            <li> I DECIDED TO GIVE THE HEADS FOR THE ORAL B A TRY AFTER ALL THE HYPE ON TV AND I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED THAT THE BRUSHES IN COMBINATION REALLY DID MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN MY TEETH.  BEFORE I GOT THIS  BRUSH HEAD AND THE DEEP SWEEP TO USE INTERCHANGEABLY EVERY OTHER NIGHT, THE DENTIST HAD MENTIONED I NEEDED A CLEANING AT MY LAST APPT. THE NEXT TIME, ABOUT 2 MONTHS LATER, I ASKED HOW MY TEETH WERE DOING AND HE SAID THEY LOOKED FINE AND DIDN&#x27;T SEEM TO NEED A CLEANING AT THAT TIME. THAT WAS HUGE TO ME AS I HATE THE NEW CLEANING PROCESS! THIS COMBINATION OF BRUSHES, THE FLOSS ACTION AND THE DEEP SWEEP LEAVES MY TEETH FEELING REALLY CLEAN ALL THE WAY TO MY GUMS. THE MOTION IN THESE HEADS ACTUALLY SEEMS TO DO SOMETHING TO CLEAN YOUR TEETH RATHER THAN JUST GOING AROUND IN CIRCLES LIKE SO MANY DO. FOR THE 1ST TIME, I ACTUALLY ENJOY BRUSHING MY TEETH AND WITH THIS BRUSH, MY CARPAL TUNNEL DOESN&#x27;T BOTHER ME DURING OR AFTER BRUSHING MY TEETH AS IN THE PAST BEFORE I DISCOVERED THESE 2 HEADS &amp; THIS BRUSHING SYSTEM. I&#x27;D HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANYONE BUT ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE WITH LIMITED WRIST MOTION.</li>
            <li> Product is as expected. I have purchased before and am pleased with this product. I will again in a few months</li>
            <li> Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Head。 I use the toothbrush for 10 years, it is a good brush, brush my YanZi off, I will also buy.</li>
            <li> Great produce, as described.</li>
            <li> I rarely give out 5-star ratings and with that being said, I am satisfied with these replacement heads. Impressed even. I am using them with a Clean Precision 1000. I used to have the Pro White heads but these are much better. The bristles feel good on my teeth and gums. You shouldn&#x27;t expect it to replace daily flossing for you, but it feels like it reaches deeper and cleans more thoroughly.</li>
            <li> They leave my teeth squeaky clean.  I wish I would have started using a good electronic toothbrush many years ago.  Manual flossing is still required for those of us with crowded mouths, but it is accomplished much more quickly than after using regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful electric toothbrush heads. Guidelines say that you only need to change the head on the day that the season changes so a 3-pack lasts you 3/4 of the year. A great product!</li>
            <li> Needed replacement brush heads for the Oral-B electric toothbrushes purchased. This is convenient value pack to have spares on hand.</li>
            <li> What can you say about toothbrush heads ? They spin, and clean my teeth, they work ok. Don&#x27;t know if the \\&quot;flossaction\\&quot; feature really does anything, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> these brushes are just as advertised.  smaller brush head and easier to use.</li>
            <li> They appeared to be as they were advertised. Was a gift for others and they won&#x27;t use these for a while</li>
            <li> if you want to really take good care of your teeth and gums ... invest in this simple little gadget!!!   what a difference it has made with my doctor&#x27;s report</li>
            <li> I had ordered what I thought were Oral B replacement heads off Ebay, but they were generic.  Glad I found these, they work great!</li>
            <li> This is the brush head that fits. It works. No complaints. Should I really move on to hyperbole about a toothbrush head? Buy it if it fits.</li>
            <li> Got a good price on these and bought them instead of the &#x27;standard&#x27; brush heads. The brush portion itself is slightly larger than on the &#x27;standard&#x27; ones, but not so large as to present a problem. They definitely remove more particles hidden between teeth, and seem to do a good job on tooth surfaces as well. Would recommend as a replacement head for your Braun/Oral B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I could not find these in stores and now I have a source.  Bought six so as not to run out since they are so hard to find.  Does an excellent job and will never go back to manual brushing again.  I like the floss action which is better than the regular heads.  A little hard though.</li>
            <li> This brush is great. The action of this brush does very well to clean between teeth. It is easy on the gums and your mouth feels really fresh after brushing.</li>
            <li> My Oral-B just keeps on going and these relacement heads are perfect and so reasonably priced.  I order them on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly my friend!</li>
            <li> I have used the Oral-B toothbrush for many years, and I really like the Floss Action Replacement Brush Heads.  They have spoiled me for any other Oral-B brush heads.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t tell which Oral-B products can be used w/ this and mine is a different size.  Just through 20 bucks down the toilet since i had to open package to find out.  Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Love these Oral B replacement heads, fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> I ordered because I purchased the Oral-B Rechargeable Electric Rechargeable Toothbrush.  Everything came quickly and works perfectly.  I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hayley Ninnis&lt;br /&gt;West Chester, PA</li>
            <li> Looks like Oral-B is moving on with new design &amp; these won&#x27;t be available any longer. So, I&#x27;ll use these then look for another unit all together. These smaller brushes are easier to maneuver while brushing.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected to get.</li>
            <li> Those are easily my favorite replacement for my electronic toothbrush. I tried them all, and this seems to be the most comfortable, and most gentle on the gum. I really like those replacements.</li>
            <li> these have always worked well for our family and you can tell easily when it&#x27;s time to replace them when the brushes on the outside lose their blue color.&lt;br /&gt;Wish they were a little lower in cost but Amazon does seem to have the best cost on them.</li>
            <li> i have had oral -b for years but nothing like this kin of brush to bad i di not get one sooner oh well beter late than never</li>
            <li> Works well but I still need to floss.  Was this supposed to replace flossing? I prefer the new flexible soft floss picks.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Professional Floss Action Brush makes your teeth feel really clean.  The regular replacement brush is good but this is much better.</li>
            <li> I like the smaller size so you can get around the whole mouth. I purchased two brush heads and this is my preferred one.</li>
            <li> This product was used to replace the original brush head that came with my Oral B Triumph toothbrush. I replace the head every 3 months. These work great!</li>
            <li> The ease to purchase this item is so convenient and I like the contour of the bristles.</li>
            <li> The Floss Action Brush Head is a terrific flossing agent. My teeth feel so clean after using it. And, being powered, it doesn&#x27;t require more effort on my part than simply holding the unit.</li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend this brush head. It feels very rough on the mouth and especially the gums. Not a great design.</li>
            <li> I love these brush heads and this was a good price. My favorite brush heads. Arrived fast. Just what I wanted!!</li>
            <li> We have switched permanently to these great brush-heads.  They are larger than the regular brush heads, so you can be done brushing faster or brush more thoroughly in the same amount of time.      I used these for 6 months instead of flossing.  At my dentist appointment--while I did get the usual lecture about flossing when I told her about my experiment--the hygenist did acknowledge that my gums were the best she saw that day and that I had less tartar than before.    The only drawback is that these are more expensive.</li>
            <li> works great, super easy to change out</li>
            <li> Good replacement heads.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and was a good price for the amount or brush heads. Have used the product for years but this was first time buying replacements from amazon. They are exactly what I needed and work well.</li>
            <li> I used an Oral-B electric toothbrush for ages, and these heads are great. The generic heads are the ones you want to steer clear of....I bought them once because they were so inexpensive, but you get what you pay for. If you have an Oral-B Floss Action Electric Toothbrush, definitely buy these heads for it.</li>
            <li> I bought a new Oral B pro brush that came with this head.  I used it for a few days and found that my teeth were killing me.  The Sensodyne wasn&#x27;t helping.  OTC toothache medications weren&#x27;t helping!  I couldn&#x27;t figure it out at first, then went back to the sensitive brush.  Eureka!  It was the brush!  It cleaned well, but disturbed the sensitive areas around the gums to the point where I thought I might need a root canal!  So, if you are older, and/or have sensitive teeth, I suggest you avoid this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Braun Excel 3D for years and I&#x27;ve been using the standard brush heads up until now.  I saw the floss action brush head and read a lot of good reviews.  I completely see why now.  The first thing you need to get use to is the slightly \\&quot;rougher\\&quot; brushing action.  I guess the best way to describe it is - slower and larger vibrations vs. that of fast short ones with the standard head.  It wasn&#x27;t a big deal just something I had to get use to.  I can say though my mouth feels MUCH cleaner.  I&#x27;d agree with the other reviews that 2 minutes with this thing and you honestly feel like you just came from the dentist its amazing.  It&#x27;s also much more effective at brushing your tongue than the standard brush head.  I&#x27;m sold - we&#x27;ll see what the dentist says in a few months :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit 6/13 just went to the dentist and without mentioning anything the hygienist said I appeared to be brushing better.  I told her the only thing I changed was this brush head and she immediately wanted to know all about it.</li>
            <li> I have a mouth full of crowns and bridges (permanent) so this is a great way to clean teeth,  It is easy to use, and does a good job.  Would not live without it.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best brushheads you can get it. Hands-down.  If you have the matching Oral-B electric toothbrush, you have the ultimate dental machine.  These brush heads for the closest thing you can get to flossing your teeth without actually putting falls into your mouth. While these things can take place of regular flossing, they definitely make the job easier.</li>
            <li> Please notice the little hole that exists near the top of the toothbrush head - on the neck of it.  This hole spits out your toothpaste/saliva mix anytime that you happen to maneuver the brush so that this part come out through your lips.  The result is a flow of toothpaste and saliva all over your brand new shirts - this sucks unless you like paying for unnecessary dry cleaning.  The alternative is to lean over the sink so that gravity will pull this flow down into the sink, not down on to yourself.  This is rather uncomfortable after about 2-3 minutes of standing in this awkward position.  The projectile saliva/toothpaste mix is an inevitability with this design - it sucks!  I hate this product and will never buy it again.  What a waste!  Supposedly the best on the market?  What a joke!</li>
            <li> This order was completed to replace a current toothbrush head that was being used. This is a choice product by the user.  It also fits the targeted toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Awesome; good quality; item is and works as described.  Would purchase these again.  A+++++++ experience overall; have no complaints.  Happy camper.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.  I think it&#x27;s worth getting the name brand in this case based on reviews I read of very disappointing knock-offs.</li>
            <li> the replacement is larger than the original, and as a result it pounds against my teeth.</li>
            <li> Quality product at a great price.  Arrived in a very timely manner!</li>
            <li> Best I have tried. I usually use the regular heads and ordered these on sale and with a coupon by mistake. I was a little excited by the price and missed the flossing bit. Decided to give them a try since I am terrible about flossing. They work great but took a few days for the guns to adjust. These are now my go-to brush head now.</li>
            <li> These are a great all-round general purpose brush head.</li>
            <li> These are excellent brushes.  They clean my teeth very thoroughly.  My teeth feel better cleaned than with any other brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> quality product and very effective</li>
            <li> I actually wanted the professional &#x27;precision clean&#x27; type which was not available on the website which was a shame.  These have some plastic bristles that I find rather painful &amp; you must be aware of this before deciding if you want this type of brush!&lt;br /&gt;they probably last longer!  it&#x27;s such a personal choice!</li>
            <li> Wonderful Cleaner for my teeth. I will do anything to keep my teeth in my head. So just brush away. Keep my teeth until I am in the grave</li>
            <li> The Oral-B toothbrush is the winner hands down. The floss action heads are incredible. My teeth feel super clean after every brushing. I highly recommend. My whole family has one.</li>
            <li> It is a good Choice and good price. This is an ideal option for who need teeth brushes for his family members.</li>
            <li> The whole family uses these - these are the best.  Looking for a sensitive version for my youngest daughter. Have has fewer dental problems after we switched from manual toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> This brush makes my teeth feel very clean. It has made a difference in my dental check up.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this brush to anybody but especially to people with periodontal issues.</li>
            <li> This is one of only 2 places that this model can be found. Plus they were very reasonably priced. no</li>
            <li> this is the replacement heads for my oral b.  i bought it so i&#x27;ll have a toothbrush for my wife.  so you don&#x27;t have to buy 2 oral b.  just buy extra brush to save money.</li>
            <li> Genuine, excellent product. I bought two packages on sale.  I wish I should have bought more as the price has increased.</li>
            <li> I have used Oral-B professional tooth brush for a while.  It&#x27;s time to replace some old heads. Right after I ordered this product at Amazon, I found a better deal at Costco; that is why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> Works better than the generic ones that I picked up from Target. You get what you pay for but little bits of plastic shouldn&#x27;t cost this much.</li>
            <li> I ordered the extra brushes along with a new toothbrush.  I received the toothbrush, but not the extra brushes.  And they are outrageous expensive.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  Head a little bigger than Oral-B&#x27;s standard head, but I like the size.  Getting three heads at a time means I will probably replace the head as scheduled and not continue to use it after it has mostly worn out.  More expensive than aftermarket heads.</li>
            <li> So far I have no complaints about this style head.  They seem to wear well and do a good job.  When I manually floss there is no more blood when I spit.  My teeth feel clean and it is easy to reach trouble spots in my mouth.  I haven&#x27;t been back for a check up since I started with this style toothbrush.  That will be the real report.</li>
            <li> My gums have thanked me on several occasions because I have purchased these.  Better then the standard bristle types.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. Every gets stuck between my teeth. This brush head is excellent because it really loosens up and removes between teeth particles.</li>
            <li> I have been using these toothbrush heads for about 3.5 years. Since I made the switch, I am in and out of a dentist appointment in about 25 minutes. They never have to scrape and I always get told how clean my teeth are! They are the best and can completely benefit your oral health!</li>
            <li> I have bought the knock-off versions of these - who hasn&#x27;t? The price of the knock-offs is so much cheaper...BUT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The knock-offs fall apart quickly. The little floss tabs are the first to go - usually in less than a week I am spitting out bits, Then you start losing bristles. Within the month, you are reaching for a new head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the genuine Oral-B, mine are still completely intact and still plenty of life left on the indicator bristles after more than 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned my lesson the hard way and will only order the genuine Oral-B from now on. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Bristles were a bit harder than I expected but it&#x27;s all right after I got used to it (I suppose I used the soft ones the last time I ordered). Fits my toothbrush perfectly. Not really much else to say about brush heads lol</li>
            <li> I have been using thee heads for over 2 years, and was pleased to find them available through Amazon. I find my teeth are much cleaner than with a traditional tooth brush.  I also only use a dab of toothpaste, so it really lasts a long time.  My hygienist consistently compliments me on having the cleanest teeth she&#x27;s seen in awhile.  I do additionally floss, because I have tight teeth and the bristles of this brush can&#x27;t reach between them.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  They fit my bulrush perfectly and i am pleased with the quality of the brush geads.  Get s</li>
            <li> I tried another Braun head recently and it ended up feeling a bit big in my mouth. This resulted in a lot messier brushing experience so I have gone back to the original.</li>
            <li> They are the Oral-B Floss Action brush heads. Exactly what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No funny business. No knock offs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Floss Action works well for the back teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that any off-brand of the toothbrush heads just aren&#x27;t as good; either too soft, or don&#x27;t fit properly.  These are great, they fit, they work and aren&#x27;t too soft..</li>
            <li> These are horrible. Expensive and the plastic under the bristles hits my teeth. Oral-B needs to rethink this design. I&#x27;d rather have the original kind.</li>
            <li> Fit my brush perfectly, snapped on with no problem. It does work like it was advertised. Buy this, you won&#x27;t be dissapointed</li>
            <li> We really like the deep clean that these give. They come in different colored bands so you know which one is yours. They are great!</li>
            <li> Feels a lot more substantial than the std brush heads. I have bought store brand products before, but this leaves teeth feeling much cleaner.</li>
            <li> These brushes fit my Braun electric toothbrush perfectly. I can never find these in the stores. I am thankful these are available on line. Now if I could just find the thin brush tip heads just as easily. They are out there, just have to search a little harder.</li>
            <li> these heads dont beat the benefits of flossing, but if you&#x27;re too slothful to EVER floss they go a long way toward making up for it</li>
            <li> My favorite brush! A MUST HAVE for anyone who wants teeth which are &#x27;dentist clean.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Oral B has come out with so many brush heads, it is hard to know what to buy anymore.  But these seem to give me a deeper clean than the standard oral B brush heads that come with the unit. Came fast and free with Prime.  Will buy again from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Well it may be just me, but these floss-like thingies are way too thick to get between my teeth. I mean the brush head still functions well, but for people with tight teeth these structure are, in my opinion, useless. Gonna get a normal brush head next time.</li>
            <li> The knock offs, or generic, don&#x27;t even work. These are the only ones the actually work and they do a great job..</li>
            <li> These brush heads really do have a flossing action, but I would not forego using floss.  I like the Oral B toothbrush and brush heads very much.  I will definitely reorder the floss action brushes.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for my needs. I would buy more if my needs require it.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the ones that are &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; this brand b/c they are bit cheaper. Now, that I&#x27;ve switched back to the &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; brand I realize the bristles are such better quality, and at varying heights - they really get in-between each tooth. There seem be some extra scrubbing bristles as well (yellow) - I am not sure what they do but I do think (having used both kinds) that this brush reaches every part of the tooth better.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re simply great. We&#x27;ve been using these for several years; and, if you brush in the morning and before you go to bed and most importantly, FLOSS, that will avoid most dental problems. We just went to the dentist and our teeth and gums were very clean. The dental hygentist said we can come back in a year for the next check up.</li>
            <li> Such a great price for overpriced replacement brush heads, I could not pass this up. Love the product, came quickly.</li>
            <li> These are great your teeth feel amazing after brushing with these&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if the price was a little less</li>
            <li> i love these brush heads!</li>
            <li> Compared to the Oral-B Pro White brush heads:&lt;br /&gt;The Pro White heads pretty much have this circular rubber piece in the middle (I assume trying to imitate the polish brush used by the dental hygienist) but it feels hard on my teeth even when I am brushing softly so as not to trigger the pressure alert on my electric toothbrush. The Pro White heads feel like I&#x27;m trying to scrape my teeth clean, not polish them. I will choose the Floss Action heads every time because they get into the crevices quite nicely and distribute the toothpaste rather evenly (the Pro White heads would fling all of the toothpaste off before I finished brushing a quarter of my mouth). The Floss Action heads are effective and comfortable, even when my teeth are feeling sensitive. They also brush the gums nicely. These leave my mouth feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I needed more and they get the job done.  The price was a good for a 3 pack</li>
            <li> Since someone gave me the OralB electric toothbrush, I cannot go back to the manual toothbrush. These brush heads will get your teeth significantly cleaner than not only a manual toothbrush but also other electric tooth brush heads. These have numerous little brush heads in varying sizes and density. They really work well.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat cautious in buying these given a number of reviews claiming they received knock-offs. The ones I received are definitely the real deal. They work exactly as expected, and hold up just like the originals.</li>
            <li> The brush heads I received were definitely genuine Oral B heads.  They work great &amp; I saved a little $$$S</li>
            <li> Flossing action yellow tabs give you a cleaner gum stimulated feeling! They get in between teeth and under the gumline. Definitely made a difference at my next check up with the dentist.</li>
            <li> I don&#x60;t think you will like my review. I have not been happy with these brushes at all-- they are too hard.</li>
            <li> My dentist noticed a significant change in my check up since I&#x27;ve been using this replacement head. The auto fill every three months helps me remember to switch out replacement heads. My kids also use this product with great success.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually received this order yet, but this brush head is what came on my toothbrush and it&#x27;s awesome. I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t own an electric toothbrush my entire life until now--it would&#x27;ve paid for itself a hundred times over. These brush heads are very thorough, but gentle. Now I&#x27;m addicted. I even carry this toothbrush with me when I travel now--my teeth just don&#x27;t feel clean with a regular toothbrush anymore. My dentist/hygienist are going to be thrilled at my next visit. As far as the refills, this price was much better than anything I saw at retail.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothbrush for several years, and along with daily flossing and Waterpix, I hardly have any tarter build up at my semiannual teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li> Brush heads just like the ones that came with the brush.  What else can I say?  I am perfectly satisfied.</li>
            <li> This oral B replacement heads are a bit rough when you first start using them. That is my only complaint. Just need to not push too hard on the toothbrush to avoid irritation. The product is great and here on amazon it is at a great price. At certain times you might also be able to grab it at a discounted price which will definitely make it worth it. I got them around $15 for the 3 which was a great price.</li>
            <li> Items are OEM replacements.  Guaranteed to fit if you have selected the appropriate brushes for the motor unit you have.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! It makes me teeth clean and digs in deep to make my gums looks well. However, the product tends to wear down quickly.</li>
            <li> Too expensive- but what can I say.  We purchased the toothbrush and need replacement heads.  For an item that needs to be replaced quite frequently they should be less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve compared this with Prowhite and Sensetive models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good if you don&#x27;t want to whiten your teeth and just want to improve your cleaning experience after your old common teethbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say anything bad about it, but i still prefer Prowhite ones.</li>
            <li> I use this daily since I bought the Pro Health Oral B Tooth Brush (it is run on 2 AA batteries) and it really does the job. My teeth is definitely 100 percent cleaner after I use it than with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. Do a great job. Almost don&#x27;t have to floss. If you are buying the toothbrush itself, there is a coupon tho so don&#x27;t buy these with the brush itself.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase! Item was exactly as advertised. I would be happy to recommend this item!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed my Oral B electric toothbrush and found it easy and inexpensive to order refills from Amazon with the free shipping since I was ordering other items at the same time.  At first I thought the price was quite high for the refill, but that is because I did not realize I got 3 refills in the package.  They came quickly and in great comdition, as is typical of Amazon purchases.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  They are toothbrushes.  They fit the handle I own.  They work as specified.  The real important thing is the significant money one saves doing the automatic delivery.  The brushes are supposed to be replaced every three months, Amazon sends a set, tax and shipping free and at an approximately $7.00 discount over the local CVS.</li>
            <li> I bought this product so I can have extra refills for the new Oral B 9400 Power Toothbrush I bought. They fit well in the storage compartment and are protected by a lid that swings open. According to the instructions you are supposed to replace the brush head every six months.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I was looking for.I am very pleased and if the need arises in the future I look forward to making further purchases.Cindy Douglass</li>
            <li> Cleans great! After using, it feels like you just walked out of your dentist office.</li>
            <li> I have used a good number of brush heads.  These are by far the best.  They cover a good amount of surface area and are fairly firm.  First time I used them, my gums were a little sore from the floss action.....which is a good thing.  Plan to buy again and again, especially with the subscribe and save offer.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit less than you can buy at Walmart for. No sales tax</li>
            <li> this is an excellent toothbrush. I come from a long line of dental professionals. the hubs is a dentist &amp; am a registered dental hygienist &amp; this is what we are currently using in our home. great replacement heads!!    (we also like the Sonicare Elite &amp; the Braun OralB Sonic Complete.)</li>
            <li> I have been using the Braun Oral B rechargable toothbrushes for over 24 years now, today was the first time I tried the floss action brush head and it really does work better than the regular Oral B replacement brush heads. Using the slightly larger brush on the floss action takes a little bit of getting used to, but my teeth felt cleaner right after brushing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still floss after brushing, and I noticed that there was alot less plaque between my teeth and the floss action brush also did a better job of cleaning the hard to reach spots on the inside surface of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Excellent tooth-by-tooth cleasning and polishing provided.  Wonderful stimulation of gums on both sides of teeth.</li>
            <li> Great deal!  better than warehouse price.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I find that the Oral-B replacement brush heads work better than the generic replacement brush heads that I have been able to buy. They cost more but they work well.  I have had others that don&#x27;t fit well or do not vibrate well or wear down more quickly. They were less expensive but only in price not in quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an Oral -B tooth brush for years. The spin brushes are not cheap but my dentist always comment on how good my oral hygiene is.</li>
            <li> My hubby and I love this. After we brush our teeth, we feels much cleaner than Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> great price for these replacement brushes</li>
            <li> Have had this on S&amp;Save for years - I don&#x27;t even know what these are in the store. Having these on hand helps with maintaining dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrush heads!</li>
            <li> Bristles are falling out after 5 uses. They keek coming out while brushing. Cheap made.</li>
            <li> I got an extra set of these when my BF moved in and brought home his Oral-B Triumph. I&#x27;ve never in my life used an electric toothbrush but boy does it work well! I love little yellow bristles, they really work wonders with my braces, that my regular rite aid toothbrush never seemed to get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say though that if you have braces, the brush wears down pretty quick though. The yellow bristles also sometimes got caught in the brace itself which then led to the bristle falling off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m happy with these replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I really like these brush heads. I feel like they are getting my teeth cleaner than the standard spin brush head.</li>
            <li> These worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a replacement head for the standard Precision Clean heads that come with many Oral-B toothbrushes.  I was hoping for an even better clean than these standard heads because they certainly look more significant and if I can get close to flossing performance with this type of brush head I am going to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, these brush heads are no substitute for flossing for me.  They seem to clean as well as the other heads but no better in my opinion.  So instead of cleaning better than the regular heads, these are larger and harder to maneuver around your teeth and gums.  All things being equal I will just get the Precision Clean heads and be done next time.  You may find these work better for you, but I would not be surprised if they don&#x27;t.  I use a Waterpik and sometimes dental floss after the Oral-B toothbrush and there has been no noticeable difference in what&#x27;s leftover for these things to remove than there was with the Precision Clean head.  If you get one or the other type on sale go for it, but don&#x27;t pay more for these and I don&#x27;t see a need to go out of your way to have this type and the increased brush size that comes with it.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife&#x27;s toothbrush, and I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints.</li>
            <li> this is something you have to order if you have this toothbrush. I think these brushes are a bit more thorough in the brushing process.</li>
            <li> Floss Action heads are the best! After many years of getting the head shake from the dentist, I randomly swapped to electric toothbrush and these floss action heads. Just by using this my teeth are a lot more clean and healthy. I dont&#x27; know if I&#x27;ll ever use anything else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW: This is the real product, and a good price.</li>
            <li> Brushes work well but it is ludicrous to spend more than $100 on the Oral B professional 5000, and find that it arrives with only a single brush, and your first action after purchase has to be to get more brushes so that your wife can use it too. The device contains storage for 4 brushes and is clearly intended for use by multiple users.</li>
            <li> Have several Braun electric tooth brushes and my son and daughter prefer the floss action heads the best. Not bad 3 heads for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> These are great toothbrush heads. My teeth always feel very clean after using these.</li>
            <li> Finally replaced my brush head after about a year.  Should have done it sooner b/c I can really feel the difference in the feel of the head itself.  It does the job and does it well.</li>
            <li> They work very well though I do think that the brushes that are included with the toothbrush last longer than the replacements.</li>
            <li> I got them by accident (a friend sent them to my address for her and then forgot to tell me). They&#x27;re way better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> These are the brush heads to get - I&#x27;ve tried the other varieties of Oral-B brush heads, but these floss action ones leave your teeth with that smooth/slick clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I really like these heads. After brushing I feel like I get a very thorough cleaning. I highly recommend  giving them a try. If this review was helpful please comment.</li>
            <li> Just the best period. Everyone should have this cleaning twice a day. Should have started using the Oral-B dental cleaning program 50 years ago.</li>
            <li> These were like the fourth heads I tried with  my electric toothbrush. Despite others claiming they fit, they most definitely did not. These were easy--pry off the old one, pop on the new one, bam. Done. Works great. Still have used only one and I&#x27;ve had them  a few months. Like that it comes in a three pack so I have back ups on hand.</li>
            <li> I think this brush head works better than the older simple heads I have been using. My gums and teeth appear to be in better shape. Of course it fits my old Oral-B Braun toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my Oral-B electric toothbrush, and the floss action brushes really do loosen what might be stuck between your teeth.  I would not go back to a traditional toothbrush for anything.  My teeth feel clean for the first time ever with my Oral-B.</li>
            <li> My dentist loves this product. Have had this Oral-B for 3 years and only had one cavity. That&#x27;s why we keep reordering the refills.</li>
            <li> Great price, 2-day delivery.  What more could you ask for?  I&#x27;ll use them again.</li>
            <li> These flossers was combined with the oral-b toothbrush set.  The ad said to purchas all three sets for a good price.  I opened the flossers to discover it did not fit my oral-b.  Then I was advised to return the product only if it was unopened.  I gave up after that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of Oral B&#x27;s (have 2 different units) and these brush heads are better than the round heads unless you have a very tiny mouth, I bet Oral B will come out with a kids sized version soon.  Except for that, these are the BEST...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider buying the larger 6 +1 pkg. as it will save you a few bucks and also include another \\&quot;tip head\\&quot; at no increase in price!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000X6DDM8 Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (6 ct), plus 1 Interspace Power Tip Refill]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s.  I found that Costco has the 6 + 1 pkg (6 of these and 1 different tip head) for a lower price (without any shipping required) than listed on Amazon (today anyway)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy \\&quot;brushing\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> These brush heads are my favorite so far.   They are slightly bigger than some heads- and they are rough!</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes are sturdy, strong, and long lasting. They cost more than the &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; cheaper brushes, but they&#x27;re worth the money.</li>
            <li> These heads are great and in my opinion do a better job that the standard Oral B brushhead. Not much more to say about it. Worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 5000 Professional series toothbrush which I love and they work great. They keep my teeth feeling great and get all the particles out of them. Good deal, but they have I think better prices at Costco for these though if you want to get a huge supply, just saying.</li>
            <li> As the son of a dentist,I never listened to him. Now many decades later, when i must pay for all the work. I believe! I was using the other major device. There is no comparison. Oral B is just better. It is easier to use and more effective. It is easier to maintain with less fungal growth on the heads and handle. As a retired surgeon I know how important that is. This is the one!</li>
            <li> The floss action brush heads are advertised as being sold with the Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush; however, these brush heads DO NOT fit that particular toothbrush. It also does not list which toothbrushes it is actually made for on the order page. Misleading.</li>
            <li> I have both Oral B Vitality Dual Clean &amp; Oral B Vitality Sonic. The Sonic &amp; Dual Clean Vitality brush heads DO get in between teeth. They are like using a flat head manual toothbrush THAT DO CLEAN your teeth well.    THE FLOSS ACTION IS POINTLESS, since it WON&#x27;T get in between your teeth.     The top of the brush head sticks out/ too long in depth. It hits our teeth when brushing in an average way; be prepared to open wide to avoid the tooth hitting. DON&#x27;T forget to floss separately.</li>
            <li> These brush heads work well to get your teeth feeling very clean.  My Braun/Oral B electric toothbrush is getting old now so I am glad to still be able to buy new heads for it.  This 3 pack refill was cheaper on Amazon than if I bought a 6 pack from Costco.</li>
            <li> These brush heads were exactly as indicated.  They were new, in perfect condition, and a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly no worrying if it&#x27;s going to fit or not. Did the job will purchase again and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> These brushes really clean much more than the original brushes that came with my toothbrush.  Kind of strange when you first use it but after a few uses, really great.  I can&#x27;t praise a toothbrush much but these heads are different, in a good way</li>
            <li> Easy way to keep refills on hand, auto buy.  Good brushes</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads! 100 times better than the default brush I got with mine.</li>
            <li> Beats the hell out of brushing manually - I use them for 4 months, so the three-pack lasts a year.</li>
            <li> We ordered a few of these for the family, they came on time and sealed like they should be. They work great! These are our favorite of the brush heads, really gets into the grooves and makes out teeth feel clean. Our dentist and hygienist has noticed a difference in our mouth health. We like the fact that there are different color markers for the bottoms of the heads to tell the difference in whose is whose. They last as long as they should for sure! We would definitely recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I buy these for our electric tooth brush often. This is a very good deal.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much aboout dislodging stuff between teeth, and shape makes it somewhat hard to navigate around irregular teeth.  When these are used up I&#x27;m going back to standard ones.</li>
            <li> Great Brushes!!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent Sellar!</li>
            <li> The web site _images_ show both a 3 head and a 4 head package. What I received was the 3 head pack that was illustrated, not the 4 head package that was described. Make sure to check what you receive before opening your package of heads to use them.</li>
            <li> This 3 pack was a lot more pricier than the 5 pack I had purchased a year ago. The price is a very high for reppalcement brush heads. Wish the manufacturer would reduce the price. Or else I am switching back to the old-fashioned hand powered tooth-brushes</li>
            <li> OEM brushes, work as expected. Good price from amazon. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product. The little piece in the middle acts and feels like what they use at the dentist to polish your teeth during cleanings.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended these floss action heads and we have used them exclusively every since.</li>
            <li> these things saved my gums from advancing periodontitis. Ok, frankly it is probably more having to do with the fact that i started brushing more, started brushing for 2 minutes with an electric vs. 30 seconds with a handheld, started a vigorous prescription mouthwash treatment, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But still, I really like these toothbrush heads. I also had a dual action head, and generally prefer this one, though the other one is good once in a while as well, as it is a fuller head and scrubs slightly differently.</li>
            <li> Worked as promised! Was not an off brand. High quality. Will be back for more definitely.  Buy, buy, buy, buy!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say?  It&#x27;s a toothbrush -- it fits the hand unit and does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> These are good replacement brush heads (I have an Oral-B Healthy Clean Precision 1000).  They are more oval shaped than the brush head that came with my tooth brush, but that&#x27;s not noticeable in my mouth.  The only think that I don&#x27;t like about them is that the plastic arms (which allows them to be marketed as &#x27;floss action&#x27;, I assume) are more rigid than I&#x27;d like for them to be.  When I turn the brush to the side they sometimes dig into my gums.  It&#x27;s not terribly painful or anything but it&#x27;s noticeable.  I will be purchasing the extra soft heads to try next, after these three need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> braun is great  I lke the choices of brushes&lt;br /&gt;great deal on family pack&lt;br /&gt;I especially  got this one with flossers really help</li>
            <li> No complaints, easy to swap out.  Can go through them quickly, new to order about double the amount.  I would recommend this product to those interested.</li>
            <li> I love the oral-b professional floss action replacement brush heads. I have subscribe and save, so every 6 months I get it in the mail. Perfect timing!</li>
            <li> Great heads! Just what I expected</li>
            <li> These brush heads are so good for getting my teeth clean and at a lot lower price through this seller than anywhere else I have compared prices for them. Fastest shipping and I recommend buying these if you want that clean feeling you get from your dentist cleanings.</li>
            <li> These brush heads really make your teeth and the spaces between feel great.  They get into nooks and crannies that regular brushes do not.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> They did not fit my electric toothbrush. I wasted my money. This had happened twice now. Once at Braun and now at Amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; a toothbrush head, but I like this one, for use with my many-years-old-now Braun/Oral-B electric toothbrush.  Finding the right replacement heads in the drugstore or at Walmart is sometimes hard.  Glad that Amazon carries them.</li>
            <li> I really love having an electric toothbrush, but I hate buying these replacements.  The cost is a little outrageous.  The electric really cuts down on time, and you know that you&#x27;ve done a good job due to the quadrant timer.  I would still recommend them since Oral-B is at the top, but I wish they would lower the price a bit.</li>
            <li> Love this product and works like a charm.  My first time ever to use this &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; brush head and I like it very much!</li>
            <li> See previous answer.  Bristles are falling out much too quickly.  This product used to have a much longer life.  I will now purchase the drug store brand of these brushes which will be considerably more cost effective.</li>
            <li> My favorite replacement brushes for my toothbrush. The price is way better than in stores and Amazon had a discount coupon making the deal even better. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Good Oral B replacement brush heads.  I know the product and must buy it for my toothbrush, so that is a no-brainer, but prices fluctuate all over as does the quantity in the packet.  So shop around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are &amp;#34;No name&amp;#34; copies that are way cheaper.  But I personally find that they do not last any where near as long as the real thing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice a difference between this and the regular head, but I guess that means it&#x27;s no worse.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush was expensive enough, I don&#x27;t know why the replacement heads must cost so much. These worked really well, but I would say look for an off brand that works the same and doesn&#x27;t cost so much!</li>
            <li> I love this particular Brush Head.  My dentist asked if I was using something different because my gums were looking healthier.</li>
            <li> Amazed to find replacement brush for my old Oral-B so easy.</li>
            <li> Best there is for brushing teeth.</li>
            <li> What can I say, they are replacement heads and they work!</li>
            <li> They seem like they don&#x27;t clean as well as the normal head...and they hurt!</li>
            <li> A great price compared to the brick and mortar stores. I don&#x60;t floss as much as I should so the flossing action is a big plus.</li>
            <li> Good quality and price. As advertised.</li>
            <li> You will definitely not get what you paid for.  I&#x27;ve bought these brush heads online before from a different seller and it went perfectly.  However, this seller sent me completely different brushes from what&#x27;s clearly being advertised on the page and in the photos.  It&#x27;s clearly not the same.  The brush heads I received do not have yellow tips which get in between your teeth - this is the feature that sets this brush head apart from others.  What&#x27;s the point of buying an expensive electric toothbrush when you&#x27;re going to use bad brush heads on them? I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The brush head being too big, puts too much pressure on the gums which is not recommended by dentists. The flossaction is a false advertisement.  The four rubber things do not even come close to flossing.  I will go back to the regular heads after using my 3 pack.</li>
            <li> By far, this is the best tooth cleaning system out there...especially when you add these brushes!  After each use, your gums and teeth feel like you&#x27;ve had a professional cleaning.  Do you like the sensation of running your tongue behind your teeth and actually feeling each and everyone?  If so, you will love these heads!  They clean like no other brush/system I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to order these here, the best way to go is the automatic shipment so you&#x27;ll save an additional 15% and receive free shipping!  Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have used this kind of brushheads for years and the first 2 days I used my new  brushheads that I used ordered worked fine. On the third day it feels very strange when I&#x27;m using it, as if it&#x27;s not really brushing my teeth. I came to check if other buyers have this problem, and I saw some have the suspicion that they are fake brushheads. One reviewer suggests to check this picture with my brushheads, and yes, they look different! The \\&quot;Oral B\\&quot; is grey on the ones I just purchased, and the blue part of the brushhead is darker!! I have never got a counterfeit item from Amazon before! I really didn&#x27;t think that I need to be worried about whether the product is fake or not on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Just received these brush heads as replacements for the standard heads and I really like them. Took a couple of brushing to get used to the slightly different feel, (the flossing tips have a different depth and texture), but once I did I felt like my teeth felt slightly cleaner than with with standard heads. Overall, good purchase.</li>
            <li> These did not look, feel or perform very well, bristles felt like they were fraying almost immediately, would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is rip off of the original Oral B brush heads with far fewer filaments in the center. A copy of the original product but not nearly as good. If you have been using these brush heads for awhile as I have (i.e., four years) you will notice your teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean after a brush.  They are an INFERIOR product and should not be sold under the Oral B label.</li>
            <li> This item arrived in a timely manner and I began using it immediately.  I expected less plaque after 3 months of use but my dentist still wants to see me 4 times a year so....</li>
            <li> I ordered four 3 packs of these brushes because they were such a good deal. I received six 2 packs. We have used 6 of the brushes since September 2010 and four were defective. After only a few weeks use, the head of the brush is so loose it pinches the inside of your mouth. The one that I just started using keeps falling off the handle. And none of the brushes have the fading of the blue bristles that indicates when It&#x27;s time to replace. I have never had this problem before and am convinced they&#x27;re counterfeit.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve emailed this company twice and have got no response. I would strongly suggest not buying from this company, particularly not these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I just bought these off of 3rd party seller on amazon and they are definately knock offs. The brushes feel flimsy and i do not feel \\&quot;clean\\&quot; after brushing. I will not purchase these online anymore.</li>
            <li> Buy this filter once a year for our refrigerator....works great, beats hundreds  of bottles of water which is no better.....</li>
            <li> I purchased these twice in the last year.  Sometimes they lasted a while, but like other people have said they felt loose.  Then one by one, they would break, sometimes even while in my mouth.  I honestly thought it was just something wrong with my toothbruth.  I figured it was just a little off and causing damage to the heads.  So this weekend I began to look into buying a new toothbruth when I came across all the articles about the fake brushheads.  Sure enough, the descriptions of the fake merchandise matched what I had.  So I&#x27;ve been using fake heads for a year.  I contacted Amazon and after 30 minutes and having to speak to the manager they refunded only the ones bought directly from Amazon.   They said since I had purchased them so long ago this was a \\&quot;special exception\\&quot; they were making for me.  I don&#x27;t even really care about the money so much as I care about taking responsibility for it.  Amazon should be at least somewhere responsible for the quality of their products and even of the resellers.  Refunding or contacting the reseller is the least they can do in my opinion.  The manager has forwarded my story to the inventory department and if I receive a call back I will update here.  Thanks everyone.    Update: I haven&#x27;t heard yet from Amazon, but I called Oral B.  They took this much more seriously.  At Amazon I got the feeling they thought I was scamming them, but Oral B took all my information, refunded me, and is looking into it.  Like I said I didn&#x27;t really care about the money, but rather that I&#x27;ve been using fake brushheads for a year and the fact that it still seems like Amazon is selling them.  Who knows if I was damaging my teeth....</li>
            <li> does wonders for my gum!</li>
            <li> It is what it sells for. A bit expensive for a plastic consumable, wish it was cheaper but I subscribed for this racket myself.</li>
            <li> The brush heads broke after two weeks of use and pinched my husband&#x27;s lip.  I returned the unopened brushes and never received a refund.  DO NOT order from Direct Super Center.</li>
            <li> Good brush heads. They fit multiple Oral-B&#x27;s well and seem to clean our teeth better than the normal brush heads. I&#x27;m happy to buy them in multiples but wish they were not quite as expensive. I&#x27;m giving them a 4 rather than 5 due to the high price.</li>
            <li> Have upgraded my Oral-B Professional system and purchased for grandkids. Totally sold on effectiveness of the system.  I love how the small brushed allow you to manicure each tooth.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t fault these replacement heads they work very well indeed, the design has chaged from the original and this has in my opinion made them much better at cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li> These are the same replacement heads that are on my new Oral B toothbrush. Because I just got my toothbrush, I haven&#x27;t opened the package yet. Buying 3 along with the new brush means I am set for a year. They are excellent.</li>
            <li> Good product at a decent price.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day, and will reorder.</li>
            <li> I purchased these along with the Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep + Smart Guide Triaction 5000 Rechargeable Toothbrush. This was the best price compared to other on-line and in-store prices. I bought the toothbrush and these replacement brush heads because mY dental hygienist recommended it. I just had my first checkup since I started wearing braces about 7 months ago and my dental hygienist said I needed to floss and brush more. I&#x27;ve never had a problem before so I was a bit frustrated bust more concerned because I have been flossing and brushing more apparently to no avail. Braces are obviously more of a challenge than I thought. So I decided to try an electronic toothbrush and thought since flossing is the really a challenge with braces, I buy the these floss action brush heads.  So far, so good. Definitely noticed a difference after brushing. Easy to change the heads too. The product itself seems to be working as described.</li>
            <li> Use these for my Oral-B tooth brush.  They fit great and can be used for guests if they forgot their tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I tried the imitation brush heads as these always seemed so expensive. They are well worth the price. I love them and my daughter loves them. It feels like you just got your teeth cleaned at the dentist. I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Having braces, getting a good clean is difficult with just a regular toothbrush. The oral-b brushes get in between places that a normal brush would miss. They don&#x27;t last as long when brushing with braces, but I don&#x27;t mind replacing the brush head every month or so to get that pretty smile.</li>
            <li> This are great and for the price.  I bought them a year ago and my dentist saw alot of improvement.  It just makes it so easy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product but what I received was actually a different type of toothbrush head.  The one I received fits my toothbrush just fine, so it turned out to not be a problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on these brushes. They are larger which was weird at first but I really appreciate that they massage my gums while keeping me from brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Heads leave my teeth so clean i always feel like i just came back from the dentist.  I could never go back to a manual tooth brush knowing how much cleaner my teeth get with these.</li>
            <li> Ian. Dry satisfied by my purchases.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this toothbrush is that daily use of it shortens the time in the dentist chair.  I replace the brush heads once a month.</li>
            <li> These are very cool, and a little hard on my gums, but I do feel the floss action is effective, though not as effective as actually flossing.</li>
            <li> Been using these for years, I have not been dissapointed, no cavities.</li>
            <li> Excellent deal! You can&#x27;t buy them at the store for this price.</li>
            <li> have been using for over a year works great no problems.  is easier and better than just brushing myself.</li>
            <li> Very firm brush head. I can&#x27;t seem to get used to them. I went back to the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; brush heads.</li>
            <li> Used to be able to get these for about $3/head. Now they are around $7/head. Pretty lame Oral B. But unfortunately electric brushes are much more effective than the traditional way to clean your teeth...so I pay the price!</li>
            <li> Love This head the take away the all the plaque from your teeth I used it along with the spin brush by oral b ... Its a must have for the mouth ...</li>
            <li> Great - last longer than the regular ones so well worth the money</li>
            <li> your ad showed 4 brushes in the order. only 3 brushes was contained in the package I received.</li>
            <li> I tried the cheap off brand ones and they were horrible.  These are much better.</li>
            <li> am very happy with product</li>
            <li> Exactly what was needed. Thank you</li>
            <li> I like my Oral B electric toothbrush and the Floss Action Replacement Head works well for me.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are very pricey in the store, so I&#x27;ve been looking for alternatives.  First I purchased the generic brushes and was not satified (the bristles came out on one, the others started out stiff and didn&#x27;t last as long).  There is no comparison between the generic and the name brand so I&#x27;m glad they are priced better here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I got my adult bracez on a couple years ago and this toothbrush is all I need. My electric toothbrush. And that&#x27;s it and that&#x27;s the only thing I need, is this. I don&#x27;t need anything else. Well, the ashtray. And the paddle game. The toothbrush, ashtray, and the paddle game and that&#x27;s all I need. And the remote control. The toothbrush, ashtray, the paddle game, and the remote control, and that&#x27;s all I need. And the matches. The toothbrush, ashtray, and the matches, and the remote control and the paddle ball. And the lamp. The toothbrush, ashtray, the paddle game and the remote control and the lamp and that&#x27;s all I need. And that&#x27;s really all I need. I don&#x27;t need one other thing, not one. And the chair. The toothbrush, paddle game, and the chair, and the remote control, and the matches, for sure. And a magazine. And that&#x27;s all I need. The toothbrush, ashtray, the remote control, the paddle game, the magazine and the chair...</li>
            <li> What can you say about Oral B except they clean the teeth of America! My wife loves her Brush and these are waiting in the wings.</li>
            <li> this Brush heads are great, after brushing it literally gives feeling of super clean teeth and yes floss action do happens since before buying I was not 100% sure whether it will but now i am happy.</li>
            <li> Came fast &amp; saved a trip to town.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews regarding these heads not being the originals. I have ordered twice from here and both times I received the original.&lt;br /&gt;Couple of years ago these tooth brush heads were harder, but now they are a little bit softer and the flossing parts are a little loose. But overall it is good. I will order again.</li>
            <li> Good replacement brushes for my old Oral-B. I have them on regular shipments so I will replace them regularly rather than run out and wait until I drive over to the big box store, that way I always have a new brush.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushheads by a great brand - Oral-B!</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-sixties, and I want to continue to keep all my teeth (except for the two wisdom teeth extracted in my youth).  The best way for that to happen is to prevent both tooth decay and gum disease.  Although genetically speaking some people are prone to have ‘weak teeth’, extensive damage can be prevented by proper dental hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B Floss Action Brush Head helps to remove a substantial amount of plaque, which is the bacterium that attacks our teeth and gums.  I use the Oral-B Floss Action Brush in conjunction with flossing.  After brushing with the Floss Action Brush Head, I spend less time flossing since the brush head removes a substantial amount of plaque, and the result is less time in the dentist chair, all my teeth intact, and no periodontitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mouth is the gateway to the body and the bacterium that builds up on teeth makes the gums prone to infection.  Then the immune system moves in to attack the infection and the gums become inflamed.  Over time, inflammation and the chemicals it releases eat away at the gums and bone structure that hold teeth in place.  The result is severe gum disease, known as periodontitis and this inflammation can cause problems in the rest of the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B Floss Action Brush has a spinning and oscillating movement that helps to remove the excess plaque between teeth and at the gum line.  Although this is NOT a substitute for flossing, it will deliver much cleaner teeth and gums than a regular brushing.  Each Oral-B Floss action brush should last between 3 – 4 months, when the bristle colors start to fade and the bristles start to spread the brush is worn out and it is no longer effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So whether one is a non-flosser, an occasional flosser, or one who flosses regularly, if you own an electric rechargeable toothbrush that is compatible with the Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush, then I recommend this addition for both better mouth hygiene and your own internal body health.and your own internal body health.</li>
            <li> Ordered these because I was out of brush heads for my oral B.  These were reasonably priced and worked great.</li>
            <li> Product as described fast shipment</li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth looking and feeling clean. Great fit on my Oral-B electric toothbrush. Durable so far. Bristles are neither too soft nor too stiff.</li>
            <li> Item arrived and fit as it should. No need to return. Works just as I believed it would!! Would buy again in a minute.</li>
            <li> Awesome for the gums, you will need standard brush as well.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both use these Oral-B floss action brush heads. We use them with the Oral-B 3000. They fit really well on the brush base and they stay clean and clean my teeth and gums well. They lost a good amount of time. I don&#x27;t normally change them out every three months, I usually wait about 4 to 5 months. They hold up well and even when I toss them they still look like they&#x27;re in good shape. Overall, this will be the only brush head I use for the future.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this replacement Oral-B Floss Action Replacement Brush Head is the real thing, and not a fake.  I know that I, as had many of the other reviewers, received fake replacement brush heads a few years ago.  When I ordered this one, I ordered directly from Amazon and did not look for generic or cheaper prices.  I checked my past orders on Amazon and ordered the same replacement brush head currently on my toothbrush so I&#x27;m pretty confident that this is the real one.</li>
            <li> As heads go for Oral B, I think they are the best as they have good strong brush action.  My original brush head seemed like they had harder bristles, which I personally like.  But Very good overall.  As a perk Im gonna keep my old brush head for cleaning my jewelry.</li>
            <li> Love these brush heads.  Would not give this back, I love the toohbrush and these are the best brush heads I have found.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are very good at removing plaque in hard to reach places. They work better than the other heads.</li>
            <li> The packing it came it was good. The product was well protected. I was using the standard brush that came with my professional care pack, but wanted to give the floss action a try. I am pretty satisfied with the product, though cant feel a huge difference between the standard brush that it came with and the floss action.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how the other reviewers got a sub-standard (read fake) product, but I made pretty sure that this was a genuine Oral B replacement.</li>
            <li> These are the real Oral-B brushes.  Be careful, there&#x27;s a lot of fake crap out there.  I don&#x27;t need to put anymore about this item, it&#x27;s given for anyone that&#x27;s ever used the brush head.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are great! I love them... I plan on always ordering them since they do a great job.</li>
            <li> This product is a cheap knock-off - not worth the money. The bristles are too stiff and the whole assembly doesn&#x27;t even snap in place as it should. Frequently, the brush head would slip off the top of the main unit and remain in my mouth. Approx. two month after this purchase, I gave up and went to the local Wal-Mart to buy the real thing (made in Germany) for $10 more.</li>
            <li> I have been using these Floss Action brushheads for a couple of years and really like the way that they clean my teeth.  Using them has greatly improved my check-ups at the dentist and I find that they are easy to manuever and aren&#x27;t rough on my teeth/gums.      I was glad to find refills available inexpensively on Amazon and I received it within a couple of days.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to get the floss type Oral Brush head refill without being forced to additionally buy the standard brush heads. So thanks for giving me this choice, and at a good price.</li>
            <li> my order was filled with no problems and will reorder again probably; did not particularly like the type brush I got but wanted to try it.  Works great but will go back to what I was using as it is a little stiff and my gums need something softer but someone looking for firmer brush will probably like it.</li>
            <li> Simple. They&#x27;re fake. A simple google search reveals how to distinguish between real and fake brush heads.  The product matches exactly with the description of the fake brushes.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrush heads--they work like magic! I don&#x27;t want to use anything else. Highly recommend. The 3 pack is a great value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands....no substitute.  They fit the brush properly and clean better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried.  Don&#x27;t bother with anything else.</li>
            <li> The Floss Action is my fave of all the brush heads. It is comfortable and get&#x27;s the job done.  Make sure you floss normally though - it is not a substitute, just as they have indicated.</li>
            <li> These work great :) They make me smile. Sometimes at work I drive back home just to say hi to my electric tooth brush. I love these</li>
            <li> Oral B is al that needs to be said.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for 3 years, totally in love with this, small but smart, it is doing a great job cleaning every single tooth.</li>
            <li> really like this cleaning head, and it performed better than the standard cleaning head,  but I think it is really expensive.</li>
            <li> I debated whether to go for these larger brush heads for my beloved Oral B toothrush or to once again purchase the smaller more standard size.  I decided to try these, knowing they would not take the place of flossing, but I like the idea of a larger head.  Well, I&#x27;ve ended up purchasing these genuine Oral-B manufactured brushes and I alternate with the others.  This way, I have the best of both worlds and with my flosser, and floss tape, my teeth and gums are extremely healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little paddle brushes in these heads really gets between the teeth and I like the feel as I move it around in my mouth.  At night, the smaller head is easier to maneuver when I am tired.  There are several styles available and each has its benefits.  My only advice is to go for the Oral-B brush heads and avoid the generics which do not even hold up for very long.</li>
            <li> I got these additional heads because they got good reviews and they work well. I like them a lot as they seem to get between your teeth. It does not replace flossing, not by a long shot, but this is better than the standard brush that comes with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> love this package of 3</li>
            <li> The moment I put this head on my Braun toothbrush I had the feeling there was more drag and I expected less battery life. The battery is dealing with a larger head (more friction) and a noticeably heavier head.  I went from 6 days on a charge to 3 days.  3 days is the new norm. That&#x27;s quite a bit more drag and a stiff penalty to pay for potentially improved cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some have pointed out, the head is larger.  It is noticeable and you will need to decide if you like the lost agility and ability to navigate teeth better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In-so-far as the cleaning goes, I could not detect any difference.  After using the head for 3 to 4 weeks I had to go to the dentist on another matter. I mentioned to him I had switched brush heads and had mixed feelings about the larger head. His view was to go back to the older head due to it&#x27;s smaller size. The smaller head gets into areas a larger head cannot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to the traditional head.</li>
            <li> I know other reviewers posted they weren&#x27;t sure if this was the legitimate Oral B brand, but to me it seems like the real deal.</li>
            <li> good product and fast service.</li>
            <li> Great product, arrived just as described.  Cheaper price than in store.  Will definitely order again next time I need them.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Oral B electric toothbrush for many years now, but getting the new heads were always expensive, and not always easy to find for my model. This product does the job so well, that I think my Dentist is a little perplexed, as I \\&quot;have less tarter, than most women my age\\&quot;. It&#x27;s funny, she is always pushing another brand. If this brand is doing so well, why would I switch! I love the auto ship option that I now have with Amazon!</li>
            <li> My whole family switched to Oral B power toothbrushes about a year ago. We are very happy we did.  We have bought replacement heads through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program. Both times we have received genuine heads, as far as I can tell. The first set has lasted more than 3 months with no problems and the heads feel identical to the originals while brushing. We haven&#x27;t used the newest set yet, but I am confident they are also genuine because they look identical to the last set of heads, which looked identical to the original heads that came with the toothbrush. Just be sure to carefully compare your replacements to your current heads each time, given all the complaints about fakes.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE DESIGN! What genius thought that rapidly spinning OVAL shaped brush heads was a good idea? It vibrates like crazy and beats up your teeth. Imagine if whomever designed these worked in Detroit - try driving 60MPH with OVAL wheels. They seriously need to change this design. Really glad I saved my old brush head.</li>
            <li> Just as expected. Works perfectly fine. Reasonable price. Shipped fast</li>
            <li> Yes the Oral B tooth brushes are quite unique, they do really leave my teeth feeling smooth and clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural smiler, I laugh at anything including corny stuff, omg I can&#x27;t stop laughing writing this review, Thanks Colgates for your amazing toothpaste. XD Thanks Corona for your amazing beer.</li>
            <li> Love these flossing is easier. Can feel the brushes going between teeth. Better cleaning going on for sure.</li>
            <li> This product is well made and on top of that it is a good buy for the money! I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> Have been using these for 6 years now and can&#x27;t imagine using anything else. Great product.</li>
            <li> Like the cleaning capacity of the product, they seem to wear out quicker than the standard brushes.  a a a</li>
            <li> I love the way this product feels on my gums and it does the job that I purchased it for.  Will purchase from Amazon again as the price is right.</li>
            <li> My wife and I use a Braun Professional Care toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Dual Clean she uses the Floss Action (due to size).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are great at giving a superlative cleaning!</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about these because they are the original product. There is no quality difference from the replacement heads you buy at the store. The best part is that they are cheaper then buying them from the store.</li>
            <li> necessary auxillary for toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Quality good. Price great!</li>
            <li> I prefer these brushes to all the others. They get into the narrow spaces between my teeth exceptionally well.</li>
            <li> Best brush heads I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Two packs come with blue and red, three packs come with red, blue, and yellow.</li>
            <li> Product works as expected.</li>
            <li> These brush heads feel a little rough on my gums and teeth. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase them again, I&#x27;ll go for something that doesn&#x27;t have the little rubber swatters in there!</li>
            <li> Works as well as the original. It is a toothbrush; what more can I say?</li>
            <li> We bought these as replacements for the brushes that came with the original brush. It turned out to be a pleasant surprise. They are larger than the original and have a different action. They work great and I would certainly recommend them over the original brushes.</li>
            <li> Great replacement head for the Oral B toothbrush. Not much more to say other than it does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> best toothbrush ever!</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads have forever altered my life.  Knowing that my teeth are at their cleanest fills me with self-confidence and joy.  I tried a lesser head recently, and was miserable for three months, until it wore out.  Having these heads would have cured my substance abuse problem if I only had one.  If only we could supply our inner city youth with a regular supply of these, crime would drop and the children would be singing and dancing in the streets.  Give them to Congress and Republicans and Democrats will work together with mutual respect to better our nation.  Shoot them into the ozone layer and our climate change problem will be eliminated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait until the next batch arrive.  I live for that delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I exaggerate a bit, but they&#x27;re pretty good replacement brush heads.  My dental hygienist suggests that I switch to the Phillips electric brushes, though; she says that the round heads of the Oral-Bs generally do a good job, but aren&#x27;t as effective at removing plaque between the teeth.</li>
            <li> Love the floss action brushes. I have sensitive teeth and these brushes give me a great cleaning and no pain issues. They work even better than the brush heads for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> without doubt the best toothbrush head for my mouth ! amazon has made it super easy by allowing automatic re order at a very reasonable price. so often when i shop for it in real stores they are out of stock. great service !</li>
            <li> I like these brush heads quite a bit - my teeth always feel very clean after use. My only complaint is that they are quite expensive. The subscribe-and-save option helps, but they&#x27;re still pricey - on amazon or elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of cleaning along the gum lines.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this</li>
            <li> Gets your teeth really clean</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as good quality as what they used to be, but still good enough.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, It took me a while to get used to the smaller brush.  I was used to the the brush that came with the original Oral-B.  Overall, it does act as a floss brush.  Love the price, would purchase again.</li>
            <li> necessity with toothbrush,</li>
            <li> Irritated my gums.  Consequently, had to back off the pressure.  Would go with a different tip next time.</li>
            <li> When I go to the dentist for a tooth cleaning, they can&#x27;t believe that there is no plaque on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;IT is because I use the Braun &amp;#34;Floss Action&amp;#34; toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never change.</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads are very thorough and really leave my teeth and gums feeling clean every time</li>
            <li> Great product...only wish that Reach would have continued the electronic version of this brush.  I think it is much better than the non-electric manual flosser.</li>
            <li> VERY NICE QUICK SHIPPING</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun Oral B electric toothbrush or a Sonicare electric toothbrush for well over 20 years. Both are good products and both are getting better every time I wear out one of the units and need to replace it, every few years when it won&#x27;t hold a charge. The heads have to be replaced when they wear down over 6-12 weeks. There&#x27;s a color indicator to let you know. I&#x27;ve been using the Oral B consistently for quite some time; years in fact. I&#x27;ve tried a number of different heads and theFloss Action seem to work the best as I get rave reviews from my hygienist when I go. I think these heads get into the nooks and crannies and between the teeth the best and, dare I say, better than floss (don&#x27;t tell her I said so, she&#x27;ll send the floss police after me), especially when coupled with a manual Proxabrush that goes between the teeth where the space is wide enough to accept it. There are a variety of sizes and devices to attach. My dentist gives them away at cleanings. If yours does as well, take them along with a handle next time and give them whirl. And look into an electric toothbrush. You&#x27;ll never look back and your gum health and teeth health will be leaps and bounds better.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth (no comments from relatives or spouse please) and I have never gotten braces. I do have a couple teeth in each quadrant that are very close and hard to floss.  These heads are for a floss-like action.  They are working really well.I do not have to work hard at flossing now.  The tooth brush with this head is doing most of it. Great design.  I will probably stick with this design although Oral B offers other types of heads.</li>
            <li> The brush bristles are coming off after just 4 days of use, Possibly a fake being sold. I would prefer to buy from the local Target in future. It is too much hassle to ship it back now.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  I bought them to supplement the single brush that comes with the Oral-B electric toothbrush so that my wife could have her own.  They come with colored rings to distinguish the brushes.  The brushes combined with the toothbrush will leave your mouth with a fresh from the dentist feeling every time you brush!</li>
            <li> Dont wast your money on cheap know offs that break and don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the replacements yet, they are the same on the brush I ordered.  The one that came with the brush is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years.  Makes my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Removed 3 year old stubborn tartar on first brush. I have neglected my dental health since about age 24. I am 29 and had a wake up call once I really looked at my gum health and realized it was bad (embarrassing, ich!). I had been using the off-brand cheap heads for years, but got these because of the high score. A large chunk of tartar fell out on the first brush. I cannot believe it. I literally jumped for joy when I realized what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr - these are way better than the cheap off brand stuff, just changed my life for the better</li>
            <li> If you like the Oral B toothbrush, then you will be fine with this product since it is a replacement head after your brush is worn.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral B power brush for 4 years. These brush heads are the best. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the floss action heads for 2 years and my teeth feel clean and refreshing every time. My boyfriend is also starting to love this type and we need to order more often through the subcribe and save option here at Amazon that can save you more money + free shipping every 3 months, or 6 months. I think the system is very convenient. I recommend this pack.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for the past three years, as they originally came with my 9000 series. Although they say they are floss action, they do not come close to using regular floss, as they can not get all the way between the teeth, and below the gum line. I have had no cavities, and cleaner teeth since upgrading to the 9000 with the floss action, so I guess they do work well.</li>
            <li> i normally love these brush heads but this set didn&#x27;t last very long, maybe a 2-3 weeks. will get them in town instead of online from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and highly recommend it to anyone anticipating buying it. It&#x27;s like getting your teeth cleaned at the dentist office but on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I have an Oral B toothbrush and I ordered the Floss Action 3 pack to replace my old brush head.  These feel significantly harder than my old brush heads. I had been using the new Floss Action head only a few weeks when I went to my dentist. He told me that my toothbrush was too hard and I was going to damage my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The [[ASIN:B004FEFGNS The Oral Health Bible]] also states that you should always use a soft brush. It says a medium or hard brush can cause immediate damage to the soft tissues surrounding the teeth as well as severe damage to the teeth over time. It says the only thing to use a medium or hard brush on are to clean car parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I just threw away a $20 three-pack of brush heads because they the bristles are really hard.</li>
            <li> after two futile attempts (my fault) and i&#x27;m sure glad of your return policy, i finally got the right thing.  i&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> These are basically inexpensive when compared buying them locally well worth it.</li>
            <li> The heads seem to work OK and are lasting pretty well, but if if you are thinking this is a replacement for real flossing, think again, unless you have big spaces between your teeth. If I use this head and then floss, it is obvious the floss was still needed. I can&#x27;t tell if it is any better than the standard head.</li>
            <li> every body in my family using different heads, those are the ones I use and I love them</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase. Does the job.</li>
            <li> The Oral B Floss Action brush heads are great.  I still floss but less often.  I can fill the deep clean with these brush heads</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product to daily clean.&lt;br /&gt;in my country is too hard to find it.&lt;br /&gt;was a rapid answer to my needed</li>
            <li> There are few type of toothbrush head for my Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Electric Toothbrush. I love this because it may have my dental cleaned indeep rather than other brush head.</li>
            <li> I noticed an improvement in plaque removal over time at dental cleanings, as compared to the brush head without the yellow floss action paddles.</li>
            <li> Really helps to keep my teeth clean. Gets the hard to reach food particles out of my teeth. Also gentle to gums.</li>
            <li> Nice product, fits my Oral B Vitality. Good price.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this type of brush head.  I like it but I prefer the larger brush heads.</li>
            <li> Like these!  They work well!</li>
            <li> I recommend paying a few extra dollars for the oral B Floss Action instead of the regular because of the floss action.  However, the price is not the cheapest at Amazon.  I went to Costco and notice a difference in price. Costco sells a pack of eight for around $45 bucks.  However, I&#x27;m single and there is no need to buy a large amount.  I hope this helps everyone.</li>
            <li> always get a great deal on these heads from amazon and they work great. i will continue to by these 3 packs. excellent value</li>
            <li> Great tooth brush.  When I went in for my cleaning, it took the hygenist 1/2 the time to clean.</li>
            <li> I ordered 1 of Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill at 12 $ first time.I couldn&#x27;t use because it didn&#x27;t fit with my machine.Amazon sent me another one at 19.25 $ after several month.I return both at the same time for refund.Amazon refund me at 1.11$ for both. both cost me 31.25 $.   Beware of return product &amp; the way amazon treat their customer.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem like the Oral B brand that I have used before.  All three heads became loose after 3 or 4 weeks and then would pinch my lip at times.  The blue indicator bristles do not wear down in color like they should.  The Floss Action plastic bristles even broke off.  If this is truly an Oral B product, and not a counterfeit, then their quality control has suffered.  I am a dentist and recommend Oral B products on a daily basis, especially their power brushes, but for some reason this package turned out to be of a lesser quality than I am used to.  May have to go back to the Precision heads.</li>
            <li> Genuine replacements for Oral-B Triumph toothbrush. I will admit I was worried when buying them but Amazon came through. Which is great because I only ever buy the floss action brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothbrush leaves behind a clean feeling and gives plenty of indication to replacement times (or if you are brushing too hard).</li>
            <li> These heads clean just fine but I prefer the Precision Clean or Pro White heads.  I&#x27;m not sure that I get the \\&quot;Floss Action\\&quot; feeling from these heads.  They just seem to lose the toothpaste easier more than anything.</li>
            <li> These work quite well in my electric toothbrush.  In fact, I have been getting clean bills of health on my dental visits since switching to an electric toothbrush that uses these heads.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying this, but these are a little too soft for my taste.  Nevertheless, they are long-lasting, and fit my Oral-B electric toothbrush just fine.</li>
            <li> Hey, do you have an Oral B rechargeable toothbrush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If so, you&#x27;ll want some of these if you like, want your teeth to get clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These ones say &#x27;floss action&#x27; which apparently equates to some rubber bristles.</li>
            <li> Love these brush heads! And I get Subscribe &amp; Save, so I get a little discount.  However I did notice a $5 off coupon which would put the price cheaper than S&amp;S.  Overall very happy with this and I got real Oral-B brush heads and not knock-offs, which according to the reviews seems to be a problem.</li>
            <li> I get these for my husband, he hasnt complained about them so they must work good. can get for pretty cheap with coupons and subscribe and save</li>
            <li> Item received was different from product picture. Picture show a 4 pc but item is 3 pc. Inaccurate description of product.</li>
            <li> These just work, they aren&#x27;t anything special. Much cheaper than buying new heads from local drugstore. The heads last so long that I don&#x27;t know when I will need to purchase more!</li>
            <li> The goods arrived on time and nicely packaged. I already knew this product and it was the quality I expected.</li>
            <li> I use this with my deep-cleaning setting on my toothbrush, and it does a great job of cleaning out plaque, and even seems to keep my teeth sparkling white even longer.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fits my electric tooth brush perfectly! Keeps my teeth cleaned! Cant wait to reorder once I run out the the supply.</li>
            <li> Since I have gum problem years, I look for the best quality tooth brush.  This is the one.  I do always choose this Oral B Floss Action 3pack brush head refill.</li>
            <li> I can never find these specific brushheads in stores so I order them online and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase....price is great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars because I am satisfied with what actually arrived in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go with these official brush heads sold by Oral-B on Amazon because I have heard of too many horror stories of people buying knock-off brands that have been very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, even buying from Oral-B&#x27;s Amazon listing was somewhat of a gamble because other reviewers for this particular listing said that they were sent fake/low quality brush heads as well. However, there seems to be a general consensus in the reviews that that is a thing of the past, and that all the brush heads bought from this listing are all real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I am happy with the product. The only thing that&#x27;s keeping me from giving this 5 stars is the price for these. They are outrageously expensive! But I guess the security of knowing that these are not knock offs is the only real price justification for these.</li>
            <li> Work well!  My hygienist has noticed improvement and my measurements have definitely improved.  Would not go back to the sonicare.</li>
            <li> My favorite dental cleaness.</li>
            <li> Highly recomended!! Fill All my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;You can purchase with All the confidence you need!&lt;br /&gt;The product has the quality you need!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brush heads with my [[ASIN:B004U7RKYI Oral-B Professional Care 1000]]. I&#x27;ve tried the precision clean and dual clean heads. I get the best clean feeling from these.</li>
            <li> I was worried by the fact I could get a fake brush head refill... fortunately I get the original refill and I&#x27;m happy for the performance of the product.</li>
            <li> We all love praise from our dental hygienist, don&#x27;t we? Since I&#x27;ve started using these, My dentist appointments are fun and not nearly as painful!</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes. Have been using for years and the dentist always comments about how clean my mouth is.</li>
            <li> I bought this before, and really like it</li>
            <li> bougght for wife she loves it</li>
            <li> Good product and ease to replace.</li>
            <li> Reliable and effective.</li>
            <li> Always good to replace often.  Great double action.  There are varying softness. Pick those best for you. Well made.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I hoped for. Doesn&#x27;t eliminate the need for dental floss but it enhances the value.</li>
            <li> I use these brush heads regularly.  My hands are poorly coordinated because of MS and arthritis.  Regular flossing is difficult so this product really helps.</li>
            <li> Just read some of the reviews (should have before I purchased). My \\&quot;new\\&quot; toothbrush heads did not feel right (used for about a week) -- now I read the reviews! At first I thought they were fake -- now I know! Oh well, live and learn.</li>
            <li> every tooth is cleaned completely.  Oral-B offers a variety of toothbrush heads to fit your personal oral health needs. everthing is ok!</li>
            <li> These have saddened my periodontist! No longer need him!!!  Great tooth brush and replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Made by the Oral-B people, so it&#x27;s the same quality as the original equipment, albeit an improvement over the standard brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen them at CVS or similar stores, though this particular model was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple different Oral-B electric rechargeable toothbrushes over the years and am currently using the Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 Electric Rechargeable Power Toothbrush. I have usually purchased this type of toothbrush head as a replacement and find that I replace brush heads every month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints regarding craftsmanship – they do the job you expect them to and do it well – though I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever noticed any &amp;#34;floss action.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve also recently discovered the Oral-B DualAction Premium Power Toothbrush Head Refills which are not only cheaper but also seem to do a more thorough job – perhaps simply because the brush head is bigger. That said, if your mouth is smaller or if you prefer more precise control, this is an excellent brush head.</li>
            <li> For those wondering if the counterfeit complaints have been resolved, they have been. I received genuine Braun brush heads that pass all of the counterfeit tests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never have a problem with the longevity of these brush heads but this particular pack did come with one head that failed during first use. These are not cheap when you consider cost per brush head so I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with that. However, I have never had this happen before and have yet to experience it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, these brush heads are slightly bulkier than the standard models. This makes it more difficult to brush the molars at the back of the mouth, but still possible.</li>
            <li> Clean my teeth flosses at the same time.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! They make me want to brush my teeth all the time. Love the toothbrush and these brush heads. It is an investment, but the benefits are worth it. LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Bought from &amp;#34;sold and shipped&amp;#34; by Amazon and I was comparing to my original one and looked the same but the new one doesn&#x27;t fit flush to the pole base.  Works fine as is but just a tiny gap between the color ring and the base.  Seems sketchy.</li>
            <li> I prefer the large headed brushes. They have the same round top but they also have a down portion that makes the cleaning area much bigger.</li>
            <li> This is a reorder. Love the thorough cleaning I get with this brush</li>
            <li> Wow, I am so amazed that I&#x27;m not the only person who has a problem with replacement brushes (RB) falling off and scratching one&#x27;s tongue/cheeks/lower face. Recently I have to hold the toothbrush upside down or at a slight angle w/ a decent amount of pressure of the RB falls off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my RBs at the Target in Lakewood, Colorado (Belmar) location and I&#x27;m having the same issue. I came here to see if the Target Oral-B RBs are shoddy, but I think it&#x27;s a bigger issue. The manufacturer is either making shoddy products or someone is making a lot of fake Oral-B replacement brushes and selling them to legitimate businesses. Unfortunately, I spend more time trying not to cut up my face or drop a RB in the sink than I actually do taking care of my teeth. I think it&#x27;s time to find another toothbrush.</li>
            <li> it is very cheap and good。 i like it！it is worth buying！I will continue to buy next time！a nice shopping！</li>
            <li> I have had them before and was glad to find them again.....the store, locally, no longer carries them AND SWITCHED AND WAS UNSATISFIED WITH WHAT I SWITCHED TO</li>
            <li> Good deal, work just fine.</li>
            <li> got extra 3 flossy action very nicely bundled with healthy clean brush head. Recommended to all.&lt;br /&gt;My very first brush head used and it feels almost like after a cleaning from the dentist.</li>
            <li> This review is just for these flosser heads-I&#x27;ve never purchased them from Amazon, but based on other reviews, if they are purchase from Amazon through another seller, there is a high risk of them being counterfeit. Who knew?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I have been using these brush heads for a couple of years now, and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Our dentist noticed a change in six month&#x27;s time when we switched to the Oral B electric toothbrush. Another dentist said \\&quot;I wish all people took as good of care of their mouths as you do!\\&quot; and barely had to do any teeth cleaning-and that is when I was only flossing once a month or so. In addition to bristles, there are four thin rubber \\&quot;pads\\&quot; on the brush. I would think this helps with polishing the teeth, too. Nothing replaces daily flossing, but these brush heads do provided a deeper and more satisfying clean than other brush heads we&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are definitely more expensive than generic non-electric toothbrushes, but for the money they will save us on dental work in the long run, they are well worth it. Electric toothbrushes really do provide a better and more efficient clean. Also, don&#x27;t waste your money on generic replacement heads. I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands, and the bristles started falling out after a few uses. These brush heads are the way to go!</li>
            <li> The ones that are sold by Amazon are 100% real and not the fake ones. Arrived in two days. Worked perfect and cleaned my teeth perfectly. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described and works well with my Oral B toothbrush.  I change out every 2 months and have not had any defects in this product</li>
            <li> the problem has been reported to amazon and to oral b.  they both are following up.&lt;br /&gt;amazon was very upset about it.  they will track down the offender through their distributors who supply the product.  amazon indicated that the first step they take is to remove the product from their website.  DO NOT ORDER THESE WITHOUT CALLING AMAZON FIRST TO SEE IF THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these from PGEstorecom.  PG is proctor &amp; gamble who owns oral B.  they are on sale for $18.99/3-pack, plus a $3 coupon on the order, plus a $3 instant rebate per pack,plus an additional 15% discount for new customers, plus no shipping charges on orders over $25, plus, no sales tax from NJ.. i ordered 3 packs because of the price.  bottom line came to 45.87 for nine brushes total. in addition, oral B said you can also get them from theessentials.com and drugstore.com.[[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Head 3 Count]]</li>
            <li> I love these heads.  They make my teeth feel cleaner then ever. Good  for those days when you don&#x27;t have time to floss.</li>
            <li> Glad I took the chance on this product.  will purchase more as neeed.  Hhighly recommend to others if you want good product</li>
            <li> once i purchase an electronic toothbrush i won&#x27;t be going back that being said these came with the brush i purchase and i love this things .. i see a improvement in my teeth as well .. i use these heads and 3d crest whiting toothpaste and 3d crest mouthwash .. will and have purchase more heads .. RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral-B replacement brushes for a while now and they really leave my mouth feeling clean and fresh. I always floss prior to brushing, yet when I use the brushes it still finds and remove particles I thought I had gotten. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this floss action brushes with my triumph for years and I have no complaints. It&#x27;s not even comparable to using a regular toothbrush. My teeth feel almost polished after I&#x27;m done cleaning them. Not sure how much they do in the flossing realm but they clean my teeth well.</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads are my favorite. They definitely feel better in the mouth and I think they do a better job than the regular non-floss models. The only reason I can&#x27;t give them 5 stars is because the company gouges the consumer on price. It&#x27;s the same old thing, give them the razor and make them pay through the nose for blades. They don&#x27;t even \\&quot;give\\&quot; you the toothbrush however and this is now old technology. The only reason I bought these brushes when I did is because Amazon offered a $3 off coupon. I use the heads much longer than the recommended amount because I don&#x27;t like being gouged.</li>
            <li> We use these in our Oral-B Pro-Health Precision Clean Electric Toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Teeth look and feel great, and the Dentist said &amp;#34;No cleaning needed this time!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Do&#x27;t bother buying these the normal ones work better and dont make you feel like your gums have been damaged</li>
            <li> I love the floss-action brush heads because, while I don&#x27;t think they actually &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; between my teeth, they do polish the surface of my teeth very well.  I can obtain a great clean feeling with these brush heads, and with that polished feeling of course comes whiter teeth.  I highly recommend the Oral-B electric toothbrush and this type of brush head for clean teeth fanatics.</li>
            <li> The wife and I both enjoy the new &amp;#34;Floss Action&amp;#34; design and the way the brush head feels comfortable in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt; These brush heads last longer than the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; brush head that comes with the Oral-B electric toothbrushes -- and longer-lasting means greater value !!&lt;br /&gt; We use several different Oral-B brush head types, and all meet the same high quality standards that come with the Oral-B brand.&lt;br /&gt;My order arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Thanks, Amazon !!</li>
            <li> arrived at time, as advertise.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an old user of Oral B brush heads. It will be the first time for this kind- floss action.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> I love Oral-B toothbrushes and most brush heads, however, these seem too harsh for ANY teeth. Next time I&#x27;ll try getting the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; version?</li>
            <li> I think these are the best replaceable brush heads ever! I love the floss action - it leaves me wih an especially clean feeling mouth. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I was worried about it being an &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; Oral-B replacement head, but it is! It cleans my dogs teeth and my husband&#x27;s beautifully. I&#x27;ve saved the other two for myself.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good toothbrush heads. I hate to floss and my last dentist check up went really well. So kudos to Oral-B for the innovation of the Floss Action.</li>
            <li> I feared getting a counterfeit product , but I have been using them ( 1 ) for about 5 weeks and it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart yet . Quick delivery and somewhat of a discount price.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical after reading some reviews about fake brush heads, but what I received, works very well. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and still going strong, also I read the ORAL B mark will scratch off fakes, which it does not with these. I recommend saving some money and ordering these refill heads.</li>
            <li> Oral B Action 3 pack brush head refill are as good as the original ones that come with the machine</li>
            <li> I like the Oral B products a lot they are great and good for their money, I have the Oral B tooth brush, so I got this to replace the heads when I need a new one, it arrive on time and it is a great product.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are effective -- they get in tight spots and remove even the toughest deposits.  They last a long time too.</li>
            <li> these are good and i received these on time when i need chang old oral B floss action brush head ............</li>
            <li> Received my order as promised by Amazon well packed and protected from shipment damage...As for the brush I could not ask for better preformance,my teeth feel real clean after use, I have respatory problem, and have to sleep with a &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; pack at night and sometimes when I get up I have breathed with my mouth open durring the night  and I have a dried film on my teeth and this brush really cleans thing up for me better than anything I have used before!!!</li>
            <li> Can you believe how expensive the refills are for electric toothbrushes, but I am hooked on the electric kind.  Do you suppose they could adopt the same philosophy as printer manufacturers?  Make the handle inexpensive and the replacement head cost a lot.  But, both are expensive.  No wonder there are counterfeits.</li>
            <li> In comparison to the store price, these toothbrush heads are a great deal.  Also, the floss action is far superior to the regulars, and around the same price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t last long, and quite expensive.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t seem quite as well constructed as the original, but they work.  better than paying more elsewhere...trust me I looked.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable product. best on the market. Cleeans WWAAAAYYYY better than my old (other brand) toothbrush.</li>
            <li> this works to clean my teeth.  Ill buy it again.  the yellow pieces are hard plastic, but i don&#x27;t notice it when i brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> Always a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought these for $17, which I felt was a good bargain. They work as expected. I was using the sensitivity brush heads previously, when I started using these I started bleeding - which makes me think that these bristles are getting below my gum line better. I also bleed when I floss for the first time in a long while (same idea).</li>
            <li> My teeth have never been cleaner nor felt cleaner!</li>
            <li> Familiar product.  Arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> My dental examines have improved a lot since I began using these. I highly recommend this brush head as it helps act like a floss for those who don&#x27;t regularly floss. You should still floss though!</li>
            <li> I replace the heads on my oral b electric toothbrush every 3 months or so.  I like this head the best.</li>
            <li> I tried these brush heads because I thought the \\&quot;Floss Action\\&quot; would be better than just the standard brush head.  To be honest I really didn&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;m throwing these away and I&#x27;m going to buy more of the standard head.  I didn&#x27;t like the feel of the yellow plastic things (that were added to give the flossing effect) and I don&#x27;t think that it did any better at cleaning my teeth.  Actually, it felt like it was too rough on my gums.  I floss regularly with dental floss, so it&#x27;s not like my gums are too sensitive.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery of refills.  Good quality; does the job.</li>
            <li> A little rougher than expected.  I love my Oral B toothbrush and this certainly cleans well.</li>
            <li> Good value - use daily</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Cleans well.</li>
            <li> What can you say about a tooth brush?</li>
            <li> I have use these brushes for about a year, i can notice the big difference. Great product. Great investment in your health.</li>
            <li> I purchased an Oral-B electric toothbrush a while back. I chose the brush heads that included flossing. My dental checkups have been great since I started using Oral-B and the flossing brush heads (purchased thru Amazon).  As &amp;quot;Tony the tiger says, There Great!!!&amp;quot;</li>
            <li> Great Recommendation. Very efficient in using and I believe I would buy it again.  Great Recommendation. Very efficient in using and I believe I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> With the $5 coupon, you can only use it once.  So don&#x27;t cancel an order you have already placed and try to reorder right away thinking the coupon will be there for you.  It won&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coupon will reset itself.  I&#x27;m not sure how long it takes.  When I placed an order about a week later, the coupon was available again.</li>
            <li> This Oral-B brush head has very interesting design that contains two moving little brushes on the sides. When it rotates the little brushes do their job by cleaning the small gaps between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little larger than the original/classic brush head that comes with the electric toothbrush. It took me a week or so to get used to it. But overall it provides a better tooth-brushing experience.</li>
            <li> Other than how expensive they are, I have no complaints on this product. They work great on my teeth, I like these (Floss Action) a little more than the standard heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used the floss action before and was very pleased to find that I love them. They make my teeth feel extra clean.</li>
            <li> We all need to brush our teeth. I choose to let a little machine do most of the work.  I may have skimped on some flossing over the years and then my dentist yelled at me and as a result I changed to this head on an OralB toothbrush.  Since then, my gum health has improved.  That&#x27;s scientific evidence right there right?  Anyway... I use this head and it does a good job cleaning my teeth and keeping the gums happy.</li>
            <li> Several messages here have alleged that Amazon is selling replacement heads that said to have been made by Oral B (Braun) but are actually fakes.  That has not been my experience.  Some have provided photos with claims that this is what the fake packaging looks like and that is what the real thing looks like.  Take such photos with several grains of salt.  Oral B has changed its packaging several times.  One photo of a putative fake is identical to the packaging used recently by Oral B, snd the genuine packaging has changed even more recently.  One reviewer suggested that you go to the Oral B site to buy your heads rather than shopping at Amazon -- but guess what -- if you go to the Oral B site they provide you several links for retailers who sell their products, and one of them leads right here, to this product at Amazon.  Bottom line is, the brush heads I have purchased from Amazon work fine, appear to be identical to those that came with the toothbrush, and perform just as did those that came with the toothbrush.  If someone has produced a fake and conned Amazon into selling it (highly unlikely, IMHO), the fake is of such good quality that it is a non-issue.</li>
            <li> Purchased these heads to try with the new Oral-B 1000 Toothbrush I purchased to replace the Oral-B electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve been using for over 8 years now.  I had read reviews from other people about these heads and thought I&#x27;d give them a try.  I&#x27;m still using the head that came with the toothbrush so haven&#x27;t tried these yet.  I&#x27;m hooked on Oral-B so can only give an advanced guess that I&#x27;m going to like these (I&#x27;ve been very pleased with Oral-B products).</li>
            <li> I use this head with my Oral-B Professional Care 5000. It goes a great job getting all of the plaque off of my tooth surfaces and around the gum-lines. It is not a substitute for floss, however and I&#x27;m still able to get visible amounts of gunk from between my teeth after brushing. Sometimes I feel it is a little harsh on the gums but hopefully I will get used to it with time. I will note, my package was shipped from and sold by Amazon and I received genuine brush heads.</li>
            <li> These are good for kids as well (I would say 12 and up). Realistically it&#x27;s not quite as flossing regularly but sure does a better job than normal toothbrush, also better than regular or &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; brush heads. Might as well get the most out of brushing teeth!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this after I read some reviews by people who gave this product one star ratings, complaining that the product they received was not a real Oral-B, though it said it was.. I was glad for the warning and pictures to check to make sure that the problem had been solved.  Mine is really Oral-B and it works well, plus it&#x27;s cheaper buying it on Amazon than in the stores.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know why the other reviews have a lot of complaints about authenticity. but i have purchased these more than once and have always received authentic toothbrush heads at a fraction of the drug store price.  they ship quickly and i can subscribe and save. win win.</li>
            <li> i did not need the floss action but, the smoother heads.</li>
            <li> Original product not the shabby imitation which disintegrated.</li>
            <li> Great set of brush heads.  Feels comfortable on your teeth.  No issues at all.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely matter and in good condition. Love these brushes and my dentist can definitely tell a difference when compared to the plain old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for both cleaning and massaging the gums. If you have an Oral B toothbrush, you should try this product.</li>
            <li> I assumed because these were expensive Oral-B brand they&#x27;d work well.  WRONG.  Within a few weeks half of the bristles wore away or fell out or something.  The original head that came with the brush was wearing out so I got these but these literally wear away- I&#x27;m virtually brushing my teeth with the plastic head sans bristles...</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral B brush for years and was very happy with the Oral B Pro White Head but they did not have them at the store so I bought this one, the Oral B Floss Action. When I looked at it I thought it would not clean good in the corners of the teeth since the round brush is not fully round but I said to myself, \\&quot;oh, it should work.\\&quot; I figured I would not know for a few months. Well several months later and I was right. My teeth have dirty spots on them in the crevice corners and this never happened before. They should discontinue this brand. It does not work. I floss everyday with normal floss, a toothbrush cannot do that. I need to get a cleaning from dentist now and will order the Oral B Pro White Head again.</li>
            <li> Just purchased the Oral-B elex toothbrush, and got these for a good price.  They feel just right for my purpose, but no long term review at this time, but feel I have made the right choice</li>
            <li> Right heads, good packaging, saved a few bucks from buying in store. The floss action brush heads are the best for a person of decent to normal oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> I bought these to go with the toothbrush I purchased which I love.  I thought they were cheaper on line. But they weren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Oral B Floss Action brush heads for years.  We really feel they do the best job by far.  The cost is a edging on ridiculous, however, so lately we&#x27;ve been using the generic version from Target.  They are identical to this name brand and probably manufactured by Oral B themselves.  Costs about five bucks less than this standard pack.  If the generics weren&#x27;t available when I need them, I&#x27;d definitely buy these name brand ones again.  But if I can save a few bucks with Target&#x27;s generic, then that&#x27;ll be my first choice.</li>
            <li> good and cheap. easy to replace and can wash the teeth very clean. good to buy this thing with such a price</li>
            <li> I started using this about a month before seeing my dentist, having switched from Sonicare because I ha dtwo of those break in three years. My dentist noticed immediatly that my gumms were irrtated and recommended that I stop using this and switch back to Sonicare, which I had used for nearly 20 years until their planned obscelence ticked me off.  Any other suggestions?</li>
            <li> everything was as I orded and arrived on time and I would recommend these producs to anyone who is interested.</li>
            <li> This item is counterfeit. Do not buy it. Pictures comparing real and counterfeit are also misleading, Original Oral-B brush only has ONE color ring not 2. Why Amazon.com is selling these? What is ORAL-B doing about it?</li>
            <li> Great refill deal. I would recommend if your using this toothbrush, better than buying the individual packets in the store. For some reason the heads seem to not last as long, but still great buy.</li>
            <li> If you ordered this then you probably knew what you were getting yourself into.  They fit on my electric toothbrush and get to cleaning.</li>
            <li> They are somewhat pricey for a cheap guy like me but they work very well. The wife uses them and loves them. I have never tried the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; brands but I figure that if it&#x27;s not broken, don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement brushes, these floss action brushes do the job. Have been using these for over 2 years and my teeth look visibly better and gets the food particles from the gaps. Don&#x27;t forget to change them when the light blue color fades to about half way.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this around my teeth and gum area. It cleans exceptionally.</li>
            <li> Floss action bristles are the best of the lot in my opinion.  Over time i&#x27;ve seen the best cleaning results from these bristles and they&#x27;re built well.</li>
            <li> Need to come out with heads that are smaller for toddlers and children</li>
            <li> two minutes twice daily greatly reduces the Godaweful misery of the biannual dental cleansing ritual.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my teeth feel!</li>
            <li> With these brush-heads and careful flossing with both cheap dental picks and Oral-B Satin floss, there&#x27;s very little build-up of tartar for the dental hygienist to clean, even when I missed a couple appointments, and went 1 1/2 years between cleaning. The Oral-B Triumph brush with the floss heads clean your teeth and massage your gums so much more thoroughly and efficiently than regular brushing, it really is quite amazing.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these brush replacements. They work good in my version of Oral-B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Much better than those cheaper copies.</li>
            <li> brush heads are like they state, a flossing action type brush head. My teeth feel so clean after brushing with this.</li>
            <li> I love  my oral b toothbrush, please don&#x27;t get me wrong,  I just decided to try this configuration (for some strange reason) instead of the standard one that came with the unit.  I  don&#x27;t really like this brush head.  While cleaning, the head seems to  hang upon my teeth because of the little rubber pieces. Next time I will  buy the brush heads that are all brush, no rubber.</li>
            <li> As with most items similar to these on Amazon (razors etc.), there are fakes that exist. However, it is incredibly easy to avoid the fakes. Only buy the products when they say sold by/shipped by Amazon. If it&#x27;s a third party vendor, they seem to always be fakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered this product twice from Amazon, always ensuring it was coming from them. Both times I got legit, long-lasting brush heads (with imprinted serial number on the back, and each head coming with 2 color rings) for almost half the price of what they are in most stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t pass up this deal because of bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Good replacement brushes for my toothbrush. OEM equipment as advertised. Good product and decent value. Nothing special, but nothing wrong. Hey, these are toothbrush replacements not gold watches.</li>
            <li> I have used these brush heads for many years. They can be a bit harsh but I love the feeling of clean that these leave behind. I recently tried another toothbrush with different heads and have to say that the Braun toothbrushes and brush heads seem to work better. I noticed that I could not feel plaque along the gum line like I could other brushes.</li>
            <li> Need to get some more</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and a very nice product.</li>
            <li> They work great with our older Oral B electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Great product. Prerfer Pro white</li>
            <li> Not what I expected like the original brush head but they still perform really well. Perfect for plaque removal.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for people with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Teeth always fell so much cleaner with these.</li>
            <li> I have used this product over and over.  I do not think it is worth an on line order.  Can purchase product locally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is the head or the actual unit I love the most but it sure is nice to use. I have one of each of the different heads but tend to stick to just the same one until it wears out.</li>
            <li> As expected, great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried every type of head Oral-B makes and these are the best balance of having that &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling after brushing while still being small and maneuverable enough to get my wisdom teeth and other hard-to-reach areas.</li>
            <li> It really is an improvement from the earlier versions I have been using.  And my dentist approved of it too.</li>
            <li> Delivery – great&lt;br /&gt;Functionality – great&lt;br /&gt;I got what I wanted, and I got everything I needed.&lt;br /&gt;What more do you need?&lt;br /&gt;I recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> See my toothbrush review.....the Oral-B 5000.....There are many brush styles from which to choose from intense cleaning to flossing and more!</li>
            <li> This is a repeat purchase. I have a tough time finding these heads in the stores when I need it. Amazon almost always has them and I am grateful for it.</li>
            <li> Every brushing is like leaving the dentist. WOW! This type of brushing should be taught in public school worldwide. Then maybe we would not have to see people with offensive nasty teeth with brown rings near the gums, brown stains, and white plaque crudded up on the front or between the teeth.</li>
            <li> If you like the small head of the standard round brush, be aware that these have a much larger head. The brush is a little stiff too. I have a pack, and I&#x27;ll use them, but my next pack will be the standard brush heads.</li>
            <li> I own the Oral B Triumph and it is the best toothbrush I have ever had.  My dentist&#x27;s assistant recommended it, the next time I went back for a check up the dentist was amazed how much better my teeth were.  Amazon also has the refile floss heads for half of the price of any where elsed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes since they first came out and believe they do a much better job that do regular brushe.</li>
            <li> I order this product because it is the lowest price I can find.  I was worry if it is geneuin, but it is right from the manufacture.  I haven&#x27;t use it yet, but it looks like the original one that come with the Triomph toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of researching before buying an electric toothbrush because let&#x27;s face it - these babies are expensive! I bought mine a little over a year ago and immediately fell in love with it. It works wonderfully, it cleans your teeth amazingly. My teeth have been whiter and strong since I started using it. The replacement heads aren&#x27;t too expensiuve either. I get my 3 packs here on Amazon for $13 and you only have to replace them every 2 months I&#x27;d say - but you could wait longer and it still works fine. It even tells you when it&#x27;s time to replace by starting with blue bristles that slowly turn to white as it&#x27;s used. It has a timer on it so you brush your teeth for the full recommended time. When your done it shows a smiley face. It has different settings for the kind of brushing you want. It doesn&#x27;t hurt your teeth and does a great job, you don&#x27;t even have to press it to your teeth. If your looking to buy one - buy this one. It&#x27;s so great I even bought myself a second one for when I travel. :)</li>
            <li> These are the best brush heads for Oral B brushes.  They are 3 times as expensive as non-flossing heads.  They do a better job of cleaning for me, penetrating deeper into the teeth gaps and gum layer.  I use the other brush heads too because I am not sure whether these create gum wear.  I still floss, as these brush heads are not a real substitute.  When I use these flossing brush heads I feel more comfortable flossing just the deep areas between my teeth.  This means I&#x27;m hacking at my gums less with floss, but feel just as clean.  I recommend these replacement brush heads a a mix of brush heads for any Oral B handsets.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]]      This product is good as i already use it. But the main thing is price. It is cheapest on amazon. really a good deal.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral B Floss Action 3 pack brush head refill]]  This is a great product at a great price.  I shopped othe websites such as the Oral-B replacement parts site and found much higher prices.  This is a real good buy!</li>
            <li> Best brush head for Oral-B powered brushes.  For some reason they don&#x27;t carry them at our local warehouse club, so here on Amazon with Prime shipping we stock up regularly.</li>
            <li> These are pretty simple. They work great. No problems whatsoever. I should set up a reminder to change them every 2-3 months though.</li>
            <li> What will they think of next? They actually work!  My orthodonist commented on how clean my teeth were. They do a great job.</li>
            <li> i change my head about every two months&lt;br /&gt;they keep their rigidity and flexibility and don&#x27;t fray easily&lt;br /&gt;i recommend these brush heads</li>
            <li> Oral-B produces a variety of electric toothbrush heads. Your dentist can recommend one for your particular dental needs. My shifting from manual to electric toothbrushes years ago helped keep my teeth ivory white and cavity-free and, for me, the simple rotating head with two types of bristles was very satisfactory, but when I switched to this head with paddles and three bristle types, dental hygiene actually improved. The heads are expensive (like replacement cartridges for your ink-jet printer) and should be replaced when the blue indicator is worn down half way, but they do work and coupled with the timer-electric toothbrush unit, the daily routine becomes easier and healthier.</li>
            <li> This is a great product because the heads wear out long before the unit and it is like buying three new tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> I have been using an Oral B electric toothbrush for approximately 8 years. In this time I have used the Floss Action, Dual Clean, Sensitive Clean, Power Tip, and a knock-off from China to save a few bucks (purchased on Amazon). I figured I should try them all so I could identify what works best. First, throw the Chinese knock-offs in the garbage. They are useless compared to any of the Oral B brushes. Secondly, I find the Floss Action better by a wide margin over any of the others I have tried. There are a few reasons why. First, it gets between large gaps in the teeth like no other replacement head. For example, I have a wide gap between two teeth caused by a dental root canal. This brush cleans in the space in a way the others don&#x27;t. I do not have to worry about bad breathe from the root canal anymore! Secondly, it gets deeper into tight spaces as well. I have been told by multiple dental assistants it is very difficult to floss me because the teeth are located close together. With these heads there is no issue! Third, The brush is not too rough or soft. I have average teeth and gums in regards to sensitivity. It seems today everyone thinks they have soft or hard gums. Well you know what, most people are &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; - this is the very definition of average! This brush is intended for the 80-90% of us who have average gums and teeth. My teeth aren&#x27;t left slimy from a too soft brush and my gums don&#x27;t hurt from a too rough one. Finally, This head feels the best. You can tell by the unique oscillating rotations that this is a brush with unique features. It doesn&#x27;t do in a circle like others. All the bristles move in awkward ways, creating a sensation that leaves me happy!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  Price was fair.&lt;br /&gt;Would order again when needed.&lt;br /&gt;Having to add an exact amount of words is a nuisance!</li>
            <li> BOUGHT THES ON THE RECOMENDATION OF AMAZON, BOY THAT WAS A MISTAKE, THEY DO NOT LAST AS LONG AS THE ORIGINAL, TOO SMALL, VERY OVER PRICED AND VERY POOR QUQLITY.  SAVE YOPUR MONEY, DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last forever.  Just common sense to purchase the extra heads so you are not left holding an old yucky brush head.&lt;br /&gt;Common Sense.</li>
            <li> I bought an Oral B/ Braun electric toothbrush package and it came with the regular round heads. Since I suffer from periodontal disease, my doctor recommended that I use this head instead of the regular round head. It was amazing how clean my teeth felt after using this head. They felt clean with the round head, but wow, they felt like I had just visited the dentist after using these. It might be interesting to note that the periodontal disease isn&#x27;t getting worse, and on some teeth is even disappearing. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these heads!</li>
            <li> Not my favorite heads.  These are exactly what the seller posted and claims - authentic and all, I just didn&#x27;t like them as much as the polishing ones.  If you know you want the &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; ones then these are them.</li>
            <li> These are after market oral b brush heads. They don&#x27;t fit on the brush quite right and don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> This set of 3 brush heads come sealed together and are original equipment replacement heads for your Oral-B rechargeable tooth brush.</li>
            <li> The reason I bought these is that they were the same brand available at a local chain store but at a 30% savings...  Great Deal!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT.  EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED.</li>
            <li> The brush works well providing a cleaner feel than brushing manually. I don&#x27;t know how long they will last as I just bought them. I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> They fit the toothbrush and work just fine. I can&#x27;t say I felt the &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; cleaned any differently than regular heads, so it might be more a matter of personal taste (and price).</li>
            <li> It works just as planned and is at lower cost then buying it in the store.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 12 year old Oral B handle and all I can say is &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34;  The rubber paddles really do swat stuff out from between your teeth and the varied bristles do a great job.  Kudos to Oral B for keeping their head mechanics the same so we can use newly designed heads with our old handles.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super; my husband and I both really like them.  The price is a bit expensive but not as much at Amazon as at other stores.</li>
            <li> I like it, I thought I will not use the Dental floss.&lt;br /&gt;It did a good job but still sometimes you need the Dental floss.</li>
            <li> I love it!  these brush heads leave your teeth feeling really clean!  I plan on buying more, these seem to be my favorite</li>
            <li> Love this, have bought many times, cleans your teeth like a pro.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the standard ones since I found these.</li>
            <li> Works well with my oral b toothbrush. Feels like it does a better job than the toothbrush head that came with toothbrush. Have had great results at the dentist while using it.</li>
            <li> Great product, works perfect!</li>
            <li> only toothbrush &amp; brush head I use.  The Dental Hygienist is always amazed at what a good job it does.</li>
            <li> Should have bought these sooner, they are very thorough.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and subscribe to this item using Amazon subscribe and save.  I know that, whenever I get my new shipment of heads, it&#x27;s time to switch them out!  No issues with compatibility, as these are the real deal.</li>
            <li> worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Expensive but the only ones that fit properly.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are expensive, and so are these. However they are not cheap knockoffs. They are the real thing that works and last relatively long unlike store name replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Do what they are supposed too. Decent price.</li>
            <li> works well, prompt shipping etc, but these seem pricey for what they are.</li>
            <li> These are perfect.  They fit on the brush head without slipping  the individual threads don&#x27;t come loose, and they get the choppers clean!</li>
            <li> It fits my oral b toothbrush correctly, however ruled that must order $25.00 worth of martial to order it is a hassle.</li>
            <li> Works Great  !!  Have always chosen this brand. For the price it does wonders and don&#x27;t have to break the bank .</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised, and the 3-count saves me from having to reorder for over a year.  I will reorder these.</li>
            <li> good brush head, I just liked my Sonic Care one better, but appear like they are holding up very well.</li>
            <li> &#x27;worked well and lasted long.  Would buy this product again.  I liked it.  I&#x27;d recommend it for friends with such toothbushes.</li>
            <li> Seems like a good value.  Easy replacement and automatic delivery is convenient.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommends these brush heads and I like the results. And they fit the least expensive Oral B Electric Toothbrush. Remember - it&#x27;s the brush head... not so much the handle that counts.</li>
            <li> These have worked great for me, I use them for a very long time and never had any problems breaking or losing bristles.</li>
            <li> They work well but are a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> OEM replacement parts, delivered timely.</li>
            <li> wife uses this type and loves them.</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes are a nice way of having an array of brush heads to try out to see which type you personally prefer for your Oral-B Toothbrush.  They come in a single convenient package.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> They work well on the Oral-B Professional Deep Sweep Brush.  They interchange for the type of clean you want.  They give a real clean feeling like you&#x27;ve been to the dentist for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand why these are so expensive.  I shouldn&#x27;t have to pay more for replacement heads for my $150 electric toothbrush than I would pay for a new regular toothbrush.  The 3 count replacement heads are more than $7 each.  I really need to find a way to either get these for less or just switch back to regular toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside of the cost, I loves these heads, they make my teeth feel very clean and are very comfortable on my gums.  The only reason I would tell you not to use them is the cost.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re doing a lot better on dental health with the Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush. These brush heads are priced right and fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an Oral-B toothbrush for years, and this is my favorite brush head.  The variety of bristle strengths and lengths lets it do a super job.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement heads for my Oral B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Bought these directly from Amazon and ended up receiving counterfeit product. This has happened in the past where the brushheads don&#x27;t last longer than 1 month because the brushheads comes loose and breaks off. Since then, whenever I received them I would inspect them to verify their authenticity. I compared these new ones to one of my older replacement brushheads and you can clearly tell they are fake. The most obvious is the Oral-B branding is much lighter grey than the authentic. The other indicator is each brushhead replacement should come with 2 colored rings. These only came with 1. I&#x27;m returnting the product and getting a refund. Very disappointed with Amazon</li>
            <li> I bought this replacement head for my oral-B spin brush electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I find they need to be replaced about every 2-3 months.&lt;br /&gt;I have Parkinson&#x27;s and have difficulty keeping the rythym of brushing.&lt;br /&gt;I find this electric unit and replacement heads fulfil my need, keeping me&lt;br /&gt;independant.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth never felt so clean as they do using these heads.&lt;br /&gt;I did purchase one brush on the replacement whereas I usually have a twin brush.&lt;br /&gt;For a smaller mouth, this seems to work real well.&lt;br /&gt;The product is made well, bristles stay in tact and spin on the unit very well.&lt;br /&gt;I like buying 3 at a time, so I am well stocked when the need arises.</li>
            <li> I like this brushhead so much. I have lingual braces, so oral hygiene is not only super important, but it&#x27;s also SUCH a hassle (my braces are on the backs of my teeth); this brushhead makes brushing my teeth that much more efficient (and I&#x27;ve tried almost all the others), and my mouth is actually clean. It makes flossing that much easier, and just works harder than many other brushheads. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed for my Oral B .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering the Oral B Floss Action brush heads from Amazon for over a year.  I did the &#x27;scratch test&#x27; on the label and it didn&#x27;t come off ... they&#x27;re authentic and doing a good job.</li>
            <li> I love these brush heads. They are definitely high quality, I don&#x27;t remember them ever losing a bristle. Unfortunately they are quite expensive and you need to exchange them quite frequently for hygiene reasons. I have been trying out cheaper options and those are just ok, but definitely not offering the same quality as the originals. I wish they would just sell for less, I know I&#x27;d start buying them again!</li>
            <li> Best to order extra replacement heads when ordering electric toothbrushes since they should be replaced regularly. Different colours. Good price.</li>
            <li> Just what you are looking for! Nice replacement pack</li>
            <li> This is genuine product which was shipped and sold by Amazon. I received the genuine heads not like some people were getting.&lt;br /&gt;they work great and last longer than what box states.</li>
            <li> Cleans teeth better then tooth brushes, even when they are free from the dentist.  Wish the dentist would give these away free after a visit.  Make sure you replace them once they get soft; otherwise, they will not clean your teach well enough.  A good product to keeping you teach in a preventative way.</li>
            <li> Appear to be OEM replacement heads as advertised. These last us 2-3 months with brushing twice daily. Tried generics, but just not as good as OEM.</li>
            <li> beside the fact that they raised the prices than originally started, its still a good buy. I am satisfied with the product quality.</li>
            <li> I am a constant user of electrical toothbrushes and oral b sells the more affordable replacement brush and it works just as great.</li>
            <li> This brush head is really no substitute for flossing. It has small plastic blades within the bristles and is really uncomfortable to use. Won&#x27;t ever buy this again.</li>
            <li> The new longer, yellow, plastic bristles took some getting used to but feel like they do a more thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> This is the only oral B that seems to do the job for me....with larger pockets and plaque build-up this is the answer for me.&lt;br /&gt;My dentist wanted to know what did you do differently?  The only think I did was change from the Precision Clean to the Floss Action Oral B and it said it made a big difference in my gums....</li>
            <li> good to have a pack so you can replace brush on regular basis. good product. I&#x27;d buy again if  needed</li>
            <li> These do a little better job than normal bristled brush heads  for me. I thought I had a few stockpiled but my wife seems to have taking a liking to them too.</li>
            <li> I was very much in need of new brush heads and was not happy with the cost at one of my local stores.  I am glad that I was able to find them on your site and as always, happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> pretty firm but works well.</li>
            <li> These do a great job of cleaning your teeth. I have these on auto buy and would recommend these to anyone</li>
            <li> it is quite durable. enjoy brushing teeth with it. does not hurt gum. stronly recommend to use it. a great product.</li>
            <li> The dentist actually recommended against these; I picked these up just to try something new and found that they aren&#x27;t actually very good at cleaning teeth as the regular brush heads are. I have pretty solid teeth as well and these are really pricey compared to the knock-ff alternative.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re toothbrush heads. they work well, and for some reason are much higher quality than the store brand ones.</li>
            <li> The cost of these things is like printer ink, not a bad price for the whole package but they get into your wallet for replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;BUT I THINK THE BRUSH NEEDS COVER FOR THE HEAD,&lt;br /&gt;OTHER VISE I LIKE ORAL- B IN COMPARISON WITH  SONIC THAT I HAD BEFORE.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush performs well for cleaning teeth as advertised; however IMHO there are two issues with the product one major, health related issue and the other related to marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I started using this brush head with Triumph series electric toothbrush and noticed an increase in frequency of frequency and intensity of sore-throats. I read that &amp;#34;Always replace your toothbrush head after you have had a cold, sore throat or infection. The bacteria stays on the toothbrush which can lead to re-infection.&amp;#34;  This is easier said than done, first, it increases the total cost of ownership quite significantly and secondly, sore throats do not have a very well defined end point. I normally clean toothbrushes by holding under running under water and agitating the bristles before and after use, however this is clearly insufficient. When I travelled to developing countries with unsafe tap water, I used a glass of bottled water and turned on the toothbrush with the head dipped in water. To my disgust a lot of gunk fell out. The construction of the toothbrush head is such that build-up of deposits is unavoidable, there is a big oblong cavity in the front and back of the toothbrush and also 6 smaller ones at back, where fluids while brushing can easily go in but cannot be flushed out. I thought of sanitising the toothbrush by dipping in boiling water, or hydrogen peroxide or alcohol or using a UV or ultrasonic cleaner and called up the 1800 number on the website to check if this is a safe method. I was informed that removing the brush head and holding under running water is the only recommended method of cleaning, and they were unable to recommend any other method of getting rid of the deposits, but said they may call back if there is further information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Misleading name “Floss action”: It does not replace flossing and on the product this is mentioned with an asterisk and fine subtext, so there should be no representation even in the name thatit achieves what flossing does.</li>
            <li> After using this product I feel like I just went to the Dentist.  Easy removal and cleaning.  Please do your research on the tooth brushes that this goes with.  It is easy to make a mistake.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried to buy these based on other reviews, but I received genuine Oral-B replacement heads.  The brush-heads work great.  I just wish they were a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> ثلاثة قطع ممتازة للفرشاة اورل بي واصلية وجودتها ممتازة وسعرها مناسب جدا&lt;br /&gt;  وسهلة التنظيف وعملية جدا وبالطبع انصح بها ا</li>
            <li> I used to hate the dentist, not because of anything that he did, but because of my poor brushing habits.  Since we switched to an Oral B electric toothbrush and these heads, things have been totally different.  No more cavities, bad check ups or added expense.  Worth far more than we pay.</li>
            <li> I have used my Oral B electric toothbrush for more than 10 years.  I have tried many different brush heads over time: the Oral-B Floss Action, Oral-B Dual Clean, Oral-B Precision Clean, and Oral-B Pro White.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, my gums would bleed a few times a week after brushing and flossing.  I was using the larger brush head with two parts, the Oral-B Dual Clean, for the past four months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within just three days after switching to this Oral-B Floss Action Brush Head [[ASIN:B000AUIFCA Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Head 3 Count]] my gums have entirely stopped bleeding and the gum condition looks much healthier.  The Dual-Clean heads have a rubber massage component which seems very beneficial to my gums.  Changing brushes every 3-4 months is probably also a good idea.  Thanks to Amazon Prime, I got my order within 48 hours, free shipping, at less than half the price of Walgreens, and it&#x27;s the genuine Oral-B replacement item, not a counterfeit clone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will come back and update this after my next dental appointment if it gets any likes or comments.</li>
            <li> These are a great set of toothbrush heads, for a much better price than biting them in stores. Nicely packaged product.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t always floss, we always mean to though, these are the next best thing. My wife likes this brush head for that reason while I still prefer the traditional brush heads. These have little yellow rubber bristles that vibrate when the toothbrush is engaged and they do an ok job of cleaning between the teeth.  Still not a replacement for real floss.</li>
            <li> This brush works great with the Oral-B Professional system. I switch back and forth from the floss head. I can tell a difference in my teeth since using the system/brush heads..</li>
            <li> Great product that is extremely overpriced they say to replace every three months in my opinion you can easily get 6 months based on average usage as long as bristles not frayed. Again this is just my opinion and I have no cavities.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but necessary for your electric toothbrush and we LOVE our electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li> OEM product.  No fakes on my order.  The real deal.  As advertised, 3 to a pack.  No problems with the product.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> As someone who watches money, I saved to get an Electric Toothbrush. When I started shopping for them, I realized I didn&#x27;t have to because the brush I would pick was $35. I love the Oral B Floss Action and the refills are great. As a household of two, a dab of blue nailpolish on the side of one brush keeps the two distinguishable. These are a great value for the money and they are hard working brushes and bristles.</li>
            <li> Much better than the original ones it replaced. My teeth feel properly brushed.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush, I’ve been buying these for the past 3 years.  They last about 5 months each.</li>
            <li> This made my mouth felt much more cleaner than the standard precision clean.  I noticed some areas of my teeth are getting whiter as well.  Decent price compared to my friends sonicare replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> First time using a toothbrush of this type. Love it!</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes work as well as the original brushes.  After market brushes do not fit well or clean as well.  I recommend the oem replacement.</li>
            <li> I have been using these oral b floss action brushes for a very long time. I don&#x27;t use anything else always a trusted brand you can count on</li>
            <li> Fits and works perfectly on my my Oral B electric toothbrush. The heads clean well and lasts as long as expected.</li>
            <li> Nothing like a new tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Works as replacement heads for Braun Oral B with decent quality and value. Reviews of other products suggest not all are equal.</li>
            <li> Well made product, fit and finish, works as described... unlike the generic brush heads, which have an extra hole that water/spit/tootpaste runs out of while in use.  Suck it up, pay a fw extra bucks and buy the originals.</li>
            <li> Works as they should. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap look alikes</li>
            <li> Thanks for working Oral B replacement brushes. My husband&#x27;s teeth are clean!</li>
            <li> This is the best one of this kind from Oral-B to us.</li>
            <li> I think they wear out a little fast, but they are cheaper than in store.</li>
            <li> why are these so costly, I think because Oral-B knows no one else&#x27;s replacement don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Heads are durable, effective, with a quality build.  It&#x27;s a good value price wise.</li>
            <li> Great brushes. The floss action replacements are my preferred brush in the Oral-B Pro Series. They do a great job at getting between the teeth and cleaning around the gums. I also like the Oral B pro white brush heads, but feel these are superior for cleaning since they get between the teeth better and have stronger bristles for plaque removal.</li>
            <li> This is Good brush replacement heads. My wife really likes this but, it is a little pricey for replacements. All in All this are Good.</li>
            <li> If you bought Oral-B brush-driver you haven&#x27;t another option to buy brush from other brand:). But, Oral-B&#x27;s products quality is very good and all works as expected</li>
            <li> first class transaction all the way! A+++++++++++</li>
            <li> Lets you know when it&#x27;s time to change them out &amp; It feels like you just got a cleaning from the dentist</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to at first, but after a few days, my teeth and gums got used to the &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; cleaning that these brushes provide.  I don&#x27;t think the brushes are intended to eliminate the need for flossing, so the name might be a little misleading.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 of these head now and they work really well.  It&#x27;s best to not leave it on the toothbrush when you&#x27;re not using it as they can become unhygienic.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the good reviews of the Oral-B floss brushes are from years ago and negative reviews are from more recent years:2011 +.  I ordered these brushes and they were obviously a scam, the tip-off being unprofessional packaging.  It appeared someone had purchased the larger pack of brushes, cut off four from the larger pack , repacked them in a unlabeled box and sold them as a Braun product.  I later bought 8 brushes in the Oral-B packaging from Costco-for the same price as the Amazon pack of 4.  I sent the Amazon pack back to Amazon with the reason being they did not appear to be authentic Oral-B product with no response.  My purchase was from Amazon and should not get even one star--but that was the best choice.  Amazon&#x27;s four star reviews are outdated and the older product reviews are much more positive than reviews from 2011-my purchase was 2013.  This is misleading.  The time to fix this problem is long overdue, Amazon.  I even called to report this as this kind of scam is unlike Amazon.</li>
            <li> they do a good job of getting between my teeth although they unfortunately do not replace the need to floss</li>
            <li> What is there to say, we all need to brush our teeth and these work great for a variety of models.</li>
            <li> I have never liked this floss action toothbrush my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean as they did with my old oral b.  I ran out of brush heads so I forced one of the old brush heads onto this toothbrush and it works wonderfully.  My teeth have that just cleaned at the dentist office feeling.  The next oral b I get will not be the floss action if they still make the other style!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an advocate of keeping tooth brushes replaced to get the best oral care. These fir my machine perfectly and were as advertised.</li>
            <li> YES, I would definitely recommend this toothbrush and replacement heads! I continue to get excellent oral health check-ups after having an issue with a periodontal problem!</li>
            <li> I have purchased the generic brand heads that pretty much fit my Oral B, but they&#x27;re terrible and literally fall apart after a few uses. These last a full three months or more, clean extremely well, and are comfortable. They have a color indicator to tell you when to replace them. To my mind, they are a tad pricey, but I would never go for the cheap ones again.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> No issues with this product so far but I just received it and cannot say how it will hold up over time</li>
            <li> Not sure if these are the same as the brushes that come with the original toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;These broke at the junction of the moving head and the extension that fits on the brush itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not honestly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Ok, the tooth brush heads are great and hold up very well even beyond the 3 month recommended changing cycle by dentists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To all those comparing this with the cheaper generic brands available on Amazon, DON&#x27;T!!!&lt;br /&gt;I tried the generic brands and the brush feathers came out piece by piece every time I brushed, you might save few bucks in price but Oral-B&#x27;s are the real deal and well worth it!  your teeth will thank you in the future :)</li>
            <li> Been using the Oral B Professional electric tooth brush for many years and am always amazed at how long the machine has lasted.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the cost of the replacement heads.  How long the heads last is a matter of opinion, they lose their initial stiffness in a couple weeks, then takes a couple months for the blue to wear down.  When to actually swap it out is a matter of opinion.  Buying from Amazon is definitely the only way to go, in the local stores a 3 pack like this can go for over $30.</li>
            <li> Worked very well on linoleum floor.  A few bad spots are still visible but the lighter spots are all gone and the floor has a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> Work well.  Great deal on the subscription plan.</li>
            <li> They do the job. Much more efficient than hand brushing.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I can&#x27;t remember to floss daily. I realize this pretty much makes me a horrible person. But thanks to these, my dentist doesn&#x27;t know that! At my last appointment my dentist was actually impressed with my apparent flossing skills.</li>
            <li> Good replacement heads</li>
            <li> Good toothbrushes.  Glad they come 3/pkg.;  plus I am on the subscription plan so don&#x27;t have to worry about running out.</li>
            <li> I tried a number of different brands and brush heads.  These are my favorite.  They clean really well, are pretty gentle and get food out from between my teeth.  They also last pretty long.</li>
            <li> they fit my oral b professional toothbrush perfectly. Just what i needed! I love this toothbrush. Does a great job at cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> I tried these out and they seem to be similar if not the same as the brush heads that came with my unit.  Teeth feel clean after using it.  Says floss action but I still floss.  I would buy it again.  Price seems good enough to try again.</li>
            <li> Irritate: Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Head are terrible. I realized it too late too return them. The profesioanl clean are MUCH better. These do not leave my teeth smooth and clean and worse the yellow rubber bristles the &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; irritate the gums very bad.  Professional Precision clean  heads are  the way to go. Learn from me .</li>
            <li> Great price for an excellent product. It serves the exact purpose for which it was purchased. I would buy it again from this seller and have already recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> these work fine, but Oral-B keeps revising the toothbrush head line-up in ways that its hard to figure out what you&#x27;re buying, and how the new heads compare to the old ones I used to use.  I&#x27;m not convinced it really matters what heads you have, as long as you have an Oral-B toothbrush</li>
            <li> The units sent were what were advertized,  The product was shipped fast and the price was reasonable.  Thanks for the</li>
            <li> I ordered these because I have been using this elecrric toothbrush for years and needed refills.  Not much moreto tell.</li>
            <li> Good bristles that last awhile and easy to apply to mostly any toothbrush head. I would recommend this to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Always need more brushes.  The floss action ones work great.  Doesn&#x27;t replace flossing but cleans the teeth well.  Good price</li>
            <li> Great price and excellent product.</li>
            <li> I bought these to go along with an Oral-B Precision 3000 brush so my wife could use it as well as me, and I&#x27;d have refills handy in 3 months when the original heads wore out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure which head came standard with the brush so picked these based on description. The floss action head is a bit larger than the standard precision clean head but I like both of them. If your mouth tends to the larger side I certainly recommend trying these replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> Much needed replacement parts!!&lt;br /&gt;Dr jace</li>
            <li> Works well and each brush head lasts around 2-3 months. I would buy this again when my time for refill comes.&lt;br /&gt;It works with the mechanical toothbrush kit I bought from costco.</li>
            <li> It fits my electric toothbrush perfectly. It&#x27;s bristles rubs against your teeth very nicely and it gives you the feeling as if you first leave the dentist&#x27;s office after a cleaning.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrush heads for my toothbrush. Having been sans dental insurance off and on over the past decade, whenever I do get in for a cleaning, the hygienist is usually amazed that I&#x27;ve gone 12+ months without a professional cleaning. Once in the morning with a manual toothbrush, once before bed with this toothbrush, and a good flossing is all I did. I&#x27;ve tried the less expensive Oral-B heads (minus the floss action) and these are far superior. I just wish they were less pricey but compared to expensive trips to the dentist I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
            <li> Even my dental hygenist asked what i was doing differently.  Does a really good job.  Flossing is still required, but this head really does a lot of the job for you!</li>
            <li> Very good at getting out those stubborn food particles, especially if you have gaps between your gums and your teeth--gingivitis.  I have such gaps, and it hurts when food gets stuck in them--even the tiniest piece.  They come out fast and easily when I brush with these!</li>
            <li> I use these every day.  I think they are well made and will hold up well.  I believe they really clean the teeth nicely especially in between the teeth.</li>
            <li> These are the same as the original brush and work the best.  They fit many of the Oral-B brushes and are very easy to install</li>
            <li> Not the larger head with 2 distinct parts, but I actually like the smaller head better. Makes it easier to reach all sides of teeth and it fit the Oral B toothbrush I own. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Works well. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for couple of weeks. the product is overrated on amazon.com. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think the product is good it cleans your teeth fine, but it is probably 5% better than the other O-ral B brushes.</li>
            <li> Very useful. Great quality. I will keep using it. Thanks .&lt;br /&gt;A litter expensive, but acceptable. So anyway a good product</li>
            <li> Like this item. Clean teeth extremely well.</li>
            <li> These are great and are OE.  They leave my teeth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> There are fakes floating around, I suggest you do research to tell the difference. When I popped these out of the packaging, I was thrilled to have authentic brush heads.</li>
            <li> Genuine product, work great!</li>
            <li> I chose this because of the floss action and I would reccomend this to everyone.  My dentist is very pleased with my teeth.</li>
            <li> Previously purchased some generic brand replacement brush heads for dirt cheap and well, they were horrible. The OE brand are much better, provide a better, deeper clean feeling than the generic brand heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Great price for replacement brush heads.  I&#x27;ve been using the oral-b toothbrush for about 10 years and the flossing action of these brush heads is evident at dentist visits.  Does a great job!</li>
            <li> Good deal and timely shipping</li>
            <li> fits better than generic ones, and decent price</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush get good reviews from my dentist on my clean teath.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the Vitality Precision Clean heads to the Floss Action heads.  I used the Floss Action for 6 months (replaced every 3 mos.) and I found them to be extremely uncomfortable.  I had come from a Sonicare (battery model) and it was very comfortable in comparison to the Floss Action.  But since I bought the Floss Actions, I didn&#x27;t want to waste them so I went ahead and used them.  I was contemplating switching back to the Sonicare when they wore out but then saw the Precision Clean heads.  Wow - what a difference.  So much more comfortable and my teeth still feel very clean.  I believe these are a relative bargain in comparison to the Sonicare heads which are much pricier.</li>
            <li> I usually bought these from costco. I didnt notice any difference. From those and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> great way to get what you need with a great amount of convenience</li>
            <li> The floss action brush was of no use since it won&#x27;t work on my brush</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Exactly as shown.  The price is perfect.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Fits my oral B. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Recommend these brushes works very well...</li>
            <li> They work, and so much cheaper than buying at Target. When you see the occasional Amazon coupon appear, snap them up.</li>
            <li> No cavities (not even one) since I started using this product. It makes my teeth feel clean and comes with lovely little bands on the bottom to personalize. This is a winner!</li>
            <li> These are perfect for my electric toothbrush, and much less than the cost of the same brush heads in my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Always love Oral B products</li>
            <li> performs as stated. will use again</li>
            <li> Just getting my replacements because I love it and can&#x27;t go wrong. plus its alottttt cheaper here on amazon than other places! woot woot</li>
            <li> Pearly whites are gleaming</li>
            <li> These work really well minimizing plaque buildup, cleaning gum pockets and keeping gums healthy etc.  Just had a 6 month cleaning, and the hygienist was commenting on how little plaque she had to remove.</li>
            <li> work as expected.  be good to your teeth and be gentle with them with these kinds of brushes. They aren&#x27;t exactly soft sensitive. No reason to push hard. Just cover the areas of your teeth softly and repeatedly.</li>
            <li> Perfect for routine use. Economically priced and hardy instrument.</li>
            <li> After coaching for years, I finally broke down and purchased an Oral-B toothbrush (with regular and Floss Action heads) and actually eliminated the need for minor oral surgery after using it for a few months [probably not typical]. Finding brand name replacement Floss Action brush heads at this price was great!</li>
            <li> I have used other versions of brush for this handle, however i was dissatisfied with the results&lt;br /&gt;and wear life. So i switched the configuration to this item, it is somewhat more expensive but worth&lt;br /&gt;the bucks. Now all need is for Oral B not to improve it like the last version. Apparantly, the old one was lasting to long.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different heads, including the dual clean and precision clean heads. The floss action is my favorite. My teath and gums feel like I just came from the dentist. The dual action is my second favorite.</li>
            <li> These heads work great! A bit big for a smaller mouth though.  I am a dental hygienist and would highly recommend electric toothbrushes for just about everyone!</li>
            <li> love these toothbrush heads they work so good, love the floss action for a deeper clean definitely worth paying more for the name brand</li>
            <li> Just my preference, I like the old style better.  This new one is a little too stiff for me.&lt;br /&gt;Costco has good offer too.  Better check it out before commit to this offer.</li>
            <li> It goes without saying that it is essential to get an Brush Head Replacement pack, as the Brush itself is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure this does enough flossing, so I do floss the regular way, and also use a waterpik,  However, it can&#x27;t hurt, and these brush heads last  about 4 months.  A bit expensive, but health is worth it.</li>
            <li> Quick way to replenish my brush heads.  These are the best.  Whiter, cleaner teeth! Love that they ship so quickly.</li>
            <li> bought these as replacement heads for my toothbrush and they work well...what more can I say except they do the job and I like them</li>
            <li> Oral-B replacement brush heads are ridiculously expensive. I sometimes find entire Oral-B electric toothbrushes for less than these replacement brush heads. These are the best of the replacement heads. One gripe I have with the Oral-B brush heads is that smelly foul-tasting crud builds up in the opening in the side of the shaft. But off-brand replacement heads I&#x27;ve tried are even worse, usually being abrasive to the lips or crudding-up around the moving brush.</li>
            <li> Great for use before retiring at night if you can&#x27;t floss! I use the standard Oral-B in the morning. Great check-ups!</li>
            <li> I thought the Oral-B cleaned pretty well, until I recently switched over to a Philips Sonicare. After switched, I brushed much cleaner and my gums are less sensitive. Perhaps the Floss Action wasn&#x27;t right for me, but I&#x27;m much happier with the Sonicare now than when I had the Oral-B.</li>
            <li> These are good cause they are soft.  The brushes that come with the other ones are to hard for me.  So I purchase these.</li>
            <li> These are brush refills for the toothbrush . . . hard to say more than that - I like them.</li>
            <li> They work...I&#x27;m not sure if they are %100 legit but hey it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have a real problem with plaque. I was using a store brand that looks something like this, but it never got my teeth clean like these do.</li>
            <li> These things are too hard and make my gums and teeth sensitive.  I think the wal-mart knock off brand is better in that the bristles aren&#x27;t has hard.</li>
            <li> Product is great. Does its job and last a for over a month. However, I was able to find the product cheaper at Sam&#x27;s Club</li>
            <li> These are the real McCoy, works great, and the Dentist even thinks I floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cavities on the kids have dissapeared, and the heads have good durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why 4 stars, I only give 5 stars to truly outstanding products.  These are very good.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as advertised.  Wont fit Oral B Pulsonic.</li>
            <li> Tried &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; heads, but they simply fell apart.  This is the original and worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell the difference with regular heads, but I like them all so it&#x27;s fine.  The price was right with a coupon and I like these toothbrushes, they work better than a manual brush and cost less than Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I use these on a daily basis, and they are awesome! I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> These are the best heads for keeping your teeth cavity free and clean - love them.  Even my dentists over the years are always asking what kind of electric toothbrush I use because my teeth are in such good shape.</li>
            <li> I really like these brush heads. I use it every other day as I also like the stain removing head. They can be too much for someone with sensitive gums, however.</li>
            <li> This is an item that I endose. They work well, and get the job done for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve invested in the item for quit some time, and have no issues with it at all.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, you have to make sure you&#x27;re getting the right brush that you want/need.  Oral-B makes a variety of brushes, and this happens to be the one that I like best, though I have to say that I haven&#x27;t tried many of the others.  I actually had a coupon, and was going to purchase these at a local drugstore. . but. . after I got there, even with the coupon, Amazon was MUCH lower in price, so I&#x27;m glad I checked!</li>
            <li> great price, good value for all three brush heads. Head has built in indicator so you can replace when necessary. Gets in between teeth.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use these toothbrush heads and since I had a free trial of Amazon Prime I wound up purchasing these.  With free shipping from Amazon, the price was about $0.30 less than the same product at Target.  Not a huge difference, but enough that I decided to go for it to take advantage of the Prime.  Aside from price, I think the toothbrush heads are great.  This brush/head were recommended by my dentist.  I&#x27;ll be curious what they say at my next cleaning in a couple of weeks!  So far, my teeth look cleaner and I feel healthier!  Also: even though these say they are flossing brushes, my dentist said you DO have to actually floss still so unfortunately these won&#x27;t give you a shortcut to the finish line in the bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE on 7/13/13: The toothbrush and heads are DEFINITELY working.  I went in for a cleaning and my hygienist was impressed, particularly since I&#x27;m now pregnant and pregnant women generally have problems with bleeding gums.  My gums were great!  I confess: despite being told that I should still floss regularly, I&#x27;m not a very regular flosser at all so the fact that I had the pregnancy also working against me and yet my gums and teeth were in great shape was an excellent sign.  I will definitely continue using these toothbrush heads and will (almost) look forward to my next cleaning!</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Do the job well and last long</li>
            <li> You do need to change them every 3-6 months, the difference between one that I used for longer and one of the new ones was very stark. The new one seems to be able to clean your teeth much much much more efficiently, don&#x27;t skimp out on it.</li>
            <li> These are really nice typical toothbrush replacements - they get the job done. Fits my Oral-B and lasts a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Only included 3 not 4 as advertised. So was much too expensive.</li>
            <li> These really do a nice job of oral cleaning.</li>
            <li> Great product, cheaper then the local drug store.</li>
            <li> Such a value! Come in very handy.</li>
            <li> Much better than ones that came with machine</li>
            <li> I have been using the Oral-B Vitality electric toothbrush for about six years now, and have used several different toothbrush heads with it.  The Floss Action brush is by far my favorite.  It&#x27;s unique design does, indeed, give it the superior cleaning action that the packaging says it does, and it cleans my teeth better than other toothbrush heads do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers claim that this toothbrush head is fake, that it doesn&#x27;t stay on their toothbrush or it doesn&#x27;t work.  However, they may have been using it on the wrong electric toothbrush.  The packaging clearly states that this does not fit the Vitality Sonic, Sonic Complete, Pulsonic, or CrossAction Power toothbrushes.  (Curiously, this statement is on the back of the package rather than on the front, and the packaging does not list the toothbrush models that it does fit.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heartily recommend this for those people who have the appropriate Oral-B / Braun electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The floss head works better than the stock all bristle head for the oral-B electric toothbrush (in my experience). Feels pleasant as it sweeps your gums. There is less bristle, so it doesn&#x27;t take as much toothpaste and it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the stock head (i probably push too hard though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews saying people received fake product. I bought mine &amp;#34;ships from Amazon.com&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s definitely genuine, made in Germany. Just a thought.</li>
            <li> Standard oral b tooth brush heads like the ones that came with my toothbrush. They&#x27;re fantastic and come with extra color band identifiers.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get this brush head for some time now. So when it was time to purchase replacement brush heads, I opted for this product. Unfortunately, the plastic floss bristles are very hard. Too hard for my gums and I fear too hard for most as well.</li>
            <li> Awful actually hurts to brush.</li>
            <li> These are the best most comprehensive toothbrush heads you can buy.  Very comfortable, durable, and effective.  I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> I like that the brush is designed to help one get to hard to get to places in one&#x27;s teeth.  I hope that my next check up will show that it has been well work buying the replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> I have been using these since discovering them by accident, and although I have the regular heads, I buy more of these. I think they do the best job of cleaning teeth properly.</li>
            <li> The round brush heads are the best!!! Love this product!!</li>
            <li> These brush heads are fine.  It&#x27;s hard to get excited about a replacement brush, but I&#x27;m glad they exist because I don&#x27;t ever want to be without my electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for now 10 years and must say this is the best brush head Oral-B ever made. Now when I visit with my Dentist he stated that my teeth&#x27;s are better no more drilling...Oral-B is better then the normal circle head brushes that comes with most Oral-B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Everytime I brush my teeth with my Oral-B electric toothbrush, I feel like I just came from the dentist&#x27;s office after a cleaning.  The replacement brush head really gets into all the nooks and crannies.  I like the way the brush head lets you know when it is time to replace it.  I get the replacement brush heads through the Amazon Subscribe and Save program which makes it really nice, both in price and convenience.</li>
            <li> My dentist says thank you.</li>
            <li> You can not use this item with the pacemaker restrictions and to learn the restrictions you must open the box to read the instruction which then will not allow you return it since the box has been opened.</li>
            <li> Fits well, easy to attach, last longer than the generics.</li>
            <li> Bristles are far to hard and hurt my teeth.  I used one brush head for a week thinking it would get softer but didn&#x27;t.  I threw out the rest of the brush heads.</li>
            <li> MY dentist recommended this brush to me several years ago and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  They offer about 10 different types of brush heads but these are my favorite.</li>
            <li> I read a few of the reviews both positive and negative before I bought this.  I respect those who bought it and discovered they had received some generic knockoff-- I think their complaints were looked into by Amazon because the ones I received were genuine.  Thanks to them for keeping us alert to scams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My toothbrush fell off the counter and the neck and head snapped off.  When these arrived, I immediately snapped on a new head and it immediately worked as if nothing ever happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look out for the sale I got, which is $7 off Oral-B&#x27;s entire line, including single replacement heads.</li>
            <li> So far they seem as good as the standard heads. I don&#x27;t think they replace proper flossing, but the price is similar to the standard heads, so I would probably choose them again</li>
            <li> What go wrong with these. Just make sure they have floss thing in the brush so make sure what you are buying.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Oral-B Dual Clean brushes for years. I thought I was ordering more of the same but didn&#x27;t enlarge the picture for a better look. Now that I have the  floss action brushes by mistake, I think I will stick with them. They seem to do a better job of cleaning at the gum line and between the teeth.</li>
            <li> Great value and I rarely get cavities now.</li>
            <li> good and easy to change it.</li>
            <li> these pack of brush head is convenient for me, so I won&#x27;t forget to buy/purchase brushes if I&#x27;m out of the used brushes. So this pack is good, the brushes are also good for my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral B for years.  I was so  happy to find them on Amazon since it is hard to find in drug stores.  My mouth feels so clean and it get in between my teeth really well.</li>
            <li> I dread buying the Oral-B replacement brushes in local stores because of the cost and because they can be hard to find. Usually when I have a coupon I don&#x27;t need a replacement and when I need one there are no coupons around.  Shopping Amazon saves on gas and time and money.</li>
            <li> Like Oral-B products. Have used for years and will continue to do so as long as I have teeth  Use at home and while travelling.</li>
            <li> great value and great price. fits perfectly on my oral b electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve had for years.</li>
            <li> Talk about deep cleaning! these heads work great and can be used as your primary head. just so you know, if you are a hard brusher it wont last super long.</li>
            <li> i bought to test all the replacements, it is ok to have it but i prefer the sensitive gum one. it is smoother and doesn&#x27;t hurt like this</li>
            <li> Fit and function as as expected.</li>
            <li> My teeth never felt cleaner!</li>
            <li> I never had an electric toothbrush before.  The replacement brushes last a long time and good quality.  My dentist appointments are much shorter, I have a lot less plaque.</li>
            <li> I buy these through Subscribe and Save...and I do SAVE money. Excellent product and much cheaper than going to store to buy</li>
            <li> 3 at this price! Can you say &amp;#34;deal!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as the regular tips.  Great for gums though.</li>
            <li> Did not fit my old unit!</li>
            <li> Maybe a little overpriced for replacements... oh well.</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered, but I find it strange that replacement brushes are always sold in packages of odd numbers.  We are a two-person household.</li>
            <li> So much better than the generic heads I bought last time!</li>
            <li> I decided to get the floss action replacement heads as opposed to the normal bristle heads to try them out and see if I liked them better. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. It was a little uncomfortable brushing at first, but now I look forward to brushing my teeth in the morning because the floss action does such a good job and my teeth look and feel cleaner. By &amp;#34;feel cleaner&amp;#34; I mean that my teeth feel totally smooth afterward, no rough deposits or anything else is missed by these heads. I&#x27;ll be using these from now on.</li>
            <li> OEM for my family Oral-B.  Less time at the dentist. I hate to floss and this works great.</li>
            <li> Use them every day.&lt;br /&gt;These are the original Oral B Brush Head Replacements.  They work perfectly for a long life,. and beat all to heck the generic refills sold by CVS.  In addition, these Floss Action heads are far superior to the original brush heads.  If you have a choice, get the Floss Action Replacement Brush Heads!!</li>
            <li> Order every three months</li>
            <li> These brush heads are great.</li>
            <li> Good replacement heads</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Works well.</li>
            <li> great price, easy to order!</li>
            <li> This automatic refill program saves me money.  Not only are the refill brush heads cheaper than what I would pay at the store, but they are delivered to my home.  I can select how many I want delivered and how often.  Also, I can cancel whenever I need to.  This is important to me because if the toothbrush breaks and I end up buying a non-Oral B toothbrush, I don&#x27;t have to worry about ending up with refill brush heads that I won&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> These make me drool, I prefer the Precision Clean heads.</li>
            <li> The real deal...not generic as some were saying they received</li>
            <li> As yet we have still not received this item so cannot review which I feel is pretty poor when we ordered it over six weeks ago but you were quick enough to take our money</li>
            <li> This product is great quality, easy to use and cleans extremely well.  I still use floss, but the brush head cleans almost as well!  They also last longer than I expected.  I will definitely continue to reorder</li>
            <li> This Oral-B brush was recommended by my dentist.  All I can say is that my mouth feels clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Do not need want to return</li>
            <li> excellent product with precious description,I like this way of dealing specially online.Also, delivering time and packaging are indicate for those people are professional.</li>
            <li> These brushes work well and last awhile, my only complaint is they stopped including the sensor which would flash and tell you it needed changing.  Now you need to look at the brushes and change them when the blue part is half way faded.</li>
            <li> I really think these brushes make a difference no matter which of the handles you use them on. Teeth feel cleaner and look whiter than the &#x27;professional&#x27; brush that comes as standard equipment.</li>
            <li> These heads are quite different from the regular heads that I use to purchase.  These are larger, does more vibrating for cleaning teeth and getting to those back teeth.  This brush head also will help to floss your teeth much better than the traditional heads for Oral B.  I would highly recommend them as a better alternative for your Oral B brush.  You will love it.</li>
            <li> Would have given it a 5-star but I think the price should be lower, the construction is the same as the gerneric brand.</li>
            <li> The Oral B leaves our mouthes and teeth clean and refreshing. It also makes your gums feel invigorated and fresh.</li>
            <li> I love my Oral B toothbrush and the brushes. The work really well and would hate to ever have to go back to a manual toothbrush ever again.</li>
            <li> I love my toothbrush head it gets to the heard to reach places. I would die without my oral B toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is great for those who have been told they need to floss more often. The yellow hard bristles get as far as possible in between your teeth to really help clean up well! I&#x27;ve noticed an overall improvement in my gums and my dentist agrees!</li>
            <li> Pros: I choose this product for the affordability and flexibility and comfortable to use vice flossing and it is working just fine since I do not have to floss as much I used to.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not noticed any problem so far.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Great product, performs as expected.</li>
            <li> My teeth are soooooooo clean!</li>
            <li> These are good but they don&#x27;t last even 1 month and they&#x27;re supposed to last 3 months - I don&#x27;t think so</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush and refills.  Not sure what else i can say but the oral b is a great product.  The base has an incredible battery life and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say about tooth brush heads? They work!</li>
            <li> I have an electric tooth brush that has been a bllesing,  So I bought replacements and both have worked just perfect, no problems at all.</li>
            <li> I bought these refills to replace the original brush heads on my Oral-B. The refills slip on easily and fit just like the original. They also come with a few assorted color plastic rings that can be added so you can tell the brushes apart if you have more than one user. The floss action is great for getting a professional cleaning feel at home. I&#x27;ve tried many other types of toothbrushes, but these really work best. Also, the price of this 3-pack was much better than the 2-pack I saw in the drugstore.</li>
            <li> This is brush head replacement for what I bought for my wife 3 months ago. Instructions are to replace the heads every 3 months or when the heads begin to deform whichever comes first. I selected this set cause it is also good for the gums. Oral-B is same as Braun which is a German manufacturer of many electric appliances that last and last and last. They are the Maytags of small appliances many of which are made for the kitchen.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It makes my teeth feel extremely clean. However, as a dental professional, I would advise that those with sensitive gums or receding gums alternate between a manual toothbrush and this power toothbrush. I think using this constantly is too hard on the gums. I have healthy gums and I alternate between a manual and power brush to prevent recession.</li>
            <li> The Oral B Professional Floss Action replacement brushes are always my favorite, Still have to use floss, but they really work the best for my sonic tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the originals!!</li>
            <li> These are too aggressive and hard on the gums and the heads are larger so they chatter against the teeth at certain angles.&lt;br /&gt;Not a good thing. bigger is not better</li>
            <li> Was so happy to receive my brush heads.  To order from your chart is accurate.  I have to return the ones I bought at the store which do not fit.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying them in retail stores. Factory replacements, hard to complain about these.  My brush had been going strong for 4 years now so finding heads at a decent price was a must.</li>
            <li> They include little plastic rings, so if more than one person uses the base, you can tell whose is whose.</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes are ok. Not my top choice but work ok. I prefer the brushes that have the yellow plastic flossing strips on the  brush head.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these brush heads.  My first time trying them and I think they clean much better than the standard head.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrush heads because they really make your teeth feel squeaky clean.  It is as though you are&lt;br /&gt;actually flossing between your teeth and the little rubber pieces seem to protect the bristles and make them last so much longer.</li>
            <li> Fits my Oral-B power base perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;I feel this really getting up into the gum line of my teeth (where I commonly suffer from caries {those lead to cavities btw})&lt;br /&gt;Leaves me with a very clean feeling mouth!&lt;br /&gt;Heads last just as long as a toothbrush!</li>
            <li> These heads work so well.  I have used this head for years and love it.  The price is great also.</li>
            <li> This is a factory replacement part, so the heads fit and work perfectly.  Whether you&#x27;ll like these &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; heads is a matter of personal preference.  They are considerably more aggressive that the regular heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve shopped around, you know that these are surprisingly expensive most places.  The price here at Amazon is the best I&#x27;ve been able to find.</li>
            <li> The flossing action tends to be a little rough, I think I will return to the regular brush when it is time to replace.</li>
