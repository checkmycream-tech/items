            <li> It was totally worth the money and I hope they come out with more sets in the future. I will buy many more</li>
            <li> My skin tone resembles Kelly Rowland&#x27;s (singer)  so pink ice gloss was too light... beautiful was &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; but NUDE was perfect!  I love the packaging and I received the shipment on time.</li>
            <li> Product not as glossy as described.  I would have returned it, but return shipping too costly.  It feels very sticky on my lips.  Colors are not that pretty.</li>
            <li> I have naturally big lips that require coverage most of the time.  This product covers my lips flawlessly but also if it wears off, it doesn&#x27;t leave my lips terribly chapped like other glosses, which is really nice.  The colors are nice neutrals that I typically blend with a pencil or darker lipstick shade when I want to change up my look. The only downside is that I didn&#x27;t find this product sooner in life!</li>
            <li> So my order came super early got to love that. The Natural lip color is absolutely perfect. finally a nude color that compliments the skin tone rather than washing you out and looking flat. The other colors are just as nice and very moist on the lips.</li>

            <li> I have ordered several NYX products lately and I have to say that I love them! The smell is really great (fruity) and the colors are nice and soft. I really like them to top off pretty much any lip color so I use them daily. There are a bit sticky for those that don&#x27;t like that, it might be a turn-off from this product, but I don&#x27;t mind it. Between these and the butter glosses, I&#x27;m set!</li>
            <li> Great product, love the colors and they also smell really good. A great value for the price.</li>
