            <li>The price was great too for the number of ounces.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and it is great.</li>
            <li>and it does a great job moisturizing my face, neck and hands.</li>

            <li>Smells amazing &amp; works like a charm!</li>
            <li>I love the avalon organics line, but I am not as impressed with the night creme.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t think it has done much good either.  </li>
            <li>I need two or three pumps for good coverage.  </li>
            <li>Good product , I have used it for10-15 years .</li>
            <li>I just turned 30 and wanted to start adding in eye cream and a good anti aging night cream for prevention.</li>

            <li>Love it all!</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m on to Alaffia products which I love!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>I love the lavender!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell yet if it effective.  </li>
            <li>It feels fresher to me and absorbs nicely.  </li>
            <li>Though this products gives my skin a nice feel and appearance, there&#x27;s an ingredient in it which has an offensive odor to me.  </li>
            <li>and this one is pretty good for the price!</li>
            <li>I do like the product it may not be suitable for oily or combination skin.</li>
            <li>I love the light scent and just feel good putting something more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; on my skin.  </li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s better than nothing.  </li>
            <li>I have many allergies</li>
            <li>And better yet, the price is a bargain.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Have ordered it before and am pleased with the product my wife uses it</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>This used to be more lotion</li>
            <li>I had purchased it many times, but will never purchase it again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So more toxic.&lt;br /&gt;BTW</li>
            <li>I have yet to see breakouts and feel plumper and more glowing each morning.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I think it is a great night cream!</li>
            <li>Love, love, LOVE this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The ingredients in the product I know and love are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t the magical elixir I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I have to unscrew the top to use it by scooping out the content.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite, but will use it until it is gone and try something else.</li>
            <li>Great product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Works great, but the price seems high to me for the size of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>The old formula was great, used the cleanser to.</li>
            <li>I wish it was unscented, but other than that, its great!</li>
            <li>The pump opening is very tiny -- thus needing 2-3 pumps for adequate product to do face and neck -- but that is a very good feature.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy using the day cream, I think it has something to do with the Q-10 ingredient.</li>
            <li>I like the light scent and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin has looked really smooth since i have been using it.</li>
            <li>About 2-3 squirts each morning and evening on face and neck works well to keep my fifty-something skin reasonably smooth.  </li>
            <li>It has nice lavender smell and smooth texture which I really like.  </li>
            <li>It really keeps her face clean and nice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years, ever since I visited my daughter and she remarked how smooth  and nice my facial skin  looked.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this is a very light lotion, nice scent, and has really helped my dry face become more supple.</li>
            <li>So far, I have really liked this night creme.</li>
            <li>The main thing I like about it is that it feels very light on the skin.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the formula change, it doesn&#x27;t smell as good, takes more product to get the same results, and the pump doesn&#x27;t work very well and clogs easily.</li>
            <li>and I received the item by mail quickly.</li>
            <li>It can go quick.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, but in the morning, I can still tell that it is there when I wash my face.</li>
            <li>After trying many, many products, I can only recommend tea tree oil to fight acne, and flaxseed oil for skin quality/wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The new \\&quot;more sustainable\\&quot; formula makes my face feel</li>
            <li>This stuff makes me break out (lightly) and doesn&#x27;t seem to do much else.</li>
            <li>and it seems to help keep skin healthy and young looking.</li>
            <li>Worth the $$$</li>
            <li>but I found it worth it for the quality of the cream and the appropriateness of the pump to the amount of product needed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sorry to say, I much prefer the original product.</li>
            <li>It was just right.</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin soft and more vibrant.</li>
            <li>First of all...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really speak to it&#x27;s wrinkle-reducing properties, but I&#x27;d like to think that if I use it for awhile it will help!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be aware that the product package picture here on Amazon is of the old packaging and the original product.  </li>
            <li>I guess it IS more of a creme than a lotion, but my skin starts feeling really dry</li>
            <li>and it really works.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Product is quite nice...rich &amp; creamy and goes on smoothly but after only 10 days the pump doesn&#x27;t work!!!  </li>
            <li>I have always just used the day time creme (didn&#x27;t have the whole line).  </li>
            <li>very fast!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>, i really feel my skin is getting healthier and fresher than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so then i will know the real effects</li>
            <li>I feel like my skin is much smoother now and some of the wrinkles I had before are diminishing.  </li>
            <li>That really turns me off.</li>
            <li>definately something worth giving a shot was pleasantly surprised highly recomend it</li>
            <li>I am hoping in the long run it will help reduce the appearance of my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give a complete review because I haven&#x27;t really used it much.</li>
            <li>This night cream  is not thick and sticky and I do not wake up with a greasy face.</li>
            <li>I only gave it four stars because I think for someone that wants to reverse signs of moderate-deep wrinkles this might not be rich enough.  </li>
            <li>But what you will get when you order is the new stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since the new packaging contains all the same wording as on the original package, I assumed that I got the same</li>
            <li>This product glides on and isn&#x27;t oily at all, it just leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated all night!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find something for combination skin or even oily skin because many things can cause breakouts and most aging creams are thick.</li>
            <li>The scent is minimal which I like when I&#x27;m going to bed, and it&#x27;s light enough to use year-round.  </li>
            <li>It has done no harm to my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sooo soft.  </li>
            <li>this cream works well on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The old formula would have gotten five stars.  </li>
            <li>Smelled like old flowers.  </li>
            <li>two bottles that I recently ordered were in new packaging.  </li>
            <li>Well, my daughter is very picky and not free with commpliments, so I knew she really meant it.</li>
            <li>I guess I will just enjoy my slowly aging body naturally as God intended.  </li>
            <li>So many of the other night cremes I&#x27;ve tried feel too heavy.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This was not a thick cream but possible the strong smell is irritating my skin clogging it up making pimples.</li>

            <li> This was not a thick cream but possible the strong smell is irritating my skin clogging it up making pimples.</li>
            <li> I have normal to slightly oily skin</li>
            <li> I bought a different brand that cost less but did not have the pump - big mistake for how wasteful it was.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry skin I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and does not feel like it&#x27;s hydrating my skin much.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to report.  </li>
            <li> I want to try their other products now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually i got my other items around 2-3 weeks, but this one in about 10 days</li>
            <li> I should have listened to other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I usually use avalon organics regular face lotion.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to start preventing wrinkles before they happen but still need to be careful not to create break-outs I am prone to with too heavy of creams.  </li>
            <li> A little pricier than the other CoQ10 creams</li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea if it is making my wrinkles less noticeable or not</li>
            <li> using two night cream for now, so maybe it&#x27;s a little bias...</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t tell yet if it effective.  I have used others and they are all about the same.  I still have my same wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This creme I have tried before and it really works.&lt;br /&gt;The service was excellent  and I received the item by mail quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now.  There&#x27;s not much to report.  It has done no harm to my sensitive skin.  But I don&#x27;t think it has done much good either.  The smell bothers me a bit, as does the texture.  It&#x27;s very thick and does not feel like it&#x27;s hydrating my skin much.  I need two or three pumps for good coverage.  All in all, it&#x27;s better than nothing.  I won&#x27;t buy it again though.</li>
            <li> Good product , I have used it for10-15 years .</li>
            <li> Been using this product for 2 years now after seeing it on the news.  It was rated as one of the few moisturizers that truly work.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Just tried this and I was skeptical until I noticed immediately that my skin looked smoother (especially around my eyes)and looked younger and healthier.  My skin is sooo soft.  I have normal to slightly oily skin and this didn&#x27;t make my skin greasy at all.  I want to try their other products now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years, ever since I visited my daughter and she remarked how smooth  and nice my facial skin  looked. Well, my daughter is very picky and not free with commpliments, so I knew she really meant it. At that point I&#x27;d been using the day cream for about 6 months. So when I saw the night cream, I immediately ordered it. This night cream  is not thick and sticky and I do not wake up with a greasy face. I also enjoy using the day cream, I think it has something to do with the Q-10 ingredient. I have many allergies anf this cream works well on my sensitive skin. And better yet, the price is a bargain.</li>
            <li> Product is quite nice...rich &amp; creamy and goes on smoothly but after only 10 days the pump doesn&#x27;t work!!!  I tapped the bottom on a hard surface as directions stated but it didn&#x27;t help.  Won&#x27;t buy again unles Avalon decides to put this cream in a &amp;#34;non pump&amp;#34; container/jar.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this is a very light lotion, nice scent, and has really helped my dry face become more supple.</li>
            <li> The old formula was great, used the cleanser to. The new \\&quot;more sustainable\\&quot; formula makes my face feel like is has a film on it and it doesn&#x27;t absorb as well.  the bottle is also a pain, hardly any comes out when I pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old formula would have gotten five stars.  I&#x27;ll be switching products now :(</li>
            <li> I have used Avalon organics creme for a few years now, and I really like it.  I have always just used the day time creme (didn&#x27;t have the whole line).  So, I decided to give the rest of the product line a try.  I was expecting the night time creme to be thicker than the day time one?  But it is actually thinner, and of course has no sun block.  So I sometimes use it on icky, winter days, when I don&#x27;t feel like having a thicker layer on my skin.  It feels fresher to me and absorbs nicely.  So, I guess this isn&#x27;t my night time creme...it&#x27;s my winter day&#x27;s creme :)  I will buy this product again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Have ordered it before and am pleased with the product my wife uses it and it is the best wrinkle cream that she has tried</li>
            <li> First of all...the shipment of my item very fast!!&lt;br /&gt;Usually i got my other items around 2-3 weeks, but this one in about 10 days&lt;br /&gt;Great work!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the cream, i really feel my skin is getting healthier and fresher than before.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using two night cream for now, so maybe it&#x27;s a little bias...but in a few days&lt;br /&gt;my night cream from the doctor will run out..so then i will know the real effects&lt;br /&gt;of my avalon on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all for now, but definitely will buy again!</li>
            <li> I just turned 30 and wanted to start adding in eye cream and a good anti aging night cream for prevention. This is causing me to breakout. I do like the product it may not be suitable for oily or combination skin. It&#x27;s hard to find something for combination skin or even oily skin because many things can cause breakouts and most aging creams are thick. This was not a thick cream but possible the strong smell is irritating my skin clogging it up making pimples. Overall I like the product but not for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but I have been using it for years and it seems to help keep skin healthy and young looking.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of the night creme. The main thing I like about it is that it feels very light on the skin. So many of the other night cremes I&#x27;ve tried feel too heavy.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for awhile after a friend told her about it.  It really keeps her face clean and nice.  Worth the $$$</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin soft and more vibrant. I use the facial cleanser and lotions as well. I am pleased with the results</li>
            <li> I have uses this item for years and have to say I forgot and bought this on amazon for the second time.  The pump doesnt work becuse the product is too thick.  This is not the same formla that i buy at Wholefoods and Vitamin Shopp.  Beware!</li>
            <li> Great product helps a lot with your face. definately something worth giving a shot was pleasantly surprised highly recomend it</li>
            <li> I like this stuff a lot.  The scent is minimal which I like when I&#x27;m going to bed, and it&#x27;s light enough to use year-round.  I can&#x27;t really speak to it&#x27;s wrinkle-reducing properties, but I&#x27;d like to think that if I use it for awhile it will help!</li>
            <li> Smells good and feels nice.  I have no idea if it is making my wrinkles less noticeable or not but I like this product.</li>
            <li> This works great! I can already see a difference. I use the Avalon wrinkle defense cream, wrinkle defense night cream, lavendar face lotion and the cleansing milk with CoQ10. Love it all!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to work like I remember.  :-(</li>
            <li> Made my face break out horribly. Smelled like old flowers.  Used it for about a week &amp; never again. I should have listened to other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for two years now and I love it.  I feel like my skin is much smoother now and some of the wrinkles I had before are diminishing.  It has nice lavender smell and smooth texture which I really like.  A great great GREAT product from Avalon Organics.&lt;br /&gt;Best of all Amazon delivers it to my door steps within a day or two.</li>
            <li> Great product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This used to be more lotion like and I used it in the day time too. I had purchased it many times, but will never purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;It also used to have a 2 score on ewg.org/skindeep now it&#x27;s a 3! So more toxic.&lt;br /&gt;BTW I also tried the day formula with the spf15 in it and can&#x27;t stand that one either. Now I&#x27;m on to Alaffia products which I love!</li>
            <li> I love the avalon organics line, but I am not as impressed with the night creme. I guess it IS more of a creme than a lotion, but my skin starts feeling really dry about 10 to 15 minutes after applying. I don&#x27;t use it too often. I usually use avalon organics regular face lotion.</li>
            <li> Too thick for my liking.</li>
            <li> Works great, but the price seems high to me for the size of the bottle.  It can go quick.</li>
            <li> I have looked around for a night cream for a while and this one is pretty good for the price! I have combination skin and am entering my mid-thirties so I wanted to start preventing wrinkles before they happen but still need to be careful not to create break-outs I am prone to with too heavy of creams.  This product glides on and isn&#x27;t oily at all, it just leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated all night! I have yet to see breakouts and feel plumper and more glowing each morning.  I love the light scent and just feel good putting something more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; on my skin.  I only gave it four stars because I think for someone that wants to reverse signs of moderate-deep wrinkles this might not be rich enough.  Overall, I think it is a great night cream!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and find it one of the few creams that doesn&#x27;t sting my face.  However, the redesigned bottle does not work.  Even from the beginning I had to use the straw of the pump as a scoop to get the product out.</li>
            <li> I like the product a lot. It feels good on my skin and I believe it works. however the pump was broken when I received it in the mail.</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE this moisturizer. I use it day &amp; night. Smells amazing &amp; works like a charm!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought Avalon Organics CoQ10 Wrinkle Defense Night Creme for several years.  The ingredients in the product I know and love are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic Lavandula Angustifolia (lavender), chamomilla recutita (chamomile), camellia sinensis (white tea) and organic arnica montana extracts (aqueous), organic helianthus annuus (sunflower) oil, vegetable glycerin, sodium hyaluronate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, cetyl alcohol, glyceryl stearate, organic simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, stearyl alcohol, butyrospermum parkii (shea butter), cetyl ricinoleate, phenoxyethanol, benzyl alcohol, potassium sorbate, tocopherol ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two bottles that I recently ordered were in new packaging.  Since the new packaging contains all the same wording as on the original package, I assumed that I got the same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WRONG.  The ingredients have drastically changed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe, Water, C10-18 triglycerides, polyglyceryl-6 disterate, glycerine, clyceryl sterate, sunflower seed oil, jojoba seed oil, cetyl alcohol...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that the product package picture here on Amazon is of the old packaging and the original product.  But what you will get when you order is the new stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to say, I much prefer the original product.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the formula change, it doesn&#x27;t smell as good, takes more product to get the same results, and the pump doesn&#x27;t work very well and clogs easily. AO, what were you thinking?!?</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t the magical elixir I was hoping for.  But I haven&#x27;t used it diligently.  I guess I will just enjoy my slowly aging body naturally as God intended.  :)</li>
            <li> The plunger of the bottle was blocked.  I have to unscrew the top to use it by scooping out the content.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for the past seven years.  I like the light scent and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> This made my skin feel youthful and replenished.  The price was great too for the number of ounces.  It was not too heavy or too greasy.  It was just right.</li>
            <li> So far, I have really liked this night creme. I am hoping in the long run it will help reduce the appearance of my fine lines and wrinkles. It is light weight and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! My skin has looked really smooth since i have been using it. I have actually been using it in the morning and at bedtime. I wish it was unscented, but other than that, its great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the Avalon CoQ10 line to be very effective. The night cream is mid-weight and goes on without any odor. It absorbs quickly, but in the morning, I can still tell that it is there when I wash my face.</li>
            <li> I tried a couple of CoQ10 creams and came back to this one.  About 2-3 squirts each morning and evening on face and neck works well to keep my fifty-something skin reasonably smooth.  The pump opening is very tiny -- thus needing 2-3 pumps for adequate product to do face and neck -- but that is a very good feature. I bought a different brand that cost less but did not have the pump - big mistake for how wasteful it was.  You only need a very small amount.  A little pricier than the other CoQ10 creams but I found it worth it for the quality of the cream and the appropriateness of the pump to the amount of product needed.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes me break out (lightly) and doesn&#x27;t seem to do much else. I did start eating flax oil again about a month ago, and have noticed the small lines in my face filling in noticeably. After trying many, many products, I can only recommend tea tree oil to fight acne, and flaxseed oil for skin quality/wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it is great. a a a a a a a a a</li>
            <li> Not my favorite, but will use it until it is gone and try something else.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give a complete review because I haven&#x27;t really used it much. I was using it on my face and neck but I think it was making me breakout so I stopped using it. If you have dry skin I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Though this products gives my skin a nice feel and appearance, there&#x27;s an ingredient in it which has an offensive odor to me.  That really turns me off.</li>
            <li> I love the lavender!  It is so soothing and it does a great job moisturizing my face, neck and hands.</li>
