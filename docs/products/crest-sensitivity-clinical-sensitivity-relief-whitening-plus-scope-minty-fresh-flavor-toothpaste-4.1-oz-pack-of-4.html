            <li>This seems to really work for him.</li>
            <li>but this one does not do it too much.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much on your tooth</li>
            <li>Takes about 2 weeks to get the full effect then when used every day remains that way, totally protective.</li>
            <li>For those of you with sensitive teeth, you know that whitening formulas actually make your teeth more sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I find that I like the taste of this one, and love the fact that is costs less and that it works as well as the RX brands.</li>
            <li>the only one that is truly sensitive and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Time to find a new brand.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried the new Sensi-Relief for a while now</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I have used the product for years and didn&#x27;t want to try something new.</li>
            <li>He has very sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like Sensodyne because while it helps to clean my teeth without irritating my sensitivities, it doesn&#x27;t do much to actually clean my mouth and breath.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste and it is way too hard to find.</li>
            <li>After about one month of use, the sensitivity subsided completely.</li>
            <li>In the beginning, this product worked for my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find the toothpaste near my home.</li>
            <li>This was the only sensitivity toothpaste to ever really work for me</li>
            <li>I ordered four tubes, which I now regret, because by the second tube, my teeth started hurting MORE than usual.  </li>
            <li>Tastes okay, and works fine with sensitive teeth, but there are other products that do the same, with less trouble.</li>
            <li>I have new sensitivity my gums, and I&#x27;m only in my 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>My husband was having regular pain as a result of sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>If we run out of the Crest Sensitive, and he uses my regular toothpaste, the pain returns almost immediately.</li>

            <li> If we run out of the Crest Sensitive, and he uses my regular toothpaste, the pain returns almost immediately.</li>
            <li> But it only worked ALMOST as much as other sensitive toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> This product is similar to other sensitive teeth tooth-pastes.</li>
            <li> (other similar products actually made my teeth hurt more; including crest&#x27;s new version), so I&#x27;m very sad to see it was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> It is more viscous than other toothpastes I&#x27;ve used, which makes it hard for weak or arthritic hands to squeeze out, especially with the flip cap in the way.</li>
            <li> It came in a different package, and I am not sure it is the same toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Steer clear of this weird entry into the world of sensitive toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was sent a dark blue box with a pick stripe down the box.  </li>
            <li> This has worked really well for my family for several years, and we too are very sad it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t messy like some tooth paste is.  </li>
            <li> I seriously could not live without this stuff, the pain of my front teeth would do me in.</li>
            <li> I have tried this in the past and it was not what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> No more tooth pain.  </li>
            <li> Once my stash runs out, I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m going to end up replacing it with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other prescription fluoride toothpastes which work well if you have trouble eating or drinking anything really cold.  </li>
            <li> Lots of pain with eating cold watermelon after my last crown was placed.</li>
            <li> They are still sensitive, but cold water is not quite as painful as it used to be.  </li>
            <li> I were licking the floor of a dusty storeroom.  </li>
            <li> No more cold spots!</li>
            <li> and I hate all other toothpastes.  :(</li>
            <li> The cap is just awkward.</li>
            <li> I have never liked the taste of Crest products, and this product is the worst of all.  </li>
            <li> Very unpleasant!</li>

            <li> I seriously could not live without this stuff, the pain of my front teeth would do me in. It works alot better than sensodyne. Takes about 2 weeks to get the full effect then when used every day remains that way, totally protective.</li>
            <li> My husband was having regular pain as a result of sensitive teeth. His dentist recommended this toothpaste to help relieve sensitivity. After about one month of use, the sensitivity subsided completely. That was over a year ago. If we run out of the Crest Sensitive, and he uses my regular toothpaste, the pain returns almost immediately. I have this product shipped to us regularly using subscribe and save. It saves me money, and ensures we never run out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and I have noticed a difference in the degree of sensitivity of my teeth.  They are still sensitive, but cold water is not quite as painful as it used to be.  I am hopeful that regular continued use of this product will make a substantial difference in the sensitivity of my teeth.  At this stage, after using the product over a month, I definitely give it a thumbs up!</li>
            <li> It came in a different package, and I am not sure it is the same toothpaste.  i will try it this week and let you know.  thanks,  debbi</li>
            <li> In the beginning, this product worked for my sensitive teeth.  But it only worked ALMOST as much as other sensitive toothpaste.  I ordered four tubes, which I now regret, because by the second tube, my teeth started hurting MORE than usual.  I went to the grocery store and bought some sensodyne, and after one use, the pain is gone.  Steer clear of this weird entry into the world of sensitive toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because the box of toothpaste was the one I wanted.  I ordered 8 tubes of this and it was not the product as shown.I was sent a dark blue box with a pick stripe down the box.  I have tried this in the past and it was not what I wanted.  I am now stuck with 8 tubes of toothpaste that I will not use.  If the correct box has been shown, I would not be stuck with something I didn&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li> We love this toothpaste.  It arrived quickly, works well and tastes great.  We will order it again.  No more cold spots!</li>
            <li> At the time of the order, I was under the impression that I was ordering the Crest Sensitivity W/Scope Toothpaste.  What came in was the Crest Sensitivity Whitening W/Scope.  For those of you with sensitive teeth, you know that whitening formulas actually make your teeth more sensitive.  I contacted Crest and they no longer make the type that is not whitening.  What a shame.  Time to find a new brand.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have been using this for years and has really helping with my sensitivity problems. Buy it</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and this product tastes good (to me) compared to sensodyne and other brands I&#x27;ve tried. Not much else to say but great product and price (using subscribe and save)!</li>
            <li> This has worked really well for my family for several years, and we too are very sad it was discontinued. It has worked great for reducing painful and sensitive teeth while also having good flavor and whitening. The new product they replaced it with doesn&#x27;t taste as good and doesn&#x27;t work as well. We&#x27;ve tried the new Sensi-Relief for a while now and it&#x27;s tolerable, but when I saw this on Amazon I immediately ordered it so we can have a stash of &amp;#34;the good stuff&amp;#34; for a little while longer.</li>
            <li> my husband loves this tooth paste and cannot find it where we shop.</li>
            <li> Tastes okay, and works fine with sensitive teeth, but there are other products that do the same, with less trouble. It is more viscous than other toothpastes I&#x27;ve used, which makes it hard for weak or arthritic hands to squeeze out, especially with the flip cap in the way. The cap is just awkward. I threw it out and borrowed the screw cap from another brand. The bottom line: why bother?</li>
            <li> I have new sensitivity my gums, and I&#x27;m only in my 20&#x27;s.  This is a great solution as I do not like Sensodyne at all.  I highly recommend this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> use it everyday great product,works as it should, came as promised on time. will buy this again when the time comes</li>
            <li> Tried this tooth-paste.  My teeth-brushing has changed however.  This product is similar to other sensitive teeth tooth-pastes.</li>
            <li> This product was discontinued by Crest. I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find this product on Amazon. It is exactly what I used to purchase in the stores and I am very happy to have it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste and it is way too hard to find.</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste my domestic partner uses.  He has very sensitive teeth.  This seems to really work for him.</li>
            <li> I have been using this paste for 7 years and haven&#x27;t had a cavity or sensitivity.  The taste is good and it isn&#x27;t chalky.</li>
            <li> My teeth are sensitive and I don&#x27;t like tooth paste that foams up too much most whitening ones do foam up a lot but this one does not do it too much. So this one is the bst of all of the ones I have used</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time and was happy to find it on line as Crest has discontinued making this product.</li>
            <li> the only one that is truly sensitive and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth with some significant gum recession.  I don&#x27;t like Sensodyne because while it helps to clean my teeth without irritating my sensitivities, it doesn&#x27;t do much to actually clean my mouth and breath.  This Crest with Scope is the answer.  You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> This is the only one that stops my sensitivity. I&#x27;ve tried everything!  I&#x27;m bummed that Kroger has taken it off of their shelves.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Crest sensitivity tooth paste does work. No more tooth pain.  You don&#x27;t have to use much on your tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;It  isn&#x27;t messy like some tooth paste is.  Also it doesn&#x27;t burn like some brands.  A pack of 4 is a  good buy, cheaper than if you buy it at Walmart.  My dentist gave me my first sample and I have been using it for years.  I am thankful for Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The service is excellent, fast, reliable service that I really appreciate.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the toothpaste near my home. I have used the product for years and didn&#x27;t want to try something new.</li>
            <li> This was the only sensitivity toothpaste to ever really work for me (other similar products actually made my teeth hurt more; including crest&#x27;s new version), so I&#x27;m very sad to see it was discontinued.  Once my stash runs out, I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m going to end up replacing it with.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste and I can&#x27;t find it anymore.  It was the best.</li>
            <li> This product tastes \\&quot;medicinal\\&quot; and \\&quot;dirty\\&quot;.  It tasted as tho I were licking the floor of a dusty storeroom.  I have never liked the taste of Crest products, and this product is the worst of all.  Very unpleasant! Try another brand. mb</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other prescription fluoride toothpastes which work well if you have trouble eating or drinking anything really cold.  I find that I like the taste of this one, and love the fact that is costs less and that it works as well as the RX brands.</li>
            <li> Lots of pain with eating cold watermelon after my last crown was placed. This took about a month, but now I do not have any further sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this is being discontinued.  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 10 years and I hate all other toothpastes.  :(</li>
            <li> The pack of 4 that I received were all set to expire within 6 months of purchase. I think Crest has discontinued this product.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought I was getting definitely not what is in the picture</li>
