            <li> Right price, right product, good results.  Our vet recommended this and we are very happy we could get them cheaper at amazon.</li>
            <li> Have to use it every night for a dry eye. Have used other brands but come back to Genteal it works the best for me</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and a great price!</li>
            <li> First off, I would have given this product 5 stars for its effectiveness. It is excellent as an overnight eye lubricant. I have partial paralysis on the left side of my face that oftentimes affects the ability of my eye to close completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem lies elsewhere.  The ointment is very thick. Application is tricky. It comes out of the squeeze tube in a little lump that is difficult for the eye to distribute. I&#x27;ve found that after applying, I&#x27;ve had to add Genteal drops (there are three different kinds and all work well) to add enough moisture to make the lubricant spread effectively across the entire eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a huge deal, but it takes some manipulation and getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other issue is the quantity. It&#x27;s a very small tube that runs out quickly. Most likely I am squeezing the tube too hard and making too much come out at one time. I haven&#x27;t found that &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34; that is neither too little nor too much. It is nowhere near comparable in amount to other Genteal eye lubricants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product most likely is best for the most severe cases of eye dryness. If your problem is not as bad, you might consider Genteal Eye Gel for severe dry eye. For most, that might do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Genteal products overall are really the very best there are. My ophthalmologist recommends them for their quality, purity and effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Ointment works great! I use some every night and it keeps my eye moist throughout the night. Since accidentally scratching my cornea back in June of 14, my eye tends to dry out at night.  Apply about an inch of this a night and it does the trick to keep it from waking me up. Will definitely be stocking up on this!</li>
            <li> This is the best pm ointment I have found for severe dry eye.  Am happy to be able to get it and service was fast.</li>
            <li> The ointment is very easy to use and it does the trick.  I put it in every night and my eyes feel good in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for over a year now and was unable to get it in the local pharmacies,  Thank goodness you had it.  I will be ordering all of this item from you in the future.</li>
            <li> great stuff too pricey!!</li>
            <li> PM Lubricant is thinkand lasts long.  Great for certain Eye diseases.  This product is so much in demand, most drug stores/super markets are always running out of them.  Glad Amazon has them.</li>
            <li> Great product, doctor recommended.</li>
            <li> Great product and highly recommended by our optometrist.  We&#x27;ve used nothing else for three years now.</li>
            <li> Best ointment for highest lubricant effect. Mom with scleroderma, can&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li> I use this for my elderly dog with eye dryness.  It works great when I use it every night.</li>
            <li> My dog has a tumor in one of his cranial nerves, which is affecting the health of his right eye.  I&#x27;ve been putting the night time ointment in his eye before bedtime and the gel for severe dry eyes in his eye during the day for a few weeks.  The combination has significantly improved his eye health.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome for dry eye syndrome. I use it every night and it keeps my eyes moist throughout the next day. Rarely do I need supplemental  eyedrops during the day. Without the ointment I am in pain and wake up if I forget to use it.</li>
            <li> This has been just the ticket for my husband&#x27;s dry eye problem. Because of strokes his left eye doesn&#x27;t close all the way so it is imperative that we keep his eye lubricated 24/7. The other ointments have just not been strong enough, but he has reactions to all of the gels. Then our ophthalmologist suggested using this one. So glad he did. My husband&#x27;s eye no longer looks like it has been sunburned, but has returned to a normal look and texture. What a relief!</li>
            <li> great product for Dry Eyes!!</li>
            <li> I have a very bad case of Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome and this particular lubricant works the best for me since it has a higher petroleum jelly content than others.  I use it all throughout the day.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This works wonderfully and is a great price compared to the price that I paid at a local store.  This is so soothing and helps through the night.  It is a little messy but cleans up easily.  I mean that the gel gets on your eye lids etc. This happens during the night but is easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> My wife has used it for years. She has tried several other brands and formulations, but this is the most helpful. It&#x27;s not cheap and sometimes it is very difficult to find, but it really does work.</li>
            <li> I have been using Genteal for a long time and it is great!!  Eye Ointment</li>
            <li> The best solution I have found for dry-eye (applied at bed-time)</li>
            <li> My son uses this at night for his recurring corneal erosion. It help keep his eyelid from sticking to his cornea and causing damage when he opens his eye in the morning. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a very tiny tube for the price.</li>
