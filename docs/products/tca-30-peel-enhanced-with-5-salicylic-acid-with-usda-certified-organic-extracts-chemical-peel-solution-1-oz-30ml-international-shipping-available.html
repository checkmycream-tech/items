            <li>Anyway, this product worked great.  </li>
            <li>Great thing about it was that I did this during the winter months, and didn&#x27;t have expose my legs.    </li>
            <li>so this is great if you want smoother skin...</li>
            <li>If you follow the instructions and do the patch test you will get great results.</li>
            <li>I am so happy Amazon has products like this for people who cannot afford to go to The Doctors office.</li>
            <li>TCA is great stuff.</li>
            <li>Works great to unclog pores, reduce wrinkles and refine pores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just a thrilled customer!</li>
            <li>Also, I have fair skin</li>
            <li>Just follow the instructions, and you should be good.</li>
            <li>It take about 10 days for you to look really good.</li>
            <li>so it got a good dose of soda</li>
            <li>I love this seller!  </li>
            <li>but works amazing.</li>
            <li>they caused me more problems than good--</li>
            <li>This is a very strong peel, and I peeled a lot as promised.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best peel I have ever used!!</li>
            <li>So far, so great!  </li>
            <li>With the peels that have very positive reviews mostly go with more than 20 4-5 star ratings, my skin is like leather expect leather accepts moister happily</li>
            <li>perhaps the reason why it was not overly potent for me was because I&#x27;ve been using retinol for 8 months --</li>
            <li>I mention it burns like h e LL :)</li>
            <li>Fast delivery,great price and great service</li>
            <li>You also however will need many treatments to get rid of your acne scars, age spots, etc.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to read the directions.</li>
            <li>The product is ok.</li>
            <li>but i sure felt it.</li>
            <li>it was more like 3% peel</li>
            <li>and It seems they didn&#x27;t realize that taking 30% TCA THAN adding more things in will of course dilute the TCA.&lt;br</li>
            <li>just takes much much more layers.</li>
            <li>I gave myself my first TCA peel with this product 8 days ago and the results are looking good.</li>
            <li>is a pretty good</li>
            <li>and I think peels work better on light complexions.</li>
            <li>My skin looks improved and fortunately my neck is doing okay.</li>
            <li>Also, this is a somewhat strong concentration of TCA and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel this is strong and</li>
            <li>Strong stuff</li>
            <li>Medium to strong peels.  </li>
            <li>n sanitary n u should be fine, i use aquaphore after to heal faster.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how smooth my skin was and how fine lines had disappeared.</li>
            <li>a recommendation, I&#x27;d keep some Aloe Gel (dye free-</li>
            <li>There is nothing to say but it is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Face feelbs like a light sunburn now.  </li>
            <li>I finally worked my way up to it and used it yesterday got beyond 5 seconds, lol.  </li>
            <li>I used this product several times and had great results with it.</li>
            <li>its pretty strong make sure every things clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was by far the best, I hesitated to perform a deeper peel earlier because I was</li>
            <li>I need to feel clean.</li>
            <li>(I used it full strength.)</li>
            <li>a full 30% TCA.</li>
            <li>Even just to have this on had to remove moles and spots is good enough.</li>
            <li>Only one layer has, so a good result.</li>
            <li>I used a fan to cool my face which helped with the burn.  </li>
            <li>It  is super and you should make the purchase.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order again when I need more. :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using copper cream or serum as the peeling is happening as it really absorbs into the new skin and the results are great.</li>
            <li>Makes application easy without using too much product.</li>
            <li>so that was like pour hot water on a burn!</li>
            <li>The neck skin is much more sensitive than the face and takes longer to heal.  </li>
            <li>but it IS worth having a scabby face for a week lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It clears your face and gives you a fresh face in no time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth it to me.  </li>
            <li>I used it and it work right as it was written in the instructions.  </li>
            <li>I got right into to it</li>
            <li>I gently applied cool water look and tried to figure what I would say to my protective hubby.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done a few peels before with good success</li>
            <li>Love it really works stings you face but after a week your skin is soft and renewed</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was SUPER fast...</li>
            <li>already had a very gentle cloth in the water</li>
            <li>I plan to do a follow-up peel in two weeks and possibly one more two weeks after that.</li>
            <li>This peel worked exactly as it should.</li>
            <li>This works really well!</li>
            <li>but this is first product I&#x27;ve used in the USA (I&#x27;m orginally from the UK).</li>
            <li>Not knowing the grade of the product I diluted it the first time I used it with saline to make it 15%</li>
            <li>Believe it or not, this peel does exactly what it advertises.</li>
            <li>I did my first peel two days ago using the 30%.  </li>
            <li>Plus I&#x27;ve done lactic and glycolic peels of higher percentages to work my way up to this.  </li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I won a package of peels so went consistently every 8 weeks.</li>
            <li>30% is a safer bet for me than uising a higher percent than i used before, it burns</li>
            <li>This is a good product for people who don&#x27;t have the money for a professional peel but have the ability to be careful and follow instructions to the letter.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal, but be sure to read the instructions and follow them religiously.  </li>
            <li>I will update if their is a positive difference</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s important to follow the instructions carefully because this stuff does burn you and you have to rinse it off pretty quickly after you apply it.</li>
            <li>I do have some residual pink areas on my neck 10 days out, but I feel confident they&#x27;ll fade in a matter of days or weeks.</li>
            <li>This product has really helped me with my skin</li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t like the product.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>Have a fan ready.  </li>
            <li>I did put very concentrated moisturizer on after.  </li>
            <li>I grabbed the neutralizer pre soaked cotton balls and gently applied.</li>
            <li>Fast shiing, quality product</li>
            <li>Super strong peel that you can delute to half strength to extend.</li>
            <li>I dump a half a box of baking soda into the sink filled with cool water</li>
            <li>If you are in need of the real deal where TCA is concerned, I highly recommend these guys.  </li>
            <li>The cool thing is I FINALLY see the melasma breaking up!  </li>
            <li>It got dry and lightly peeled off.</li>
            <li>So, if you&#x27;re brave enough, and won&#x27;t be seeing anyone for at least a week, you can try to leave the product on till your skin turns whitish before washing it off, or longer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the deep burn can cause temporary scaring, once the scar drops off, the skin under is really soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>When I pay a lot of money for some decent TCA, I expect to get it.  </li>
            <li>Anyway that said, the product worked fine on my face, with no problems, but if I had it to do over I would have diluted it down for my neck to a much milder potency.</li>
            <li>all natural) in the fridge before hand and have it ready to apply after--</li>
            <li>I have used TCA in the past and its great stuff (minus the healing times</li>
            <li>but I poured some directly onto the cloth and covered my face after really caking the soda on and about five minutes</li>
            <li>Now it is brown and leathery, which is normal.</li>
            <li>After a few trials, you&#x27;ll be able to determine what you can tolerate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is intense  ordered a couple different peels this arrived first</li>
            <li>first is absolutely essential.  </li>
            <li>so anxious to get my skin to do more than just turn every moisturizer into sluff.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend this on your face as it can easily darken the skin if you are prone to dark spots/hyperpigmentation!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone that is looking to clear their skin.</li>
            <li>Early use in the fall.</li>
            <li>Only very cautiously.</li>
            <li>did a whole face peel last night</li>
            <li>(I dont think my skin was as sensitive as I</li>
            <li>I also covered my sensitive areas that I wanted to protect with Vaseline like the professional did.</li>
            <li>Ugh it&#x27;s still burning my whole face is red now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done about four peels now, and this last time I applied copper serum on the newly peeled areas of skin.</li>
            <li>I use natural oils, emu oil, high and low end &amp; perscription moisturizers- serums, the oils don&#x27;t soak in, the creams literally stuff off and serums same as oil after about 2 hrs</li>
            <li>When I used this product I barely got any stinging or redness.</li>
            <li>a few weeks later I tried at full strength</li>
            <li>Holy cow, the burn was intense.  </li>
            <li>(I diluted it down first) and applied with cotton balls- next time I am using a fan brush- cotton balls soak up a lot of the product.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried the dotted, the scars a little.</li>
            <li>I will not dilute it down as much</li>
            <li>deep scars from adolescent acne progressively getting significantly better (half a dozen peels over about a year), and essentially no more breakouts.</li>
            <li>is two thing extremely sensitive and so dry it looks biit like a desert.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I gave myself my first TCA peel with this product 8 days ago and the results are looking good. (I used it full strength.) Not a huge improvement, but the skin definitely is improved. I plan to do a follow-up peel in two weeks and possibly one more two weeks after that. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s important to follow the instructions carefully because this stuff does burn you and you have to rinse it off pretty quickly after you apply it. Also, this is a somewhat strong concentration of TCA and perhaps the reason why it was not overly potent for me was because I&#x27;ve been using retinol for 8 months -- so my skin was somewhat prepped. Also, I have fair skin and I think peels work better on light complexions. Anyway that said, the product worked fine on my face, with no problems, but if I had it to do over I would have diluted it down for my neck to a much milder potency. I would suggest buying the 15% potency TCA (or less) for the neck, and also, rinse it off within a minute or less the first time you use it there. The neck skin is much more sensitive than the face and takes longer to heal.  UPDATE 10-4-11  This peel worked exactly as it should. My skin looks improved and fortunately my neck is doing okay. I do have some residual pink areas on my neck 10 days out, but I feel confident they&#x27;ll fade in a matter of days or weeks. This is a good product for people who don&#x27;t have the money for a professional peel but have the ability to be careful and follow instructions to the letter.  A patch test (or tests) first is absolutely essential.  UPDATE 2-5-12  I&#x27;ve continued to use this product on my face. I&#x27;ve done about four peels now, and this last time I applied copper serum on the newly peeled areas of skin. This works really well! I highly recommend using copper cream or serum as the peeling is happening as it really absorbs into the new skin and the results are great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel this is strong and a full 30% TCA. I bought 30% TCA in the past so I know the difference and also have worked  with TCA for my job. When I used this product I barely got any stinging or redness. It got dry and lightly peeled off. I  still have a bottle of 30% TCA I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon and did a comparison. It turned white when applied and stung and turned red like it should. Now it is brown and leathery, which is normal. I don&#x27;t get this from this product even after applying several layers. I will not buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a tatoo which means it is no longer desireable.  It was located on the back of my calf.    Anyway, this product worked great.  Great thing about it was that I did this during the winter months, and didn&#x27;t have expose my legs.    Anyway, just be careful with this stuff.  I mean seriously, what you&#x27;re doing is a controlled chemical burn on your skin.  Just follow the instructions, and you should be good.</li>
            <li> This product has really helped me with my skin I would recommend it to anyone that is looking to clear their skin.</li>
            <li> The seller sent it on time and the item was what it said...I think. I have had TCA peels in the past (about 5). However this 30% did not have nearly the effect of other 30% Ive had in the past. I think Ill stick to going to a salon.  Otherwise I would of given 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Even just to have this on had to remove moles and spots is good enough. I&#x27;ve purchased it twice and it def gets results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s incredibly painful so I recommend a few shots before going for it.&lt;br /&gt;You will only need to use very little. I had to buy a second bottle because it tipped over.&lt;br /&gt;Try your hardest not to get it on areas you don&#x27;t want modified.&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention it burns like h e LL :)&lt;br /&gt;If you spill this on anything, trash it, it will stain. Try not to get it on your finger tips because well it will remove your finger prints momentarily but it&#x27;s painless.</li>
            <li> Used, as before, but no results and difference noticed.  Will use again and see what happens.  I will update if their is a positive difference and some noted results.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery,great price and great service but I really didn&#x27;t like the product. I&#x27;ve done a few peels before with good success but this is first product I&#x27;ve used in the USA (I&#x27;m orginally from the UK). Not knowing the grade of the product I diluted it the first time I used it with saline to make it 15% but it didn&#x27;t even make a mark, so a few weeks later I tried at full strength and I did get some peel but it was flaky rather than a peel and it hasn&#x27;t made any difference to superficial scaring. It flaked for a few weeks which was pretty inconvenient and unsightly. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the product but would recommend the seller.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal, but be sure to read the instructions and follow them religiously.  If the product is left on too long, it will burn through several layers of your epidermis and scar.  The scar does eventually fall off (and don&#x27;t peel it off or you might cause permanent scarring), but it can take 1 - 2 weeks or longer depending on how deep the burn.  The scar looks like very dark skin (imagine a very dark age spot covering the entire area you applied the product on) and can be very embarrassing.  However, if you follow the instructions, you should not be getting the burning nor scaring.  You also however will need many treatments to get rid of your acne scars, age spots, etc. So, if you&#x27;re brave enough, and won&#x27;t be seeing anyone for at least a week, you can try to leave the product on till your skin turns whitish before washing it off, or longer.  After a few trials, you&#x27;ll be able to determine what you can tolerate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the deep burn can cause temporary scaring, once the scar drops off, the skin under is really soft and smooth.  My acne scars have truly improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not recommending that you do anything other than follow the directions though.  I&#x27;m just telling you my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do trust this seller.  The product worked as promised and shipping/purchasing was a breeze.</li>
            <li> Early use in the fall. The first time I tried the dotted, the scars a little. Or concentrate a large, three times at intervals cause the skin on the scars still thin. And now I tried the face. Only one layer has, so a good result. Recommend. Only very cautiously. Since a week I go red.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best peel I have ever used!! Just be sure to read the directions. Strong stuff but works amazing.</li>
            <li> I had previously done a number of lactic acid peels(50%) along with some salicylic acid peels (30%)--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was by far the best, I hesitated to perform a deeper peel earlier because I was worried-- however-- nothing to worry about-- your face will appear as though you just had a sunburn-- some parts may turn brown, but it will peel off after a few days-- nothing terribly unsightly--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a recommendation, I&#x27;d keep some Aloe Gel (dye free- all natural) in the fridge before hand and have it ready to apply after-- (my skin hates mosturizers-- they caused me more problems than good-- I tried a bunch)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Anyway- this product works wonders-- will continue doing peels--</li>
            <li> The product is ok. It´s well explained the way how to use it.</li>
            <li> Love it really works stings you face but after a week your skin is soft and renewed</li>
            <li> I am currently doing a peel for my stretchmarks. The 1st time I did I left it on for several minutes with a couples layers and it peeled minimally but took a very long time to peel. It did make the skin a bit smoother then the surrounding skin without the peel....so this is great if you want smoother skin...but I did not do it deep enough for it to have any possible effect on my stretchmarks/moles/freckles. I just did the second peel and this time I added several layers and had it on for several minutes and it finally frosted. Time will tell if it will have any affect. The negative side is that the peel makes my skin slightly darker(but not extremely noticeable) so I will have to buy expensive bleaching cream to get it back to normal. I would not recommend this on your face as it can easily darken the skin if you are prone to dark spots/hyperpigmentation!</li>
            <li> This is a very strong peel, and I peeled a lot as promised. users need to  follow the instructions to the T.</li>
            <li> Have used tca peels before at a lesser strength.  This one needs just one application and you will need a blow dryer for the stinging.  I have dark pigmentation in different areas of my face and will need a few applications but did see a difference from my first application with this product.</li>
            <li> Defintely buy this if you want scars, red skin with brown spots, and facial capillaries everywhere like you have roseaca. That&#x27;s what this WONDERFUL product did for me. Yet, I&#x27;m not alone. Do some research and you&#x27;ll see PICTURES of people who have been permanently disfigured because of this exact crap from this seller who sees nothing but dollar signs.    Visit the website realself.com to view peoples opinions of cosmetic procedures and the results they got. You&#x27;ll see pictures of people who did at home TCA peels that are scarred for life!</li>
            <li> This works wonderful!  My skin peel was perfect.</li>
            <li> I used it and it work right as it was written in the instructions.  It&#x27;s certainly medical grade.  I personally got not scarring or any sad effect.</li>
            <li> its pretty strong make sure every things clean n sanitary n u should be fine, i use aquaphore after to heal faster.</li>
            <li> It did just what I wanted it to.  It  is super and you should make the purchase. There is nothing to say but it is fabulous.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  Medium to strong peels.  Strength roughly proportional to amount of time one leaves it on.  Wear rubber gloves and don&#x27;t get it on your lips (chap stick or lipstick (maybe) just before).  Probably shouldn&#x27;t start off with the 30% stuff if haven&#x27;t done peels before.  I use one of those little foam brushes to apply and (have progressed to) leaving it on for 5-6 minutes.  Difficult to resist picking at it when the peeling starts, but try.  Works well for me: deep scars from adolescent acne progressively getting significantly better (half a dozen peels over about a year), and essentially no more breakouts.</li>
            <li> This really works. But you must follow the directions. The frist few time only leave it on the 90 seconds. Also your finger tips will peel , The peeling might not start for at least 3 days than it will happen. It take about 10 days for you to look really good.</li>
            <li> I have acne scars (both red marks and rolling/boxcar scars)... I have used TCA in the past and its great stuff (minus the healing times but it IS worth having a scabby face for a week lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a whole face peel last night (I diluted it down first) and applied with cotton balls- next time I am using a fan brush- cotton balls soak up a lot of the product. I had no real frosting but i sure felt it. I used a fan to cool my face which helped with the burn.  Next time I decide to peel I will not dilute it down as much (I dont think my skin was as sensitive as I though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was SUPER fast... it didnt come with alcohol pads, just the directions sheet but that was no big deal. I will definitely order again when I need more. :)</li>
            <li> Came as described by manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;This is a pretty good product.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again / encourage others to buy.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, this peel does exactly what it advertises. It clears your face and gives you a fresh face in no time. Well, actually a few days after the peeling process I complete I also use retinol cream regularly.  You might want to give this a try. With the peel, my pores don’t feel as clogged. I hope that makes sense. I need to feel clean. At least my face does.</li>
            <li> The strongest chemical peel you can purchase outside a physician&#x27;s office. Follow directions carefully, and stay out of the sun.</li>
            <li> Followed every single instruction and my skin got burnt. Will never recommend or reuse. Will add photo.</li>
            <li> I love this seller!  When I pay a lot of money for some decent TCA, I expect to get it.  These folks don&#x27;t skimp on anything.  This is a mean TCA so if you are not used to it, don&#x27;t use it until you work your way up.  I&#x27;ll be a return customer forever and ever!!!  I did my first peel two days ago using the 30%.  I&#x27;ve done 15%, 20% and now 30% (stop at 30% if you are using this on your face) Plus I&#x27;ve done lactic and glycolic peels of higher percentages to work my way up to this.  The cool thing is I FINALLY see the melasma breaking up!  There were a few tough spots that wouldn&#x27;t budge, but this is taking care of that ;)  It is going to burn like dragon pee and your are going to want to bathe your skin in ice water ... but hey!  It&#x27;s so worth it to me.  I used their 15% around the eye area and the rest of my face I did with 30%.  It&#x27;s already starting to peel a bit!  I&#x27;m using CeraVe cream,  50+ SPF constantly and washing my face twice a day with CeraVe hydrating cleanser.  So far, so great!  If you are in need of the real deal where TCA is concerned, I highly recommend these guys.  I am in no way affiliated with them...I&#x27;m just a thrilled customer!</li>
            <li> I won a package of peels so went consistently every 8 weeks. Package done so tried this.  Holy cow, the burn was intense.  Have a fan ready.  Face feelbs like a light sunburn now.  Will see how things progress in the days to come.  I did put very concentrated moisturizer on after.  I also covered my sensitive areas that I wanted to protect with Vaseline like the professional did. Also put on with a fan brush.  Makes application easy without using too much product.</li>
            <li> This is intense  ordered a couple different peels this arrived first so anxious to get my skin to do more than just turn every moisturizer into sluff.  I got right into to it following directions I immediately realized I need to work my way up and rinced immediately.  I finally worked my way up to it and used it yesterday got beyond 5 seconds, lol.  Per instructions I kept it on until tingle went beyond a tingle and I saw a bit of redness start to appear in on small spot, I immediately rinsed continuing to do so that was like pour hot water on a burn! I grabbed the neutralizer pre soaked cotton balls and gently applied. Ugh it&#x27;s still burning my whole face is red now I dump a half a box of baking soda into the sink filled with cool water already had a very gentle cloth in the water so it got a good dose of soda but I poured some directly onto the cloth and covered my face after really caking the soda on and about five minutes it finally stopped burning then I gently applied cool water look and tried to figure what I would say to my protective hubby.  I&#x27;m not sure the results yet my face is red not oozing or peeling.  I went this step after using  glycolic and lactic peels by skin is two thing extremely sensitive and so dry it looks biit like a desert.  I use natural oils, emu oil, high and low end &amp; perscription moisturizers- serums, the oils don&#x27;t soak in, the creams literally stuff off and serums same as oil after about 2 hrs I have to use a paper towel to dab it off so to not get on everything.  With the peels that have very positive reviews mostly go with more than 20 4-5 star ratings, my skin is like leather expect leather accepts moister happily my skin wil not exfoliate :-(. The plus on this end is that now I can but a micro dermabration machine so I&#x27;m open to suggestions.</li>
            <li> Did not work well it was more like 3% peel not 30%&lt;br /&gt;very unhappy with it .  Will not buy again</li>
            <li> I used this product several times and had great results with it. I was amazed at how smooth my skin was and how fine lines had disappeared. If you follow the instructions and do the patch test you will get great results. I am so happy Amazon has products like this for people who cannot afford to go to The Doctors office. TCA is great stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot weaker than any 30% TCA I&#x27;ve ever seen... It feels rather diluted by all the extracts they put in and It seems they didn&#x27;t realize that taking 30% TCA THAN adding more things in will of course dilute the TCA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it still works... just takes much much more layers.</li>
            <li> Fast shiing, quality product</li>
            <li> Super strong peel that you can delute to half strength to extend. Works great to unclog pores, reduce wrinkles and refine pores. So happy I purchased!</li>
            <li> 30% is a safer bet for me than uising a higher percent than i used before, it burns but i put up with it for 5 minutes, it made my skin very red, i did not dilute it, but none of the Trichloroacetic acids have made my skin peel.</li>
