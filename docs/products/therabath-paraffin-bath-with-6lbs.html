            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>The Therabath Paraffin Bath is great for my hands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just happy that it&#x27;s providing my mom relief.</li>
            <li>got the el-cheapo &#x27;13 inch terry cloth oven mitts&#x27;, and they were great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very pleasant just on its own for relieving stiffness, but I always have to follow with the stretching, etc.  </li>
            <li>Very nice, wonderful and easy.</li>
            <li>It is so nice to use and works great.  </li>
            <li>I ordered one for a friend because of the good service and how it works.</li>
            <li>The wax feels really good on my hands.  </li>
            <li>I still think that is a good, lower-priced option and would still have done that if the price not been lowered on the Therabath.  </li>
            <li>I still think that is a good, lower-priced option and would still have done that if the price not been lowered on the Therabath.  </li>
            <li>The wax is really nice, no perfume smells but great oil content.</li>
            <li>It has a good depth, good, even heat, reliability.  </li>
            <li>I suppose just some really good lotion would do that too</li>
            <li>It appears to be constructed of good quality materials.  </li>
            <li>Received the item promptly and in good packaging.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I dip my hand in it 6 or 7 times per application to get a good coating of wax and it makes my hand feel</li>
            <li>I did some research before buying and this seemed to be a good value for the money.</li>
            <li>The most challenging aspect was finding the perfect location in the house for the Therabath (since it needs to remain plugged in/on at all times).  </li>
            <li>Delivery service was exceptional.</li>
            <li>I got a good price deal on it and love it!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m now very glad that I made the purchase.  </li>
            <li>I had used this product when visiting my massage therapist and was very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>its very inspiring that they have a 5 year warranty</li>
            <li>We love it!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that had it not been damaged it would have been a good product.</li>
            <li>It stays nice and warm all the time.</li>
            <li>I use it to warm up my wrist and hand muscles before stretching and exercising them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am THRILLED.  </li>
            <li>The warm paraffin is soothing to my injured wrist, and it helps to \\&quot;unlock\\&quot; the muscles in my hand.  </li>
            <li>The warm wax is so soothing to my arthritic joints.  </li>
            <li>, they made sure I received this item in perfect new condition!</li>
            <li>I love this thing but can&#x27;t honestly say I have gotten a lot of relief for my trigger fingers.</li>
            <li>works just as perfectly as the one my old salon used.  </li>
            <li>She first experienced relief at the therapists offices.</li>
            <li>Since I have been helping her with her wax dips every morning and evening she has seen a huge difference in her fingers, they have warmth to them now and also much more dexterity!</li>
            <li>Meaning it&#x27;s a miracle tub with Paraffin wax that gives her relief, warmth, reduces swelling and gives her a huge leap forward with dexterity in her fingers!</li>
            <li>Item was received with dent on top of bowl.  </li>
            <li>The lid was lying on top untouched.  </li>
            <li>I have had better quality crockpots for $39.95.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Most people can&#x27;t/don&#x27;t want to wait 8 hours EACH time before using it.  </li>
            <li>(And in the cycling on/off, it is off more than it is on - which is indicated by the indicator</li>
            <li>It also retains heat better because you can zip-lock it to your arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For a fraction of the price, I absolutely love the Therabath.  </li>
            <li>It also retains heat better because you can zip-lock it to your arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For a fraction of the price, I absolutely love the Therabath.  </li>
            <li>Box not damaged just the top lip was bent where you can tell it was dropped.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>The more times equals the amount of heat that is retained, so you will probably need to experiment.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to register your unit with the company.  </li>
            <li>A six page information sheet is generated with the registration that has some interesting &amp; helpful information.  </li>
            <li>My hands &amp; wrists do feel better after each treatment &amp; I am able to do painless finger/wrist exercises after the treatment.  </li>
            <li>My hands &amp; wrists do feel better after each treatment &amp; I am able to do painless finger/wrist exercises after the treatment.  </li>
            <li>I expect to use it for many years.</li>
            <li>We can better afford the treatments at home.</li>
            <li>Love this for hand moisturizing and softening in the winter months.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I both work with our hands, and are mostly in the shop--I&#x27;m a carpenter and he works with repairing machinery.  </li>
            <li>I chose this one after lots of reading and am glad we settled on this one.  </li>
            <li>Love the bath, but it does take 6 hours for the wax to melt entirely for best use.</li>
            <li>So glad I decided to purchase this brand and model.</li>
            <li>It is still safe for the feet, but I would prefer to catch it on an idle heat.  </li>
            <li>And here are six more words.</li>
            <li>My hands are 100% better since I have been using this.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research on the web and glad I purchased this bath.  </li>
            <li>It is top quality</li>
            <li>and I believe we will have it for many years of use.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to any one that is in need of a top of the line paraffin bath.  </li>
            <li>You can leave it plugged in all the time in a safe and child-proof location.  </li>
            <li>Love my Therabath.  </li>
            <li>We have children around most every day.</li>
            <li>I could not think of a safe location to place it, to leave it plugged in without the worry of spilled wax.</li>
            <li>The instructions say it takes 4-6 hours to melt and it does just that so make sure you plan for that.  </li>
            <li>The wax comes pre-shreaded which is great and makes it melt much easier.  </li>
            <li>the therabath is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>i was also pleased to see something is still made in the u.s.a.  AND</li>
            <li>Outstanding product to reduce the affects of arthritis.  </li>
            <li>It melted the wax very quickly and maintains it at the proper temperature perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It sure feels good on the hands and it leaves your hands feeling really, really nice - soft.</li>
            <li>I have large hands and they fit easily in this paraffin bath, it does an excellent job of maintaining temperature and is easy to clean and refill.</li>
            <li>Wonderful for dry skin but also just for the relaxation affect.</li>
            <li>I found this to be a quick way to warm up</li>
            <li>My finger was injured in an accident and therabath works great to warm hand prior to exercises/therapy, or when sore.</li>
            <li>but oh, the warm feeling on the hands is worth it just for that</li>
            <li>but it really feels good after use.</li>
            <li>Spa was purchased for rehab purposes, but is also very useful for keeping your skin in tip top condition.  </li>
            <li>and they said no problem except I had to remove all the wax from the unit - it was full of solidified wax!  </li>
            <li>Easy storage when not in use.</li>
            <li>How easy is that.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to store and the 6lbs of wax that comes with the bath</li>
            <li>Not only does it feel great, but it works better too.  </li>
            <li>Feels great, leaves skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Therabath was very easy to set-up and use RIGHT OUT of the BOX.  </li>
            <li>a 5 yr warranty is very unusual these days, which made me more confident of the product.  </li>
            <li>and it continues to work just fine.  </li>
            <li>but once you add the wax to where it is supposed to be, it will be fine.  </li>
            <li>It does have some gap between the well and the outer shell, but it doesn&#x27;t move and seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with my own professional Therabath paraffin bath and the convenience of using it at home.</li>
            <li>If you are a person that does not feel comfortable leaving things on/plugged in 24/7, then this probably is not the unit for you.  </li>
            <li>This product is great, especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li>Wax stays warm and ready for use.</li>
            <li>While I am not too happy with the results of the surgery, I love how the paraffin bath makes my still very sore hands feel better, even if only temporary.</li>
            <li>Sufferers of rheumatoid arthritis really appreciate the temporary relief this warm wax brings.</li>
            <li>so the wax is ready for you when you have some time to warm your hand(s) and get the therapeutic  benefits.  </li>
            <li>To me that was an important feature.</li>
            <li>This is a great idea but it has to be kept plugged in all the time if you want to use it daily.</li>
            <li>Great online purchase through Amazon, would definitely recommend to anyone needing this for therapy!!!</li>
            <li>i added just 3 more pounds and now it&#x27;s the right depth for my use.</li>
            <li>There is even a 5 step QUICK and easy SET-UP REFERENCE CARD so that you don&#x27;t have to read the instruction manual.  </li>
            <li>Worked fine for me so far, make sure not to reuse wax!</li>
            <li>I have used one at a salon and enjoyed it very much.  </li>
            <li>Is not so hot that safe to use with hardware in hand.</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been using this for two months and says it has helped her significantly with the pain.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use when it arrived</li>
            <li>My husband also mentioned that it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for dry areas</li>
            <li>After 4 months my left hand is doing pretty good; most of the swelling/scaring is gone).</li>
            <li>Great for dry winter hands and feet!  </li>
            <li>A large towel keeps the heat in better than a skimpy one.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing special about this product and a lower priced paraffin bath</li>
            <li>Feels good &amp; cuts back on pain &amp; aches!</li>
            <li>And it does leave my hands nice and soft; and helps alleviate arthritis while I&#x27;m using it.  </li>
            <li>(You can repeat for as many times as you&#x27;d like, but based on my experience anything over 5 times is way too much.)  </li>
            <li>The food storage, plastic bags are MUCH thicker (and cheaper) than the hand/foot \\&quot;liners\\&quot; and the terry oven mitts are thicker and hold in the heat better (and, again, cheaper) than the hand/foot mitts.  </li>
            <li>, this is a good choice for you because you can place your foot in the bath and the wax will rise up above your ankle joint.</li>
            <li>The wax must cool...</li>
            <li>The Euc/Mint fragrance is very calming and satisfying.  </li>
            <li>i was a bit worried when the product guide said that the environmental operating range should be 65-85 degrees F, since i planned to put it in the basement, which on a good day in winter tops out at 54, and was the only convenient place where i had a vacant 3-prong grounded outlet.</li>
            <li>and it is far superior to the first 2.  </li>
            <li>I loved the thing so much that I decided to put out the money for a new one.  </li>
            <li>I do have to admit, though, that I was extremely lucky and did not pay the full price.  </li>
            <li>I do have to admit, though, that I was extremely lucky and did not pay the full price.  </li>
            <li>The heating indicator light goes on and off but doesn&#x27;t seem to be on very much so there must be good insulation between the aluminum &amp;#34;tub&amp;#34; and the plastic outside shell.</li>
            <li>After deciding on the location, I just opened the 6 plastic bags containing the wax, put the solid wax into the container, placed the grate on top of the wax, placed the lid on top of that and then plugged the unit in.  </li>
            <li>It costs way more than the one it replaced, but it&#x27;s worth every penny because it&#x27;s always ready, plus it&#x27;s made in the U.S.</li>
            <li>she pulled her hand out really quickly</li>
            <li>Then you quickly wrap the plastic bag around your hand, foot or elbow, etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big enough for my husband&#x27;s size 12 feet, and stays at a perfect temperature.  </li>
            <li>This helped out the tendonitis pain tremendously.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, faster than the directions state.  </li>
            <li>She had to stop taking some of the prescription meds due to liver problems, after a lot of research I found this to be a pretty good supplement!</li>
            <li>When hands and fingers are really sore from change in weather, etc., the hot wax quickly alleviates most of the associated discomfort.</li>
            <li>and i want, i love it thanks very  much,</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly, retains heat  level very well.</li>
            <li>I still believe the Therabath is a far better quality paraffin spa, if you have the money to invest in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest looking at the manufacturer&#x27;s website (which is the name of the product dot com) because it has a lot of useful information (including care, cleaning and maintenance of the unit).eaper) than the hand/foot \\&quot;liners\\&quot; and the terry oven mitts are thicker and hold in the heat better (and, again, cheaper) than the hand/foot mitts.  </li>
            <li>The gaurd for the bottom is wonderful as well as I borrowed the first paraffin bath I used, which was shallow and lacked a gaurd</li>
            <li>but I want it available) but not as much now.</li>
            <li>I love this and it makes your hands feel so soft.</li>
            <li>And for hands or feet you will need plastic bags and/or mitts to keep you warm - they have kits for both - a necessary added expense in my view.</li>
            <li>I am typing this one-handed while my left hand is encased in warm wax, a plastic bag, a wax mitten, and a towel.  </li>
            <li>It is pricey to buy the unit &amp; wax, but if you can afford it, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I may give it one last shot because when its working its really nice.  </li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>It was well worth the cost</li>
            <li>Recommend getting the big mitts to put over the plastic to keep it warm longer.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money paid.  </li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re going to do both hands and feet at the same time, have a partner to help put on plastic and some kind of towel or mitts/booties</li>
            <li>after reading reviews of the cheaper paraffin baths, i figured it wasn&#x27;t worth wasting my money on one of those.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product for anyone with hand pain, post-surgical hand recovery treatment and other related issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>like it was right out of the package).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>like it was right out of the package).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day on my hands because of a sore right wrist and thumb joints on both hands.  </li>
            <li>Just right for hands.  </li>
            <li>and the temperature is just right.  </li>
            <li>It has made a positive difference in my recovery, allowing my fingers to move more freely and thus gain back flexibility and</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is very good quality, heats fairly quickly (overnight or all day to melt 6-7 pounds of wax initially).</li>
            <li>The treatment is very soothing and is even good for dry or cracked hands.  </li>
            <li>This one is nice, compact, heats up fast enough to melt the wax within 5 to 6 hours.  </li>
            <li>I still believe the Therabath is a far better quality paraffin spa, if you have the money to invest in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest looking at the manufacturer&#x27;s website (which is the name of the product dot com) because it has a lot of useful information (including care, cleaning and maintenance of the unit).</li>
            <li>Love this-use it daily on my arthritic hands&lt;br /&gt;Not too hot for me-just right temp</li>
            <li>Therabath, so far, does just fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as hot as I would like.  </li>
            <li>The first time, my hands felt like I applied Vaseline to them and then slept with socks over my hands overnight.  </li>
            <li>By using ZIP-LOC mouth bags, it&#x27;s easier to get your hands in by yourself because the top stays open on</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are MANY different scents of Therabath brand wax to choose from.  </li>
            <li>this was my first time trying it.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;There are MANY different scents of Therabath brand wax to choose from.  </li>
            <li>this was my first time trying it.  </li>
            <li>I noticed some reviews thought it was too hot.</li>
            <li>used it quite a bit when I first got it</li>
            <li>how my hand is feeling that makes it feel hot or not so hot.</li>
            <li>It felt a lot hotter that time than the first time</li>
            <li>The wax has to be liquid, but not so hot as to burn.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in 3 days from order, exactly as ordered.</li>
            <li>It keeps the wax at a consistent temperature.  </li>
            <li>At first glance Therabath Pro Parafin Bath units seem a bit pricey; but, after research I found they have the longest warranty of the industry and provide the deepest and widest basin for dipping hands, elbows and feet in a paraffin therapy bath.</li>
            <li>so you could imagine how much you would be saving!  </li>
            <li>It has surely made a difference in my daily living.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Therabath!</li>
            <li>This is my first paraffin bath.  </li>
            <li>It takes about 12-24 hours to heat up the wax the first time you stick it in.  </li>
            <li>The heat of the wax feels too hot during these times.  </li>
            <li>I feel it too hot</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Most of the client&#x27;s forearm wound up in the bath using an enormous amount of wax.</li>
            <li>This is the first paraffin bath we have owned</li>
            <li>It is exactly as the description states</li>
            <li>I use it at least two times every day and it has made a great difference in my hand pain and flexibility.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping also!</li>
            <li>besides, those bugs were living on me in the first place.  </li>
            <li>if they are so confident in their product that they give a 5 yr warranty, they should NOT make me pay to send it back for repair.if they are so confident in their product that they give a 5 yr warranty, they should NOT make me pay to send it back for repair.</li>
            <li>It really does not need a low/high switch because the temperature is just right all the time.  </li>
            <li>I leave the unit plugged in all the time, and the paraffin is always ready and the right temperature.  </li>
            <li>The wife loves it,  Large enough for my size 14 foot! :)</li>
            <li>The deep capacity of this bath is wonderful, as I am not able to bend my wrist very well to dip my hand.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never too hot and always ready for a dip.&lt;br /&gt;SETS</li>
            <li>I went with the professional Therabath because of all of the terrible reviews on the cheaper tubs out there, and I&#x27;m here to tell you that I&#x27;m so happy I went with the best!</li>
            <li>as I am still using it two to three times a day, it stays hot and is always ready to go.  </li>
            <li>That way, if it overflows, the wax doesn&#x27;t end up on the floor, and it is a major pain to try to clean the spilled wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a large unit, but not unattractive.  </li>
            <li>It was a smart purchase.</li>
            <li>I find the wax is still a little warm.</li>
            <li>The overall construction is cheap compared to description.  </li>
            <li>This therabath product is much sturdier and deeper than the cheaper models out there.  </li>
            <li>After waiting about 6-8 hours, the wax was melted and ready to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is important to note that the makers of Therabath designed their paraffin wax spas without an external on/off switch or manual/adjustable temperature control.  </li>
            <li>It takes about 6-8 hours for the wax to fully melt and be ready to use.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Therabath because it keeps the wax ready at all times.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comforting and has given me lots of relief and helped me sleep at night.</li>
            <li>strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax is always the same comfortable temperature.  </li>
            <li>Now mind you, I had put the lid back on and hadn&#x27;t noticed the light going on either.</li>
            <li>but she has never complained that it was too hot.</li>
            <li>she says it gives her much relief as her hand continues to heal.</li>
            <li>so it is always ready to use.</li>
            <li>I keep it plugged in and at the ready.  </li>
            <li>The unit is kept on all of the time so that it&#x27;s always ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really helps to have it at home too.</li>
            <li>enjoy the use of this bath, but I feel that sometimes I will catch it in the middle of a warmup cycle.  </li>
            <li>thank you for everything thanks i need</li>
            <li>I must have spent an hour heating, scooping, heating again and scooping more.</li>
            <li>Ready for use 7/24.</li>
            <li>This has been great for my tired sore hands after being on a keyboard all day (and mousing for hours and hours).  </li>
            <li>It really helps with arthritis pain and my post surgery pain as well.  </li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t done anything really.</li>
            <li>the bath is built much sturdier than the others I have had.  </li>
            <li>really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I like it because It really does soften your feet.</li>
            <li>This thing was packed very well</li>
            <li>I really like the Therabath Pro Paraffin Bath.</li>
            <li>(the living quarters top out at 62, not much of an improvement  ...)</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll replace the wax when it starts to look very unsavory.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I think my hand was more sensitive the second dip.</li>
            <li>The wax was REALLY thick, but it felt good.  </li>
            <li>I got this to help with the healing of the surgery I had done on my right thumb, plus it makes your hands feel soft.</li>
            <li>(Please see my note below about other, better options).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It had been shipped just in the original box and not double boxed and when the unit is inside the box</li>
            <li>I was concerned the first time she tried it and had an old towel ready just in case</li>
            <li>and it seems to be doing much better than the first round of shots.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then you can dump the mostly solid wax plug out, and scrap off the bottom layer off the plug and from the bottom of the bath, and then return the remaining clean wax to the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li>We tried a more expensive one before this and found out it didn&#x27;t warm the wax hot or soon enough.</li>
            <li>Better than the inexpensive brands I&#x27;ve previously used.</li>
            <li>I am slowly able to perform tasks with my hands that I previously lost the capacity to do.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t easy to do, and you have to be careful not to overflow the bath).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know that this is the same type of regimen used by physical therapists--heat followed by exercises.page information sheet is generated with the registration that has some interesting &amp; helpful information.  </li>
            <li>Also the unit is left plugged in and powered up at all times, so you had better trust the product to work properly.  </li>
            <li>i love that is big enough for the feet as well as the hands and wrists!!</li>
            <li>Steady and reliable as can be.</li>
            <li>and I chose this particular one by reading Amazon reviews.</li>
            <li>I particularly like that it stays on all the time</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend ordering one today if you&#x27;re trying to deal with wrist/hand/finger stiffness and pain.</li>
            <li>All in all I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Each time I use the wax, they feel a little softer (and better).  </li>
            <li>Large enough to fit both hands or feet at the same time.</li>
            <li>We both enjoy to wet heat and the relief provided by this bath.</li>
            <li>Over all it has been well worth the extra money for my sore aching hands.</li>
            <li>It is still early, but so far it is functioning exactly as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s normal ad</li>
            <li>and I think it is worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li>(normal range 126-134 per literature).  </li>
            <li>More or less this is a wonder for her, and also myself!</li>
            <li>It only took 1 1/2 hours for that amount to melt for me, so I started using it right away.  </li>
            <li>I use my new Therabath to ease the cramping and drawing of the muscles in my hands.</li>
            <li>however, it heated up just fine down there, to 133 degrees using cooking thermometer</li>
            <li>this has helped my hands after surgery, the PT suggested I use it before exercising, it helps my flexibility, and leaves my hands very soft.</li>
            <li>It also makes your hands feel very soft.</li>
            <li>It does keep my hands very soft</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes it feels really really hot and other times not so hot</li>
            <li>Excellent product and would highly recommend this product over some less expensive.  </li>
            <li>it only comes with 6 blocks of wax you definitely need the full 9.  </li>
            <li>I ended up making a huge mess and gave up.  </li>
            <li>The bath is the size of a large, oval crockpot &amp; I keep it plugged in all the time on the counter in my second bathroom.  </li>
            <li>and finally wrap the plastic bag on your hand, etc., in a large towel.  </li>
            <li>It is large enough to sink my hand and wrist into it without having to touch the sides or bottom.  </li>
            <li>It is large enough for me to use on my feet as well as my hands.</li>
            <li>By watching, I learned that all you need is a plastic bag large enough to slip over your hand and an old towel to wrap around your hand.  </li>
            <li>(getting the bag on my second hand was a little more of a challenge, but doable) and then put them in terry mitts.  </li>
            <li>Amazon must have made a huge data entry error/glitch while updating/changing the prices in their system, because for a few hours one day it was selling for a fraction of the retail price.  </li>

            <li>So far it has been a blessing to my son-in-law.  </li>
            <li>This bath is very accommodating to larger feet and hands.</li>
            <li>PROFESSIONAL QUALITY....LOVELY.  </li>
            <li>The second time it feels much hotter.</li>
            <li>Actually our whole family uses it.  </li>
            <li>Also, its clear that the paraffin wax that came with this product is old.</li>
            <li>and they are still soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend placing it on an old towel or something to protect the surface of the place you put it.</li>
            <li>I got the therabath professional for treatment of osteo arthritis of my hands.  </li>
            <li>By the time the wax got near the body part, it was already hardened so that it did not \\&quot;paint\\&quot; on</li>
            <li>Be sure to buy at least 8 blocks of paraffin for it.  </li>
            <li>I even recycle the wax in the bag that is in small clumps &amp; easy to pick out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I dip my hands (one at a time) about 10 times with only a few seconds between dips, put my hand in a 9x15 plastic bag that I have had a large box full forever and place my hand inside a bath towel and do so for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>although the aluminum insert that actually holds the wax is a bit delicate and the top part (see photos) can be bent - mine came with a small area of the aluminum top deformed from the box being dropped I think.</li>
            <li>After much thought and consideration, I would not, however, pay the full retail price (for my dry skin problem)  because there are other cheaper alternatives.  </li>
            <li>After much thought and consideration, I would not, however, pay the full retail price (for my dry skin problem)  because there are other cheaper alternatives.  </li>
            <li>The plastic bag lasts for quite a few uses--in seven days I have replaced the original once.  </li>
            <li>and my hand/wrist were pretty loose as I began my routine each time, twice a day.</li>
            <li>It definitely didn&#x27;t get hot enough for us.  </li>
            <li>As a bonus, I find that using this really makes my skin soft, and relieves dry or chapped skin.</li>
            <li>Well, one time I did one of my hands and it felt about what I thought to be normal and then decided to do the same hand again.</li>
            <li>Based on other reviews, I selected this model as deep enough and safe enough to use every day or so.  </li>
            <li>(I am right handed and didn&#x27;t want to take a chance of something going wrong and my left hand was hurting more anyway)</li>
            <li>It has done everything that I expected and a little more.  </li>
            <li>I had the Therabath in my Amazon cart for a while because I was hesitant to spend THAT much money on something that may or may not work in alleviating the extremely dry skin on my hands (even though my friends swore by the paraffin treatments at their spa).  </li>

            <li>It is deep enough to submerge your whole foot.  </li>
            <li>(had all 4 fingers on both hands doing the trigger finger thing) which helped for awhile (4-6 months the first time) and then finally had surgery on my left hand as it started being more painful than my right hand.</li>
            <li>I generally leave the wax on for about 15 minutes and then peel it off (like a glove).  </li>
            <li>The TB6 is a Professional DEEP IMMERSION (6-9 lb wax capacity) paraffin bath that accomodates hands and feet.  </li>
            <li>I am a divorced male and share a 9 year old daughter with my ex-spouse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had the therabath for one week, but so far it has lived up to expectations.  </li>
            <li>It was received much faster than I expected - within 2 days.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived very well packaged and just as expected.  </li>
            <li>Therabath Professional Paraffin Bath came with 3 packages of wax beads and we immediately set it up and used it later that night.  </li>
            <li>I got a little carried away the first time I did it and did it probably 7 times.  </li>
            <li>I had a second round of shots on my right hand</li>
            <li>The selling points were its size (width and depth) and apparent commercial quality/</li>
            <li>My wrist and hand are still on the mend but they have come a long way since those early days.</li>
            <li>Therabath&#x27;s rationale (according to their website) behind this is that the spa should be viewed similar to a refrigerator that is safely plugged in and running all of the time with internally regulated temperature controls.  </li>
            <li>I keep it filled to the 6 pound level and have much less paraffin splash over the edge than in previous ones I&#x27;ve had and</li>
            <li>finally had shots in my right hand (the most painful one)</li>
            <li>When I first opened the package, I thought the scent was going to be too overwhelming, but once the wax was melted in the container (and even on my hands), it was only a very subtle scent (not strong</li>

            <li> The Therabath Paraffin Bath is great for my hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just happy that it&#x27;s providing my mom relief.</li>
            <li> got the el-cheapo &#x27;13 inch terry cloth oven mitts&#x27;, and they were great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very pleasant just on its own for relieving stiffness, but I always have to follow with the stretching, etc.  </li>
            <li> Very nice, wonderful and easy.</li>
            <li> It is so nice to use and works great.  </li>
            <li> I ordered one for a friend because of the good service and how it works.</li>
            <li> The wax feels really good on my hands.  </li>
            <li> I still think that is a good, lower-priced option and would still have done that if the price not been lowered on the Therabath.  </li>

            <li> The wax is really nice, no perfume smells but great oil content.</li>
            <li> It has a good depth, good, even heat, reliability.  </li>
            <li> I suppose just some really good lotion would do that too</li>
            <li> It appears to be constructed of good quality materials.  </li>
            <li> Received the item promptly and in good packaging.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I dip my hand in it 6 or 7 times per application to get a good coating of wax and it makes my hand feel</li>
            <li> I did some research before buying and this seemed to be a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> The most challenging aspect was finding the perfect location in the house for the Therabath (since it needs to remain plugged in/on at all times).  </li>
            <li> Delivery service was exceptional.</li>
            <li> I got a good price deal on it and love it!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m now very glad that I made the purchase.  </li>
            <li> I had used this product when visiting my massage therapist and was very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> its very inspiring that they have a 5 year warranty</li>
            <li> We love it!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that had it not been damaged it would have been a good product.</li>
            <li> It stays nice and warm all the time.</li>
            <li> I use it to warm up my wrist and hand muscles before stretching and exercising them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am THRILLED.  </li>
            <li> The warm paraffin is soothing to my injured wrist, and it helps to \\&quot;unlock\\&quot; the muscles in my hand.  </li>
            <li> The warm wax is so soothing to my arthritic joints.  </li>
            <li> , they made sure I received this item in perfect new condition!</li>
            <li> I love this thing but can&#x27;t honestly say I have gotten a lot of relief for my trigger fingers.</li>
            <li> works just as perfectly as the one my old salon used.  </li>
            <li> She first experienced relief at the therapists offices.</li>
            <li> Since I have been helping her with her wax dips every morning and evening she has seen a huge difference in her fingers, they have warmth to them now and also much more dexterity!</li>
            <li> Meaning it&#x27;s a miracle tub with Paraffin wax that gives her relief, warmth, reduces swelling and gives her a huge leap forward with dexterity in her fingers!</li>
            <li> Item was received with dent on top of bowl.  </li>
            <li> The lid was lying on top untouched.  </li>
            <li> I have had better quality crockpots for $39.95.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Most people can&#x27;t/don&#x27;t want to wait 8 hours EACH time before using it.  </li>
            <li> (And in the cycling on/off, it is off more than it is on - which is indicated by the indicator</li>
            <li> It also retains heat better because you can zip-lock it to your arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For a fraction of the price, I absolutely love the Therabath.  </li>
            <li> It also retains heat better because you can zip-lock it to your arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For a fraction of the price, I absolutely love the Therabath.  </li>
            <li> Box not damaged just the top lip was bent where you can tell it was dropped.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> The more times equals the amount of heat that is retained, so you will probably need to experiment.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to register your unit with the company.  </li>
            <li> A six page information sheet is generated with the registration that has some interesting &amp; helpful information.  </li>
            <li> My hands &amp; wrists do feel better after each treatment &amp; I am able to do painless finger/wrist exercises after the treatment.  </li>
            <li> My hands &amp; wrists do feel better after each treatment &amp; I am able to do painless finger/wrist exercises after the treatment.  </li>
            <li> I expect to use it for many years.</li>
            <li> We can better afford the treatments at home.</li>
            <li> Love this for hand moisturizing and softening in the winter months.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I both work with our hands, and are mostly in the shop--I&#x27;m a carpenter and he works with repairing machinery.  </li>
            <li> I chose this one after lots of reading and am glad we settled on this one.  </li>
            <li> Love the bath, but it does take 6 hours for the wax to melt entirely for best use.</li>
            <li> So glad I decided to purchase this brand and model.</li>
            <li> It is still safe for the feet, but I would prefer to catch it on an idle heat.  </li>
            <li> And here are six more words.</li>
            <li> My hands are 100% better since I have been using this.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on the web and glad I purchased this bath.  </li>
            <li> It is top quality</li>
            <li> and I believe we will have it for many years of use.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to any one that is in need of a top of the line paraffin bath.  </li>
            <li> You can leave it plugged in all the time in a safe and child-proof location.  </li>
            <li> Love my Therabath.  </li>
            <li> We have children around most every day.</li>
            <li> I could not think of a safe location to place it, to leave it plugged in without the worry of spilled wax.</li>
            <li> The instructions say it takes 4-6 hours to melt and it does just that so make sure you plan for that.  </li>
            <li> The wax comes pre-shreaded which is great and makes it melt much easier.  </li>
            <li> the therabath is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> i was also pleased to see something is still made in the u.s.a.  AND</li>
            <li> Outstanding product to reduce the affects of arthritis.  </li>
            <li> It melted the wax very quickly and maintains it at the proper temperature perfectly.  </li>
            <li> It sure feels good on the hands and it leaves your hands feeling really, really nice - soft.</li>
            <li> I have large hands and they fit easily in this paraffin bath, it does an excellent job of maintaining temperature and is easy to clean and refill.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for dry skin but also just for the relaxation affect.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a quick way to warm up</li>
            <li> My finger was injured in an accident and therabath works great to warm hand prior to exercises/therapy, or when sore.</li>
            <li> but oh, the warm feeling on the hands is worth it just for that</li>
            <li> but it really feels good after use.</li>
            <li> Spa was purchased for rehab purposes, but is also very useful for keeping your skin in tip top condition.  </li>
            <li> and they said no problem except I had to remove all the wax from the unit - it was full of solidified wax!  </li>
            <li> Easy storage when not in use.</li>
            <li> How easy is that.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to store and the 6lbs of wax that comes with the bath</li>
            <li> Not only does it feel great, but it works better too.  </li>
            <li> Feels great, leaves skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Therabath was very easy to set-up and use RIGHT OUT of the BOX.  </li>
            <li> a 5 yr warranty is very unusual these days, which made me more confident of the product.  </li>
            <li> and it continues to work just fine.  </li>
            <li> but once you add the wax to where it is supposed to be, it will be fine.  </li>
            <li> It does have some gap between the well and the outer shell, but it doesn&#x27;t move and seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with my own professional Therabath paraffin bath and the convenience of using it at home.</li>
            <li> If you are a person that does not feel comfortable leaving things on/plugged in 24/7, then this probably is not the unit for you.  </li>
            <li> This product is great, especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Wax stays warm and ready for use.</li>
            <li> While I am not too happy with the results of the surgery, I love how the paraffin bath makes my still very sore hands feel better, even if only temporary.</li>
            <li> Sufferers of rheumatoid arthritis really appreciate the temporary relief this warm wax brings.</li>
            <li> so the wax is ready for you when you have some time to warm your hand(s) and get the therapeutic  benefits.  </li>
            <li> To me that was an important feature.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea but it has to be kept plugged in all the time if you want to use it daily.</li>
            <li> Great online purchase through Amazon, would definitely recommend to anyone needing this for therapy!!!</li>
            <li> i added just 3 more pounds and now it&#x27;s the right depth for my use.</li>
            <li> There is even a 5 step QUICK and easy SET-UP REFERENCE CARD so that you don&#x27;t have to read the instruction manual.  </li>
            <li> Worked fine for me so far, make sure not to reuse wax!</li>
            <li> I have used one at a salon and enjoyed it very much.  </li>
            <li> Is not so hot that safe to use with hardware in hand.</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been using this for two months and says it has helped her significantly with the pain.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use when it arrived</li>
            <li> My husband also mentioned that it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for dry areas</li>
            <li> After 4 months my left hand is doing pretty good; most of the swelling/scaring is gone).</li>
            <li> Great for dry winter hands and feet!  </li>
            <li> A large towel keeps the heat in better than a skimpy one.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing special about this product and a lower priced paraffin bath</li>
            <li> Feels good &amp; cuts back on pain &amp; aches!</li>
            <li> And it does leave my hands nice and soft; and helps alleviate arthritis while I&#x27;m using it.  </li>
            <li> (You can repeat for as many times as you&#x27;d like, but based on my experience anything over 5 times is way too much.)  </li>
            <li> The food storage, plastic bags are MUCH thicker (and cheaper) than the hand/foot \\&quot;liners\\&quot; and the terry oven mitts are thicker and hold in the heat better (and, again, cheaper) than the hand/foot mitts.  </li>
            <li> , this is a good choice for you because you can place your foot in the bath and the wax will rise up above your ankle joint.</li>
            <li> The wax must cool...</li>
            <li> The Euc/Mint fragrance is very calming and satisfying.  </li>
            <li> i was a bit worried when the product guide said that the environmental operating range should be 65-85 degrees F, since i planned to put it in the basement, which on a good day in winter tops out at 54, and was the only convenient place where i had a vacant 3-prong grounded outlet.</li>
            <li> and it is far superior to the first 2.  </li>
            <li> I loved the thing so much that I decided to put out the money for a new one.  </li>
            <li> I do have to admit, though, that I was extremely lucky and did not pay the full price.  </li>
            <li> I do have to admit, though, that I was extremely lucky and did not pay the full price.  </li>
            <li> The heating indicator light goes on and off but doesn&#x27;t seem to be on very much so there must be good insulation between the aluminum &amp;#34;tub&amp;#34; and the plastic outside shell.</li>
            <li> After deciding on the location, I just opened the 6 plastic bags containing the wax, put the solid wax into the container, placed the grate on top of the wax, placed the lid on top of that and then plugged the unit in.  </li>
            <li> It costs way more than the one it replaced, but it&#x27;s worth every penny because it&#x27;s always ready, plus it&#x27;s made in the U.S.</li>
            <li> she pulled her hand out really quickly</li>
            <li> Then you quickly wrap the plastic bag around your hand, foot or elbow, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big enough for my husband&#x27;s size 12 feet, and stays at a perfect temperature.  </li>
            <li> This helped out the tendonitis pain tremendously.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, faster than the directions state.  </li>
            <li> She had to stop taking some of the prescription meds due to liver problems, after a lot of research I found this to be a pretty good supplement!</li>
            <li> When hands and fingers are really sore from change in weather, etc., the hot wax quickly alleviates most of the associated discomfort.</li>
            <li> and i want, i love it thanks very  much,</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly, retains heat  level very well.</li>
            <li> I still believe the Therabath is a far better quality paraffin spa, if you have the money to invest in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest looking at the manufacturer&#x27;s website (which is the name of the product dot com) because it has a lot of useful information (including care, cleaning and maintenance of the unit).eaper) than the hand/foot \\&quot;liners\\&quot; and the terry oven mitts are thicker and hold in the heat better (and, again, cheaper) than the hand/foot mitts.  </li>
            <li> The gaurd for the bottom is wonderful as well as I borrowed the first paraffin bath I used, which was shallow and lacked a gaurd</li>
            <li> but I want it available) but not as much now.</li>
            <li> I love this and it makes your hands feel so soft.</li>
            <li> And for hands or feet you will need plastic bags and/or mitts to keep you warm - they have kits for both - a necessary added expense in my view.</li>
            <li> I am typing this one-handed while my left hand is encased in warm wax, a plastic bag, a wax mitten, and a towel.  </li>
            <li> It is pricey to buy the unit &amp; wax, but if you can afford it, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I may give it one last shot because when its working its really nice.  </li>
            <li> Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> It was well worth the cost</li>
            <li> Recommend getting the big mitts to put over the plastic to keep it warm longer.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money paid.  </li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re going to do both hands and feet at the same time, have a partner to help put on plastic and some kind of towel or mitts/booties</li>
            <li> after reading reviews of the cheaper paraffin baths, i figured it wasn&#x27;t worth wasting my money on one of those.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for anyone with hand pain, post-surgical hand recovery treatment and other related issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> like it was right out of the package).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like it was right out of the package).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day on my hands because of a sore right wrist and thumb joints on both hands.  </li>
            <li> Just right for hands.  </li>
            <li> and the temperature is just right.  </li>
            <li> It has made a positive difference in my recovery, allowing my fingers to move more freely and thus gain back flexibility and</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is very good quality, heats fairly quickly (overnight or all day to melt 6-7 pounds of wax initially).</li>
            <li> The treatment is very soothing and is even good for dry or cracked hands.  </li>
            <li> This one is nice, compact, heats up fast enough to melt the wax within 5 to 6 hours.  </li>
            <li> I still believe the Therabath is a far better quality paraffin spa, if you have the money to invest in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest looking at the manufacturer&#x27;s website (which is the name of the product dot com) because it has a lot of useful information (including care, cleaning and maintenance of the unit).</li>
            <li> Love this-use it daily on my arthritic hands&lt;br /&gt;Not too hot for me-just right temp</li>
            <li> Therabath, so far, does just fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as hot as I would like.  </li>
            <li> The first time, my hands felt like I applied Vaseline to them and then slept with socks over my hands overnight.  </li>
            <li> By using ZIP-LOC mouth bags, it&#x27;s easier to get your hands in by yourself because the top stays open on</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are MANY different scents of Therabath brand wax to choose from.  </li>
            <li> this was my first time trying it.  </li>

            <li> this was my first time trying it.  </li>
            <li> I noticed some reviews thought it was too hot.</li>
            <li> used it quite a bit when I first got it</li>
            <li> how my hand is feeling that makes it feel hot or not so hot.</li>
            <li> It felt a lot hotter that time than the first time</li>
            <li> The wax has to be liquid, but not so hot as to burn.  </li>
            <li> It arrived in 3 days from order, exactly as ordered.</li>
            <li> It keeps the wax at a consistent temperature.  </li>
            <li> At first glance Therabath Pro Parafin Bath units seem a bit pricey; but, after research I found they have the longest warranty of the industry and provide the deepest and widest basin for dipping hands, elbows and feet in a paraffin therapy bath.</li>
            <li> so you could imagine how much you would be saving!  </li>
            <li> It has surely made a difference in my daily living.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Therabath!</li>
            <li> This is my first paraffin bath.  </li>
            <li> It takes about 12-24 hours to heat up the wax the first time you stick it in.  </li>
            <li> The heat of the wax feels too hot during these times.  </li>
            <li> I feel it too hot</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Most of the client&#x27;s forearm wound up in the bath using an enormous amount of wax.</li>
            <li> This is the first paraffin bath we have owned</li>
            <li> It is exactly as the description states</li>
            <li> I use it at least two times every day and it has made a great difference in my hand pain and flexibility.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping also!</li>
            <li> besides, those bugs were living on me in the first place.  </li>
            <li> if they are so confident in their product that they give a 5 yr warranty, they should NOT make me pay to send it back for repair.if they are so confident in their product that they give a 5 yr warranty, they should NOT make me pay to send it back for repair.</li>
            <li> It really does not need a low/high switch because the temperature is just right all the time.  </li>
            <li> I leave the unit plugged in all the time, and the paraffin is always ready and the right temperature.  </li>
            <li> The wife loves it,  Large enough for my size 14 foot! :)</li>
            <li> The deep capacity of this bath is wonderful, as I am not able to bend my wrist very well to dip my hand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never too hot and always ready for a dip.&lt;br /&gt;SETS</li>
            <li> I went with the professional Therabath because of all of the terrible reviews on the cheaper tubs out there, and I&#x27;m here to tell you that I&#x27;m so happy I went with the best!</li>
            <li> as I am still using it two to three times a day, it stays hot and is always ready to go.  </li>
            <li> That way, if it overflows, the wax doesn&#x27;t end up on the floor, and it is a major pain to try to clean the spilled wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a large unit, but not unattractive.  </li>
            <li> It was a smart purchase.</li>
            <li> I find the wax is still a little warm.</li>
            <li> The overall construction is cheap compared to description.  </li>
            <li> This therabath product is much sturdier and deeper than the cheaper models out there.  </li>
            <li> After waiting about 6-8 hours, the wax was melted and ready to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is important to note that the makers of Therabath designed their paraffin wax spas without an external on/off switch or manual/adjustable temperature control.  </li>
            <li> It takes about 6-8 hours for the wax to fully melt and be ready to use.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Therabath because it keeps the wax ready at all times.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comforting and has given me lots of relief and helped me sleep at night.</li>
            <li> strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax is always the same comfortable temperature.  </li>
            <li> Now mind you, I had put the lid back on and hadn&#x27;t noticed the light going on either.</li>
            <li> but she has never complained that it was too hot.</li>
            <li> she says it gives her much relief as her hand continues to heal.</li>
            <li> so it is always ready to use.</li>
            <li> I keep it plugged in and at the ready.  </li>
            <li> The unit is kept on all of the time so that it&#x27;s always ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really helps to have it at home too.</li>
            <li> enjoy the use of this bath, but I feel that sometimes I will catch it in the middle of a warmup cycle.  </li>
            <li> thank you for everything thanks i need</li>
            <li> I must have spent an hour heating, scooping, heating again and scooping more.</li>
            <li> Ready for use 7/24.</li>
            <li> This has been great for my tired sore hands after being on a keyboard all day (and mousing for hours and hours).  </li>
            <li> It really helps with arthritis pain and my post surgery pain as well.  </li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t done anything really.</li>
            <li> the bath is built much sturdier than the others I have had.  </li>
            <li> really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I like it because It really does soften your feet.</li>
            <li> This thing was packed very well</li>
            <li> I really like the Therabath Pro Paraffin Bath.</li>
            <li> (the living quarters top out at 62, not much of an improvement  ...)</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll replace the wax when it starts to look very unsavory.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I think my hand was more sensitive the second dip.</li>
            <li> The wax was REALLY thick, but it felt good.  </li>
            <li> I got this to help with the healing of the surgery I had done on my right thumb, plus it makes your hands feel soft.</li>
            <li> (Please see my note below about other, better options).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It had been shipped just in the original box and not double boxed and when the unit is inside the box</li>
            <li> I was concerned the first time she tried it and had an old towel ready just in case</li>
            <li> and it seems to be doing much better than the first round of shots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then you can dump the mostly solid wax plug out, and scrap off the bottom layer off the plug and from the bottom of the bath, and then return the remaining clean wax to the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li> We tried a more expensive one before this and found out it didn&#x27;t warm the wax hot or soon enough.</li>
            <li> Better than the inexpensive brands I&#x27;ve previously used.</li>
            <li> I am slowly able to perform tasks with my hands that I previously lost the capacity to do.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t easy to do, and you have to be careful not to overflow the bath).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know that this is the same type of regimen used by physical therapists--heat followed by exercises.page information sheet is generated with the registration that has some interesting &amp; helpful information.  </li>
            <li> Also the unit is left plugged in and powered up at all times, so you had better trust the product to work properly.  </li>
            <li> i love that is big enough for the feet as well as the hands and wrists!!</li>
            <li> Steady and reliable as can be.</li>
            <li> and I chose this particular one by reading Amazon reviews.</li>
            <li> I particularly like that it stays on all the time</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend ordering one today if you&#x27;re trying to deal with wrist/hand/finger stiffness and pain.</li>
            <li> All in all I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Each time I use the wax, they feel a little softer (and better).  </li>
            <li> Large enough to fit both hands or feet at the same time.</li>
            <li> We both enjoy to wet heat and the relief provided by this bath.</li>
            <li> Over all it has been well worth the extra money for my sore aching hands.</li>
            <li> It is still early, but so far it is functioning exactly as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s normal ad</li>
            <li> and I think it is worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li> (normal range 126-134 per literature).  </li>
            <li> More or less this is a wonder for her, and also myself!</li>
            <li> It only took 1 1/2 hours for that amount to melt for me, so I started using it right away.  </li>
            <li> I use my new Therabath to ease the cramping and drawing of the muscles in my hands.</li>
            <li> however, it heated up just fine down there, to 133 degrees using cooking thermometer</li>
            <li> this has helped my hands after surgery, the PT suggested I use it before exercising, it helps my flexibility, and leaves my hands very soft.</li>
            <li> It also makes your hands feel very soft.</li>
            <li> It does keep my hands very soft</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes it feels really really hot and other times not so hot</li>
            <li> Excellent product and would highly recommend this product over some less expensive.  </li>
            <li> it only comes with 6 blocks of wax you definitely need the full 9.  </li>
            <li> I ended up making a huge mess and gave up.  </li>
            <li> The bath is the size of a large, oval crockpot &amp; I keep it plugged in all the time on the counter in my second bathroom.  </li>
            <li> and finally wrap the plastic bag on your hand, etc., in a large towel.  </li>
            <li> It is large enough to sink my hand and wrist into it without having to touch the sides or bottom.  </li>
            <li> It is large enough for me to use on my feet as well as my hands.</li>
            <li> By watching, I learned that all you need is a plastic bag large enough to slip over your hand and an old towel to wrap around your hand.  </li>
            <li> (getting the bag on my second hand was a little more of a challenge, but doable) and then put them in terry mitts.  </li>
            <li> Amazon must have made a huge data entry error/glitch while updating/changing the prices in their system, because for a few hours one day it was selling for a fraction of the retail price.  </li>

            <li> So far it has been a blessing to my son-in-law.  </li>
            <li> This bath is very accommodating to larger feet and hands.</li>
            <li> PROFESSIONAL QUALITY....LOVELY.  </li>
            <li> The second time it feels much hotter.</li>
            <li> Actually our whole family uses it.  </li>
            <li> Also, its clear that the paraffin wax that came with this product is old.</li>
            <li> and they are still soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend placing it on an old towel or something to protect the surface of the place you put it.</li>
            <li> I got the therabath professional for treatment of osteo arthritis of my hands.  </li>
            <li> By the time the wax got near the body part, it was already hardened so that it did not \\&quot;paint\\&quot; on</li>
            <li> Be sure to buy at least 8 blocks of paraffin for it.  </li>
            <li> I even recycle the wax in the bag that is in small clumps &amp; easy to pick out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I dip my hands (one at a time) about 10 times with only a few seconds between dips, put my hand in a 9x15 plastic bag that I have had a large box full forever and place my hand inside a bath towel and do so for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> although the aluminum insert that actually holds the wax is a bit delicate and the top part (see photos) can be bent - mine came with a small area of the aluminum top deformed from the box being dropped I think.</li>
            <li> After much thought and consideration, I would not, however, pay the full retail price (for my dry skin problem)  because there are other cheaper alternatives.  </li>

            <li> The plastic bag lasts for quite a few uses--in seven days I have replaced the original once.  </li>
            <li> and my hand/wrist were pretty loose as I began my routine each time, twice a day.</li>
            <li> It definitely didn&#x27;t get hot enough for us.  </li>
            <li> As a bonus, I find that using this really makes my skin soft, and relieves dry or chapped skin.</li>
            <li> Well, one time I did one of my hands and it felt about what I thought to be normal and then decided to do the same hand again.</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, I selected this model as deep enough and safe enough to use every day or so.  </li>
            <li> (I am right handed and didn&#x27;t want to take a chance of something going wrong and my left hand was hurting more anyway)</li>
            <li> It has done everything that I expected and a little more.  </li>
            <li> I had the Therabath in my Amazon cart for a while because I was hesitant to spend THAT much money on something that may or may not work in alleviating the extremely dry skin on my hands (even though my friends swore by the paraffin treatments at their spa).  </li>

            <li> It is deep enough to submerge your whole foot.  </li>
            <li> (had all 4 fingers on both hands doing the trigger finger thing) which helped for awhile (4-6 months the first time) and then finally had surgery on my left hand as it started being more painful than my right hand.</li>
            <li> I generally leave the wax on for about 15 minutes and then peel it off (like a glove).  </li>
            <li> The TB6 is a Professional DEEP IMMERSION (6-9 lb wax capacity) paraffin bath that accomodates hands and feet.  </li>
            <li> I am a divorced male and share a 9 year old daughter with my ex-spouse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the therabath for one week, but so far it has lived up to expectations.  </li>
            <li> It was received much faster than I expected - within 2 days.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived very well packaged and just as expected.  </li>
            <li> Therabath Professional Paraffin Bath came with 3 packages of wax beads and we immediately set it up and used it later that night.  </li>
            <li> I got a little carried away the first time I did it and did it probably 7 times.  </li>
            <li> I had a second round of shots on my right hand</li>
            <li> The selling points were its size (width and depth) and apparent commercial quality/</li>
            <li> My wrist and hand are still on the mend but they have come a long way since those early days.</li>
            <li> Therabath&#x27;s rationale (according to their website) behind this is that the spa should be viewed similar to a refrigerator that is safely plugged in and running all of the time with internally regulated temperature controls.  </li>
            <li> I keep it filled to the 6 pound level and have much less paraffin splash over the edge than in previous ones I&#x27;ve had and</li>
            <li> finally had shots in my right hand (the most painful one)</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package, I thought the scent was going to be too overwhelming, but once the wax was melted in the container (and even on my hands), it was only a very subtle scent (not strong</li>

            <li> decided to use just regular, generic zip-lock gallon-size plastic food storage bags and long terry oven mitts.  </li>
            <li> I use it daily, especially after I have been on the computer for a long time or working in the yard.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing for over-used hands and Repetitive Stress Injuries.</li>
            <li> but you get what you pay for if you want one that will work as described and last for a long time</li>
            <li> In fact, before the price was drastically (erroneously?) lowered, I had decided that I really shouldn&#x27;t spend THAT much money and instead was going to compromise and buy the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Paraffin Spa (on sale for twenty dollars at Wal-Mart) and then use the Therabath paraffin wax with that unit.  </li>
            <li> In fact, before the price was drastically (erroneously?) lowered, I had decided that I really shouldn&#x27;t spend THAT much money and instead was going to compromise and buy the Dr.</li>
            <li> I bought a much less expensive paraffin bath a few years ago which was just as good.</li>
            <li> She uses it also claiming that her hand hurts or is sore or whatever as an excuse for me saying, yes, you can do your hands too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the down side the rack that resides in the bottom of the tub is not as big as it ought to be, it doesn&#x27;t cover the entire bottom</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of the Therabath and some minor buffing and moisturizing, my feet are healed!</li>
            <li> I have not had this unit very long.</li>
            <li> It helps with his severly dry hands and some arthiritis.  </li>
            <li> My hand and wrist were severly injured, a lot of scar tissue and limited mobility.  </li>
            <li> Wish they would have just sent replacement, but I order different unit that cost less.</li>
            <li> When he uses this regularly his hands/wrists ache less</li>
            <li> and it was off all summer, so only was running about half the time i had it.  </li>
            <li> purchased the Therabath to help alleviate the EXTREMELY and painfully dry and cracked hands that I get as soon as the weather turns colder.  </li>
            <li> This product is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ll see how it is in the next few years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not very practical for my situation.</li>
            <li> As a 9 year old, my daughters skin is not as thick and weathered as mine at 60</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard of people leaving it on overnight, but the wax was already starting to crack after 15 minutes, so I&#x27;m not really sure it would stay attached to my hands for over 8 hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then do the other hand if I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the paraffin bath for my wrist and elbow due to surgery...</li>
            <li> I started doing the other hand and what a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> After reading reviews for other paraffin baths I decided to purchase this unit.  </li>
            <li> but I have used other brands of paraffin that I prefer.  </li>
            <li> took the tip from the other reviewer to use ziplock bags and oven mitts.  </li>
            <li> The outer casing is thin plastic and will bow against the inner pan when apply moderate pressure to the side of the unit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the hassle to return, hence the problem with mail order.  </li>
            <li> I think this is over priced and not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I added this para which may seem common sense, but w/a broken bone, one is not always thinking of details &amp; messes at first.</li>
            <li> Read other reviews on Amazon and decided to purchase for my dad who has trouble with arthritis.  </li>
            <li> This one was previously damaged and repacked.  </li>
            <li> The product has met or slightly exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> So I did what they recommended and tried to use my hair dryer to get the wax out - what a mess.</li>
            <li> I was not able to use it due to damage.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier and I added a little lavender oil to it, so relaxing.</li>
            <li> My O.T. said it may get a little warmer when the wax goes below the minimum amount</li>
            <li> a little...</li>
            <li> It gets a little messy adding wax to the unit and I often drip a little on the surface as I dip and remove my hand.  </li>
            <li> The swelling in her hands and wrists has gone down substantially also!</li>
            <li> It really helps prevent our hands from drying out and cracking in the cold of winter.</li>
            <li> Instead, you spread your fingers, dip for a few seconds, take your hand out for a few seconds and then re-dip.  </li>
            <li> I had a unit that worked for a few months before it stopped heating.  </li>
            <li> Use an epson salt or dead sea salt bath instead.</li>
            <li> I have done her feet a few times but not on the schedule as her hands</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard for me to get down to do her feet!</li>
            <li> I would give the tub a 5 except for the rack in bottom being to small and not caring for the paraffin.  </li>
            <li> WAY TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THAT SHORT A LIFE!</li>
            <li> Pretty stupid on the part of the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I have pain in my hands related to cold weather and have been considering purchasing a paraffin bath.  </li>
            <li> You dip your hand slowly into the wax that is between 120 - 125 degrees, (there is no temperature switch-the heat is preprogrammed)</li>
            <li> seriously, if you wash your hands and clean your nails before using it, and you&#x27;re not sharing it with someone with ebola, i can&#x27;t imagine horrible diseases are breeding in paraffin--</li>
            <li> Bought it because my wife had a painful &amp;#34;hammer finger&amp;#34;, and she uses it daily.  </li>
            <li> Do a bit of shopping and find the least expensive unit...</li>
            <li> If you have ankle or foot problems like I do (broken both over a year ago)</li>
            <li> IF YOU BUY FROM THE WRONG SOURCE</li>
            <li> Expensive experiment for us.</li>
            <li> She has poor circulation in her fingers also!</li>
            <li> out----it will feel like i&#x27;m paying rent on an expensive product.  </li>
            <li> it was cold.  </li>
            <li> He helped me pick this out for my mom who suffers from arthritis in the hands and carpal tunnel in her arms.</li>
            <li> and I ended up burning an area on my hand that is numb from nerve damage.  </li>
            <li> This product is a must for any massage therapist to soothe and relax tired hands at the end of the day!!  </li>
            <li> too bad one isn&#x27;t built in).  </li>
            <li> you think you&#x27;ve got bad feet....</li>
            <li> I badly broke my wrist.</li>
            <li> and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Eventually, you&#x27;ll get a nasty collection of lint, hairs, etc at the bottom of the unit.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is so nice to use and works great.  I ordered one for a friend because of the good service and how it works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as hot as I would like.  Maybe that&#x27;s the way it is suppose to be.  Let me know.</li>
            <li> The product exceeded expectations.  The machine arrived as advertized.  The unit performs well.  Constant even temperature.  Easy storage when not in use.</li>
            <li> I love this and it makes your hands feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Item was received with dent on top of bowl.  The lid was lying on top untouched.  This one was previously damaged and repacked.  It does not interfere with the performance. It&#x27;s not worth the hassle to return, hence the problem with mail order.  This seems to be a problem with Therabath and not Planet Stuff.  The overall construction is cheap compared to description.  The outer casing is thin plastic and will bow against the inner pan when apply moderate pressure to the side of the unit.  I have had better quality crockpots for $39.95.  Will not buy any Therabath product moving forward.</li>
            <li> The wife loves it,  Large enough for my size 14 foot! :)</li>
            <li> So far it has been a blessing to my son-in-law.  It was a gift and he has been using it since he received it.  It helps with his severly dry hands and some arthiritis.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> Awesome for improving circulation and recovering joints in arthritic states!!!</li>
            <li> Spa was purchased for rehab purposes, but is also very useful for keeping your skin in tip top condition.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The Therabath Paraffin Bath is great for my hands. Feels good &amp; cuts back on pain &amp; aches! I love it.</li>
            <li> This therabath product is much sturdier and deeper than the cheaper models out there.  And it does leave my hands nice and soft; and helps alleviate arthritis while I&#x27;m using it.  It takes time to melt the wax though - so some advance planning is required (I&#x27;ve started to use a timer;  too bad one isn&#x27;t built in).  There is no one-off switch either.  And for hands or feet you will need plastic bags and/or mitts to keep you warm - they have kits for both - a necessary added expense in my view.</li>
            <li> I researched several different paraffin spas before ultimately deciding on this one.  The selling points were its size (width and depth) and apparent commercial quality/durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TB 6 (110V) is Therabath&#x27;s newest/most recent model.  The TB6 is a Professional DEEP IMMERSION (6-9 lb wax capacity) paraffin bath that accomodates hands and feet.  It also has a new/improved (over the TB5 model) ANODIZED ALUMINUM TANK (with integrated handles) that is lightweight, durable, and energy efficient.  This box set comes with 6 PACKAGES (6 lbs.) of Therabath of PARAFFIN WAX (which is what you need to get started).  According to the manufacturer, six pounds of paraffin provides ~42 manicures (both hands) or 32 pedicures (both feet), assuming three dips per hand or foot.  The plastic liners and terry mitts are NOT included. (Please see my note below about other, better options).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Therabath was very easy to set-up and use RIGHT OUT of the BOX.  There is even a 5 step QUICK and easy SET-UP REFERENCE CARD so that you don&#x27;t have to read the instruction manual.  The most challenging aspect was finding the perfect location in the house for the Therabath (since it needs to remain plugged in/on at all times).  After deciding on the location, I just opened the 6 plastic bags containing the wax, put the solid wax into the container, placed the grate on top of the wax, placed the lid on top of that and then plugged the unit in.  After waiting about 6-8 hours, the wax was melted and ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to note that the makers of Therabath designed their paraffin wax spas without an external on/off switch or manual/adjustable temperature control.  (When it&#x27;s plugged in, it&#x27;s \\&quot;on\\&quot; and automatically cycles on/off to regulate the temperature of the wax.)  Therabath&#x27;s rationale (according to their website) behind this is that the spa should be viewed similar to a refrigerator that is safely plugged in and running all of the time with internally regulated temperature controls.  In reality, if you want to use the Therabath on a regular basis, you have to keep it plugged it to keep the paraffin wax melted.  It takes about 6-8 hours for the wax to fully melt and be ready to use.  Most people can&#x27;t/don&#x27;t want to wait 8 hours EACH time before using it.  If you are a person that does not feel comfortable leaving things on/plugged in 24/7, then this probably is not the unit for you.  I have had mine on/plugged in for almost 3 weeks without any problem.  (And in the cycling on/off, it is off more than it is on - which is indicated by the indicator light.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Therabath to help alleviate the EXTREMELY and painfully dry and cracked hands that I get as soon as the weather turns colder.  The wax feels really good on my hands.  I just wish I could \\&quot;soak\\&quot; them in the wax.  Instead, you spread your fingers, dip for a few seconds, take your hand out for a few seconds and then re-dip.  (You can repeat for as many times as you&#x27;d like, but based on my experience anything over 5 times is way too much.)  I got a little carried away the first time I did it and did it probably 7 times.  The wax was REALLY thick, but it felt good.  After that, I put my hands inside plastic bags (getting the bag on my second hand was a little more of a challenge, but doable) and then put them in terry mitts.  I generally leave the wax on for about 15 minutes and then peel it off (like a glove).  The first time, my hands felt like I applied Vaseline to them and then slept with socks over my hands overnight.  Each time I use the wax, they feel a little softer (and better).  I&#x27;ve heard of people leaving it on overnight, but the wax was already starting to crack after 15 minutes, so I&#x27;m not really sure it would stay attached to my hands for over 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use just regular, generic zip-lock gallon-size plastic food storage bags and long terry oven mitts.  The food storage, plastic bags are MUCH thicker (and cheaper) than the hand/foot \\&quot;liners\\&quot; and the terry oven mitts are thicker and hold in the heat better (and, again, cheaper) than the hand/foot mitts.  You can even re-use the plastic bags to help save additional money.  By using ZIP-LOC mouth bags, it&#x27;s easier to get your hands in by yourself because the top stays open on it&#x27;s own.  It also retains heat better because you can zip-lock it to your arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are MANY different scents of Therabath brand wax to choose from.  I purchased the unit with the LAVENDER HARMONY scent.  When I first opened the package, I thought the scent was going to be too overwhelming, but once the wax was melted in the container (and even on my hands), it was only a very subtle scent (not strong like it was right out of the package).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with my Therabath Paraffin Spa purchase.  I do have to admit, though, that I was extremely lucky and did not pay the full price.  Amazon must have made a huge data entry error/glitch while updating/changing the prices in their system, because for a few hours one day it was selling for a fraction of the retail price.  And that is when I purchased mine.  The extremely low price was the only reason that I purchased it.  I had the Therabath in my Amazon cart for a while because I was hesitant to spend THAT much money on something that may or may not work in alleviating the extremely dry skin on my hands (even though my friends swore by the paraffin treatments at their spa).  I personally had never had a paraffin treatment at the spa/salon, so this was my first time trying it.  For a fraction of the price, I absolutely love the Therabath.  After much thought and consideration, I would not, however, pay the full retail price (for my dry skin problem)  because there are other cheaper alternatives.  In fact, before the price was drastically (erroneously?) lowered, I had decided that I really shouldn&#x27;t spend THAT much money and instead was going to compromise and buy the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s Paraffin Spa (on sale for twenty dollars at Wal-Mart) and then use the Therabath paraffin wax with that unit.  I still think that is a good, lower-priced option and would still have done that if the price not been lowered on the Therabath.  At a fraction of the price, The Dr. Scholl&#x27;s is smaller,  not as deep and is not the same commercial quality (as the Therabath), BUT it does have an ON/OFF switch and manual temperature control.  Again, I have not tried the Dr. Scholl&#x27;s ... only read about it.  I still believe the Therabath is a far better quality paraffin spa, if you have the money to invest in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest looking at the manufacturer&#x27;s website (which is the name of the product dot com) because it has a lot of useful information (including care, cleaning and maintenance of the unit).eaper) than the hand/foot \\&quot;liners\\&quot; and the terry oven mitts are thicker and hold in the heat better (and, again, cheaper) than the hand/foot mitts.

            <li> This bath is very accommodating to larger feet and hands. Heats up very quickly, retains heat  level very well. The wax is really nice, no perfume smells but great oil content. Wonderful for dry skin but also just for the relaxation affect. Would give for a gift without hesitation!</li>
            <li> This product is great, especially in the winter.  We love it!  It has a good depth, good, even heat, reliability.  Better than the inexpensive brands I&#x27;ve previously used.</li>
            <li> We tried a more expensive one before this and found out it didn&#x27;t warm the wax hot or soon enough. Based on others&#x27; reviews we tried this and we are very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> PROFESSIONAL QUALITY....LOVELY.  WORKS GREAT!  GOOD PRICE!</li>
            <li> I am typing this one-handed while my left hand is encased in warm wax, a plastic bag, a wax mitten, and a towel.  This is the only thing that brings any relief to my fingers that have both Heberden&#x27;s an Bouchard&#x27;s nodes on the joints.  Because the wax adheres with my fingers bent in a relatively relaxed curve, it works far better than using a heating pad (or cold pack).  I bought the Therabath because it keeps the wax ready at all times.  It costs way more than the one it replaced, but it&#x27;s worth every penny because it&#x27;s always ready, plus it&#x27;s made in the U.S.</li>
            <li> I have large hands and they fit easily in this paraffin bath, it does an excellent job of maintaining temperature and is easy to clean and refill. Plus it is made in the USA!</li>
            <li> Read other reviews on Amazon and decided to purchase for my dad who has trouble with arthritis.  He has refused to use it and its still in the box.  I have used one at a salon and enjoyed it very much.  I can&#x27;t give any cons as it has not been used.</li>
            <li> Should have been over boxed. I was not able to use it due to damage. Wish they would have just sent replacement, but I order different unit that cost less. I&#x27;m sure that had it not been damaged it would have been a good product.</li>
            <li> It was Xmas gift and it was dropped and or damaged before it was put in the box to ship. Box not damaged just the top lip was bent where you can tell it was dropped.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband, he tears his hands up at work and they hurt all the time.  When he uses this regularly his hands/wrists ache less and they heal faster.</li>
            <li> Love this. Very soothing for over-used hands and Repetitive Stress Injuries.</li>
            <li> i did a lot of research before i bought this one. I read many reviews.  This one is nice, compact, heats up fast enough to melt the wax within 5 to 6 hours.  I did not like the fact that you could not tell the temperature of the melted wax.  It definitely didn&#x27;t get hot enough for us.  It felt like it was room temperature.  You no sooner dipped and before you could get the bag on it it was cold.  We used a heating pad wrapped around the bag to make it hotter but that was a pain and defeated the purpose of buying the wax unit. I think this is over priced and not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I use it to help with arthritis and tendon problems in hands (tenosynovitis/trigger finger/DeQuevains) as well as chemo-induced peripheral neuropathy in toes.  It&#x27;s very comforting and has given me lots of relief and helped me sleep at night.</li>
            <li> I have not had this unit very long. About a month, but is has been the p3rfect thing for my therapy following carpal tunnel and trigger finger release surgery.  I noticed some reviews thought it was too hot. I think it is themperfect temperature,  and it has to be to prevent bacteria from growing. Over all it has been well worth the extra money for my sore aching hands.</li>
            <li> I ordered this bath to assist with recovery from hand surgery.  I use it every morning to help take away the stiffness my wrist/fingers develop from wearing a splint all night.  It has made a positive difference in my recovery, allowing my fingers to move more freely and thus gain back flexibility and strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax is always the same comfortable temperature.  It is a large unit, but not unattractive.  I just leave mine plugged in one of the master bathroom outlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hesitated to buy this unit because of the cost but I&#x27;m now very glad that I made the purchase.  I highly recommend ordering one today if you&#x27;re trying to deal with wrist/hand/finger stiffness and pain.</li>
            <li> I have &amp;#34;trigger&amp;#34; finger - well not finger but fingers. I tried everything to find some relief and was researching this &amp;#34;trigger&amp;#34; finger thing and ran across the wax bath things used for arthritis and a couple of the reviewers said they had gotten relief for their trigger finger(s). I decided to try it. I love this thing but can&#x27;t honestly say I have gotten a lot of relief for my trigger fingers. It sure feels good on the hands and it leaves your hands feeling really, really nice - soft. I suppose just some really good lotion would do that too but oh, the warm feeling on the hands is worth it just for that I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it quite a bit when I first got it (it is still plugged in on my kitchen counter - in the way but I want it available) but not as much now. I am a divorced male and share a 9 year old daughter with my ex-spouse. She uses it also claiming that her hand hurts or is sore or whatever as an excuse for me saying, yes, you can do your hands too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it feels really really hot and other times not so hot but I have come to the conclusion that the temperature is almost always the same and it is the temperature of my skin and how my hand is feeling that makes it feel hot or not so hot. How do I know this? Well, one time I did one of my hands and it felt about what I thought to be normal and then decided to do the same hand again. Now mind you, I had put the lid back on and hadn&#x27;t noticed the light going on either. I took the wax off my hand, placed it on a plastic plate lid and re-dipped it. It felt a lot hotter that time than the first time so I think my hand was more sensitive the second dip. I have done this several times since and it is always the same. The second time it feels much hotter. As a 9 year old, my daughters skin is not as thick and weathered as mine at 60 plus but she has never complained that it was too hot. I was concerned the first time she tried it and had an old towel ready just in case she pulled her hand out really quickly but she didn&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t imagine it ever burning anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally had shots in my right hand (the most painful one) (had all 4 fingers on both hands doing the trigger finger thing) which helped for awhile (4-6 months the first time) and then finally had surgery on my left hand as it started being more painful than my right hand. After 4 months my left hand is doing pretty good; most of the swelling/scaring is gone). I had a second round of shots on my right hand a couple of months after the left hand surgery (surgery done in Sep 2013) (I am right handed and didn&#x27;t want to take a chance of something going wrong and my left hand was hurting more anyway) and it seems to be doing much better than the first round of shots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Therabath unit itself? Very good quality although the aluminum insert that actually holds the wax is a bit delicate and the top part (see photos) can be bent - mine came with a small area of the aluminum top deformed from the box being dropped I think. It had been shipped just in the original box and not double boxed and when the unit is inside the box, there was only about a 1/4 inch from the unit to the inside of the box on all sides. Pretty stupid on the part of the manufacturer. All they would have to do is make the box a tad larger (1/2 inch all the way around) and there probably wouldn&#x27;t have been any problem. Other than that, it is very good quality, heats fairly quickly (overnight or all day to melt 6-7 pounds of wax initially). It stays nice and warm all the time. The heating indicator light goes on and off but doesn&#x27;t seem to be on very much so there must be good insulation between the aluminum &amp;#34;tub&amp;#34; and the plastic outside shell. It is simple. Put in wax and plug in. When all the wax is melted put your hand, elbow or feet into it and enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I dip my hands (one at a time) about 10 times with only a few seconds between dips, put my hand in a 9x15 plastic bag that I have had a large box full forever and place my hand inside a bath towel and do so for about 15 minutes. I find the wax is still a little warm. I then do the other hand if I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it!  It works great! I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  Actually our whole family uses it.  It really helps prevent our hands from drying out and cracking in the cold of winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the therabath for one week, but so far it has lived up to expectations.  I use it twice a day on my hands because of a sore right wrist and thumb joints on both hands.  The bath is the size of a large, oval crockpot &amp; I keep it plugged in all the time on the counter in my second bathroom.  I do both hands  in the morning when I eat breakfast by bathing only one hand at a time.  Then I can eat and read the paper at the same time.  As the reader can guess, I am retired so mornings are no longer a rush.  I use the bath a second time in the evenings as I watch television or read.  The directions say that it takes 8 hours to melt the 6 pounds of paraffin that comes with the unit.  It only took 1 1/2 hours for that amount to melt for me, so I started using it right away.  I saw this product used on hands in a hospital setting, and the heat brought the patient relief.  By watching, I learned that all you need is a plastic bag large enough to slip over your hand and an old towel to wrap around your hand.  You dip your hand slowly into the wax that is between 120 - 125 degrees, (there is no temperature switch-the heat is preprogrammed) then lift your hand up and redip in the same manner 6 or 7 times.  The more times equals the amount of heat that is retained, so you will probably need to experiment.  Then you quickly wrap the plastic bag around your hand, foot or elbow, etc. and finally wrap the plastic bag on your hand, etc., in a large towel.  A large towel keeps the heat in better than a skimpy one.  The treatment is very soothing and is even good for dry or cracked hands.  I plan to use it in the winter also for the latter reason.  After the wax has cooled, you unwrap your hand, etc. and peel the wax back into the unit to be reused.  The plastic bag lasts for quite a few uses--in seven days I have replaced the original once.  I even recycle the wax in the bag that is in small clumps &amp; easy to pick out.  Be sure to register your unit with the company.  A six page information sheet is generated with the registration that has some interesting &amp; helpful information.  My hands &amp; wrists do feel better after each treatment &amp; I am able to do painless finger/wrist exercises after the treatment.  I know that this is the same type of regimen used by physical therapists--heat followed by exercises.page information sheet is generated with the registration that has some interesting &amp; helpful information.

            <li> Wonderful to use for sore joints and soften skin</li>
            <li> My finger was injured in an accident and therabath works great to warm hand prior to exercises/therapy, or when sore. Wax stays warm and ready for use. Is not so hot that safe to use with hardware in hand.</li>
            <li> A lot of money just to keep paraffin wax in a liquid state. That&#x27;s all it does!  But, our physical therapist recommended this brand.  My wife had hand surgery and coats her hand several times each day.  The wax has to be liquid, but not so hot as to burn.  Also the unit is left plugged in and powered up at all times, so you had better trust the product to work properly.  Therabath, so far, does just fine. By the way, my wife is very happy with the paraffin therapy...she says it gives her much relief as her hand continues to heal.</li>
            <li> I needed this product so i went on line, found it and bought it. It arrived in 3 days from order, exactly as ordered. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 2 weeks but it really feels good after use. I bought 5 lbs of extra paraffin from another source as the 5 lbs shipped with the bath is not really enough. i added just 3 more pounds and now it&#x27;s the right depth for my use. I expect to use it for many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about a month.  So far I am very pleased.  It appears to be constructed of good quality materials.  It keeps the wax at a consistent temperature.  I use it every day.  It is still early, but so far it is functioning exactly as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> My Wife&#x27;s Arthritic Hands are HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY after bathing in this unit.  She first experienced relief at the therapists offices. We can better afford the treatments at home. At first glance Therabath Pro Parafin Bath units seem a bit pricey; but, after research I found they have the longest warranty of the industry and provide the deepest and widest basin for dipping hands, elbows and feet in a paraffin therapy bath. Do a bit of shopping and find the least expensive unit...HOWEVER, DO NOT BE MISLED... check out your vendor with the manufacturers website to insure they are authorized to sell this item. IF YOU BUY FROM THE WRONG SOURCE YOU HAVE NO WARRANTY.&lt;br /&gt;I have alerted Amazon to this discrepancy since they were unaware of some vendors listing with them that were not authorized.</li>
            <li> This product is not what I expected. I bought a much less expensive paraffin bath a few years ago which was just as good. There is nothing special about this product and a lower priced paraffin bath provides the same services. Also, its clear that the paraffin wax that came with this product is old.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well after 3 weeks.  My wife uses it for her arthritic hands.  It also helps  mosterize our hands, who knew.</li>
            <li> Love this for hand moisturizing and softening in the winter months.  I leave it plugged in so it is always ready to use.</li>
            <li> Great for dry winter hands and feet!  My husband and I both work with our hands, and are mostly in the shop--I&#x27;m a carpenter and he works with repairing machinery.  Lots of hand washing and being exposed to different elements, where protective gloves aren&#x27;t an option.  This is a lifesaver!  I chose this one after lots of reading and am glad we settled on this one.  It&#x27;s big enough for my husband&#x27;s size 12 feet, and stays at a perfect temperature.  It&#x27;s been plugged in for a year now--we&#x27;ll see how it is in the next few years. For now it&#x27;s earned 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Received the item promptly and in good packaging. Love the bath, but it does take 6 hours for the wax to melt entirely for best use. My husband&#x27;s hands need comfort when the weather moves and here in Colorado, the weather can change every ten minutes. During the winter is the hardest, but we know now within three days of a front coming in and for about two days afterwards we keep it plugged in so he can come home from work (especially on days he&#x27;s using his hands a lot) and dip his hands for almost instant relief. Absolutely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this plugged in continuously since we bought it four months ago and it continues to work just fine.  Bought it because my wife had a painful &amp;#34;hammer finger&amp;#34;, and she uses it daily.  Her physical therapist used paraffin baths to increase flexibility and to provide pain relief.  It melted the wax very quickly and maintains it at the proper temperature perfectly.  Good product.</li>
            <li> This helped out the tendonitis pain tremendously. I couldn&#x27;t be happier and I added a little lavender oil to it, so relaxing.</li>
            <li> Awesome! This product is a must for any massage therapist to soothe and relax tired hands at the end of the day!!  i love that is big enough for the feet as well as the hands and wrists!!</li>
            <li> HEALS YOUR SKIN&lt;br /&gt;If you think you&#x27;ve got bad feet....you should have seen mine. Cracked, calloused and bleeding...I was so used to walking on the pads of my feet from heel pain it was a habit!  After 3 weeks of the Therabath and some minor buffing and moisturizing, my feet are healed! It surprises me that i can FEEL carpet and flex the skin on my feet. IT&#x27;S AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;OPERATES FLAWLESSLY&lt;br /&gt;The Therabath regulates its temperature and is designed to be left plugged in. How easy is that.  It&#x27;s never too hot and always ready for a dip.&lt;br /&gt;SETS UP IN 2 MIN&lt;br /&gt;I pulled it out of the box, read the 1-2-3-4-5 steps and emptied 4 packs of wax into it.  The wax was ready for use within a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve tried everything else like lotions, buffing, shaving and supplements...BUY THE THERABATH. Wish I&#x27;d tried this 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> If you do as instructions state, this product works just at it should.  Perfect temperature.  I keep it plugged in and at the ready.  Had trigger finger and carpal tunnel surgery 7 months ago and paraffin baths were part of the physical therapy afterwards.  While I am not too happy with the results of the surgery, I love how the paraffin bath makes my still very sore hands feel better, even if only temporary.</li>
            <li> I waited 2 months before writing this review. My husband suggested my mom use this as he is a nurse and worked in a Beverly Hills clinic that would use these treatments to relieve the pain for his patients. He helped me pick this out for my mom who suffers from arthritis in the hands and carpal tunnel in her arms. She&#x27;s been using this for two months and says it has helped her significantly with the pain. She uses it 4-6 times a week. My husband also mentioned that it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for dry areas and I tried it on my feet and elbows. Did that two weeks ago and took away all the dryness and they are still soft. My husband mentioned that his patients would be charged $75-$100 per treatment so you could imagine how much you would be saving!  I&#x27;m just happy that it&#x27;s providing my mom relief.</li>
            <li> Have had this for a couple of years now--plugged in the entire time. Steady and reliable as can be. So glad I decided to purchase this brand and model.</li>
            <li> I badly broke my wrist. I bought this as my PT recommended using one and I chose this particular one by reading Amazon reviews. I use it to warm up my wrist and hand muscles before stretching and exercising them. I found this to be a quick way to warm up and it has worked well for me. It is a lot easier than alternatives like heating towels, etc. and my hand/wrist were pretty loose as I began my routine each time, twice a day. I&#x27;ve been using the paraffin wax for 4+ months. My wrist and hand are still on the mend but they have come a long way since those early days. It is pricey to buy the unit &amp; wax, but if you can afford it, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very pleasant just on its own for relieving stiffness, but I always have to follow with the stretching, etc.  The size was perfect for dipping my hand and wrist. Don&#x27;t know about feet, ankle, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself has been sturdy and I&#x27;ve had no problems w/it. The unit is kept on all of the time so that it&#x27;s always ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend placing it on an old towel or something to protect the surface of the place you put it. It gets a little messy adding wax to the unit and I often drip a little on the surface as I dip and remove my hand.  I added this para which may seem common sense, but w/a broken bone, one is not always thinking of details &amp; messes at first.</li>
            <li> Love this-use it daily on my arthritic hands&lt;br /&gt;Not too hot for me-just right temp</li>
            <li> I got the therabath professional for treatment of osteo arthritis of my hands.  It has surely made a difference in my daily living.  I am slowly able to perform tasks with my hands that I previously lost the capacity to do.  Thanks Therabath!</li>
            <li> I had used this product when visiting my massage therapist and was very pleased with the results.  I am completely satisfied with my own professional Therabath paraffin bath and the convenience of using it at home.</li>
            <li> I just had surgery on my hand. This the machine they use in my physical therapy. It really helps to have it at home too.</li>
            <li> this has helped my hands after surgery, the PT suggested I use it before exercising, it helps my flexibility, and leaves my hands very soft.</li>
            <li> I use the paraffin bath for my wrist and elbow due to surgery...my wife uses it on her hands for arthistis.  We both enjoy to wet heat and the relief provided by this bath.</li>
            <li> This is my first paraffin bath.  It takes about 12-24 hours to heat up the wax the first time you stick it in.  (Mine came with 6 lbs of unscented wax beads.)  This feels like a hassle to do every time I want to heat my feet, so I just leave it plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the use of this bath, but I feel that sometimes I will catch it in the middle of a warmup cycle.  The heat of the wax feels too hot during these times.  It is still safe for the feet, but I would prefer to catch it on an idle heat.  I would still recommend for purchase.</li>
            <li> thank you for everything thanks i need and i want, i love it thanks very  much, appretiation i like me</li>
            <li> I had a unit that worked for a few months before it stopped heating.  I called about the warranty and they said no problem except I had to remove all the wax from the unit - it was full of solidified wax!  So I did what they recommended and tried to use my hair dryer to get the wax out - what a mess. I must have spent an hour heating, scooping, heating again and scooping more. I tried to just melt it and drip it into a container but couldn&#x27;t hold both the dryer and the bath.  I also tried just heating the edges hoping the wax would slide out, but that didn&#x27;t work. I ended up making a huge mess and gave up.  I loved the thing so much that I decided to put out the money for a new one.  I was so excited to use when it arrived but - it wouldn&#x27;t heat!  Its going back but now I have the dilemma of not having the bags of wax to return because they were opened and dumped into the unit.  I hope a refund isn&#x27;t continent on returning the wax too.  I think I may give it one last shot because when its working its really nice.  My rating isn&#x27;t based on a working unit, its on my experience with defective ones.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife in February and she has used it regularly since and loves it. Works as it should with no problems. Large enough to fit both hands or feet at the same time.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Ready for use 7/24. I feel it too hot but that&#x27;s normal ad you get used to it. I recommend. Be careful where you place it far form kids.</li>
            <li> Awesome for arthritis pain relief!!</li>
            <li> Sufferers of rheumatoid arthritis really appreciate the temporary relief this warm wax brings. Indispensible. And here are six more words.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for aches and pains in my hands.  Also excellent at softening skin and stress relief.  Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.  I would recommend to anyone with joint pain in the hands.</li>
            <li> My hand therapist recommended I purchase this product for my hair pain and problems!  I got a good price deal on it and love it!  It was like a miracle treatment for me?  My hands are 100% better since I have been using this.  Excellent product and would highly recommend this product over some less expensive.  It was well worth the cost and I plan on using it for years to come.</li>
            <li> If you have ankle or foot problems like I do (broken both over a year ago), this is a good choice for you because you can place your foot in the bath and the wax will rise up above your ankle joint. You have to used 6 pounds of wax to do this though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are somewhat flexible, you can also use it for your knees (I lay my stomach on a padded chair, then lower my knee into the bath. It isn&#x27;t easy to do, and you have to be careful not to overflow the bath).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, you&#x27;ll get a nasty collection of lint, hairs, etc at the bottom of the unit. You need to turn the wax off, let it solidify overnight, then turn it back on for 30 minutes. This will begin to melt the edges. Then you can dump the mostly solid wax plug out, and scrap off the bottom layer off the plug and from the bottom of the bath, and then return the remaining clean wax to the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: When I use this bath, I put it on the floor, but on a cookie sheet. That way, if it overflows, the wax doesn&#x27;t end up on the floor, and it is a major pain to try to clean the spilled wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit may take 9 pounds of wax, but then you couldn&#x27;t put anything else in it (remember Archimedes?).</li>
            <li> This has been great for my tired sore hands after being on a keyboard all day (and mousing for hours and hours).  It also makes your hands feel very soft. Recommend getting the big mitts to put over the plastic to keep it warm longer.</li>
            <li> The clue is that this is a paraffin bath, meaning the body part you want to heat up has to be put into the bath. I tried using it on a client&#x27;s elbow. Most of the client&#x27;s forearm wound up in the bath using an enormous amount of wax. I dipped her arm in three times and wrapped her arm in a towel. She told me she could not feel the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using it on my hand. Same thing. Not enough heat to make any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially bought a brush to \\&quot;paint\\&quot; the body part. Forget it. By the time the wax got near the body part, it was already hardened so that it did not \\&quot;paint\\&quot; on and there was no heat left in the wax. So dipping was the only way to go and as I said that did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend using this product as it did not work for me. Use an epson salt or dead sea salt bath instead.</li>
            <li> I was only doing the hand I had the surgery on but what a difference!  The two hands were like night and day in a matter of days.  I started doing the other hand and what a noticeable difference.  It really helps with arthritis pain and my post surgery pain as well.  When I do have pain all I have to do is go and dip!  It really does not need a low/high switch because the temperature is just right all the time.  My O.T. said it may get a little warmer when the wax goes below the minimum amount but once you add the wax to where it is supposed to be, it will be fine.  I have had no problems and I leave it plugged in all the time because I use it daily.  It is worth the money paid.  Hopefully it will stand the test of time.  I have only had it two weeks.  I ordered it one day and it was delivered the very next day.  Delivery service was exceptional.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was uncertain--how to make the wax ball.  It took two uses to figure it out!  The wax must cool...a little...before it can be molded into a wax ball.  I like the soothing warmth on my hands/feet.  The Euc/Mint fragrance is very calming and satisfying.  I am, rather, content with the product:D</li>
            <li> I bought this for intensive moisturizing of my hands and feet.  Winter always destroys them and my salon up here doesn&#x27;t do paraffin treatments as part of their services, so I bought my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am THRILLED.  It heats up quickly, faster than the directions state.  It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to store and the 6lbs of wax that comes with the bath is plenty for both hands and feet although the tank can hold up to 9lbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works just as perfectly as the one my old salon used.  However, if you&#x27;re going to do both hands and feet at the same time, have a partner to help put on plastic and some kind of towel or mitts/booties (I reviewed both Therabath&#x27;s mitts and booties on Amazon.) to hold the heat in.  Not only does it feel great, but it works better too.  I can do both my feet and one hand, but after that I have to have someone help me with the last hand!</li>
            <li> I have pain in my hands related to cold weather and have been considering purchasing a paraffin bath.  I did a lot of research on the web and glad I purchased this bath.  It was everything stated in its information. It has helped my hands.  Thank you all for your paraffin bath evaluations they helped me in my decision.&lt;br /&gt;MKH</li>
            <li> I have ulna nerve damage.  Sometimes my hand hurts beyond belief.  I use my new Therabath to ease the cramping and drawing of the muscles in my hands.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife for Valentines Day 2014 and it was a big hit. It have been used almost every weekend since then and has worked flawlessly.</li>
            <li> I got this to help with the healing of the surgery I had done on my right thumb, plus it makes your hands feel soft. I will be letting my sister use when she gets her hand surgery in January. It was the best price that I found. I haven&#x27;t tried on my feet however I will when my hand is healed.</li>
            <li> This is the first paraffin bath we have owned so I can&#x27;t compare it to others .  It is exactly as the description states I use it at least two times every day and it has made a great difference in my hand pain and flexibility.  It is top quality and I believe we will have it for many years of use.  I would recommend this product to any one that is in need of a top of the line paraffin bath.  There are cheaper models for sale but you get what you pay for if you want one that will work as described and last for a long time I believe this is the unit to purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for anyone with hand pain, post-surgical hand recovery treatment and other related issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is absolutely wonderful.  Be sure to buy at least 8 blocks of paraffin for it.  You can leave it plugged in all the time in a safe and child-proof location.  I dip my hand in it 6 or 7 times per application to get a good coating of wax and it makes my hand feel so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a wonderful homeopathic treatment for joint and hand pain.</li>
            <li> Just right for hands.  Have to keep it plugged in so the wax is ready for you when you have some time to warm your hand(s) and get the therapeutic  benefits.  Wish I could get my hip joints in there.</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, I selected this model as deep enough and safe enough to use every day or so.  It works well for my hands and feet and I think it is worth the extra cost.  I am using the unscented wax for preference.</li>
            <li> I broke my wrist and, even after much physical therapy, still have problems with my hand \\&quot;locking up\\&quot; in the mornings.  My physical therapist suggested that a paraffin bath may be helpful.  After reading reviews for other paraffin baths I decided to purchase this unit.  It came with paraffin beads, which are easier to break up than the blocks.  This unit melted the paraffin and has not leaked at all.  It is large enough to sink my hand and wrist into it without having to touch the sides or bottom.  I leave the unit plugged in all the time, and the paraffin is always ready and the right temperature.  The warm paraffin is soothing to my injured wrist, and it helps to \\&quot;unlock\\&quot; the muscles in my hand.  As a bonus, I find that using this really makes my skin soft, and relieves dry or chapped skin. I use it for both hands now.</li>
            <li> Another friend swore by this, so we bought it. Hasn&#x27;t done anything really. May work for some. Expensive experiment for us.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Paraffin Bath I have owned and it is far superior to the first 2.  Because I use it only for my hands I keep it filled to the 6 pound level and have much less paraffin splash over the edge than in previous ones I&#x27;ve had and the bath is built much sturdier than the others I have had.  On the down side the rack that resides in the bottom of the tub is not as big as it ought to be, it doesn&#x27;t cover the entire bottom and I wish the lid had a grip that was easier to hang onto.  All in all it is the best one I have owned.  The paraffin is another matter.  It is on the greasy side and even tho I wipe my hands with a towel after finishing I find bits of Paraffin all over my house.  It does keep my hands very soft but I have used other brands of paraffin that I prefer.  I would give the tub a 5 except for the rack in bottom being to small and not caring for the paraffin.  I particularly like that it stays on all the time so I don&#x27;t have to wait for it to heat up and the temperature is just right.  All in all I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love my Therabath.  It keeps the temperature even at all times. To me that was an important feature. It is large enough for me to use on my feet as well as my hands. I did some research before buying and this seemed to be a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea but it has to be kept plugged in all the time if you want to use it daily. We have children around most every day. I could not think of a safe location to place it, to leave it plugged in without the worry of spilled wax. It&#x27;s just not very practical for my situation.</li>
            <li> Therabath Paraffin Bath wonderfully relieves my aching, arthritic hands by trapping warmth and reducing inflammation.  I use it daily, especially after I have been on the computer for a long time or working in the yard.  It was a smart purchase.</li>
            <li> really like this product.  it only comes with 6 blocks of wax you definitely need the full 9.  It is deep enough to submerge your whole foot.  I like it because It really does soften your feet.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Mother, she has Osteoarthritis, diabetes and joint swelling and stiffness! She has poor circulation in her fingers also! Since I have been helping her with her wax dips every morning and evening she has seen a huge difference in her fingers, they have warmth to them now and also much more dexterity! The swelling in her hands and wrists has gone down substantially also! I have done her feet a few times but not on the schedule as her hands, I have a disability in my back (pain on a constant basis) so it&#x27;s hard for me to get down to do her feet! But I am working on a way to do her feet and hands at the same time, when I get that figured out I will comment on how her ankles and feet are doing! As for the hands, 190% difference! Meaning it&#x27;s a miracle tub with Paraffin wax that gives her relief, warmth, reduces swelling and gives her a huge leap forward with dexterity in her fingers! More or less this is a wonder for her, and also myself! She had to stop taking some of the prescription meds due to liver problems, after a lot of research I found this to be a pretty good supplement! I went with the professional Therabath because of all of the terrible reviews on the cheaper tubs out there, and I&#x27;m here to tell you that I&#x27;m so happy I went with the best! So is my Mother! Thank you Therabath for the excellent product and great shipping! This thing was packed very well, they made sure I received this item in perfect new condition! Fast shipping also! Great online purchase through Amazon, would definitely recommend to anyone needing this for therapy!!! My Mother and I are HAPPY and TOTALLY SATISFIED!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in both hands.  This treatment was recommended by my therapist.  And oh by the way, this is the same one that she uses in her clinic.  It is awesome!</li>
            <li> I really like the Therabath Pro Paraffin Bath. It definitely gives relief of swelling and pain in my fingers and knuckles.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for me so far, make sure not to reuse wax!</li>
            <li> It was received much faster than I expected - within 2 days.  It works great!  The instructions say it takes 4-6 hours to melt and it does just that so make sure you plan for that.  The wax comes pre-shreaded which is great and makes it melt much easier.  It has done everything that I expected and a little more.  READ THE INSTRUCTIONS before you start and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The warm wax is so soothing to my arthritic joints.  What a great product!!</li>
            <li> THIS UNIT STOPPED WORKING AFTER 2 1/2 YEARS.  WAY TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THAT SHORT A LIFE!</li>
            <li> after reading reviews of the cheaper paraffin baths, i figured it wasn&#x27;t worth wasting my money on one of those.  the therabath is fantastic!  i was a bit worried when the product guide said that the environmental operating range should be 65-85 degrees F, since i planned to put it in the basement, which on a good day in winter tops out at 54, and was the only convenient place where i had a vacant 3-prong grounded outlet. (the living quarters top out at 62, not much of an improvement  ...) however, it heated up just fine down there, to 133 degrees using cooking thermometer (normal range 126-134 per literature).  took the tip from the other reviewer to use ziplock bags and oven mitts.  perfect!  got the el-cheapo &#x27;13 inch terry cloth oven mitts&#x27;, and they were great.  logistically, i find it easier to do one hand at a time, since you&#x27;re totally helpless with both hands mummified, and could die of boredom. i was also pleased to see something is still made in the u.s.a.  AND a 5 yr warranty is very unusual these days, which made me more confident of the product.  of course the manufacturer says to throw out the used wax.  my hand therapist said to just put it back in.  seriously, if you wash your hands and clean your nails before using it, and you&#x27;re not sharing it with someone with ebola, i can&#x27;t imagine horrible diseases are breeding in paraffin--besides, those bugs were living on me in the first place.  figure i&#x27;ll replace the wax when it starts to look very unsavory.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  october 2013....after 7 months it stopped working....and it was off all summer, so only was running about half the time i had it.  its very inspiring that they have a 5 year warranty BUT you have to pay to ship it to them, and send them a check for return postage (which is stated in the manual but not in the product description), so to get the thermostat replaced cost me $28.45 total. next time it breaks i&#x27;ll just throw it out----it will feel like i&#x27;m paying rent on an expensive product.  if they are so confident in their product that they give a 5 yr warranty, they should NOT make me pay to send it back for repair.if they are so confident in their product that they give a 5 yr warranty, they should NOT make me pay to send it back for repair.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product to reduce the affects of arthritis.  When hands and fingers are really sore from change in weather, etc., the hot wax quickly alleviates most of the associated discomfort.</li>
            <li> Very nice, wonderful and easy.</li>
            <li> The paraffin bath seems to meet it&#x27;s billing. My wife has used it 5  times and she is very happy it. The product has met or slightly exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Product arrived very well packaged and just as expected.  It even arrived quicker than we anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Therabath Professional Paraffin Bath came with 3 packages of wax beads and we immediately set it up and used it later that night.  Feels great, leaves skin soft and smooth.  Would definitely refer a friend to this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit to use once I had completed a series of Physical Therapy sessions for my osteoarthritis. Very pleased with how well it helps with my aching joints! And the paraffin moisturizes my skin!</li>
            <li> I purchased this equipment for hand therapy.  My hand and wrist were severly injured, a lot of scar tissue and limited mobility.  The deep capacity of this bath is wonderful, as I am not able to bend my wrist very well to dip my hand.  The gaurd for the bottom is wonderful as well as I borrowed the first paraffin bath I used, which was shallow and lacked a gaurd and I ended up burning an area on my hand that is numb from nerve damage.  I keep mine on 24/7 as I am still using it two to three times a day, it stays hot and is always ready to go.  It does have some gap between the well and the outer shell, but it doesn&#x27;t move and seems to work fine.</li>
