            <li>bright and cheerful.</li>
            <li>Its really cute, the mirror was a nice addition as well.</li>
            <li>super freakin cute omg great price and</li>
            <li>The size was great and pretty to look at.</li>
            <li>I love the print and colors of this bag...</li>
            <li>I love the colors used and adore the gold lining around the edges as well as gold chain for the zipper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely in love with it, It&#x27;s sooo spacious and cute.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>Super cute!</li>
            <li>, my daily makeup fit in perfectly and the mirror is cute.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for traveling and, with the pink lining, you can easily see the contents.</li>
            <li>Bigger than what I though, which was a good thing!</li>
            <li>It is beautiful but too big</li>
            <li>but the size is fine</li>
            <li>Zippers are super smooth!</li>
            <li>I bet this was a free Estée Lauder giveaway at one time.  </li>
            <li>In fact I use this bag for my costume jewelry and it keeps it shiny and scratch free.  </li>
            <li>the colors are vibrant and exactly as it looks in the picture, the bag is roomy and the mirror is so cute, I&#x27;m getting more of this as gifts !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you can find many other uses for this cute bag.</li>
            <li>great and big much room</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>This is an extra nice cosmetic bag because it has gold piping on three sides of the bag and a gold handle and a gold zipper pull.</li>
            <li>My only suggestion is that it would be nice if the mirror either had a cover on it to keep it from scratching in the bag or a pocket in the bag to put it in.</li>
            <li>I was looking everywhere for the perfect sized travel back for my skincare items (facewash, face lotion, eye cream, etc.) &amp; everything in store was literally  $20 for a damn empty bag.</li>
            <li>soooooo so so so cute love the pink and gold and its big :)</li>
            <li>This really adds a special touch.</li>
            <li>Nice bag with minor.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This is a large cosmetic bag.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very spacious.</li>
            <li>Very roomy and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Colors are much brighter when you get it.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it to keep personal items separate in my school bag during nursing school.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of worried about how long this will last because the material doesn&#x27;t seem very sturdy.</li>
            <li>It fits all of my skincare items nicely &amp; not to mention it&#x27;s super cute &amp; girly.</li>
            <li>I have two Urban Decay, Naked Pallets that fit beautifully in there along with two blushes, foundation, two powders, eye liners, mascaras, lots of glosses and lip sticks, its long enough for brow pencils, and all of the brushes, plus some individual eye pallets as well.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased since I live in the land of  the late Lilli Pulitzer.</li>
            <li>I have already put my travel items into the new bag.</li>
            <li>This bag is not only very well made; but the material on the outside feels like a light tapestry.&lt;br /&gt;The inside has a yellow satin lining which is very soft.</li>
            <li>A fragrance for young or old.</li>
            <li>But I would highly recommend this bag and especially for the price.</li>

            <li> I thought it&#x27;d be a bit smaller but the size is fine, my daily makeup fit in perfectly and the mirror is cute.</li>
            <li> I love the print and colors of this bag...bright and cheerful. The gold tone trim and handle look very nice.  It&#x27;s also very spacious. I don&#x27;t use it as a cosmetic bag. Instead I use it to pack my undergarments, socks etc. (small items that can get lost in a suitcase) when I travel. Have used it on three trips already and it helped keep me organized and my things in one place. I&#x27;m sure you can find many other uses for this cute bag.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous! I originally bought it to keep personal items separate in my school bag during nursing school. Very roomy and sturdy.</li>

            <li> I would give it six stars if I could!!!  This bag is not only very well made; but the material on the outside feels like a light tapestry.&lt;br /&gt;The inside has a yellow satin lining which is very soft. In fact I use this bag for my costume jewelry and it keeps it shiny and scratch free.  I would definitely buy another one. Very reasonable price.</li>
