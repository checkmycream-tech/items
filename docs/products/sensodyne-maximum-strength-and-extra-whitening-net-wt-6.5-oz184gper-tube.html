            <li>I never thought this was the BEST toothpaste for sensitive teeth until my dentist prescribed it to me due to my enamel weakening in spots and causing pain when brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>I suffer with sensitive teeth and this has provided the relief that I have found satisfying.</li>
            <li>Just like the fact I rarely run out.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I see the price was worth it all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;About six months ago, my periodontal disease was getting worse (it runs in my family despite excellent dental care), so I decided to switch out everything that I was using.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t drink tea (I do, with a straw), but the sensitivity and receding gums aren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Plus I am happy, because 4 of these at this price is pretty good, since this stuff can really get expensive at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and I&#x27;m super pleased to find the four pack of the larger sized tubes on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Every tube in this package is was good, the box was damaged a little.</li>
            <li>it really works!</li>
            <li>Love Sensodyne and use it daily</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used sensodyne toothpaste for many years but this one feels different.</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper than that I bought in Walmart!</li>
            <li>I was suddenly able to use a regular toothbrush!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>-white doesn&#x27;t advertise itself as reducing pain, but it does an infinitely better job of it than Sensodyne.  </li>
            <li>finall a multipack with the large tubes of toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>seems like we go through these so fast</li>
            <li>The price is about equal to the stores, but free shipping makes purchasing a breeze.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  </li>
            <li>Fast deliver, product as described.</li>
            <li>I had a sensitivity in my tooth since I am using Sensodyne it really helps and</li>
            <li>The tube is straight out of the 1980&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I just wish that GSK would put the paste in a modern tube</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell if it is whitening my teeth or not</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>it was nice to order a big pack with the big tubes.</li>
            <li>The extra whitening part of this toothpaste is not so horribly strong or fake looking; it maintains a nice light color for my teeth.</li>
            <li>When I switched from my lifelong use of Crest to regular use of Sensodyne I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>The main point is that it really eliminates sensitivity.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more frothy than the previous toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend .</li>
            <li>Amazon u r price is too high...</li>
            <li>My whole life I have struggled with gingivitis and sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>here toothpaste foams more than other general brands, However it makes no promises to the environment or your health such at \\&quot;Toms of Maine\\&quot; does..</li>
            <li>I used to bypass this toothpaste and go directly to CREST or Colgate.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and this tooth paste was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li>I use this toothpaste for my sensitive teeth, even whitens them.</li>
            <li>I nearly gagged  -  after you get used to using a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpaste, Sensodyne tastes like a chemical brew.  </li>
            <li>the only drawback is although that it says EXTRA WHITENING, honestly I don&#x27;t see it having the same whitening effect as Crest 3d white or Crest extra whitening toothpastes.</li>
            <li>This product is very effective at preventing gum sensitivity to cold, heat and flossing.</li>
            <li>My local stores don&#x27;t carry the larger tubes anymore, so it&#x27;s nice to have this on hand when I run out instead of paying the same price for half the amount.</li>
            <li>It was certainly better than regular (e.g. Colgate) toothpaste; by using Sensodyne I could at least brush.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;ultra whitening&amp;#34; formulation has kept my teeth looking decent, despite being a coffee/tea drinking all day long.  </li>
            <li>My teeth were becoming very sensitive to cold and hot beverages and my dentist recommended this product.</li>
            <li>This is completely unacceptable and potentially unsafe.</li>
            <li>At first they were ungiving and felt heavy but a week or so of walking  and a pair of Thorlo socks fixed everything.</li>
            <li>Sensodyne is the only toothpaste used in my household and the cost is becoming totally ridiculous.  </li>

            <li> Sensodyne is the only toothpaste used in my household and the cost is becoming totally ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> The product came in on time, packaged well, but the first tube I have used so far is very thick.  </li>
            <li> My choppers are happier, possibly whiter and less sensitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several brands of toothpastes, ranging from cheap generics to expensive brand-names to specialty toothpastes, and none of them every seemed to help except for Sensodyne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what exactly I expected, but I really don&#x27;t see any difference.  </li>
            <li> As long as I use this toothpaste I no longer experience any sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Also, after several months of happy use of Xyli-white, I thought I ought to use up the remaining tubes of Sensodyne I owned; I hate waste.  </li>
            <li> I have used numerous dentists over the past few years (I&#x27;ve relocated frequently), and each and every single one of them has recommended Sensodyne for strengthening teeth and making them less sensitive.</li>
            <li> I used Sensodyne for many years, because of a painful sensitivity where my teeth and gums meet.  </li>
            <li> But after a couple of weeks of use, I had absolutely no pain whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Now, I won&#x27;t buy any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It whitens as well as any other brand too, and buying it like this makes it as inexpensive as any other brand.</li>
            <li> She suggested I switch back to my usual Pronamel without whitening.</li>
            <li> This actually made my sensitivity worse due to the &#x27;extra whitening&#x27; abrasives.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t noticed any less sensitivity in my teeth and also it causes me to gag sometimes if it goes a little in my throat</li>
            <li> I have trouble squeezing it out and have to use the heel of my hand at the bottom of the tube to push it out for my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive gums, and before my dentist recommended using Sensodyne I had a lot of teeth and gum pain when consuming cold food and drinks.</li>
            <li> not pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I could hardly believe it.  </li>
            <li> even my brother who hardly ever seems to notice changes in texture felt it.</li>
            <li> it tastes terrible compared to normal toothpaste and does nothing for breath</li>
            <li> This is frightening-</li>
            <li> I had cold sensitivity in a couple of teeth and this seems to fix the problem.  </li>
            <li> I had been having increased sensitivity to the point that it was painful to rinse my mouth with cold water after brushing.</li>
            <li> However, I had to use a Sonicare, since any pressure was still painful.  </li>
            <li> It traveled through some very cold weather and that may have effected the thickness ???</li>

            <li> I used to bypass this toothpaste and go directly to CREST or Colgate.

We did find that it reduced staining from coffee especially after a dental cleaning. Great product for a good price. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and am extremely happy. I suffer with sensitive teeth and this has provided the relief that I have found satisfying. I highly recommend .</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> finall a multipack with the large tubes of toothpaste.  seems like we go through these so fast it was nice to order a big pack with the big tubes.</li>
            <li> I have used Synsodyne toothpaste since recommended by my dentist 30 years ago.  It is effective in reducing teeth sensitivty to cold and heat.  It does as advertised.  What more could a buyer  ask.</li>
            <li> This is my third time purchasing this product. Just like the fact I rarely run out. Fantastic product recommend by my DDS.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and this tooth paste was recommended by my dentist. It has helped my teeth a lot.</li>
            <li> I know/knew this toothpaste was awesome. I like to purchase it in bulk. The price is about equal to the stores, but free shipping makes purchasing a breeze. Well worth the money. The extra whitening part of this toothpaste is not so horribly strong or fake looking; it maintains a nice light color for my teeth. My sensitivity level has been well controlled for years with Sensodyne.</li>
            <li> I use this toothpaste for my sensitive teeth, even whitens them. Very Happy with this product</li>
            <li> GOOD WORK, MY DAUGHTER LOVES YHE ORDER OF THE SENSODYNE MAXIMUM STRENGTH E EXTRA WHITENING AND IT WAS SO QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> I have noticed an improvement in my teeth since using this.  I am no longer bothered by sensitivity.  I hadn&#x27;t realized how many healthy foods I had been avoiding until I was able to eat them again.</li>
            <li> Well the dr says to use this and I can&#x27;t argue on studies and medicine but I haven&#x27;t noticed any less sensitivity in my teeth and also it causes me to gag sometimes if it goes a little in my throat</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I use Sensodyne because of receding gums and tenderness because of exposed roots. It has helped with sensitivity.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!! HERE IS A BIG TIP: COSTCO IS WAY CHEAPER ONLY $20 FOR THE SAME PACK!!!!</li>
            <li> because of th promotion i choose to buy it. and i found it is just ok, not what i supposed</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Good value.</li>
            <li> Great place to buy this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hit the age where this product has become necessary for gum discomfort.  It works!  Now, it&#x27;s my regular toothpaste.  As for the &#x27;whitening&#x27; part....It really doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  I&#x27;m not sure what exactly I expected, but I really don&#x27;t see any difference.  I&#x27;ll continue using it for the purpose that it&lt;br /&gt;is intended....to stop gum pain: For that it works!</li>
            <li> Fast deliver, product as described.</li>
            <li> Just as doctors recommended i purchased&lt;br /&gt;to be honest, i do not see or feel any differences.  Its good but i wouldn&#x27;t buy ti again</li>
            <li> This product is very effective at preventing gum sensitivity to cold, heat and flossing.</li>
            <li> Love Sensodyne and use it daily</li>
            <li> Recommended by my Dentist...  I had a sensitivity in my tooth since I am using Sensodyne it really helps and 80-85% sensitivity is gone. Very nice produced ...</li>
            <li> I could hardly believe it.  I got all the way to the oral surgeon&#x27;s chair, only to find out that, no, I didn&#x27;t need a root canal.  I just needed Sensodyne!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used sensodyne toothpaste for many years but this one feels different. even my brother who hardly ever seems to notice changes in texture felt it. it&#x27;s more frothy than the previous toothpaste. makes me feel like i have a laundromat in my mouth. after using it for about a week, we returned it back to amazon.</li>
            <li> my teeth look and feel better</li>
            <li> The toothpaste works great.  The tube is straight out of the 1980&#x27;s.  I love this toothpaste.  I had cold sensitivity in a couple of teeth and this seems to fix the problem.  I just wish that GSK would put the paste in a modern tube so I can use it more easily and get more out of the container.</li>
            <li> I had been having increased sensitivity to the point that it was painful to rinse my mouth with cold water after brushing. When I switched from my lifelong use of Crest to regular use of Sensodyne I was very pleased. As long as I use this toothpaste I no longer experience any sensitivity. It&#x27;s amazing and it truly works. I didn&#x27;t care anout the whitening effect, I just wanted the brand and this happened to be available at a good price. I really can&#x27;t tell if it is whitening my teeth or not but I use a prescribed tooth whitening system anyway. The main point is that it really eliminates sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Did not achieve whitening.....not pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> U can buy this 4 pack at costco for 20.00.  Amazon u r price is too high...</li>
            <li> My whole life I have struggled with gingivitis and sensitive teeth. I&#x27;ve used several brands of toothpastes, ranging from cheap generics to expensive brand-names to specialty toothpastes, and none of them every seemed to help except for Sensodyne. I have used numerous dentists over the past few years (I&#x27;ve relocated frequently), and each and every single one of them has recommended Sensodyne for strengthening teeth and making them less sensitive. Ironically, I bought this product by mistake thinking it was the Sensodyne Pronamel toothpaste, which is specifically geared towards rebuilding enamel and which I&#x27;ve used before, but this Sensodyne toothpaste also has helped with my teeth sensitivity and gingivitis along with helping whiten them.</li>
            <li> This is frightening- the products arrived without a box and without proper sealing.  This is completely unacceptable and potentially unsafe.</li>
            <li> Every tube in this package is was good, the box was damaged a little. None of them were damaged. Therefore I save lots of money. Thanks.</li>
            <li> great have been using it for years!</li>
            <li> Great product. Use exclusively.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is excellent for my sensitive teeth and has good cleaning power.</li>
            <li> This is a super product at a super price.  Whitens teeth and makes them strong.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT. after seeing this product in the grocery stores I see the price was worth it all.</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper than that I bought in Walmart! I would like to buy it in future, as well as to recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Used this for years, and I won&#x27;t use anything else or I start having problems with sensitivity again. It whitens as well as any other brand too, and buying it like this makes it as inexpensive as any other brand.</li>
            <li> Keeps my tooth clean and pain free.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Sensodyne does a wonderful job of keeping my teeth from becoming ultra sensitive- I&#x27;m able to eat and drink cold/hot beverages again.  The &amp;#34;ultra whitening&amp;#34; formulation has kept my teeth looking decent, despite being a coffee/tea drinking all day long.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and I&#x27;m super pleased to find the four pack of the larger sized tubes on Amazon.  My local stores don&#x27;t carry the larger tubes anymore, so it&#x27;s nice to have this on hand when I run out instead of paying the same price for half the amount.</li>
            <li> I used Sensodyne for many years, because of a painful sensitivity where my teeth and gums meet.  It was certainly better than regular (e.g. Colgate) toothpaste; by using Sensodyne I could at least brush.  However, I had to use a Sonicare, since any pressure was still painful.  I assumed Sensodyne must be best at reducing pain, since that&#x27;s what it &amp;#34;does&amp;#34;, and it has been around for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About six months ago, my periodontal disease was getting worse (it runs in my family despite excellent dental care), so I decided to switch out everything that I was using.  With great trepidation I bought NOW Xyli-white toothpaste.  It was the strangest thing:  after ONE use, my pain went away!!!  Totally!!!  I was suddenly able to use a regular toothbrush!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xyli-white doesn&#x27;t advertise itself as reducing pain, but it does an infinitely better job of it than Sensodyne.  Also, after several months of happy use of Xyli-white, I thought I ought to use up the remaining tubes of Sensodyne I owned; I hate waste.  I nearly gagged  -  after you get used to using a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpaste, Sensodyne tastes like a chemical brew.  I tossed several unopened tubes.</li>
            <li> Size is right on and the look is nice in a country sort of way. At first they were ungiving and felt heavy but a week or so of walking  and a pair of Thorlo socks fixed everything.</li>
            <li> Sensodyne is the only toothpaste used in my household and the cost is becoming totally ridiculous.  I&#x27;m always looking to reduce my expenses so this was a good deal to me.</li>
            <li> This actually made my sensitivity worse due to the &#x27;extra whitening&#x27; abrasives. Granted, it did make my hygienist think that  I didn&#x27;t drink tea (I do, with a straw), but the sensitivity and receding gums aren&#x27;t worth it. She suggested I switch back to my usual Pronamel without whitening.</li>
            <li> it tastes terrible compared to normal toothpaste and does nothing for breath</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just another toothpaste. If you are hooked on sensodyne then this is a good value..&lt;br /&gt;This here toothpaste foams more than other general brands, However it makes no promises to the environment or your health such at \\&quot;Toms of Maine\\&quot; does..&lt;br /&gt;Hugs</li>
