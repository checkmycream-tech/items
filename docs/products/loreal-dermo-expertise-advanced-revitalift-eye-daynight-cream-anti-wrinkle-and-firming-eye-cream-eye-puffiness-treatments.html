            <li>Great stuff, I&#x27;ve used it for years.  </li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>it smells good and feels great around my eyes</li>
            <li>This regimen has been really successful.  </li>
            <li>The price is good, so 3 stars.</li>
            <li>I noticed the price fluctuates between $9-11 on here, but either way, it&#x27;s a good price.</li>
            <li>Product feels good going on and no irritation.  </li>
            <li>It is good for my eyes.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Always loved the product.</li>
            <li>Good value on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It truly feels good after being on for 4/6 hours.  </li>
            <li>But otherwise, good.</li>
            <li>There is not a lot of cream quantity wise.</li>
            <li>And I do believe that L&#x27;Oreal has done its fair share.  </li>
            <li>more like a review, this is one of my moms fave anti wrinkle creams!</li>
            <li>However, didn&#x27;t feel it is effective in firming my eye area.</li>
            <li>Now I have a nice lift.</li>
            <li>Nice cream.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re nice</li>
            <li>It also works perfectly with my extremely sensitive skin, not a bit of sting or allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t looking for that kind of result, but this product works even better than I had hoped it would.</li>
            <li>and I have found this cream to be one of the most affordable and, after using it, most effective.</li>
            <li>so come back to this wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>If you apply this cream in the morning and wear makeup over the top of it, by evening your mascara and/or eyeliner will have smudged.  </li>
            <li>but, I now use this under my eye and use the Oil of Olay above my eye and it works perfectly</li>
            <li>All of my wrinkles and bags are just as prominent as they were to begin with.  </li>
            <li>it leaves my skin :)</li>
            <li>We are satisfied with the product :)</li>
            <li>Better price than I find in the stores.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years, haven&#x27;t found anything I like better.  </li>
            <li>but it is better than using nothing.  </li>
            <li>Would be better as a squeeze tube.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll continue for many more to come.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Get more sleep or go to the doc for plastic surgery instead.</li>
            <li>The in store price is about $20, so I&#x27;m glad I found it on here for cheaper.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I should mention that I have been using this cream in conjunction with making sure I consume my water diligently, avoiding rubbing my eyes</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>for a high-priced, over the top name BRAND, and all your complaints for this L&#x27;Oeal product are most definitely inter-twined with the ideal, over-priced, high-end Department Store product.  </li>
            <li>Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Advanced Skin Repair Daily Serum.</li>
            <li>Lets get to the point this anti-wrinkle eye cream is CHEAP and that is why most of you gals purchased it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dozens of other eye creams but this one works best for me.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put just a drop under each eye and over the crows feet areas.</li>
            <li>Seems like it should work esp with the strong reviews.</li>
            <li>It has gotten better and better: at first, week by week; now, month by month.</li>
            <li>My fine lines are still there.</li>
            <li>no perfumed aroma and CHEAP</li>
            <li>Its a light cream</li>
            <li>This is good quality cream for my sensitive, aging skin.</li>
            <li>I found that using at night is ideal and if I need to use in the morning (eye area is more dry than normal)</li>
            <li>I purchased this after seeing many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for a week so far, and the top of my eye lids have lighten up allot!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product, with also taking care of oneself, getting sound sleep and hydrating well.  :)</li>
            <li>So overall pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>This product really works, my eyelids were touching my lashes.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have been using it for 15 years, it works very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to inexpensive to be good, but I always go back!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years because it is excellent for firming saggy, delicate skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li>The company was very prompt in sending out this product, and it arrived in new and good condition...</li>
            <li>It feels kind of tight after you apply, but the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>I rubbed my eyes so much when I was little, I looked like a raccoon Lol!</li>
            <li>Will know more in time, but seems worth taking a chance, given the reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Advanced Skin Repair Daily Serum on and my dry skin drinks and it drinks it in like a sponge.</li>
            <li>just how quickly I saw a difference.  </li>
            <li>And if you get too large a jar I think there&#x27;s a risk of it becoming contaminated and who needs that.</li>
            <li>My eye area is very sensitive and most product causes my skin to itch severely.</li>
            <li>This is the first eye cream that I&#x27;ve tried and will keep using to give it some time to work and hope these wrinkles and bags will go away!</li>
            <li>However, after applying a good amount around my eyes, I still feel very dry in my eye area.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and subtle, the texture is smooth and light.  </li>
            <li>Worth giving it a shot.</li>
            <li>Has pro-retinol which I discovered through research is a useful ingredient to have to address the issue.</li>
            <li>After I clean my face with L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect for Mature Skin Rich Restorative Cream Cleanser, with gentle exfoliating micro beads (it leaves your skin dewy soft and moist), I pat it dry and put on the L&#x27;Oreal Paris</li>
            <li>I had some difficulty finding the right amount and when to use.</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried far more expensive products and not been as impressed.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really give a full review yet</li>
            <li>I have really fair skin and as a result have troubles with dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>you L&#x27;Oreal, thank you for your wonderful products, and thank you Amazon for carrying them.e amazed like I was, and it didn&#x27;t take a month for me, it happened in less than two weeks, maybe because my skin was so dry...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t  know what the secret formula, but I take very good care of my skin</li>
            <li>The cream feels wet and nice.</li>
            <li>sold have a 6 month shelf life and even in stores have no way of telling on most brands the actual expiration date.  </li>
            <li>I started using this and not only did the puffiness go away, so did most of the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>The product was just as we expected and we liked to use it.</li>
            <li>Department store wrinkle &amp; firming creams are way-way over-priced and you all are aware of that fact.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Complete Anti-Wrinkle &amp; Firming Moisture Eye Cream is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I really hope they never stop making it!</li>
            <li>It is light, doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes, even with daily contacts, and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>While my lines are not completely gone, they look a million times better.  </li>
            <li>When first using I found that putting too much on results in my makeup &amp;#34;melting&amp;#34; or creasing.</li>
            <li>My skin is very clear, and I rarely get blackouts.</li>
            <li>I actually really like this eye cream.</li>
            <li>Cheap enough to give it a shot anyway.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price for this type of product.</li>
            <li>I REALLY</li>
            <li>Like  soft and fresh  </li>
            <li>I really wish I had taken pictures to show you the difference</li>
            <li>That was when my skin got so very dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but this L&#x27;Oreal Anti-wrinkle, firming moisturizer eye cream is actually non-greasy, soothing, comfortable,</li>
            <li>It  really works for me</li>
            <li>I have wait a while for it to really soak into the skin before applying makeup.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>may I need to finish the whole bottle</li>
            <li>Not sure it really helps with &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; but nice moisturizer for eye area.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over a for a month, and I really believe in this product, Not only did it work for me, but it worked quickly</li>
            <li>As soon as I applied it the first time the skin around eyes was soft.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of use my dark circles got so much better.</li>
            <li>There are probably some better - there are certainly more expensive ones - but on my budget, I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This stuff really makes your skin smooth and evens out the rough patches.  </li>
            <li>The main product has been this eye cream.  </li>
            <li>Within a week or two, I was surprised how much they had gone away.</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin is different but this cream is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will update after using it for a few more weeks.  </li>
            <li>I have only used one jar to date and have seen no visual results as of yet, but will try again to monitor due to good price.</li>
            <li>I definitely see a reduction in fine lines around my eyes with once daily use.</li>
            <li>I searched Amazon for new L&#x27;Oreal products, read reviews and found this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed a huge improvement in wrinkles, under eye bags, or just overall eye area.</li>
            <li>I am a very young looking 66...</li>
            <li>It goes well with my very sensitive skin &amp; keep the area hydrating.</li>
            <li>I am near 40 and have normal type skin.</li>
            <li>I feel like I see pretty big reductions in puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li>This cream seems to be better than L&#x27;oreal Eye Defense, which I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>This product is the first eye cream that actually softened and minimized the lines and sun damage around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>My eyes are smooth with less wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and people always are surprised when they find out my age.  </li>
            <li>and I was and feeling old.</li>
            <li>and I have my young eyes</li>
            <li>but I doubt it compares to the L&#x27;Oreal Triple Action Eye Serum</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am 22 years old and was just looking for something to use for preventative measures.</li>
            <li>was surprised at</li>
            <li>It has been about 8 days so far.</li>
            <li>I have used the complete jar.</li>
            <li>I am 38 years old.  </li>
            <li>I do not smoke or drink, and have been using this product or the Walmart equate version since I was 21 years old.  </li>
            <li>Guess the wrinkles are just too far gone.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t put toooo much credibility in creams, especially ones that claim they &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34;...  </li>
            <li>And it does leave your skin soft.</li>
            <li>I generally have oily to combination skin.  </li>
            <li>I tried it 5 times over a 4 day period, thinking maybe my eyes had to get worse before they got better, but could not stand it any longer.</li>
            <li>I had run out of my last product from them, not this, the one for Mature skin, and was looking for something different to use.</li>
            <li>(I believe it has caffeine which apparently serves such a purpose).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have actually noticed a slight difference in the crepe - iness in my eyelids and in general, the product feels very soothing.  </li>
            <li>I like the way the little long tip dispenses just the right tiny amount to pat on your eyelids.</li>
            <li>I like how much it moisturizes under my eyes, but in humid weather, it can stay a little sticky/tacky.</li>

            <li> Its a light cream</li>
            <li> This is good quality cream for my sensitive, aging skin.</li>
            <li> I found that using at night is ideal and if I need to use in the morning (eye area is more dry than normal)</li>
            <li> I purchased this after seeing many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a week so far, and the top of my eye lids have lighten up allot!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product, with also taking care of oneself, getting sound sleep and hydrating well.  :)</li>
            <li> So overall pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> This product really works, my eyelids were touching my lashes.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been using it for 15 years, it works very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to inexpensive to be good, but I always go back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years because it is excellent for firming saggy, delicate skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li> The company was very prompt in sending out this product, and it arrived in new and good condition...</li>
            <li> It feels kind of tight after you apply, but the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> I rubbed my eyes so much when I was little, I looked like a raccoon Lol!</li>
            <li> Will know more in time, but seems worth taking a chance, given the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Advanced Skin Repair Daily Serum on and my dry skin drinks and it drinks it in like a sponge.</li>
            <li> just how quickly I saw a difference.  </li>
            <li> And if you get too large a jar I think there&#x27;s a risk of it becoming contaminated and who needs that.</li>
            <li> My eye area is very sensitive and most product causes my skin to itch severely.</li>
            <li> This is the first eye cream that I&#x27;ve tried and will keep using to give it some time to work and hope these wrinkles and bags will go away!</li>
            <li> However, after applying a good amount around my eyes, I still feel very dry in my eye area.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and subtle, the texture is smooth and light.  </li>
            <li> Worth giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> Has pro-retinol which I discovered through research is a useful ingredient to have to address the issue.</li>
            <li> After I clean my face with L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect for Mature Skin Rich Restorative Cream Cleanser, with gentle exfoliating micro beads (it leaves your skin dewy soft and moist), I pat it dry and put on the L&#x27;Oreal Paris</li>
            <li> I had some difficulty finding the right amount and when to use.</li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried far more expensive products and not been as impressed.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really give a full review yet</li>
            <li> I have really fair skin and as a result have troubles with dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> you L&#x27;Oreal, thank you for your wonderful products, and thank you Amazon for carrying them.e amazed like I was, and it didn&#x27;t take a month for me, it happened in less than two weeks, maybe because my skin was so dry...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  know what the secret formula, but I take very good care of my skin</li>
            <li> The cream feels wet and nice.</li>
            <li> sold have a 6 month shelf life and even in stores have no way of telling on most brands the actual expiration date.  </li>
            <li> I started using this and not only did the puffiness go away, so did most of the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> The product was just as we expected and we liked to use it.</li>
            <li> Department store wrinkle &amp; firming creams are way-way over-priced and you all are aware of that fact.  </li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Complete Anti-Wrinkle &amp; Firming Moisture Eye Cream is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I really hope they never stop making it!</li>
            <li> It is light, doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes, even with daily contacts, and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> While my lines are not completely gone, they look a million times better.  </li>
            <li> When first using I found that putting too much on results in my makeup &amp;#34;melting&amp;#34; or creasing.</li>
            <li> My skin is very clear, and I rarely get blackouts.</li>
            <li> I actually really like this eye cream.</li>
            <li> Cheap enough to give it a shot anyway.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price for this type of product.</li>
            <li> I REALLY</li>
            <li> Like  soft and fresh  </li>
            <li> I really wish I had taken pictures to show you the difference</li>
            <li> That was when my skin got so very dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but this L&#x27;Oreal Anti-wrinkle, firming moisturizer eye cream is actually non-greasy, soothing, comfortable,</li>
            <li> It  really works for me</li>
            <li> I have wait a while for it to really soak into the skin before applying makeup.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> may I need to finish the whole bottle</li>
            <li> Not sure it really helps with &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; but nice moisturizer for eye area.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a for a month, and I really believe in this product, Not only did it work for me, but it worked quickly</li>
            <li> As soon as I applied it the first time the skin around eyes was soft.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of use my dark circles got so much better.</li>
            <li> There are probably some better - there are certainly more expensive ones - but on my budget, I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This stuff really makes your skin smooth and evens out the rough patches.  </li>
            <li> The main product has been this eye cream.  </li>
            <li> Within a week or two, I was surprised how much they had gone away.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is different but this cream is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will update after using it for a few more weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have only used one jar to date and have seen no visual results as of yet, but will try again to monitor due to good price.</li>
            <li> I definitely see a reduction in fine lines around my eyes with once daily use.</li>
            <li> I searched Amazon for new L&#x27;Oreal products, read reviews and found this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed a huge improvement in wrinkles, under eye bags, or just overall eye area.</li>
            <li> I am a very young looking 66...</li>
            <li> It goes well with my very sensitive skin &amp; keep the area hydrating.</li>
            <li> I am near 40 and have normal type skin.</li>
            <li> I feel like I see pretty big reductions in puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This cream seems to be better than L&#x27;oreal Eye Defense, which I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> This product is the first eye cream that actually softened and minimized the lines and sun damage around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> My eyes are smooth with less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and people always are surprised when they find out my age.  </li>
            <li> and I was and feeling old.</li>
            <li> and I have my young eyes</li>
            <li> but I doubt it compares to the L&#x27;Oreal Triple Action Eye Serum</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am 22 years old and was just looking for something to use for preventative measures.</li>
            <li> was surprised at</li>
            <li> It has been about 8 days so far.</li>
            <li> I have used the complete jar.</li>
            <li> I am 38 years old.  </li>
            <li> I do not smoke or drink, and have been using this product or the Walmart equate version since I was 21 years old.  </li>
            <li> Guess the wrinkles are just too far gone.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t put toooo much credibility in creams, especially ones that claim they &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34;...  </li>
            <li> And it does leave your skin soft.</li>
            <li> I generally have oily to combination skin.  </li>
            <li> I tried it 5 times over a 4 day period, thinking maybe my eyes had to get worse before they got better, but could not stand it any longer.</li>
            <li> I had run out of my last product from them, not this, the one for Mature skin, and was looking for something different to use.</li>
            <li> (I believe it has caffeine which apparently serves such a purpose).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have actually noticed a slight difference in the crepe - iness in my eyelids and in general, the product feels very soothing.  </li>
            <li> I like the way the little long tip dispenses just the right tiny amount to pat on your eyelids.</li>
            <li> I like how much it moisturizes under my eyes, but in humid weather, it can stay a little sticky/tacky.</li>
            <li> people think I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s, early 50&#x27;s (really!), but my skin was getting so dry and flaky, was losing its firmness</li>
            <li> In two days the new skin had less wrinkles making me appear younger.</li>
            <li> Maybe i&#x27;m not consistent applying 2 times a day, but so far for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dislike this cream, but I&#x27;m not sure yet that it&#x27;s doing too much.</li>
            <li> Jar is small, but you don&#x27;t use much of the cream.</li>
            <li> and then I try something else that sounds new and interesting, but I&#x27;m always disappointed,</li>
            <li> Caused my mother-in-laws and my eyes to burn and become irritated all day long.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the same is true in this case.</li>
            <li> , it is that unbelievable, all I can say is Wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other eye creams but always go back to this one.</li>
            <li> i also use other loreal products i use all of them daily and a little goes a long way,it last me a couple of month&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> There have been many times that I have been suckered into buying a very expensive eye cream through my dermatologist or facialist.</li>
            <li> It not only keeps away wrinkles and lines, it keeps down puffiness and bags.  </li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes had start getting rough and dry (in addition to creases).</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve only been using this cream for a week or less.  </li>
            <li> My eyes were a little puffy from allergies, even though I take allergy medicine daily.  </li>
            <li> The cream is not very creamy, or sticky.  </li>
            <li> For me personally, I did not see any change for the few lines I have around my eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ladies this line works, give it a try, you just might be amazed like I was, and it didn&#x27;t take a month for me, it happened in less than two weeks, maybe because my skin was so dry...</li>
            <li> I have to apply other serum to keep my skin around eyes moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have small eyes and had lost my eyelids, but now I have them back again!</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t see the results other reviewers saw---in fact I saw no change at all.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this product due to a promotion message from my friend, which turned out to be spam.</li>
            <li> The cream, which could just extremely moisturizing, is a bit on the greasy side.</li>
            <li> like I normally do due to allergies, and I have been using sun protection on my eyes, etc...</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using any other eye cream but this!</li>
            <li> I do like the consistency and the slight tingle I get when I apply, but time will tell on the results I suppose.</li>
            <li> After about a week the skin around my eyes began to peel slightly after each application.</li>
            <li> Some noticeable results in terms of slightly smoother skin and wrinkles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid $85.00 for less than one oz.</li>
            <li> This cream stings a little when you put it on, and I can&#x27;t tell if its working.</li>
            <li> I think I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Now  I Use it Everyday, and  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind, this takes a few weeks before you start seeing results so be patient.  </li>
            <li> This product took about a week before I began to notice a difference in the dried skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Then to hold in the moisture all day and keep my skin firm,  I use L&#x27;Oreal Paris RevitaLift</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since I received it a few weeks ago and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference as of yet.</li>
            <li> Heavy until it soaks in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure if it is discontinued, I couldn&#x27;t it at Target</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad the dark circles isn&#x27;t that bad anymore, but when I take pics, it shows really bad.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of comments on my skin lately</li>
            <li> The container is very small.</li>
            <li> They were droopy, and now they are not, honest!</li>
            <li> No remarkable results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been writing this a lot, but this winter (2013-14) has been tough on my skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet how it will work on under eye darkness, as my allergies have been really bad; hence, my eyes are murkier then usual underneath.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 70s and was tired of looking at puffy eyes when I shave.</li>
            <li> Used it for a few weeks and started to notice the bags under my eyes aren&#x27;t as bad as they used to be.</li>
            <li> but hey, that&#x27;s a crazy amount of money to spend on a face cream.</li>
            <li> It was unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this after seeing many positive reviews. The cream feels wet and nice. However, after applying a good amount around my eyes, I still feel very dry in my eye area. I have been using it for around a week twice a day. However, didn&#x27;t feel it is effective in firming my eye area. I still have eye bags. I have to apply other serum to keep my skin around eyes moisturized. I am near 40 and have normal type skin. The price is good, so 3 stars.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to eye cream. Not greasy but makes my makeup glide on my middle-aged skin. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dislike this cream, but I&#x27;m not sure yet that it&#x27;s doing too much. I do like the consistency and the slight tingle I get when I apply, but time will tell on the results I suppose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and people always are surprised when they find out my age.  I don&#x27;t have any crows-feet at all, and I&#x27;m getting close to retirement age.  Every now and then I try something else that sounds new and interesting, but I&#x27;m always disappointed, so come back to this wonderful product.  It not only keeps away wrinkles and lines, it keeps down puffiness and bags.  I hope they never stop making this!</li>
            <li> I actually really like this eye cream. No greasiness, stickiness or irritation for me. I feel like I see pretty big reductions in puffiness under my eyes. I believe under eye darkness has faded a bit as well, after two weeks of twice-a-day usage. I prefer a tub of cream, as opposed to a tube, so the \\&quot;cleanliness\\&quot; issue is not an issue for me. I noticed the price fluctuates between $9-11 on here, but either way, it&#x27;s a good price. It may not work for everyone, but it&#x27;s awesome for me! Cheap enough to give it a shot anyway.</li>
            <li> Product feels good going on and no irritation.  I am skeptical because I know most all eye creams  sold have a 6 month shelf life and even in stores have no way of telling on most brands the actual expiration date.  Unfortunately, the same is true in this case. I have only used one jar to date and have seen no visual results as of yet, but will try again to monitor due to good price.</li>
            <li> It is good for my eyes. But I just use it in the daytime, in the night I use Estee Lauder ANR eye creme.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes had start getting rough and dry (in addition to creases). It was unpleasant. This product worked perfectly. As soon as I applied it the first time the skin around eyes was soft. It has gotten better and better: at first, week by week; now, month by month. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot, will keep using it.  I see a difference. May go ahead and buy the facial cream as well.</li>
            <li> This cream seems to be better than L&#x27;oreal Eye Defense, which I have used in the past. The cream is not very creamy, or sticky.  Not a lot of drying time needed before applying makeup.  Works well on puffiness and lines around eyes.  Not sure yet how it will work on under eye darkness, as my allergies have been really bad; hence, my eyes are murkier then usual underneath.  Also, I&#x27;ve only been using this cream for a week or less.  I&#x27;ll post with an update.  Update:  One problem I&#x27;ve noticed.  If you apply this cream in the morning and wear makeup over the top of it, by evening your mascara and/or eyeliner will have smudged.  I did not have this problem with L&#x27;oreal Eye Defense.  So, what I&#x27;ve been doing is using Revitalift at night, and Eye Defense during the day.  My under eye circles seem to be improving the longer I use this cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for three weeks no results at all. The container is very small. I think I wasted my money. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff really makes your skin smooth and evens out the rough patches.  Reasonable price for this type of product.</li>
            <li> My eyes were a little puffy from allergies, even though I take allergy medicine daily.  I started using this and not only did the puffiness go away, so did most of the wrinkles.  I&#x27;m 31 and I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of comments on my skin lately (the only change is that I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream).  It is light, doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes, even with daily contacts, and it absorbs quickly.  I only use it once a day though, and I think it recommends using it like three for four times a day.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. After 3 weeks of use my dark circles got so much better. I use it every night.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product. Immediately after applying it my eyes began to itch and burn. I tried it 5 times over a 4 day period, thinking maybe my eyes had to get worse before they got better, but could not stand it any longer. I may contact the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oil of Olay for my eye area and hadn&#x27;t noticed any difference. My eye area is very sensitive and most product causes my skin to itch severely. I started using this product above my eye and under eye and my skin itched so I had to quit using it but, I now use this under my eye and use the Oil of Olay above my eye and it works perfectly and I have noticed the deep lines under my eye lessening. I have also noticed my skin looking smoother and the discoloration is clearing up. I am loving Loreal !!</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and subtle, the texture is smooth and light.  It just hasn&#x27;t improved anything!  All of my wrinkles and bags are just as prominent as they were to begin with.  Kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> Never used eye cream before,  Now  I Use it Everyday, and  I REALLY Like  soft and fresh  it leaves my skin :)</li>
            <li> What a great eye cream. Skin feels moisterized and youthful. Does not burn or sting either.</li>
            <li> This product really works, my eyelids were touching my lashes. Now I have a nice lift. Nothing else worked. The price is cheep  compaired to what it does. I am truely happy. Try it.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff!  Eye cream that ACTUALLY works????  Why yes, it does! This product is the first eye cream that actually softened and minimized the lines and sun damage around my eyes.  It also works perfectly with my extremely sensitive skin, not a bit of sting or allergic reaction.  Keep in mind, this takes a few weeks before you start seeing results so be patient.  While my lines are not completely gone, they look a million times better.  I won&#x27;t be using any other eye cream but this!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been using it for 15 years, it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if it is discontinued, I couldn&#x27;t it at Target</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. I have used eye creams for years and look 10 years younger! L&#x27;Oreal puts a lot of research into their products.</li>
            <li> This product took about a week before I began to notice a difference in the dried skin around my eyes. I&#x27;ve been applying it morning and night because I use make-up remover to take off my make-up before i go to bed. After about a week the skin around my eyes began to peel slightly after each application. In two days the new skin had less wrinkles making me appear younger.</li>
            <li> Works well to keep the eye area moist.</li>
            <li> I keep using it all the time. I think it&#x27;s good. could be a preferential choice. Will repeat the order.</li>
            <li> The product was just as we expected and we liked to use it. We are satisfied with the product :)</li>
            <li> Will know more in time, but seems worth taking a chance, given the reasonable price. I&#x27;ve tried far more expensive products and not been as impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years, great eye cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been writing this a lot, but this winter (2013-14) has been tough on my skin. I am a very young looking 66...people think I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s, early 50&#x27;s (really!), but my skin was getting so dry and flaky, was losing its firmness and I was and feeling old. I searched Amazon for new L&#x27;Oreal products, read reviews and found this. I have been using this product for over a for a month, and I really believe in this product, Not only did it work for me, but it worked quickly and I have my young eyes back.&lt;br /&gt;The L&#x27;Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream has done wonders for my eyelids. They were droopy, and now they are not, honest! I have small eyes and had lost my eyelids, but now I have them back again! Amazing! I really wish I had taken pictures to show you the difference, it is that unbelievable, all I can say is Wow! I have smoother skin around my eyes, my skin looks plumper, firmer. I wouldn&#x27;t have believed this was possible, but I have always trusted L&#x27;Oreal with my facial skin care. I had run out of my last product from them, not this, the one for Mature skin, and was looking for something different to use. That was when my skin got so very dry.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to have found this! I am using it in conjunction with L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Advanced Skin Repair Daily Serum. After I clean my face with L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect for Mature Skin Rich Restorative Cream Cleanser, with gentle exfoliating micro beads (it leaves your skin dewy soft and moist), I pat it dry and put on the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Advanced Skin Repair Daily Serum on and my dry skin drinks and it drinks it in like a sponge. Then to hold in the moisture all day and keep my skin firm,  I use L&#x27;Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Face &amp; Neck Contour Cream (that has made such a difference in my face and neck!) then, L&#x27;Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies this line works, give it a try, you just might be amazed like I was, and it didn&#x27;t take a month for me, it happened in less than two weeks, maybe because my skin was so dry...but these results never happened with anything else; even high-end products.&lt;br /&gt;Love you L&#x27;Oreal, thank you for your wonderful products, and thank you Amazon for carrying them.e amazed like I was, and it didn&#x27;t take a month for me, it happened in less than two weeks, maybe because my skin was so dry...but these results never happened with anything else; even high-end products.&lt;br /&gt;Love you L&#x27;Oreal, thank you for your wonderful products, and thank you Amazon for carrying them.</li>
            <li> Better price than I find in the stores.  Have been using this product regularly for several years.  Not sure it really helps with &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; but nice moisturizer for eye area.</li>
            <li> it smells good and feels great around my eyes</li>
            <li> The company was very prompt in sending out this product, and it arrived in new and good condition... excellent price for this product I will definitely purchase from this company again</li>
            <li> I like the way the little long tip dispenses just the right tiny amount to pat on your eyelids. Some noticeable results in terms of slightly smoother skin and wrinkles but I doubt it compares to the L&#x27;Oreal Triple Action Eye Serum but I can&#x27;t afford that.</li>
            <li> Just started using this eye cream so I can&#x27;t really give a full review yet but I have been using this eye cream for two days and this product you can use on your eyelids which people forget about and around and under eye area. This is a non-greasy,firming and smoothing eye treatment. I will give a future update.</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t see the results other reviewers saw---in fact I saw no change at all. It&#x27;s just that simple.</li>
            <li> Always loved the product. Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Real  Good Eye Cream Just What i Wanted</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this product due to a promotion message from my friend, which turned out to be spam. Overall, I don&#x27;t see any effect of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, haven&#x27;t found anything I like better.  Good value on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used it for about 2 months and like this eyecream. It goes well with my very sensitive skin &amp; keep the area hydrating. My eyes look 10 years younger. Hope they&#x27;ll come with big jam, something like 1 ounce.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the texture. No remarkable results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of other eye creams but this one works best for me.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different but this cream is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Lets get to the point this anti-wrinkle eye cream is CHEAP and that is why most of you gals purchased it. Department store wrinkle &amp; firming creams are way-way over-priced and you all are aware of that fact.  I&#x27;ve paid $85.00 for less than one oz. for a high-priced, over the top name BRAND, and all your complaints for this L&#x27;Oeal product are most definitely inter-twined with the ideal, over-priced, high-end Department Store product.  Get my point, girls?  They are all the same but this L&#x27;Oreal Anti-wrinkle, firming moisturizer eye cream is actually non-greasy, soothing, comfortable, no perfumed aroma and CHEAP....... My bag are still there too.  It don&#x27;t get rid of the wrinkles, believe me but it is better than using nothing.  It truly feels good after being on for 4/6 hours.  Worth giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> This cream stings a little when you put it on, and I can&#x27;t tell if its working. I gave it three stars. I&#x27;ll update after I&#x27;ve used it for a while longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about 7 months and it no longer stings. I can see a difference in the wrinkles around my eyes. Its a light cream and I wish I didn&#x27;t have to stick my finger in the tub every time. Would be better as a squeeze tube. But otherwise, good. I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and I&#x27;ll continue for many more to come.  I hope Loreal continues to make this product.</li>
            <li> Used it for a few weeks and started to notice the bags under my eyes aren&#x27;t as bad as they used to be. Has pro-retinol which I discovered through research is a useful ingredient to have to address the issue.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Complete Anti-Wrinkle &amp; Firming Moisture Eye Cream is fabulous.  It  really works for me and I love it.  Janice</li>
            <li> Best eye cream for the money. Have been using it for years and no matter which one I try, I always come back to this one. Now I have it delivered regularly with subscribe and save</li>
            <li> It improved the lines around my eyes</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I&#x27;ve used it for years.  Best price I could find.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and This does not hurt my eyes.</li>
            <li> If you have bags under your eyes and expect this product to do anything for you, think again. Get more sleep or go to the doc for plastic surgery instead.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a few months now and have really seen results. I am 22 years old and was just looking for something to use for preventative measures. I have really fair skin and as a result have troubles with dark circles under my eyes. Within a week or two, I was surprised how much they had gone away. I wasn&#x27;t looking for that kind of result, but this product works even better than I had hoped it would.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any firming from using this product. I like how much it moisturizes under my eyes, but in humid weather, it can stay a little sticky/tacky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 and I use this around my eyes. I rubbed my eyes so much when I was little, I looked like a raccoon Lol! I&#x27;m glad the dark circles isn&#x27;t that bad anymore, but when I take pics, it shows really bad. I&#x27;ve used this for a week so far, and the top of my eye lids have lighten up allot! Now I&#x27;m applying under my eyes as well. It feels kind of tight after you apply, but the results are amazing. The in store price is about $20, so I&#x27;m glad I found it on here for cheaper. I&#x27;m referring to this to my mom because she has the same problem and I recommend it to anyone else. I wear contact lens and it does not irritate my eyes at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for about 2 years, after researching a number of more expensive eye creams and serums and I have found this cream to be one of the most affordable and, after using it, most effective. There are probably some better - there are certainly more expensive ones - but on my budget, I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at just how quickly I saw a difference.  I have noticed a continuing reduction in lines around the eyes and no puffiness at all in the mornings.  I use the cream both morning and night.</li>
            <li> I have actually noticed a slight difference in the crepe - iness in my eyelids and in general, the product feels very soothing.  I don&#x27;t see a noticeable difference in &amp;#34;lightening&amp;#34; of any area, but I am very  fair anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update after using it for a few more weeks.  It has been about 8 days so far.</li>
            <li> Caused my mother-in-laws and my eyes to burn and become irritated all day long.  And no we didn&#x27;t get the cream in our eyes.</li>
            <li> I cannot speak for anyone else. For me personally, I did not see any change for the few lines I have around my eyes. I have used the complete jar. There is not a lot of cream quantity wise. I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed a huge improvement in wrinkles, under eye bags, or just overall eye area. I had some difficulty finding the right amount and when to use. When first using I found that putting too much on results in my makeup &amp;#34;melting&amp;#34; or creasing. I found that using at night is ideal and if I need to use in the morning (eye area is more dry than normal) I have wait a while for it to really soak into the skin before applying makeup. This is the first eye cream that I&#x27;ve tried and will keep using to give it some time to work and hope these wrinkles and bags will go away!</li>
            <li> Easy to put just a drop under each eye and over the crows feet areas.</li>
            <li> I am 38 years old.  I do not smoke or drink, and have been using this product or the Walmart equate version since I was 21 years old.  Everyone thinks I am 27 or 28.  I use this eye cream morning and night, always remove my makeup at night with a Ponds cleansing cloth, and use St. Ives medicated scrub in the shower.  My skin is very clear, and I rarely get blackouts. I also use a makeup primer before I apply my mineral makeup in the mornings.  I generally have oily to combination skin.  This regimen has been really successful.  The main product has been this eye cream.  Great product!  Don&#x27;t ever stop selling it.  And, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it if you are on the fence.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and I love it.  There have been many times that I have been suckered into buying a very expensive eye cream through my dermatologist or facialist. The more expensive creams do not work as well.  It seems to inexpensive to be good, but I always go back! My eyes are smooth with less wrinkles. I can immediately put on under eye concealer. I don&#x27;t  know what the secret formula, but I take very good care of my skin and I have found this eye cream to be one if the best..buy it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years because it is excellent for firming saggy, delicate skin around the eyes. The skin around my eyes tightens immediately after I put it on. I&#x27;ve tried other eye creams but always go back to this one. I really hope they never stop making it!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a while now and see no changers. Guess the wrinkles are just too far gone.</li>
            <li> Seems like it should work esp with the strong reviews. I&#x27;ve been using it since I received it a few weeks ago and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference as of yet. My fine lines are still there. The cream, which could just extremely moisturizing, is a bit on the greasy side. Will keep using to see what the effect is after a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping. Love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go out of my way to write reviews but I felt I should on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t put toooo much credibility in creams, especially ones that claim they &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34;...  Creams can hydrate which helps wrinkles in skin, but to confound the laws of gravity seems a stretch. (No pun intended)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I should mention that I have been using this cream in conjunction with making sure I consume my water diligently, avoiding rubbing my eyes like I normally do due to allergies, and I have been using sun protection on my eyes, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination has reaped wonderful rewards.  And I do believe that L&#x27;Oreal has done its fair share.  There seems to definitely be an ingredient that tightens the eyelid (I believe it has caffeine which apparently serves such a purpose).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, with also taking care of oneself, getting sound sleep and hydrating well.  :)</li>
            <li> more like a review, this is one of my moms fave anti wrinkle creams!</li>
            <li> Nice cream. Heavy until it soaks in. But not greasy feeling. And it does leave your skin soft. So overall pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have used $150 face creams before. They&#x27;re nice but hey, that&#x27;s a crazy amount of money to spend on a face cream. This is good quality cream for my sensitive, aging skin. The price is right.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning and every night .I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years i also use other loreal products i use all of them daily and a little goes a long way,it last me a couple of month&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I definitely see a reduction in fine lines around my eyes with once daily use. Sometimes I do twice daily.</li>
            <li> Maybe i&#x27;m not consistent applying 2 times a day, but so far for 2 weeks I don&#x27;t see any difference may I need to finish the whole bottle</li>
            <li> Saw a difference after 1 application. Definitely the quickest-acting eye treatment I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 70s and was tired of looking at puffy eyes when I shave. I think this cream makes a difference (my wife agrees) but don&#x27;t expect miracles. I think the puffiness is reduced maybe 20%. Jar is small, but you don&#x27;t use much of the cream. And if you get too large a jar I think there&#x27;s a risk of it becoming contaminated and who needs that. I would order again.</li>
