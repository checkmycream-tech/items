            <li>OMG delicious and amazing!!</li>
            <li>The lip balm itself is awesome - smells great and doesn&#x27;t have a taste.</li>
            <li>Works great and smells great!</li>
            <li>Great ingredients, moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>: I don&#x27;t advocate anyone intentionally giving this to their dog; however, coconut oil is good for dogs, and this lip balm, being organic and all, probably won&#x27;t harm your fur baby if s/</li>
            <li>Works well and feels really good on my lips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for some good coconut lip balm</li>
            <li>It does a good job of hydrating my lips</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a good &amp;#34;manly Chapstick&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I love the moisturizing effects of this lip balm and the great coconut scent.</li>
            <li>Love everything about this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Nice texture.</li>
            <li>lip balm goes on nice and smoothly and provides great protection against the elements.</li>
            <li>Nice coconut smell.</li>
            <li>It has a great consistency, the scents are delightful - natural/real-smelling and not overly strong, and it actually moisturizes!</li>
            <li>I am a bit of a Chapstick connoisseur and this has to be by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>Very smooth and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Feels super smooth on your lips and works great for chapped lips.</li>
            <li>There are cheaper lip balms on the market, but there aren&#x27;t any that are better.</li>
            <li>Would have preferred something more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>What more could you want in a lip balm?  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love these and will be buying again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used Norwex&#x27;s Timeless lip balm and comparing the two I like the Norwex one better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>tastes kind of funny when licked by accident though.</li>
            <li>When I first opened it their was a nice fragrance of coconut, however, after a couple of days it started smelling like crayons (waxy).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and smells heavenly.  </li>
            <li>Coconut oil is a fabulous moisturizer...</li>
            <li>(And the SPF one is great for days outside.)</li>
            <li>The coconut-flavored lip balm has a genuine and pleasing coconut taste to it.</li>
            <li>I was sent this coconut lip balm for review for free through the Still Eagle store.</li>
            <li>After using it for a few months I can tell you it is truly a great product!</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Not quite as rich as the Night a treatment, but it works fine.</li>
            <li>The coconut lip balm by Hurraw is light, smells delicious and really helps my dry lips.</li>
            <li>Coconut was my first favorite and then there was Cinnamon.  </li>
            <li>It tastes much better then most of the natural lip balms.</li>
            <li>Nothing special for the price.</li>
            <li>It was nothing like the cloyingly sweet, synthetic versions that are on the market.</li>
            <li>All natural, nicely scented...smells good enough to eat!  </li>
            <li>They are nice and smooth and I find that my lips do not dry out like with chapsticks.</li>
            <li>and I was very pleased with my overall experience.</li>
            <li>absorbed incredibly fast, but hydrated just as quickly, and each was fast-acting as a chapstick for fine lines.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s all organic, vegan, natural, etc.</li>
            <li>This is the best brand of lip balm (and I&#x27;ve tried a million) and the coconut is my personal favorite, though the Earl Grey is a close second.</li>
            <li>Awesome need more :(0)</li>
            <li>We sell a lot of this at our shop, and our customers keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li>My first choice is the Night Treatment though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smelly thou, maybe a lil too much.</li>
            <li>I have a weakness for purchasing lip balm and am very picky about texture and smell.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Very coconut-y.</li>
            <li>It was very oily too.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>goes on smooth and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Again, this one would be ideal for anyone who normally suffers with a chapstick allergy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I end up being able to push it up but not back down.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind so much if this happened when the balm was running low, since that does happen...</li>
            <li>but I find myself re-applying it frequently.  </li>
            <li>I found that you can get it cheaper directly from the Hurraw website - [...] - $3.95 instead of $4.95 on amazon.</li>
            <li>It lasts for a long time, but be careful where you leave it because it can melt quickly.</li>
            <li>This is OK but not great.  </li>
            <li>I am allergic to beeswax and paba and parabens and a whole heap of other things.  </li>
            <li>my lips are super smooth throughout this dry, cold, snowy winter.</li>

            <li> It is a little gritty and not really a good Coconut taste</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s raw, vegan and all-natural.  </li>
            <li> The one complaint I have is the container.</li>
            <li> but this usually occurs after a handful of uses and is really annoying.</li>
            <li> lip balm is vegan and organic, with nothing artificial added.</li>
            <li> They did not leave that sickening, fruity syrup-like taste in my mouth, was not sticky, took care of sore lips immediately</li>
            <li> Terrible taste and no smell of coconut.</li>

            <li> Knock my Booda butter out the pocket... Awesome need more :(0)</li>
            <li> I am grateful to Amazon for carrying this lip balm.  I have used a lot of different brands.  This one is perfect.  It&#x27;s smooth and smells heavenly.  It&#x27;s raw, vegan and all-natural.  Once you try it, you will be hooked.  Coconut was my first favorite and then there was Cinnamon.  Look up the Hurraw website and choose your flavor.  Delicious!</li>
            <li> The lip balm itself is awesome - smells great and doesn&#x27;t have a taste. It lasts for a long time, but be careful where you leave it because it can melt quickly. The one complaint I have is the container. It&#x27;s an oval shape instead of circular and for some reason the balm always separates from the twisty thing in the middle. I end up being able to push it up but not back down. I wouldn&#x27;t mind so much if this happened when the balm was running low, since that does happen...but this usually occurs after a handful of uses and is really annoying.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this stuff! Smells great! Love that it&#x27;s all organic, vegan, natural, etc. Nice texture. Coconut oil is a fabulous moisturizer...my lips are super smooth throughout this dry, cold, snowy winter. My teenage boys like it ... even the dog likes it! (Yup, teenage boys don&#x27;t always take care of their stuff and the dog found it. She had the yummiest smelling coconut breath and softest lips ever!) Disclaimer: I don&#x27;t advocate anyone intentionally giving this to their dog; however, coconut oil is good for dogs, and this lip balm, being organic and all, probably won&#x27;t harm your fur baby if s/he accidentally on purpose ingests it. Just don&#x27;t make them wait too long if they ask to go out as any extra oil suddenly added to their diet may cause loose stools.</li>
            <li> It is a little gritty and not really a good Coconut taste</li>
            <li> This is the best brand of lip balm (and I&#x27;ve tried a million) and the coconut is my personal favorite, though the Earl Grey is a close second. (And the SPF one is great for days outside.) It has a great consistency, the scents are delightful - natural/real-smelling and not overly strong, and it actually moisturizes!</li>
            <li> Feels super smooth on your lips and works great for chapped lips. I wear lip balm constantly due to dry lips and would definitely recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Hurraw! lip balm goes on nice and smoothly and provides great protection against the elements. It&#x27;s also soothing to already-chapped or cracked lips. We sell a lot of this at our shop, and our customers keep coming back for more. The coconut-flavored lip balm has a genuine and pleasing coconut taste to it. Hurraw! lip balm is vegan and organic, with nothing artificial added. There are cheaper lip balms on the market, but there aren&#x27;t any that are better.</li>
            <li> Works well and feels really good on my lips. Seems to help with dry, chapped lips that I have had for a long time.</li>
            <li> wonderful stuff. would buy again</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Very smooth and moisturizing.</li>

            <li> I just happened to pick this up at an american apparel store. I love it. I found that you can get this cheaper on the actual website though [...] for 3.95. There is a minumum of 3 tubes and it&#x27;s 2.95 for shipping which I didn&#x27;t mind. I had it with in 2 days. I got the coconut, mint and the spf 15. I love these and will be buying again. They are nice and smooth and I find that my lips do not dry out like with chapsticks.</li>
            <li> I love the moisturizing effects of this lip balm and the great coconut scent. I would have given it 5 stars if it contained some spf as well.</li>
            <li> Great ingredients, moisturizing. Not quite as rich as the Night a treatment, but it works fine. Nice coconut smell. My first choice is the Night Treatment though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for some good coconut lip balm and I&#x27;m still looking.  This is OK but not great.  When I first opened it their was a nice fragrance of coconut, however, after a couple of days it started smelling like crayons (waxy).  It does a good job of hydrating my lips but I find myself re-applying it frequently.  I&#x27;ve also used Norwex&#x27;s Timeless lip balm and comparing the two I like the Norwex one better.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift, he seemed to like it. I thought it would be a good &amp;#34;manly Chapstick&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s very smelly thou, maybe a lil too much.</li>

            <li> this is awesome! Works great and smells great! Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Very coconut-y. Love it! goes on smooth and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> OMG delicious and amazing!! Too pricey though!</li>
            <li> It tastes much better then most of the natural lip balms. The Coconut is not over powering. Goes on smoothly. Vegan</li>
            <li> Great product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Terrible taste and no smell of coconut. It was very oily too. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as other balms I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.  Love it.</li>
