            <li>it&#x27;s perfect - looks light and natural but holds!!!</li>
            <li>She told me this was the best product she had found on the market and the only one that worked for her hair.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more of a spray than a mousse.</li>
            <li>This Kenra Platinum Boosting Spray Foam is FABULOUS!  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the kenra boosting for years aND love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would recommend.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My favorite of all times booster/mouse</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>I like it as it gives more boost to my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product on the recommendation of a friend who also has fine hair with no body.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>This is a very light feeling product which i need because i have fine hair - i use it with Big Sexy Hair&#x27;s Root Pump</li>
            <li>Also, be sure to dry your hair at the roots changing directions many, many times to get the maximum boost at your roots.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years, order it online because I am having trouble finding it in stores, feel it is a great product</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and doesn&#x27;t hold the curl more than a few minutes after using a curling iron on it.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>It is the only boosting spray that leaves my hair with more volume, but enables me to comb it too, it is not sticky like others I have tried.</li>
            <li>When used on your roots, be sure to dry your roots first before the rest of your hair, this is key to getting the most body from your roots.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m young and style my hair many different fun ways.</li>
            <li>Kenra seems to produce more volume in my hair without feeling heavy and full of product and stays longer.  </li>
            <li>Lift hair, spray on roots, work through with fingers, blow dry, lightly lift with metal pick, spray with Kenra and smile -</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like this prduct.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice much difference with my hair or styling when I use this.</li>
            <li>I usually like Kenra products, but am not very happy with my latest purchase of many of them!</li>
            <li>I start by towel drying my freshly shampooed hair, spray Kenra on the roots, blow my hair completely dry and then use a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>My hairstylist uses Kenra product on my hair every time I get my hair done, and it&#x27;s the only product that doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down or make it greasy feeling.  </li>

            <li> I purchased this product on the recommendation of a friend who also has fine hair with no body.  She told me this was the best product she had found on the market and the only one that worked for her hair. I had nothing to lose other than a flat head of hair, so I decided to give it a try.  Remarkably, this product does work well.  My hair is very fine and doesn&#x27;t hold the curl more than a few minutes after using a curling iron on it. To use this product, it is sprayed on damp hair before blow drying.  Although the name implies it is a foam, it&#x27;s more of a spray than a mousse. I start by towel drying my freshly shampooed hair, spray Kenra on the roots, blow my hair completely dry and then use a curling iron.  I noticed that I don&#x27;t have to keep the curling iron on my hair as long as before, therefore, feel it is preventing additional heat damage.  After curling, I comb my hair out and apply finishing spray. Kenra seems to produce more volume in my hair without feeling heavy and full of product and stays longer.  I am happy with the results.  I plan to continue using this product and also try some additional hair products in the Kenra line.  All you flatheads out there, it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> This Kenra Platinum Boosting Spray Foam is FABULOUS!  When used on your roots, be sure to dry your roots first before the rest of your hair, this is key to getting the most body from your roots.  Also, be sure to dry your hair at the roots changing directions many, many times to get the maximum boost at your roots.  Enjoy!</li>

            <li> I usually like Kenra products, but am not very happy with my latest purchase of many of them! This makes my long silky hair feel like straw after I blow dry. I&#x27;ve tried styling with a curling iron and a straightener after, but it just isn&#x27;t boosting anything! Very disappointed in the product. Have no problems with the seller!</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; VERY fast shipping!  My wife has used this for a long, long time, so I shop for it often, and this was the best deal on the internet.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would recommend.  Holds hair great and is not stiff and smells pleasant.  Makes hair feel thicker.</li>

            <li> I like it as it gives more boost to my fine hair.  It works well with my Nioxin hair cleanser</li>
            <li> This spray has been awesome to use. I alternate this Boosting Spray Foam with the Root lifting Spray and it adds tons of volume.&lt;br /&gt;Hair feels and looks thicker. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I chose this product because my hairdresser recommended it.  I like it very much.  The whole Kenra Line is awesome.</li>

Both make my hair look awesome, and I always feel like I&#x27;m having a &amp;#34;good hair day&amp;#34;  :)</li>

            <li> I like this product if you blow dry your hair and use a round brush. It adds nice volume. But the cap on this was broken so it falls off so I had to throw that away, which is kind of annoying. But the product is nice.</li>
