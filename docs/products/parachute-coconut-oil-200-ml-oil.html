            <li>Cold-pressed is the best extraction method.</li>
            <li>The quality of this coconut oil is the best</li>

            <li>It may well be great for your hair if you can stomach the odor, which I can&#x27;t.</li>

            <li>Speedy delivery great product</li>
            <li>Great for the hair and skin,Love it :)!!</li>
            <li>This is ok but had reached it&#x27;s best before date on delivery.</li>
            <li>and I will purchase more!</li>
            <li>Love the product !.</li>
            <li>Parachute is the best Coconut Oil I have purchase so far.</li>
            <li>Smells great and not artificial</li>
            <li>strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I have been using Parachute Pure Coconut Oil for more than three decades, and affirm that it is the best brand of coconut oil that is available for use as hair-oil in India.</li>
            <li>I am used to using Nutiva which tastes wonderful, smells beautiful, and is clear in color when melted (so clear, I can read a paper through it).</li>
            <li>they wanted more,and i am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>They must work for the Parachute brand :-)</li>
            <li>I love using coconut oil on my toast, however,</li>
            <li>when I used this brand this morning I had to use grape jelly on top of the coconut oil to hide some of the flavor.</li>
            <li>Refining the coconut oil removes the coconut flavor and scent (replacing it with a smokey flavor) that most people are looking for in coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>Love the product will be ordering more soon</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>will put it in my favorite list.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant coconut smell,i like to put it in my hair for shine and hot oil treatments and moisturize my skin after showering.</li>
            <li>It is also the best brand for applying on dry and chapped skin and lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>When I first got the box, some of the oil liked.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t smell well but works fine.</li>
            <li>Also,used for shaving and leaves everything smooth.</li>
            <li>cover comes sealed to ensure that the oil is unadulterated.</li>
            <li>When buying a good coconut oil, look for unrefined, virgin or extra virgin.</li>
            <li>I put this on at night to make my lips nice and soft.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s true coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Good enough to even put it on my healing septum piercing (located inside of the nose).</li>
            <li>At its solid state it&#x27;s a very bright white, not gold!   </li>
            <li>I dont know what Parachute does but this coconut oil does not stink, comes out light and just observes in the skin, and is of real quality.</li>
            <li>It works and worth the money I paid for this item.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps plain olive oil would work, too, but not taste as great...</li>
            <li>Turns out, I was right.</li>
            <li>Just warm it up for 30 seconds in the microwave if the bottle is full and then reduce the heating time accordingly once the bottle starts getting empty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the trouble for good scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>I use it regularly and have always had compliments from hair stylists for having healthy scalp and shiny thick beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>This Parachute brand must be refined and use pretty high temperatures to extract the oil, thus the smokey flavor.</li>
            <li>THis oil has a light almond nutty smell which I like especially when I heat the oil up.</li>
            <li>Stay away from hair grease as much as you can.</li>
            <li>Also if you buy it from a generally busy Indian store you&#x27;ll get a fresh bottle.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I love this coconut oil, the only issue I had I preferred the larger bottles</li>
            <li>And if you wonder why I didnt return the product, the only reason is that I was expenting to see some good results after a few weeks, which never happened.</li>
            <li>smells bad in the bottle but smells wonderful out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I had been hearing about it from other african-american women who use it on their natural,chemical free hair</li>
            <li>Just be aware, not all coconut oils are equal....</li>
            <li>Their product is old!</li>
            <li>do your research and read the reviews in order to not waste your money.</li>
            <li>It truly leaves the skiin soft, my hairy shinny and bouncey.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable .</li>
            <li>It should be lukewarm while you apply it to your scalp directly.</li>
            <li>I bought my bottle at Wegman&#x27;s Market, so glad it was such a small bottle.</li>
            <li>Comes with two 100ml bottles, would last about 3-4 months for frequent use.</li>
            <li>My poor, damaged hair  looks better after  </li>
            <li>Once this seal is broken, and once the top cover is opened, it closes in a neat snap-in manner to keep the oil from getting oxidized.</li>
            <li>It really works unlike any other lip balm.</li>
            <li>A too big a pack might result in the oil becoming stale because it is not used up fast.</li>
            <li>If you have relaxed or natural hair we know thats dry.</li>
            <li>I believe is the only oil that actually penetrates the hair shaft and provides conditioning which dry Afro-texutred hair relaxed or natural needs.</li>

            <li> one thing is it seems like the smell doesn&#x27;t last as long as I though it would.</li>
            <li> I love the oil, however, it was extremely difficult to get the oil out of the bottle!</li>
            <li> Make coconut oil (this brand) a staple in your hair routine to combat dry hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also more expensive, so I didn&#x27;t want to waste it to slather on my hair.  </li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS A LITTLE DRYING SINCE IM NATIVE AMERICAN</li>
            <li> was quicker than i expected the price was cheaper online anywhere else</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not light enough for that purpose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true the oil freezes in winter or cold weather.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The 200 ml pack is and extremely convenient size, neither too big nor too small.</li>
            <li> The smell is really bad and on top of that, after I used it the first time, the oil is so pasty that I have to use the microwave to reheat it, making it almost impossible to apply.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to waste my toast, so I choked it down...</li>
            <li> Massage it with your fingers for a few minutes in your scalp before going to bed then tie your hair up in a bun</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like.. a raw, oatmeal-coconut scent.</li>
            <li> This is the most DISGUSTING coconut oil I have had the displeasure of trying!</li>
            <li> A too small pack might result in one running to the shop too often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure why there are complaints about the smell.</li>
            <li> IT WAS HARD TO FIND MOISTER</li>
            <li> I am not happy at all.</li>
            <li> I thought it had gone bad, but then I read the other reviews about it smelling \\&quot;smokey\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical on buying this b/c</li>
            <li> Even then I could still taste that disgusting smoke flavor.</li>

            <li> I have been using coconut oil for cooking and eating for quite a while, but wanted to try it as a hair treatment.  I have always used Nutriva Virgin Coconut oil, which tastes delicious and smells like a tropical dream.  It&#x27;s also more expensive, so I didn&#x27;t want to waste it to slather on my hair.  So I bought this brand to use as a \\&quot;beauty treatment\\&quot;.  It is a wonderful conditioner for my hair, but YUCK on the smell.  I thought it had gone bad, but then I read the other reviews about it smelling \\&quot;smokey\\&quot;.  I can&#x27;t distinguish the smell of coconut at all with this product - unless it was a coconut roasted on a charcoal grill that someone put their cigarette butts in.  Peee-uuuu.  I can&#x27;t use this as a skin moisturizer either, because of the smell, and I would not use it for eating/cooking.  However, as a hair oil (albeit stinky) it works well, and once washed out does not leave a residual smell.</li>
            <li> I made a purchase through smallflower for the parachute coconut oil.I had been hearing about it from other african-american women who use it on their natural,chemical free hair and i decided to try it for my self.the shipping was quicker than i expected the price was cheaper online anywhere else i saw it for the 200ml they wanted more,and i am satisfied with the product.It has a pleasant coconut smell,i like to put it in my hair for shine and hot oil treatments and moisturize my skin after showering.It can also be used for cooking.As long as the price stays the same, i will definitely make another purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the oil, however, it was extremely difficult to get the oil out of the bottle! I think a tub would be easier!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical on buying this b/c it&#x27;s in a solid bottle, I couldn&#x27;t see the product. Turns out, I was right. This is the most DISGUSTING coconut oil I have had the displeasure of trying! I can&#x27;t believe another reviewer actually said, ...this oil doesn&#x27;t stink. They must work for the Parachute brand :-) This smells like a barbecue? It&#x27;s a very smokey flavor and the color is actually gold in its liquid state and you can&#x27;t see through it like my usual brand, Nutiva. I am used to using Nutiva which tastes wonderful, smells beautiful, and is clear in color when melted (so clear, I can read a paper through it). At its solid state it&#x27;s a very bright white, not gold!   I love using coconut oil on my toast, however, when I used this brand this morning I had to use grape jelly on top of the coconut oil to hide some of the flavor. Even then I could still taste that disgusting smoke flavor. I didn&#x27;t want to waste my toast, so I choked it down...YUCK. I bought my bottle at Wegman&#x27;s Market, so glad it was such a small bottle. I&#x27;m going back to Nutiva.   When buying a good coconut oil, look for unrefined, virgin or extra virgin. Cold-pressed is the best extraction method. This Parachute brand must be refined and use pretty high temperatures to extract the oil, thus the smokey flavor. Refining the coconut oil removes the coconut flavor and scent (replacing it with a smokey flavor) that most people are looking for in coconut oil.  Just be aware, not all coconut oils are equal....do your research and read the reviews in order to not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Parachute is the best Coconut Oil I have purchase so far. THis oil has a light almond nutty smell which I like especially when I heat the oil up. I use it on my skin, in my hair and cooking. It truly leaves the skiin soft, my hairy shinny and bouncey. The quality of this coconut oil is the best and I will purchase more! I dont know what Parachute does but this coconut oil does not stink, comes out light and just observes in the skin, and is of real quality. If you have relaxed or natural hair we know thats dry. Make coconut oil (this brand) a staple in your hair routine to combat dry hair. Stay away from hair grease as much as you can. Coconut oil I believe is the only oil that actually penetrates the hair shaft and provides conditioning which dry Afro-texutred hair relaxed or natural needs. Best of luck!</li>
            <li> Best coconut oil,  ever purchased</li>
            <li> Love the product will be ordering more soon</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell well but works fine.</li>
            <li> This is the best coconut oil for cooking.  I was introduced by a friend and now i recommended it to all my family members.  I am from the caribbean and definetly recommend that you try this.</li>
            <li> parachut coconut oil..&lt;br /&gt;  The product was perfect and it arrived berfore the estemated time.I love it&lt;br /&gt;I will put it in my favorite list.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand how anyone could use this product - the smell is putrid! It literally made me nauseous. It may well be great for your hair if you can stomach the odor, which I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I put this on at night to make my lips nice and soft. It really works unlike any other lip balm. It also tastes great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps plain olive oil would work, too, but not taste as great...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT WORK GREAT ON MY HAIR.AND MY HAIR IS A LITTLE DRYING SINCE IM NATIVE AMERICAN IT WAS HARD TO FIND MOISTER&lt;br /&gt;TILL NOW</li>
            <li> This is ok but had reached it&#x27;s best before date on delivery. Some grainy bits I think for this reason. Will buy my coconut oil elsewhere in future.</li>
            <li> Smells great and not artificial</li>
            <li> Great for the hair and skin,Love it :)!! Also,used for shaving and leaves everything smooth.</li>
            <li> smells bad in the bottle but smells wonderful out of the bottle. one thing is it seems like the smell doesn&#x27;t last as long as I though it would.</li>
            <li> I love this coconut oil, the only issue I had I preferred the larger bottles and I was shipped double the smaller bottles. Other than that it&#x27;s awesome. I used it for every thing</li>
            <li> Love the product !. Leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable . Will definitely purchase product again in a larger size</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true the oil freezes in winter or cold weather. That&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s true coconut oil. Also if you buy it from a generally busy Indian store you&#x27;ll get a fresh bottle. Just warm it up for 30 seconds in the microwave if the bottle is full and then reduce the heating time accordingly once the bottle starts getting empty. It should be lukewarm while you apply it to your scalp directly. Massage it with your fingers for a few minutes in your scalp before going to bed then tie your hair up in a bun so that won&#x27;t get on your face while sleeping. Wash it off in the morning. If you are allergic to the smell do it just for couple of hours on weekend mornings. I use it regularly and have always had compliments from hair stylists for having healthy scalp and shiny thick beautiful hair. It&#x27;s worth the trouble for good scalp and hair. It won&#x27;t smell in you hair once washed off. You&#x27;ll be using about 1- 2 tablespoons each time you use it. Some people use it in cooking but it&#x27;s not light enough for that purpose. But creates miracles only for hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> This product was expired one year ago.  I would not recommend ordering from this company.  Their product is old!</li>
            <li> My poor, damaged hair  looks better after  I tried this coconut oil.  There is a smell,  but after I washed my hair with shampoo and conditioner, I felt no smell at all. It works and worth the money I paid for this item. Thanks. I guess,  I will buy it again.  I recommend it for hair mask and for face/ body mask.</li>
            <li> I have been using Parachute Pure Coconut Oil for more than three decades, and affirm that it is the best brand of coconut oil that is available for use as hair-oil in India. It is also the best brand for applying on dry and chapped skin and lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parachute sources best quality coconuts for producing its Coconut Oil. The production, purification, and packing  add to the quality and preservation of the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 200 ml pack is and extremely convenient size, neither too big nor too small. A too big a pack might result in the oil becoming stale because it is not used up fast. A too small pack might result in one running to the shop too often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cover comes sealed to ensure that the oil is unadulterated. Once this seal is broken, and once the top cover is opened, it closes in a neat snap-in manner to keep the oil from getting oxidized. It also prevents leakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Not sure why there are complaints about the smell. It smells great! Good enough to even put it on my healing septum piercing (located inside of the nose). It&#x27;s like.. a raw, oatmeal-coconut scent. Comes with two 100ml bottles, would last about 3-4 months for frequent use. (Depending on what you are using it for)</li>
            <li> The packagin was done inappropriately. When I first got the box, some of the oil liked. The smell is really bad and on top of that, after I used it the first time, the oil is so pasty that I have to use the microwave to reheat it, making it almost impossible to apply. I am not happy at all. And if you wonder why I didnt return the product, the only reason is that I was expenting to see some good results after a few weeks, which never happened.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery great product</li>
