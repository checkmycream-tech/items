            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the quality of this mirror.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully there is a perfect spot on the vanity counter that just clears the door</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this mirror.</li>
            <li>Very good looking product</li>
            <li>Also, the price was good!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very bright and the magnifying level is great.</li>
            <li>Great mirror to put on makeup with</li>
            <li>Very nice looking but</li>
            <li>Everything thing about this mirror is wonderful except for the light bulb!</li>
            <li>It is of good quality, looks good and does the job beautifully.</li>
            <li>That is good for the days that I don&#x27;t care to see my flaws.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>My wife likes the attractive shiny appearance (see picture) but the 25w incandescent bulb is an inadequate light.  </li>
            <li>chrome finish mirror is a really nice.  </li>
            <li>I liked the size and shape of this vanity lamp but the on/off switch broke after one use.  </li>
            <li>Mirror is very nice looks great in my bedroom and great for applying makeup or to remove facial hair.</li>
            <li>If you do not have a lot of light in your room it may not be bright</li>
            <li>It seems to work fine and the light is plenty bright.</li>
            <li>If you need the light, then DON&#x27;T BUY IT!</li>
            <li>so I needed to be able to sit and do my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this because I don&#x27;t need my glasses to put on my make-up to see what I am doing.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>I RETURNED IT AND WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH THE QUICK RESPONSE AND REFUND.</li>
            <li>The purpose of the mirror is to magnify and be able to see better with the built in light.</li>
            <li>Look for one with a flourescent light not incadescent if you want to see better.</li>
            <li>simular mirror at a major bath store was 3 tims the price, so I feel I got a great deal.</li>
            <li>This was exactly the kind of mirror</li>
            <li>The mirror is sturdy and looks good, but the light is very dim.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, it was in the on position</li>
            <li>As for the light, it does not illuminate your face.</li>
            <li>My eye brows look perfect everyday</li>
            <li>purchased mirror and by day 2 the light switch stopped working</li>
            <li>(switch would not turn off light).  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of light in my bathroom so it works well for me.  </li>
            <li>When it arrived the switch didn&#x27;t even work the first time I used it!!</li>
            <li>I love this mirror and received well packed fast shipping even delivered on a Sunday.</li>
            <li>The mirror is good, but the off-on switch stopped working not to long ago.</li>
            <li>I sent this back for another brand and the new one works great.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves that the mirror has a light built in and also loves the magnification feature.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is far superior to our old one.</li>
            <li>The mirror was beautiful--sleek and sturdy, but I returned it because the light was so dim</li>
            <li>But it gets so HOT</li>
            <li>but the light is a bit dim and the magnification could be stronger.</li>
            <li>Overall pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>A dim light isn&#x27;t very helpful when you are trying to put on makeup.</li>
            <li>I feel like I would have been better off just buying a light with no light.</li>
            <li>This one is fine, but I was looking for a larger mirror and not lighted.  </li>
            <li>This mirror has 8X magnification, and admittedly, as I get older, I need it!</li>
            <li>and that isn&#x27;t really what I paid for anyway</li>
            <li>Received the second one and the light switch doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I LIKED THE MIRROR, BUT IT DID NOT FIT WHERE I WANTED TO PUT IT.  </li>
            <li>I would have researched other mirrors and made a better choice.</li>
            <li>It is dim but bright enough in a dim to moderately lit room, to cause your pupils to respond to the light, making it hard to see your face in the mirror as the light does not illuminate your face.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just looking for a decent mirror, then get this product.</li>
            <li>The 40 watt provided the brightness needed but the mirror label says 25 watt max, probably because of heat generated by a higher watt bulb, so I ordered a small/cool LED 40 watt equivalent light, which draws only 4 watts, and has the same candelabra screw base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a decent mirror; its major downfall is the VERY, VERY dim light.</li>
            <li>The magnification is ok but the light is not bright enough.</li>
            <li>First, on the face of the device, the width of the frame and then the width of the light surface, times two as they surround the mirror, leaves a relatively small mirror surface.</li>
            <li>The light is a conventional bulb that is very dim.  </li>
            <li>The first one I had worked for about a month, then broke, so I sent it back and received a new one.</li>
            <li>Table Top Lighted Mirror, 8X Magnification, Chrome Finish]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this mirror to replace a Jerdon lighted mirror that I had for the past 10 years.  </li>
            <li>The lighting from the &amp;#34;halo&amp;#34; is way too dim</li>
            <li>The old mirror broke when an item fell out of the medicine cabinet and hit the glass</li>
            <li>Sent product back and replaced with new mirror.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t bother to send it back, my husband put a new switch on it.</li>
            <li>Without the light, even with lights on in the room, it&#x27;s just too hard to see</li>
            <li>My old mirror had 5X magnification and was not double sided.  </li>
            <li>In a much brighter room, the light is useless.</li>

            <li> I needed 13.75&amp;#34; or less to clear the medicine cabinet door</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I turned the light on once and the switch broke --</li>
            <li> Ordered the first one, one side of the product had broken mirror.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long, and this was one of very few mirrors that I could find that had the height to let me see my hair when I pull it up to start rolling it.  </li>
            <li> I should have listened to the previous reviews of this product.</li>
            <li> After returning two of these, don&#x27;t waste your time ordering from Jerdon.  </li>
            <li> Actually the mirror is a little over 14&amp;#34; tall, about 14.25&amp;#34; (hard to measure exactly with base in the way).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two advertised height descriptions for the Jerdon mirror, one says 13.75&amp;#34; and the other 14&amp;#34; tall, and BOTH ARE WRONG.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid it will start a fire, so I have to unplug it two or three times to cool during use and that&#x27;s not so convenient when you have bad knees.  </li>
            <li> I tested a standard 40 watt candelabra bulb with a small E12 screw base that fits.</li>
            <li> these are poorly constructed and with subpar parts.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband who&#x27;s eyesight is getting a little bad for seeing up close.  </li>
            <li> The mounting where the mirror mounts to the swivel is not perfectly level but we will keep it anyway.</li>
            <li> I have bad knees</li>
            <li> Which wouldn&#x27;t be so bad -</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this purchase.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this mirror and received well packed fast shipping even delivered on a Sunday. Mirror is very nice looks great in my bedroom and great for applying makeup or to remove facial hair. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This mirror was perfect for my needs. It&#x27;s very bright and the magnifying level is great. Also, the price was good!</li>
            <li> The mirror is good, but the off-on switch stopped working not to long ago. Fortunately, it was in the on position so  my wife can plug it in for on or unplug it for off.</li>
            <li> The mirror was beautiful--sleek and sturdy, but I returned it because the light was so dim it was like putting your makeup on in a romantic restaurant.</li>
            <li> First, on the face of the device, the width of the frame and then the width of the light surface, times two as they surround the mirror, leaves a relatively small mirror surface. As for the light, it does not illuminate your face. It is dim but bright enough in a dim to moderately lit room, to cause your pupils to respond to the light, making it hard to see your face in the mirror as the light does not illuminate your face. In a much brighter room, the light is useless.</li>
            <li> Great mirror to put on makeup with I love it! Great magnification x8 tweezing eyebrows is a snap!! Love it!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this purchase. The lighting from the &amp;#34;halo&amp;#34; is way too dim and it seems almost tinted.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my mother.  She absolutely loves that the mirror has a light built in and also loves the magnification feature.</li>
            <li> The mirror is sturdy and looks good, but the light is very dim.  I don&#x27;t use it for makeup, so the magnification may be enough for that, but I don&#x27;t think 8x is enough to get a close look at pores.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the previous reviews of this product. Overall, it&#x27;s a decent mirror; its major downfall is the VERY, VERY dim light. If you&#x27;re just looking for a decent mirror, then get this product. If you need the light, then DON&#x27;T BUY IT! If I had to do this over again, I wouldn&#x27;t gotten this mirror! I would have researched other mirrors and made a better choice.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband who&#x27;s eyesight is getting a little bad for seeing up close.  He LOVES it when he shaves and trims his mustache and beard.</li>
            <li> This was exactly the kind of mirror I had been looking for - I have bad knees so I needed to be able to sit and do my hair.  My hair is long, and this was one of very few mirrors that I could find that had the height to let me see my hair when I pull it up to start rolling it.  Unfortunately, I turned the light on once and the switch broke -- so it is permanently &amp;#34;on&amp;#34;.  Which wouldn&#x27;t be so bad - just plug it in and use it, then unplug it - theoretically.  But it gets so HOT I&#x27;m afraid it will start a fire, so I have to unplug it two or three times to cool during use and that&#x27;s not so convenient when you have bad knees.  Without the light, even with lights on in the room, it&#x27;s just too hard to see and that isn&#x27;t really what I paid for anyway - I wanted a lighted mirror.</li>
            <li> I saw a similar mirror made by the same company in a hotel.I tried to find one like it. This one is fine, but I was looking for a larger mirror and not lighted.  This lighted halo does not improve the mirror because it is too close to the mirror. I would have bought the unlighted one if I had known of this imperfection.</li>
            <li> Was delivered ahead of schedule. Replacement for larger version. Easier to pack for travel.</li>
            <li> My eye brows look perfect everyday</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0041CPF3U Jerdon HL958C 8-inch x 10-inch Table Top Lighted Mirror, 8X Magnification, Chrome Finish]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this mirror to replace a Jerdon lighted mirror that I had for the past 10 years.  The old mirror broke when an item fell out of the medicine cabinet and hit the glass mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This chrome finish mirror is a really nice.  My old mirror had 5X magnification and was not double sided.  This mirror has 8X magnification, and admittedly, as I get older, I need it! It is also reversible with 1X magnification on the flip side.  That is good for the days that I don&#x27;t care to see my flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the quality of this mirror.  It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Everything thing about this mirror is wonderful except for the light bulb! A dim light isn&#x27;t very helpful when you are trying to put on makeup.</li>
            <li> I LIKED THE MIRROR, BUT IT DID NOT FIT WHERE I WANTED TO PUT IT.  I RETURNED IT AND WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH THE QUICK RESPONSE AND REFUND.</li>
            <li> purchased mirror and by day 2 the light switch stopped working (switch would not turn off light).  Sent product back and replaced with new mirror.  THis mirror lasted 1 week before the switch stopped working (same issue).  Save your money, don&#x27;t purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Very good looking product but the light is a bit dim and the magnification could be stronger. Overall pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This item met and exceeded our expectations. It is of good quality, looks good and does the job beautifully. It is far superior to our old one.</li>
            <li> It seems to work fine and the light is plenty bright.The mounting where the mirror mounts to the swivel is not perfectly level but we will keep it anyway.</li>
            <li> The Mirror could be a bit briter. I have a lot of light in my bathroom so it works well for me.  If you do not have a lot of light in your room it may not be bright enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A simular mirror at a major bath store was 3 tims the price, so I feel I got a great deal.</li>
            <li> Very nice looking but the switch to turn on and off doesn&#x27;t work. The first one I had worked for about a month, then broke, so I sent it back and received a new one. When it arrived the switch didn&#x27;t even work the first time I used it!! So my husband rigged an extension cord with a switch and I use the switch on the extension cord. Dud product!</li>
            <li> The light is a conventional bulb that is very dim.  I feel like I would have been better off just buying a light with no light.</li>
            <li> Bought for my Niece - she loves it!</li>
            <li> I liked the size and shape of this vanity lamp but the on/off switch broke after one use.  Once I turned it on, I couldn&#x27;t get it to shut off.  I didn&#x27;t bother to send it back, my husband put a new switch on it.</li>
            <li> The purpose of the mirror is to magnify and be able to see better with the built in light. The magnification is ok but the light is not bright enough. I sent this back for another brand and the new one works great. Look for one with a flourescent light not incadescent if you want to see better.</li>
            <li> My wife likes the attractive shiny appearance (see picture) but the 25w incandescent bulb is an inadequate light.  I tested a standard 40 watt candelabra bulb with a small E12 screw base that fits. The 40 watt provided the brightness needed but the mirror label says 25 watt max, probably because of heat generated by a higher watt bulb, so I ordered a small/cool LED 40 watt equivalent light, which draws only 4 watts, and has the same candelabra screw base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two advertised height descriptions for the Jerdon mirror, one says 13.75&amp;#34; and the other 14&amp;#34; tall, and BOTH ARE WRONG.  I needed 13.75&amp;#34; or less to clear the medicine cabinet door so I took my chances and ordered this mirror.  Actually the mirror is a little over 14&amp;#34; tall, about 14.25&amp;#34; (hard to measure exactly with base in the way).  Thankfully there is a perfect spot on the vanity counter that just clears the door so we kept it.  3 stars because of the inadequate bulb and &amp;#34;not as advertised&amp;#34; height measurement.</li>
            <li> I love this because I don&#x27;t need my glasses to put on my make-up to see what I am doing.</li>
            <li> these are poorly constructed and with subpar parts.  Ordered the first one, one side of the product had broken mirror.  Received the second one and the light switch doesn&#x27;t work.  After returning two of these, don&#x27;t waste your time ordering from Jerdon.  Buy from somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Only had it for a week and the on/off button broke.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.  It&#x27;s everything I was looking for.  The product arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  I&#x27;m very happy with this mirror.</li>
