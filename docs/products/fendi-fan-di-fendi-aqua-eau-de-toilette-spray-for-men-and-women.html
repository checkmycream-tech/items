            <li>I believe this will be a safe bet.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite colognes these days.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>The price is stable and that&#x27;s what I like the most.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything and more that my husband said it was.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Great scent for the new season.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sophisticated fragrance that would be fine for the office.  </li>
            <li>A great night wear with an awesome fragrance but does&#x27;nt last long.</li>
            <li>Smells very good, but do not take long in my clothes</li>
            <li>Kind of woodsy and not too much like a women&#x27;s perfume!</li>
            <li>This has a great smell and after trying several, this is the one I like.</li>
            <li>If you like mild to medium</li>
            <li>When I first smelled this one I instantly thought Oud, but then.......you get a spicy woody leather musk, and two people smelled it as well, 1 guy told me good job ,you picked the right one.</li>
            <li>Truly a distinct smell that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I use to love the old Fendi.</li>
            <li>, it smell luxury, not cheap, and the bottle is very nice.</li>
            <li>Fresh, crisp, yet woodsy.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth and present woody tone.</li>
            <li>, I do like very much</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t care for LeMale but love Le Beau Male)</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected :-)</li>
            <li>Realy Fast.... wowwww</li>
            <li>This was not the old FENDI.</li>
            <li>I use this one as my daily scent - just enough complexity to make it interesting, not far enough from &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; to be offensive.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would buy again.</li>

            <li> However, this time when i bought it from amazon the Fan di does not have that long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> I recently tried several Burberry fragrances and one of them had a slight 1 Million and even stronger</li>
            <li> Fan Di is just a little stronger than a skin scent and will last for hours.</li>
            <li> Love it but Disappointed!</li>
            <li> n&#x27;t they have one note in common.  </li>
            <li> Poor poor very poor.</li>
            <li> I hope this helps if you&#x27;re considering a blind purchase.</li>
            <li> It hardly lasts for 1-2 hours, worst product every received from Amazon.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>

            <li> It hardly lasts for 1-2 hours, worst product every received from Amazon. Please avoid this product and especiallyfrom this supplier....</li>
            <li> Was hoping you may have had Fendi Uomo  mens Cologne butt this is good but not as good the coogne.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance for change</li>
            <li> Recommend this item and seller to everyone! 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Exactly what I expected :-)</li>
            <li> I use this one as my daily scent - just enough complexity to make it interesting, not far enough from &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; to be offensive.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> Realy Fast.... wowwww</li>
            <li> I recently tried several Burberry fragrances and one of them had a slight 1 Million and even stronger L.P.G. LeMale thing going on; Fan Di Fendi smells like a clone to that burberry!  I do own Fendi Uomo and I don&#x27;t they have one note in common.  Fan Di is just a little stronger than a skin scent and will last for hours. It&#x27;s a sophisticated fragrance that would be fine for the office.  It starts out citrus then turns into a leather musk leMale thing but nicer (I don&#x27;t care for LeMale but love Le Beau Male) and I do like Fan Di Fendi! If you like mild to medium Dolce &amp; Gabbana / Burberry I believe this will be a safe bet. It&#x27;s probably 40% the projection &amp; sillage of Fendi Oumo! I hope this helps if you&#x27;re considering a blind purchase.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colognes these days. Very smooth and present woody tone. Recommended for sure!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite cologne. I always get it from this seller. The price is stable and that&#x27;s what I like the most.</li>
            <li> Loved it!!!!!!!!! It&#x27;s everything and more that my husband said it was. I just can&#x27;t stop smelling him when he wears it.</li>
            <li> i can almost not even smell this.. and what i can smell wears off in like 10 minutes.. i would not get this ever again.. i will stick with my  212 for men...</li>
            <li> The luxurious smell of young and very beautiful long remain on cotton fabrics and skin, and a wonderful bottle&lt;br /&gt; I loved it too</li>
            <li> I did not knew how it smell, I just bought and surprise, I do like very much, it smell luxury, not cheap, and the bottle is very nice.</li>
            <li> Smells very good, but do not take long in my clothes</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Love it</li>
            <li> Smells great! Wife loves it and quality is awesome. Truly a distinct smell that lasts all day. Everyone has something good to say about it.</li>
            <li> I bought this from another retailer last week. It is now one if my favorites. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This has a great smell and after trying several, this is the one I like. Kind of woodsy and not too much like a women&#x27;s perfume!</li>
            <li> Great scent for the new season.  Fresh, crisp, yet woodsy.  The purchase was made on a Monday..received it by Thursday, earlier than anticipated.</li>
            <li> Always have been fascinated by FENDI. Have used this product before also and has been a great one to buy. However, this time when i bought it from amazon the Fan di does not have that long lasting fragrance. A great night wear with an awesome fragrance but does&#x27;nt last long. Love it but Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Wife loves it!!! I am very happy with my purchase. This is a great smelling cologne. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like Fendi too  much&lt;br /&gt;Good price&lt;br /&gt;I like it</li>
            <li> When I first smelled this one I instantly thought Oud, but then.......you get a spicy woody leather musk, and two people smelled it as well, 1 guy told me good job ,you picked the right one. And another went on Amazon and ordered himself a big bottle  for the generous price of about $45. All I&#x27;m saying is &amp;#34;impressive.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> the smell is terrific</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my husband, it smells so awesome and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> SMELLS AWESOME. PRICELESS!</li>
            <li> I use to love the old Fendi. This was not the old FENDI. Poor poor very poor.</li>
