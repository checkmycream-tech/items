            <li>Nice product to clean my hands safely when eating at restaurants!  </li>
            <li>This keeps them strong and it feels as if they hold the product effectively.</li>
            <li>They were not generous in size - OK for cleaning one&#x27;s face or hands, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>Love that the wipes almost have a plastic interior lining.  </li>
            <li>Individually wrapped and the perfect size for the uses I have in mind.</li>
            <li>I would do better if I purchased hand sanitizer from the 99 cents store.</li>
            <li>They make me feel so much better - they don&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li>Like them better than Sani-hands.</li>
            <li>bought these for a trip to india- put them in a plastic bag to carry as it is much more compact than the box.</li>
            <li>LOVE THEM and so easy to pack around....</li>
            <li>However, they are shipped and  received them very quickly.</li>
            <li>Like this product.very easy to use.</li>
            <li>If you use a lot of sanitizing wipes, better to buy in bulk and individually wrapped is great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s handy but very over priced.</li>
            <li>This is a towel so one can clean their hands easier.  </li>
            <li>It provided complete sanitation and hand cleanliness needed to stay healthy and well in our travels!</li>
            <li>Also good when go out with your kids in public places.</li>
            <li>Good not dry  was what I want and arrived fast .</li>
            <li>/&gt;The price is more than double what you would pay for it if it was locally available.  </li>
            <li>I love having these handy for quick clean ups, especially when the kids are in the back seat of the car!</li>
            <li>This company shipped extremely fast!</li>
            <li>Can never really go wrong with these.</li>
            <li>Hoped for the best and got a mediocre product.</li>
            <li>Love the individual packaging and the thickness of each wipe.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Naturally, I use them on my hands as well, and I actually much prefer these wipes to their alcohol gel counterparts.</li>
            <li>These worked better than I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They have a box that opens  as a dispenser and works very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for offering this sanitizing wipes.  </li>
            <li>Very practical.  </li>
            <li>Come in individual packets so each one is fresh.</li>
            <li>This was somewhat surprising to me, because their alcohol content is not huge, and they are certainly not dripping it.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re so soft and usefull!</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m still alive</li>
            <li>The wipes felt soft, silky, and sort of moisturizing.</li>
            <li>They were absolutely needed when using primitive in-ground toilets in rural Europe.  </li>
            <li>I ran out of the strong alcohol solution I usually use after shaving.</li>
            <li>When I use public bathrooms, I use the wipes to clean the toilet seat and toilet handle.  </li>
            <li>Do not dry out hands.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> LOVE THEM and so easy to pack around....</li>
            <li> The best in the market every person should buy this  Now I found them in Beth Bath too  Great product.</li>
            <li> Great to take on a trip.  This company shipped extremely fast!</li>
            <li> Can never really go wrong with these. I must disclose that I mostly use them for lab work, as we will work with rather dangerous bacterial and parasitic pathogens in one of my labs. After I am done with lab, I will wipe all of my things that are coming home with me with these wipes (pens, pencils, folders, notebooks, etc). Naturally, we take every precaution to prevent any spreading of pathogens, but I figure that you can never be too careful. And I&#x27;m still alive (so far)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, I use them on my hands as well, and I actually much prefer these wipes to their alcohol gel counterparts. It may be my imagination, but I feel like the alcohol gel leaves a slightly sticky residue on the hands, whereas the wipes do their job, alcohol evaporates, and there&#x27;s nothing sticky left.</li>
            <li> These worked better than I expected. I ran out of the strong alcohol solution I usually use after shaving. My skin is prone to problems unless thoroughly disinfected following the use of a shaver. Instead of copious amounts of 70% isopropanol, I ended up using a couple of these wipes, and they were helpful. This was somewhat surprising to me, because their alcohol content is not huge, and they are certainly not dripping it. The wipes felt soft, silky, and sort of moisturizing. They were not generous in size - OK for cleaning one&#x27;s face or hands, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Love that the wipes almost have a plastic interior lining.  This keeps them strong and it feels as if they hold the product effectively.</li>
            <li> I purchased a number of these for the office. As cold and flu season is here, I wanted a way to wipe down keyboards, telephones, door handles etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a box that opens  as a dispenser and works very well. Individually wrapped and the perfect size for the uses I have in mind.</li>

            <li> they&#x27;re so soft and usefull! and it came in earlier than i thought. i love these sanitizing wipes, and will definateleyy order more!</li>
            <li> Good not dry  was what I want and arrived fast . Good amount and not over powering smell! I have to keep these in my car.  They make me feel so much better - they don&#x27;t sting. Just wish they kept them in store. However, they are shipped and  received them very quickly.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed. Hoped for the best and got a mediocre product. Next...!</li>
            <li> Very practical.  Do not dry out hands. This is a towel so one can clean their hands easier.  Come in individual packets so each one is fresh. Love these!  Like them better than Sani-hands.</li>
            <li> Love the individual packaging and the thickness of each wipe.  Plus the convenience of them, I have them in my car,  in my purse, and since  I walk my dog twice a day, I carry them in my coat pockets as well.</li>
            <li> Like this product.very easy to use.Individually wrapped.. Can take it for travel. Also good when go out with your kids in public places.</li>
            <li> Totally depend on these.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you the number of times we needed these wipes when overseas.  They were absolutely needed when using primitive in-ground toilets in rural Europe.  It provided complete sanitation and hand cleanliness needed to stay healthy and well in our travels!</li>
            <li> I love having these handy for quick clean ups, especially when the kids are in the back seat of the car!</li>
