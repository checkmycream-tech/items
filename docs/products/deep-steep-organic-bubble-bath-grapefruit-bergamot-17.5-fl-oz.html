            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Smells great but no bubbles, even in my jetted tub.</li>
            <li>But otherwise, a great product.</li>

            <li>Very nice product.</li>
            <li>It is cute packaging and perfect for when I want to relax and unwind.  </li>
            <li>, in the end, this is a great bubble bath for a good price.</li>
            <li>pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>This bubble bath has a pleasant fragrance of grapefruit.</li>
            <li>This item was a gift and the recipient loved it.</li>
            <li>However, based on what is advertised, I feel I have purchased a good product.</li>
            <li>Good to have on hand for those nights</li>
            <li>This smells lovely and lathers up very nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell and is organic.</li>
            <li>Nice for the Gentleman as well as Lady.</li>
            <li>I like my baths very bubbly, so this worked out perfectly.</li>
            <li>The grapefruit bergamot bubble bath is great on the fragrance end of the product - a nice light smell of both grapefruit and bergamot that lasts all through the bath.  </li>
            <li>Smells delicious, is natural, and creates nice bubbles.</li>
            <li>I still enjoy using it because the scent is so pleasant, but if you&#x27;re looking for a bubbly experience, this doesn&#x27;t provide it.</li>
            <li>Nothing more relaxing than a warm bubble bath.  </li>
            <li>Better value, more bubbles, organic and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>The bubbles were ok but the smell was fantastic!</li>
            <li>What else is there to love?</li>
            <li>It bubbles up quite a bit too, which I love when taking a bubble bath.</li>
            <li>I love bubble bath products, I also use them for body washes.  </li>
            <li>Love love this smell.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>But a decent amount still gives off plenty of bubbles to keep me happy.</li>
            <li>It makes the bathroom smell good, it makes me smell good, but it doesn&#x27;t linger so long as to overlap with any perfumes or lotions you would want to put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is BPA free and made of #1 PETE.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li>and it makes your whole bathroom smell amazing.</li>
            <li>And I feel comfortable using this for a bubble bath for me or my toddler.</li>
            <li>It does not take much to make lots of nice bubbles.  </li>
            <li>I would say though, the scent makes me feel invigorated, not so much relaxed, but very clean!</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because it didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin other than I smelled really good!</li>
            <li>a hot bubble bath is my favorite way to unwind.  </li>
            <li>Glad I purchased it;)</li>
            <li>She said the grapefruit scent is her favorite, she loves it so much.</li>
            <li>It smells fruity without a super sweet/cloying odor.</li>
            <li>The scent is perfect - not to overwhelming and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I agree with other reviews that it smells more like Froot Loops than grapefruit, but I really enjoy the sweet smell.  </li>
            <li>However, the amount of bubbles created was minimal...hardly worthy of the term &amp;#34;bubble bath&amp;#34;, even using a large amount of the product.  </li>
            <li>This is a great scent for anyone, male or female.</li>
            <li>I wanted something less chemical-ly, but still with a lot of bubbles and a good scent.</li>
            <li>I tried this one for the first time and I truly like it.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend the product if you are interested in relaxing in the bath.</li>
            <li>Much enjoyed product, Used everyday for a fine hot soak and relaxation.  </li>
            <li>If you like earl grey tea and citrus things, you will love this.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this out due to the overwhelming positive reviews!</li>
            <li>I keep 2 on hand so that it&#x27;s there when the day has been too much...</li>
            <li>bathsalts really relaxed me and as soon as i got out</li>
            <li>I just wiped off the exterior and didn&#x27;t think much about it - until I got an email from the company</li>
            <li>It is relaxing, smells fresh and leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li>I really like the grapefruit bergamot scent.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any moisturing factors and actually kind of dried my skin out after a 45 minute bath.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable as it doesn&#x27;t take much to get a tub full of bubbles - and they last!  </li>
            <li>The grapefruit smells very clean and crisp, but I think the bergamot must round out the scent because there isn&#x27;t a bitterness underlying the scent at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used if several times and still have product visible above the top of the label.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my hubby who loves to soak in the tub, and he loves this product, and highly recommends it.</li>
            <li>I use the products because they have natural ingredients and come in unusual scents.  </li>
            <li>I was in total awe when I sniffed this the first time.</li>
            <li>I have used several different scents from Deep Steep but the Grapefruit Bergamot is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>My favorite part is that it doesn&#x27;t have any harsh chemicals in it!  </li>
            <li>I like the way fruit loops smell, so I was obviously pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Relaxing smell:) a little goes a long way every time.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that the bubbles does not last too much.</li>
            <li>there happens to be a box of fruit loops in the pantry -- but I can at least enjoy the scent every time I bathe.&lt;br</li>
            <li>far as packaging goes, I was concerned when I ordered it that it could leak everywhere, especially since it was shipped with a couple of books.</li>
            <li>So far I have like everything that Deep Steep makes.  </li>
            <li>I buy Deep Steep as gifts for friends and family that like natural products.</li>
            <li>There was a little bit of leakage, but not enough to be super noticeable.</li>

            <li> If you want to go bananas with the bubbles, you can still get plenty of uses out of it for the cost, and if you just want an occasional bubble bath this will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> (I felt like the product leakage was so minor, and a risk I took by ordering it online, that I never did contact them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try the other scents when I run out of the three bottles of grapefruit bergamot that I purchased, but I have a feeling that I&#x27;ll be coming back to this</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re hesitant to order something that could ultimately arrived with one empty bottle inside a very wet box, rest assured that the company will work with you to correct the problem.</li>
            <li> It gently cleanses and does not leave behind residue.</li>
            <li> Not much fragrance and pricey.</li>
            <li> In the end, it was shipped in a sealed plastic sleeve to protect the other items.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t say anything about being moisturizing, and it didn&#x27;t make me feel over hydrated, but I wasn&#x27;t dried out at all.</li>
            <li> But nothing a little lotion didn&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li> too small for the price.</li>
            <li> This is hard for me rate at this time.</li>
            <li> It does not smell like grapefruit but at least make bubbles.</li>
            <li> It created a pathetic amount of bubbles and forced me to use a whole lot of it to get any bubbly-ness going -- in fairness, it probably wasn&#x27;t supposed to be used for bubble baths.</li>

            <li> This item was a gift and the recipient loved it.</li>
            <li> too small for the price. pleasant smell. have to use a lot to get bubbles.</li>
            <li> I bet you&#x27;re wondering what this smells like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t believe me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT SMELLS LIKE FRUIT LOOPS. Or Fruity Pebbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not even kidding. I was in total awe when I sniffed this the first time. I like the way fruit loops smell, so I was obviously pleasantly surprised. I haven&#x27;t had fruit loops since I was a child and I will probably never have fruit loops again unless I am starving and there happens to be a box of fruit loops in the pantry -- but I can at least enjoy the scent every time I bathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this, I had been using a Kiss My Face bath gel that smelled like pine trees. It created a pathetic amount of bubbles and forced me to use a whole lot of it to get any bubbly-ness going -- in fairness, it probably wasn&#x27;t supposed to be used for bubble baths. I switched over to this. Better value, more bubbles, organic and smells amazing. I&#x27;ll try the other scents when I run out of the three bottles of grapefruit bergamot that I purchased, but I have a feeling that I&#x27;ll be coming back to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is BPA free and made of #1 PETE.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this out due to the overwhelming positive reviews! I&#x27;m glad I did! I got the grapefruit one in the smaller bottle. I literally used about a quarter of the bottle in a garden bathtub. The bubbles were ok but the smell was fantastic! The smell lingers for a while too, so your bathroom smells of citris-y goodness! I gave it 4 stars because it didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin other than I smelled really good! It doesn&#x27;t have any moisturing factors and actually kind of dried my skin out after a 45 minute bath. But nothing a little lotion didn&#x27;t fix! I will definitely buy again and try different scents!</li>
            <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;I purchases this for my daughter, she loves bubble baths. She said the grapefruit scent is her favorite, she loves it so much. I will purchase again</li>
            <li> My job is stressful and a hot bubble bath is my favorite way to unwind.  I have used several different scents from Deep Steep but the Grapefruit Bergamot is my favorite.  The price is reasonable as it doesn&#x27;t take much to get a tub full of bubbles - and they last!  I keep 2 on hand so that it&#x27;s there when the day has been too much...</li>

            <li> I agree with other reviews that it smells more like Froot Loops than grapefruit, but I really enjoy the sweet smell.  It creates great bubbles and I didn&#x27;t feel I needed to use a lot of product.  It is cute packaging and perfect for when I want to relax and unwind.  My favorite part is that it doesn&#x27;t have any harsh chemicals in it!  The seller did a great job and I would recommend using them too.  Arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious, is natural, and creates nice bubbles. What else is there to love?</li>

            <li> Much enjoyed product, Used everyday for a fine hot soak and relaxation.  Would recommend the product if you are interested in relaxing in the bath.</li>
            <li> My mom recently purchased this item for me with a host of others in the same catagory. I used this with the restless nights bath salts. What a awesome combination. This stuff rocks i suffer from ra which causes alot of stiffness aches and pains. I deceided to test it laat night to see if it had any effect on me and it did. The mintue i soaked in the tub i was in heaven the restless nights bathsalts really relaxed me and as soon as i got out the tub dryed off and got in the bed i slept like a baby. Try this with the restless nights bathsalts!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about getting a grapefruit bubble bath and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever smelled bergamot before, but this bubble bath smells heavenly. The grapefruit smells very clean and crisp, but I think the bergamot must round out the scent because there isn&#x27;t a bitterness underlying the scent at all. It smells fruity without a super sweet/cloying odor. It bubbles up quite a bit too, which I love when taking a bubble bath. It doesn&#x27;t say anything about being moisturizing, and it didn&#x27;t make me feel over hydrated, but I wasn&#x27;t dried out at all. I didn&#x27;t use any lotion after the bath and there was NO itchiness, so I was quite happy. This is a great scent for anyone, male or female. I would say though, the scent makes me feel invigorated, not so much relaxed, but very clean!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t take a lot of baths and I have never found a bubble bath I like until now. This smells lovely and lathers up very nicely. I would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Awesome bubble bathh!!! Relaxing smell:) a little goes a long way every time. Good to have on hand for those nights</li>
            <li> I love bubble bath products, I also use them for body washes.  This is a great product. I  plan on using this product for xmas presents for my girls.</li>
            <li> Smells great but no bubbles, even in my jetted tub. Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li> This review earns five stars not only for the product itself, but for the customer service and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First up, the bubble bath. I wanted something less chemical-ly, but still with a lot of bubbles and a good scent. This fits both. It isn&#x27;t a miracle bubble bath; one capful doesn&#x27;t equal oodles of bubbles. But a decent amount still gives off plenty of bubbles to keep me happy. I&#x27;ve used if several times and still have product visible above the top of the label. The scent (grapefruit) is wonderful. It makes the bathroom smell good, it makes me smell good, but it doesn&#x27;t linger so long as to overlap with any perfumes or lotions you would want to put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as packaging goes, I was concerned when I ordered it that it could leak everywhere, especially since it was shipped with a couple of books. In the end, it was shipped in a sealed plastic sleeve to protect the other items. There was a little bit of leakage, but not enough to be super noticeable. I just wiped off the exterior and didn&#x27;t think much about it - until I got an email from the company asking how the shipping had gone, if there were any problems, and that they would try to correct them. (I felt like the product leakage was so minor, and a risk I took by ordering it online, that I never did contact them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in the end, this is a great bubble bath for a good price. If you want to go bananas with the bubbles, you can still get plenty of uses out of it for the cost, and if you just want an occasional bubble bath this will last you a long time. And if you&#x27;re hesitant to order something that could ultimately arrived with one empty bottle inside a very wet box, rest assured that the company will work with you to correct the problem.</li>
            <li> This bubble bath has a pleasant fragrance of grapefruit. The bergamot is as aromatic as a cup of tea. It gently cleanses and does not leave behind residue. Nice for the Gentleman as well as Lady.Glad I purchased it;)</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product.  I don&#x27;t like an excess of bubbles.  It is relaxing, smells fresh and leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li> This bubble bath is the best I&#x27;ve found. A ton of bubbles and it makes your whole bathroom smell amazing. Will buy again, and a again and again!</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Only desirable change is to have a pump with it. I have a pump from another product which fits Deep Steep&#x27;s bottles, so that makes it easier. Or one could buy a liquid soap dispenser bottle at drugstore/hardware store. But otherwise, a great product. I take a bubble bath every evening before sleep.</li>
            <li> Love love this smell. If you like earl grey tea and citrus things, you will love this.</li>
            <li> The scent is perfect - not to overwhelming and a little goes a long way! I like my baths very bubbly, so this worked out perfectly.</li>
            <li> Finally an organic nontoxic bubble bath soap! I love it. Smells great. And I feel comfortable using this for a bubble bath for me or my toddler.</li>
            <li> Not much fragrance and pricey.</li>
            <li> The grapefruit bergamot bubble bath is great on the fragrance end of the product - a nice light smell of both grapefruit and bergamot that lasts all through the bath.  However, the amount of bubbles created was minimal...hardly worthy of the term &amp;#34;bubble bath&amp;#34;, even using a large amount of the product.  I still enjoy using it because the scent is so pleasant, but if you&#x27;re looking for a bubbly experience, this doesn&#x27;t provide it.</li>
            <li> So far I have like everything that Deep Steep makes.  I use the products because they have natural ingredients and come in unusual scents.  I really like the grapefruit bergamot scent.  The products work for my skin and don&#x27;t irritate it.  It does not take much to make lots of nice bubbles.  I buy Deep Steep as gifts for friends and family that like natural products.</li>
