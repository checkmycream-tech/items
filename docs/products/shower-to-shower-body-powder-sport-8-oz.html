            <li> I have used baby powder for years after showers.  I live in a dry place and powder really helps.  This just feels better than any baby powder I ever found.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Sticks to you much better than other products. (very fine, like cornstarch).</li>
            <li> Product arrive in time , smells n looks great it easy to apply to just squeeze and aim and the powder just instantly spreads out through out yourbody making you smells great . Definatly will be purchasing more out this brand - satisfied</li>
            <li> Powdery absorbent powder and its perfect. Lasts forever and little bit goes a long way. Smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband and he loves it.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am, so very happy. This is a very ood product. You can shower, or take a bath put this on. It last forever, and is very refreshing. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Had to throw it out.  While it is absorbent, the stink is overwhelming and so intolerable even someone elses fart would be welcome.   I had to shower again to get rid of the stink.  I can recommend the unscented version.  But I don&#x27;t want to be within 100 feet of anyone wearing this stink.</li>
            <li> I grew up knowing about Shower to Shower because my parents used it. This is my first time using the sport scent and I love it. It smells manly without being too strong. It keeps me dry where I need it.</li>
            <li> Horrible shipping. Took 2 weeks and once arrived the seals had been removed as if the product had been used. Gross.</li>
            <li> This stuff was bottled in the pits of hell by the Devil himself.... my crotch was on FIRE!!!</li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t want to keep toxifying themselves with aluminum, this is a GREAT deodorant all by itself. Use a couple of times a day and stay fresh. Surprisingly effective.</li>
            <li> I once bought this powder at a local Walmart years back.  Sadly it must have stopped carrying this particular scent.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon! It arrived very well packaged and is just what I wanted!  :)</li>
            <li> Good stuff my wife love&#x27;s the smell of the stuff though it is a little pricey</li>
            <li> Has a nice masculine fresh scent</li>
            <li> A good product, I am a man and this the only body powder that is not girly.. It is hard to get at stores lately.</li>
            <li> Ordered this on line because I couldn&#x27;t find it in a store.  After I received it, I found a store that sells it.  I will buy it there from now on, but was pleased to have found it before I went on vacation.  Vender was fine to deal with.</li>
            <li> Not as absorbent as expected.  J &amp; J Baby Powder with cornstarch does the trick.</li>
            <li> I usually buy 4 bottles of this stuff at a time since I hardly ever can find it in stores.  The powder goes on light and dry with a pleasant masculine scent. I wear it as an deodorant and it keeps me dry and smelling nice all day.  Won&#x27;t use anything else anymore.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but not really helping to keep me dry</li>
            <li> Best after bath powder there is.</li>
            <li> Not too crazy about the smell, but it is okay.</li>
            <li> love the scent of this product. it allows you to smell masculine even after a shower, without using Cologne. unlike Baby Powder which leaves you smelling like a baby no matter how old you are</li>
            <li> Absorbent and refreshing</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere. Works great and doesn&#x27;t make you smell like a retirement home like gold bond does. It&#x27;s a neutral smell with a faint sporty scent to it. Can&#x27;t smell it at all after you put it on.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with Shower to Shower. This powder has a very clean &amp; fresh scent, I use it every day! Arrived earlier then scheduled and is small, good for traveling.</li>
            <li> Like it better than babypower but would like the scent to be lot stronger and last longer</li>
