            <li>Good  </li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the results and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>It must work in conjunction with the serum, because since I use both, I&#x27;m very pleased with my skin.</li>
            <li>Seriously, I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I found magic in a bottle!</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I started with a sample bottle and liked it.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use this on its own -</li>
            <li>Honestly I fell like it brought wrinkles out like it magnified them.</li>
            <li>The Laser Focus is somewhat effective on my neck, around my eyes and on my forehead, but I try to avoid using it anywhere in between.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product fast delivery works well.</li>
            <li>There are some products cheap and good</li>
            <li>Very smooth texture to my skin now.</li>
            <li>I am using this product now; and I love the way it feels.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a great deal of difference as much as I feel the difference.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li>AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO RECOVER THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I use Clinique&#x27;s Zero Gravity Repairwear Lift for oily skin and love the result of using both products together.</li>
            <li>Like everything else, it has to be combined with healthy life-style, UV protection and needs to be used consistantly day and night in order for you to see results.     </li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I have used this for four weeks now and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>i like how it is unscented and can be used safely under the eyes,</li>
            <li>In comparing this product here and at Sephora, this product costs $20 more at Amazon then it does at Sephora.</li>
            <li>I recommend it, but give it time, it improves wrinkles the more you use it.</li>
            <li>Love Clinique products</li>
            <li>I HAVE EVEN MORE WRINKLES</li>
            <li>&quot; Be satisfied??</li>
            <li>Initially I was quite impressed and even bought a 30ml bottle of it, though not yet started it.  </li>
            <li>My skin seems more radiant.</li>
            <li>If I were to spend more money on a serum I feel it should be on a product from a dermatoligist&#x27;s office and not from another cosmetic company.</li>
            <li>Love this product...expensive, but it does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off buying the cheapest product at CVS.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love using this</li>
            <li>and it is so refreshing.</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with the results it has given my face.</li>
            <li>Amazon is better value that duty-free at the airports.</li>
            <li>I am an  allergic woman and use Clinique since many years ago.</li>
            <li>Not quite sure how well it works on wrinkles but makes my skin looking smoother.</li>
            <li>love it but is time to change it, I m 35</li>
            <li>plus, for sure.  </li>
            <li>to dry/soak in, then put on moisturizer before you go to bed.  :-)</li>
            <li>My wrinkles appeared more pronounced.  </li>
            <li>My skin just looked better.  </li>
            <li>I feel better</li>
            <li>and I think I look better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a full bottle of this product and it is exceptionally effective... wrote a review at the manufacturer&#x27;s website (hint, hint).  </li>
            <li>I had been one of those people who had pretty good skin without trying.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 55 and had an area of concern (right lower cheek) of fine lines (always sleep on the right, beginning to wonder if sleeping on satin pillowcases to prevent wrinkles was not a myth of my youth LOL) and this product, which lasted for over two months, took care of that problem.  </li>
            <li>Any of my creams and serums in this kind of volume haven&#x27;t finished so fast (slightly more than a month)</li>
            <li>would strongly suggest you buy skin care products in the retail store.</li>
            <li>When this first came out and I purchased a bottle, I liked what it did for my eye area.  </li>
            <li>I also am noticing some fine lines under my eyes</li>
            <li>my fine lines are now even deeper.</li>
            <li>This product goes on smooth and absorbs into the skin very quickly.  </li>
            <li>But, I think some of the fine lines have softened and some of the spots are lighter.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it too often or in huge doses, just as recommended in instruction.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of this COMBINED with the repairwear uplifting cream which I apply nightly.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any info about another size being available, so</li>
            <li>All I know now is that my experience with it has been great - after a week of use 2x daily, my skin looks renewed and flushed.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s light and won&#x27;t cause you to break out.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and penetrates skin immediately.  </li>
            <li>Clinique&#x27;s moisturizing gel is FABULOUS.</li>
            <li>- all I know is it makes my skin look extremely vibrant and healthy, and that&#x27;s all I could ask for!</li>
            <li>I bought a full bottle because my husband one day out of the blue said my face (skin) looked great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Clinique products for years and very happy with them (e.g. Clinique repairwear eye cream and Turnaround Concentrate are very nice), and I&#x27;ve used other serums (e.g. Ultima Swiss Hyaluronic Serum), but this Clinique serum is a no go</li>
            <li>Since I am profoundly allergic to ANY fragrance of any kind, Clinique is one of the few lines I can use and probably the best quality of all the truly hypo-allergenic products available.  </li>
            <li>After a month of using this product, I can tell a significant difference in the depth of the wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I had purchased retail for much more money.</li>
            <li>I do have a sensitive eye area, maybe more then most, but it sometimes stings and that worries me.</li>
            <li>I love that it soaks in quickly, and thoroughly enough that I can apply a moisturizer on top (though I often don&#x27;t feel the need to!).</li>
            <li>so I was super excited to try it.</li>
            <li>(Thanks Allure :).</li>
            <li>I just purchased a full size bottle yesterday in hopes of seeing results with lines.</li>
            <li>I agree that Turnaround is better, and I too miss the real Anti-Gravity line.  </li>
            <li>skin has since rebounded, but I would have been better off not going through the whole</li>
            <li>I got a product sample on a Wednesday, and I would swear that after 2 days of applying it, it has made the dark circles under my eyes more prominent, the skin appear even finer and more translucent</li>
            <li>quick and temporary fix.  </li>
            <li>My skin is noticeably brighter and more vibrant when I use this product regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for a quick fix</li>
            <li>I use it on the top of my hands too because that is the main place for brown spots to appear.</li>
            <li>pleased with this purchase and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I first used this when I got a free sample from Clinique at the mall.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products and most work good at plumping up your skin, but this is the worse of the bunch.  </li>
            <li>High end product, I feel the skin become soft after using, like face returned to 18 years old, is very good</li>
            <li>and it has consistently made my skin feel soft and nice.</li>
            <li>It is good for minor wrinkles - it is worth to try</li>
            <li>I am 42 years old and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles for my age, but living in the arid high desert plains I am trying to take better care of my skin.</li>
            <li>note, the seller was super quick to deliver and that was appreciated!  </li>
            <li>It does seem to calm my face when I use it.</li>
            <li>Good Product and came as expected.</li>
            <li>Used the product once so far but love the feel of my skin already.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better in my life, and I am 32 years old.  </li>
            <li>Over the years I have purchased hundreds if not thousands of dollars worth of &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; creams, lotions and potions.</li>
            <li>I understand this has a lot of silicone and don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price or results.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had this kind of result in getting rid of fine lines with any other product.</li>
            <li>It works and it is the most affordable product out there compared to the other Skin Care Lines that are also sold in the Better Department Stores.</li>
            <li>I am also impressed with how quickly results were seen as it only took about half the time that Clinique claims one would see changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She was right.</li>
            <li>I use 8 drops, which feels just right for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I suggest if you want to try this product purchase it from clinique so that yoy know your getting the right thing.</li>
            <li>Save your time and money, $132.00, on Laser Focus if you are 60 years or older, stay out of the sun , wear sunscreen and a huge brimmed hat.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m sorry to say that since, on the whole, I love Clinique, have been using it for 30 years, look ten years younger than I am, but find that they discontinue some of their best products and the replacements sometimes aren&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually noticed more wrinkles around my eyes and forehead.</li>
            <li>Frankly, it&#x27;s the first Clinique skin product I&#x27;ve tried that works.</li>
            <li>At first I paid no attention to it.</li>
            <li>Never purchased another bottle after first.  </li>
            <li>I love Clinique products anyway, but I do actually see visible results from this!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t exactly explain it.  </li>
            <li>I started using Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion again after about 30 years, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Clinique products for a few years now and they are great for sensitive skin and do not use a lot of fragrance&#x27;s in their products.</li>
            <li>I would have skipped by it if it wasn&#x27;t for the positive feedback from dermatologists.</li>
            <li>I bought the large bottle that day and use it twice a day.</li>
            <li>Products that state certain results</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is kind of expensive and not every product works the same for every person; department stores accepts returns on this type of thing so if you&#x27;re unsure whether this will work for you, that may be a good place to look first.</li>
            <li>I went back to my usual routine, using hydraulic acid and a good rich  </li>
            <li>I bought it only because I had an unused Bloomingdales store credit, and nothing else in the cosmetics section fit that credit, and I was smitten by all the advertisement around it.</li>
            <li>I really like Clinique products.  </li>
            <li>Still trying to decide if it is really &amp;#34;solving&amp;#34; the problem permanently, but I may be asking too much.  </li>
            <li>Responsible seller.</li>
            <li>but I have come to really like this product.</li>
            <li>It is thin and leave a great feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Fast shopping.</li>
            <li>I Don&#x27;t do Botox but would like to keep a youthful appearance and this really does work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product, but buyer beware - you very well might not like what happens when you discontinue use.</li>
            <li>very good.excellence product, at time, complete,Thanks, fulfilled my expectations.</li>
            <li>My lips became very chapped and was using chap stick</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it addresses all that much that another product, particularly Retin-A, couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tighter, firmer, brighter, more even, and fine under my eyes (the only place I had them) are severely diminished after a few months of a diligent routine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used a free sample of this new product for about 4 weeks</li>
            <li>This stuff REALLY works BUT - as with most skincare products it only works if you use it daily, mornings and at night.</li>
            <li>, my full 30ml bottle is going back to the shop today.  </li>
            <li>my suggestion is not to buy from this particular seller and save yourself some money.</li>
            <li>Also of note, for some reason the product likes to work its way up under the cap and collect at the top of the bottle so close tightly to avoid waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I feel my skin looks more even, a little tighter, and my eyes aren&#x27;t as puffy in the morning as they used to be.  </li>
            <li>I use this everyday and notice my skin is getting better.  </li>
            <li>I am only 29, but am starting to have a fine netting of lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>You might get free samples and other perks by purchasing it in person and returns would be easier.</li>
            <li>He  had no idea I was trying something new.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida by the beach and worship the sun on my days off, so my skin needs all the help it can get.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;d recommend  to buy a new bottle from clinique or sephora.</li>
            <li>However, I did not notice any reduction to fine lines or fading of dark skin patches.  </li>
            <li>I definitely see a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance, not only does it smooth out wrinkles and lines</li>
            <li>Anyway, I used the first 2 week sample and got the next 2 week sample, and by the end of the 4 weeks I was hooked!  </li>
            <li>the only positive thing that I did notice about this product was that it did help with some sun spots or sun damage.</li>
            <li>followed the directions and at about the fourteen day mark I had noticeable differences in my skin; the texture was improved somewhat but the *real* difference was the fine lines near my eyes were definitely softened and less of them.</li>
            <li>I am 27 years old and the huge mistake of not wearing sunscreen up until a few years ago.</li>
            <li>The skin becomes bright, but not awesome.</li>
            <li>It repairs your skin and makes it look brighter and clear then before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31 years old and am starting to get some lines under and around my eyes, especially when I smile.</li>
            <li>The ONLY drawback is the design of the bottle, I learned very rapidly to watch the rim of the bottle because somehow someway product &#x27;&#x27;escapes&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle enough to use around the eyes.   </li>
            <li>I am 38 years old and people tell me I look 25.</li>
            <li>This lotion makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Please dont use it if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>The price really isn&#x27;t that big of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am way too young for wrinkles</li>
            <li>It was my fist time to buy this product online, but it was much diluted when compared to all the same products I bought in the retail store.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say WOW.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>That said, I was surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li>But I too believe it dried parts of my face, and I got MORE wrinkles above my lip, which is what I was trying to address.</li>
            <li>I will definitely keep using this serum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, to comment on the other reviewer&#x27;s comments about price, this product is available $20 cheaper on Sephora.com and Clinique.com.</li>
            <li>At the website, girls and ladies, this product is brand-new, costs far less than advertised here and currently ships for free, because it is an incentive to get consumers to try it...</li>
            <li>The light crows feet grew worse than when I first started using the product, and my eyes looked sunken because of the creases around my \\&quot;bags.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m realistic enough to know that sun damage and aging can&#x27;t be removed, except by surgery.  </li>
            <li>I think after reading the review of the 28 year old who had a similar reaction, I will be smart and simply discontinue use.</li>
            <li>moisturer and my face is back to normal.  </li>
            <li>I hope that my skin snaps back to normal, Yikes!&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li>I am 54 years old and have a few lines here and there but mostly smile lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li>I had heard the dramatic claims for Repairwear and how it gets results comparable to expensive laser procedures and thought that with such a bold statement of remarkable results there might be a chance to see some actual positive changes in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like clinique in general</li>
            <li>Have had several compliments on my 70 year old sun-damaged skin since using it twice per day.  </li>
            <li>The consistency was different &amp; this product had an odor like it was old &amp; expired.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time so the price is easier to live with.</li>
            <li>I had to take one day off because it was making my skin extra sensitive to sunlight, but a one day break seemed to be enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 years old, and my days of expecting a product to come along that&#x27;s going to take 10 years off me are long gone.  </li>
            <li>Every morning I do a face pull back to see how much of a face lift I would need, and each morning I pull less back than the day before.  </li>
            <li>Everybody is differnt with difffernt skin issues but my main concern was getting rid of the dark circles and puffiness and this product did nothing it was promised to do for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I have used the Clinique Repairwear before, purchased from Macy&#x27;s, wonderful results.</li>

            <li> Good  </li>
            <li> Good  </li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the results and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> It must work in conjunction with the serum, because since I use both, I&#x27;m very pleased with my skin.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I found magic in a bottle!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I started with a sample bottle and liked it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use this on its own -</li>
            <li> Honestly I fell like it brought wrinkles out like it magnified them.</li>
            <li> The Laser Focus is somewhat effective on my neck, around my eyes and on my forehead, but I try to avoid using it anywhere in between.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product fast delivery works well.</li>
            <li> There are some products cheap and good</li>
            <li> Very smooth texture to my skin now.</li>
            <li> I am using this product now; and I love the way it feels.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a great deal of difference as much as I feel the difference.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li> AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO RECOVER THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I use Clinique&#x27;s Zero Gravity Repairwear Lift for oily skin and love the result of using both products together.</li>
            <li> Like everything else, it has to be combined with healthy life-style, UV protection and needs to be used consistantly day and night in order for you to see results.     </li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for four weeks now and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> i like how it is unscented and can be used safely under the eyes,</li>
            <li> In comparing this product here and at Sephora, this product costs $20 more at Amazon then it does at Sephora.</li>
            <li> I recommend it, but give it time, it improves wrinkles the more you use it.</li>
            <li> Love Clinique products</li>
            <li> I HAVE EVEN MORE WRINKLES</li>
            <li> &quot; Be satisfied??</li>
            <li> Initially I was quite impressed and even bought a 30ml bottle of it, though not yet started it.  </li>
            <li> My skin seems more radiant.</li>
            <li> If I were to spend more money on a serum I feel it should be on a product from a dermatoligist&#x27;s office and not from another cosmetic company.</li>
            <li> Love this product...expensive, but it does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be better off buying the cheapest product at CVS.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love using this</li>
            <li> and it is so refreshing.</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with the results it has given my face.</li>
            <li> Amazon is better value that duty-free at the airports.</li>
            <li> I am an  allergic woman and use Clinique since many years ago.</li>
            <li> Not quite sure how well it works on wrinkles but makes my skin looking smoother.</li>
            <li> love it but is time to change it, I m 35</li>
            <li> plus, for sure.  </li>
            <li> to dry/soak in, then put on moisturizer before you go to bed.  :-)</li>
            <li> My wrinkles appeared more pronounced.  </li>
            <li> My skin just looked better.  </li>
            <li> I feel better</li>
            <li> and I think I look better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a full bottle of this product and it is exceptionally effective... wrote a review at the manufacturer&#x27;s website (hint, hint).  </li>
            <li> I had been one of those people who had pretty good skin without trying.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55 and had an area of concern (right lower cheek) of fine lines (always sleep on the right, beginning to wonder if sleeping on satin pillowcases to prevent wrinkles was not a myth of my youth LOL) and this product, which lasted for over two months, took care of that problem.  </li>
            <li> Any of my creams and serums in this kind of volume haven&#x27;t finished so fast (slightly more than a month)</li>
            <li> would strongly suggest you buy skin care products in the retail store.</li>
            <li> When this first came out and I purchased a bottle, I liked what it did for my eye area.  </li>
            <li> I also am noticing some fine lines under my eyes</li>
            <li> my fine lines are now even deeper.</li>
            <li> This product goes on smooth and absorbs into the skin very quickly.  </li>
            <li> But, I think some of the fine lines have softened and some of the spots are lighter.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it too often or in huge doses, just as recommended in instruction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this COMBINED with the repairwear uplifting cream which I apply nightly.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any info about another size being available, so</li>
            <li> All I know now is that my experience with it has been great - after a week of use 2x daily, my skin looks renewed and flushed.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s light and won&#x27;t cause you to break out.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and penetrates skin immediately.  </li>
            <li> Clinique&#x27;s moisturizing gel is FABULOUS.</li>
            <li> - all I know is it makes my skin look extremely vibrant and healthy, and that&#x27;s all I could ask for!</li>
            <li> I bought a full bottle because my husband one day out of the blue said my face (skin) looked great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Clinique products for years and very happy with them (e.g. Clinique repairwear eye cream and Turnaround Concentrate are very nice), and I&#x27;ve used other serums (e.g. Ultima Swiss Hyaluronic Serum), but this Clinique serum is a no go</li>
            <li> Since I am profoundly allergic to ANY fragrance of any kind, Clinique is one of the few lines I can use and probably the best quality of all the truly hypo-allergenic products available.  </li>
            <li> After a month of using this product, I can tell a significant difference in the depth of the wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I had purchased retail for much more money.</li>
            <li> I do have a sensitive eye area, maybe more then most, but it sometimes stings and that worries me.</li>
            <li> I love that it soaks in quickly, and thoroughly enough that I can apply a moisturizer on top (though I often don&#x27;t feel the need to!).</li>
            <li> so I was super excited to try it.</li>
            <li> (Thanks Allure :).</li>
            <li> I just purchased a full size bottle yesterday in hopes of seeing results with lines.</li>
            <li> I agree that Turnaround is better, and I too miss the real Anti-Gravity line.  </li>
            <li> skin has since rebounded, but I would have been better off not going through the whole</li>
            <li> I got a product sample on a Wednesday, and I would swear that after 2 days of applying it, it has made the dark circles under my eyes more prominent, the skin appear even finer and more translucent</li>
            <li> quick and temporary fix.  </li>
            <li> My skin is noticeably brighter and more vibrant when I use this product regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for a quick fix</li>
            <li> I use it on the top of my hands too because that is the main place for brown spots to appear.</li>
            <li> pleased with this purchase and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I first used this when I got a free sample from Clinique at the mall.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many products and most work good at plumping up your skin, but this is the worse of the bunch.  </li>
            <li> High end product, I feel the skin become soft after using, like face returned to 18 years old, is very good</li>
            <li> and it has consistently made my skin feel soft and nice.</li>
            <li> It is good for minor wrinkles - it is worth to try</li>
            <li> I am 42 years old and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles for my age, but living in the arid high desert plains I am trying to take better care of my skin.</li>
            <li> note, the seller was super quick to deliver and that was appreciated!  </li>
            <li> It does seem to calm my face when I use it.</li>
            <li> Good Product and came as expected.</li>
            <li> Used the product once so far but love the feel of my skin already.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better in my life, and I am 32 years old.  </li>
            <li> Over the years I have purchased hundreds if not thousands of dollars worth of &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; creams, lotions and potions.</li>
            <li> I understand this has a lot of silicone and don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price or results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this kind of result in getting rid of fine lines with any other product.</li>
            <li> It works and it is the most affordable product out there compared to the other Skin Care Lines that are also sold in the Better Department Stores.</li>
            <li> I am also impressed with how quickly results were seen as it only took about half the time that Clinique claims one would see changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She was right.</li>
            <li> I use 8 drops, which feels just right for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I suggest if you want to try this product purchase it from clinique so that yoy know your getting the right thing.</li>
            <li> Save your time and money, $132.00, on Laser Focus if you are 60 years or older, stay out of the sun , wear sunscreen and a huge brimmed hat.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m sorry to say that since, on the whole, I love Clinique, have been using it for 30 years, look ten years younger than I am, but find that they discontinue some of their best products and the replacements sometimes aren&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually noticed more wrinkles around my eyes and forehead.</li>
            <li> Frankly, it&#x27;s the first Clinique skin product I&#x27;ve tried that works.</li>
            <li> At first I paid no attention to it.</li>
            <li> Never purchased another bottle after first.  </li>
            <li> I love Clinique products anyway, but I do actually see visible results from this!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t exactly explain it.  </li>
            <li> I started using Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion again after about 30 years, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Clinique products for a few years now and they are great for sensitive skin and do not use a lot of fragrance&#x27;s in their products.</li>
            <li> I would have skipped by it if it wasn&#x27;t for the positive feedback from dermatologists.</li>
            <li> I bought the large bottle that day and use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> Products that state certain results</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is kind of expensive and not every product works the same for every person; department stores accepts returns on this type of thing so if you&#x27;re unsure whether this will work for you, that may be a good place to look first.</li>
            <li> I went back to my usual routine, using hydraulic acid and a good rich  </li>
            <li> I bought it only because I had an unused Bloomingdales store credit, and nothing else in the cosmetics section fit that credit, and I was smitten by all the advertisement around it.</li>
            <li> I really like Clinique products.  </li>
            <li> Still trying to decide if it is really &amp;#34;solving&amp;#34; the problem permanently, but I may be asking too much.  </li>
            <li> Responsible seller.</li>
            <li> but I have come to really like this product.</li>
            <li> It is thin and leave a great feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> Fast shopping.</li>
            <li> I Don&#x27;t do Botox but would like to keep a youthful appearance and this really does work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product, but buyer beware - you very well might not like what happens when you discontinue use.</li>
            <li> very good.excellence product, at time, complete,Thanks, fulfilled my expectations.</li>
            <li> My lips became very chapped and was using chap stick</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it addresses all that much that another product, particularly Retin-A, couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tighter, firmer, brighter, more even, and fine under my eyes (the only place I had them) are severely diminished after a few months of a diligent routine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a free sample of this new product for about 4 weeks</li>
            <li> This stuff REALLY works BUT - as with most skincare products it only works if you use it daily, mornings and at night.</li>
            <li> , my full 30ml bottle is going back to the shop today.  </li>
            <li> my suggestion is not to buy from this particular seller and save yourself some money.</li>
            <li> Also of note, for some reason the product likes to work its way up under the cap and collect at the top of the bottle so close tightly to avoid waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I feel my skin looks more even, a little tighter, and my eyes aren&#x27;t as puffy in the morning as they used to be.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday and notice my skin is getting better.  </li>
            <li> I am only 29, but am starting to have a fine netting of lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> You might get free samples and other perks by purchasing it in person and returns would be easier.</li>
            <li> He  had no idea I was trying something new.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida by the beach and worship the sun on my days off, so my skin needs all the help it can get.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d recommend  to buy a new bottle from clinique or sephora.</li>
            <li> However, I did not notice any reduction to fine lines or fading of dark skin patches.  </li>
            <li> I definitely see a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance, not only does it smooth out wrinkles and lines</li>
            <li> Anyway, I used the first 2 week sample and got the next 2 week sample, and by the end of the 4 weeks I was hooked!  </li>
            <li> the only positive thing that I did notice about this product was that it did help with some sun spots or sun damage.</li>
            <li> followed the directions and at about the fourteen day mark I had noticeable differences in my skin; the texture was improved somewhat but the *real* difference was the fine lines near my eyes were definitely softened and less of them.</li>
            <li> I am 27 years old and the huge mistake of not wearing sunscreen up until a few years ago.</li>
            <li> The skin becomes bright, but not awesome.</li>
            <li> It repairs your skin and makes it look brighter and clear then before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old and am starting to get some lines under and around my eyes, especially when I smile.</li>
            <li> The ONLY drawback is the design of the bottle, I learned very rapidly to watch the rim of the bottle because somehow someway product &#x27;&#x27;escapes&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gentle enough to use around the eyes.   </li>
            <li> I am 38 years old and people tell me I look 25.</li>
            <li> This lotion makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Please dont use it if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> The price really isn&#x27;t that big of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am way too young for wrinkles</li>
            <li> It was my fist time to buy this product online, but it was much diluted when compared to all the same products I bought in the retail store.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say WOW.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> That said, I was surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li> But I too believe it dried parts of my face, and I got MORE wrinkles above my lip, which is what I was trying to address.</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep using this serum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, to comment on the other reviewer&#x27;s comments about price, this product is available $20 cheaper on Sephora.com and Clinique.com.</li>
            <li> At the website, girls and ladies, this product is brand-new, costs far less than advertised here and currently ships for free, because it is an incentive to get consumers to try it...</li>
            <li> The light crows feet grew worse than when I first started using the product, and my eyes looked sunken because of the creases around my \\&quot;bags.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m realistic enough to know that sun damage and aging can&#x27;t be removed, except by surgery.  </li>
            <li> I think after reading the review of the 28 year old who had a similar reaction, I will be smart and simply discontinue use.</li>
            <li> moisturer and my face is back to normal.  </li>
            <li> I hope that my skin snaps back to normal, Yikes!&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> I am 54 years old and have a few lines here and there but mostly smile lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I had heard the dramatic claims for Repairwear and how it gets results comparable to expensive laser procedures and thought that with such a bold statement of remarkable results there might be a chance to see some actual positive changes in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like clinique in general</li>
            <li> Have had several compliments on my 70 year old sun-damaged skin since using it twice per day.  </li>
            <li> The consistency was different &amp; this product had an odor like it was old &amp; expired.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time so the price is easier to live with.</li>
            <li> I had to take one day off because it was making my skin extra sensitive to sunlight, but a one day break seemed to be enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old, and my days of expecting a product to come along that&#x27;s going to take 10 years off me are long gone.  </li>
            <li> Every morning I do a face pull back to see how much of a face lift I would need, and each morning I pull less back than the day before.  </li>
            <li> Everybody is differnt with difffernt skin issues but my main concern was getting rid of the dark circles and puffiness and this product did nothing it was promised to do for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have not compared it to other products as Clinique feels so natural on my skin</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I had expected and arrived within a few days of ordering it.</li>
            <li> Though initially dubious about the claims made for this item, I found that skin on my face and chest was clearly smoother and less wrinkled by the end of my one month trial.  </li>
            <li> I am 28 Years old and have worked night shifts for 6 years, Therefore I have dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> hands down, not even a close comparison as far as visible results.</li>
            <li> But certainly takes down the puffiness make them less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have read other bad reviews and some good ones</li>
            <li> It has hyaluronic acid, although it is late on the ingredient list, which suggests there isn&#x27;t much of it in there.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Clinique&#x27;s Turnaround Concentrate for a long time</li>
            <li> Once you get past the poorly designed packaging that forces you to perform a ridiculous application method, and the opaque bottle that does not allow you to see how much you have left, the product inside works well to reduce fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers have noted the same thing, please see reviews on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> but it hasn&#x27;t made my face break out or turn red like other products I have used.  </li>
            <li> The same for the smile lines around my mouth - they seem to be deeper as well, what the heck?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very freaked out and disappointed, as my friend raved about it, it worked for her.</li>
            <li> the product a total of 8 times over 4 days - going to discontinue due to adverse reaction.</li>
            <li> but if your skin is dry, use this on your skin, wait for 5-10 minutes</li>
            <li> It seems totally counter-intuitive, but I would absolutely swear that this product is making the super-fine lines around my eyes worse.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t seen a single change in the wrinkles around my eyes or my forhead .</li>
            <li> The product does not last long at all (less than a month per bottle).</li>
            <li> Allot of the product gets wasted if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> However, if you figure in the price of all the other crap you would otherwise buy, it is so worth the higher price!</li>
            <li> but lately i notice new lines on my face, maybe is time for me to get something to target lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t notice any other results, I&#x27;m considering trying another product that contains coffeeberry, but if the other product doesn&#x27;t produce results, I will go back to using this.</li>
            <li> I have very deep 11&#x27;s on my forehead, and it helps that a little.  </li>
            <li> If I get a little red spot, it disappears overnight with this serum.  </li>
            <li> seems to take the texture of my skin back decades---maybe different for each--I have delicate skin --and</li>
            <li> Once I spent the night at my mother&#x27;s house and didn&#x27;t use it before bed and in the AM.</li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this several weeks ago and saw a difference in a few days.  </li>
            <li> And I just recently started noticing crows feet and forehead wrinkles a few months ago</li>
            <li> I used Clinique years ago, but as I aged, I moved on to skin care products for \\&quot;mature\\&quot; skin</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Also occasional breakouts are a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> but if you want something stronger I suggest other brand.  </li>
            <li> As I say, I&#x27;m way past the age where I expect a big change to come from a bottle of anything.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem as raw when out in the wind and weather, and if they do get red and tight feeling, this takes that away as soon as I put it on.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s meant to tackle wrinkles or dark spots or anything else</li>
            <li> My eyes are still puffy, my dark circles are still there</li>
            <li> It took at least 4 wks to notice, but the side treated has noticeably smaller pores &amp; reduced lines.</li>
            <li> User states that it is just another product billed as such with common results.  </li>
            <li> Some places by my nose where the skin was just a little bit reddened and sort of rough looking are much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> La Mer on down to drug store brands</li>
            <li> Use this in combination with a couple other things and you WILL see results!  </li>
            <li> , i can see the lines are less visible</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help the slight sag</li>
            <li> and yes, it did diminish slight laughter lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I would give the product 4 1/2 stars but you can&#x27;t do a half star.</li>
            <li> so I wonder how it was stored, too hot, too cold, salvaged from flood, who knows.</li>
            <li> My lines are less visible and the few brown spots I have are fading.  </li>
            <li> miracle in a little jar</li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> It does feel a little tingly when I put it on</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this and was so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s already empty!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to try and combat those symptoms, and I started seeing results in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I did not breakout and my skin felt softer after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s not cheap but Macys has it at 44.00</li>
            <li> but I do feel my skin softer after a few weeks of use</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money</li>
            <li> and I would see visible changes in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Trust me its a waste of money</li>
            <li> But, I got the sample of this serum and used it, and within a few days I knew something was going on.  </li>
            <li> So I make a consequence that the BOTTLE WAS NOT FULL!</li>
            <li> It works, I defently recomended I saw results faster than what it says no more line expressions under my eyes...</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product from Macy&#x27;s in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would spend the money on it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it makes my skin \\&quot;glow\\&quot; in a way that&#x27;s hard to describe and</li>
            <li> I hardly even took off my makeup at night....</li>
            <li> (what they mean is wrinkled).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, there&#x27;s no huge, dramatic difference.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s too expensive and, as another reviewer also said, a bottle lasts less than a month.</li>
            <li> This product is way too expensive not to be working, even a little.  </li>
            <li> BUT after NOT using the sample for only 2 days, my eyes look puffy, I have bags under my eyes which doesn&#x27;t happen to me, even after a bad night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> I had to lie down this morning with a cold flannel over my eyes to get rid of the puffiness.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect dramatic results since it is OTC but</li>
            <li> To add, I hated the dispenser and the fact that I had to keep the bottle upside out for the last couple of weeks to get all of it out.</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t so freaking expensive</li>
            <li> and sadly I have seen some changes...</li>
            <li> (staff at a Clinique counter would tell you it&#x27;s not an issue, sadly they don&#x27;t know what they are talking about in the case of this product).</li>
            <li> they fail to tell you is what happens when you stop using the product - I received a sneak preview of what my face is going to look like in a number of years.</li>
            <li> Expensive and does not work.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t terribly expensive and works wonders on my face..  </li>
            <li> Also expensive for ?</li>
            <li> Bad girl.  </li>
            <li> It does nothing but make your skin horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am using this product now; and I love the way it feels. I haven&#x27;t noticed a great deal of difference as much as I feel the difference.</li>
            <li> Good Product and came as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old and am starting to get some lines under and around my eyes, especially when I smile. I purchased this product to try and combat those symptoms, and I started seeing results in just a few weeks. I will definitely keep using this serum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, to comment on the other reviewer&#x27;s comments about price, this product is available $20 cheaper on Sephora.com and Clinique.com. I haven&#x27;t seen any info about another size being available, so my suggestion is not to buy from this particular seller and save yourself some money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month, and haven&#x27;t seen any noticable results. I will not be buying another bottle because I haven&#x27;t seen any noticable results, it&#x27;s too expensive and, as another reviewer also said, a bottle lasts less than a month. I have been using Clinique&#x27;s Turnaround Concentrate for a long time and I think it&#x27;s much better. The results are visible within days and the bottle lasts 2-3 months. I&#x27;m going back to using Turnaround.</li>
            <li> I bought it only because I had an unused Bloomingdales store credit, and nothing else in the cosmetics section fit that credit, and I was smitten by all the advertisement around it. My dermatologist told me not to expect miracles from it. She was right. I noticed no difference whatsoever. To add, I hated the dispenser and the fact that I had to keep the bottle upside out for the last couple of weeks to get all of it out.</li>
            <li> 4 OCCASIONS IN GOOD HE REQUESTED THE REFUND OF MONEY TO MY CARD AS THIS PRODUCT WAS NOT DELIVERED TO MY ADDRESS AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO RECOVER THE PRODUCT. LES ASK SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I started with a sample bottle and liked it. I used it twice a day. I did not breakout and my skin felt softer after a few weeks. I bought a full bottle because my husband one day out of the blue said my face (skin) looked great. He said he had been noticing. He  had no idea I was trying something new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a full bottle of this product and it is exceptionally effective... wrote a review at the manufacturer&#x27;s website (hint, hint).  At the website, girls and ladies, this product is brand-new, costs far less than advertised here and currently ships for free, because it is an incentive to get consumers to try it...I&#x27;m 55 and had an area of concern (right lower cheek) of fine lines (always sleep on the right, beginning to wonder if sleeping on satin pillowcases to prevent wrinkles was not a myth of my youth LOL) and this product, which lasted for over two months, took care of that problem.  The ONLY drawback is the design of the bottle, I learned very rapidly to watch the rim of the bottle because somehow someway product &#x27;&#x27;escapes&#x27;&#x27; the dropper...happy (lower-cost) shopping, everyone.</li>
            <li> quick and temporary fix.  use daily to see results within a week or two.</li>
            <li> This stuff REALLY works BUT - as with most skincare products it only works if you use it daily, mornings and at night. I live in Florida by the beach and worship the sun on my days off, so my skin needs all the help it can get. I definitely see a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance, not only does it smooth out wrinkles and lines but it makes my skin \\&quot;glow\\&quot; in a way that&#x27;s hard to describe and it&#x27;s gentle enough to use around the eyes.   You can&#x27;t use this on its own - you have to layer moisturizer over it, to \\&quot;seal\\&quot; it in. I use Clinique&#x27;s Zero Gravity Repairwear Lift for oily skin and love the result of using both products together. Yes, it&#x27;s not cheap but Macys has it at 44.00 so it&#x27;s a no brainer as to where I buy....</li>
            <li> I read about this product a month before it came out (Thanks Allure :). I would have skipped by it if it wasn&#x27;t for the positive feedback from dermatologists. I couldn&#x27;t wait for it to come out. Ladies, this is NOT a miracle serum. Like everything else, it has to be combined with healthy life-style, UV protection and needs to be used consistantly day and night in order for you to see results.     I am on my 4th bottle and I cannot imagine myself not having it. I am 38 years old and people tell me I look 25. I LOVE it. Once I spent the night at my mother&#x27;s house and didn&#x27;t use it before bed and in the AM. I could tell the difference!    The only downside is packaging (thus only 4 stars). The product does not last long at all (less than a month per bottle). However, if you figure in the price of all the other crap you would otherwise buy, it is so worth the higher price!</li>
            <li> miracle in a little jar</li>
            <li> I only bought this product because I had a gift card, and I was hopeful it would work with all the hype it recieved.  I have been using it for a month with no improvement in my skin. Not even a change of any type.  I may as well be putting water on my face.  This product is way too expensive not to be working, even a little.  I didn&#x27;t expect dramatic results since it is OTC but some type of change would be good.  Not worth it!</li>
            <li> I have used the Clinique Repairwear before, purchased from Macy&#x27;s, wonderful results. The bottle purchased from Amazon had a moldy smell and I don&#x27;t see the same results so I wonder how it was stored, too hot, too cold, salvaged from flood, who knows.</li>
            <li> This lotion makes my skin soft. And I noticed it the next day. I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s doing anything else, such as reduce lines, however. I&#x27;ve purchased this twice and it has consistently made my skin feel soft and nice. Since I don&#x27;t notice any other results, I&#x27;m considering trying another product that contains coffeeberry, but if the other product doesn&#x27;t produce results, I will go back to using this. And I would not purchase this on Amazon. Just go to your local department store. You might get free samples and other perks by purchasing it in person and returns would be easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit when I started using a sample bottle of this, I didn&#x27;t know what it was supposed to do! All I know now is that my experience with it has been great - after a week of use 2x daily, my skin looks renewed and flushed. I had to take one day off because it was making my skin extra sensitive to sunlight, but a one day break seemed to be enough. I love that it soaks in quickly, and thoroughly enough that I can apply a moisturizer on top (though I often don&#x27;t feel the need to!). My skin is noticeably brighter and more vibrant when I use this product regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s meant to tackle wrinkles or dark spots or anything else - all I know is it makes my skin look extremely vibrant and healthy, and that&#x27;s all I could ask for!</li>
            <li> This product does wonders for your face. I had allot of sun damage from trying to be a sun goddess all these years. It repairs your skin and makes it look brighter and clear then before. You do have to keep using it. It doesn&#x27;t work if you stop. I now have it on auto-delivery. I highly recommend this product. It is a serum so it&#x27;s light and won&#x27;t cause you to break out. Clinique does need to redesign the bottle. Allot of the product gets wasted if you are not careful. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work well.  I really like Clinique products.  Have not compared it to other products as Clinique feels so natural on my skin</li>
            <li> I have used this for four weeks now and absolutely love it. Money well spent. My skin has never looked better. Very smooth texture to my skin now. Also occasional breakouts are a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I love this stuff!  It makes my skin feel like a sheet of silk.  If it weren&#x27;t so freaking expensive I&#x27;d slather it all over my body.  I&#x27;d take a bath in it!  I&#x27;d do everything but eat it!</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping my cheek areas where weather takes it toll.  They don&#x27;t seem as raw when out in the wind and weather, and if they do get red and tight feeling, this takes that away as soon as I put it on.  Still trying to decide if it is really &amp;#34;solving&amp;#34; the problem permanently, but I may be asking too much.  I use it with my morning and night routine, and sometimes after I&#x27;ve been out in the weather.  It does seem to calm my face when I use it.</li>
            <li> I applied this serum on my skin and it made my skin burnt up. It became red and I had reaction with it. I have returned the product. Please dont use it if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li> I had a makeover at a Clinique counter.  She used this prior to moisturizer.  The next morning i saw the lines on each side of my mouth smoother.  I bought the large bottle that day and use it twice a day. Every morning I do a face pull back to see how much of a face lift I would need, and each morning I pull less back than the day before.  I have very deep 11&#x27;s on my forehead, and it helps that a little.  I am 61.</li>
            <li> I like repair wear.  It goes on smooth and penetrates skin immediately.  Leaves my face feeling soft and hydrated.  I recommend it</li>
            <li> The bottle instructs using only 4 drops for the entire face.  I tried doing that but 4 drops left some of my face and neck neglected.  I use 8 drops, which feels just right for my skin.  It&#x27;d a serum, so your face may appear oily, but the quality is excellent and absolutely worthwhile.  i like how it is unscented and can be used safely under the eyes,</li>
            <li> Good product. Responsible seller.</li>
            <li> After a month of using this product, I can tell a significant difference in the depth of the wrinkles around my eyes.  Overall, my skin is smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> I received this product promptly but when it arrived it was just in a plastic bag. No clinique box or anything. Just an open bottle. There could be anything in this bottle. I suggest if you want to try this product purchase it from clinique so that yoy know your getting the right thing. The price really isn&#x27;t that big of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I only used it for about 3 weeks... Honestly I fell like it brought wrinkles out like it magnified them.</li>
            <li> I have been using Laser focus faithfully but I must be pass the age to see any changes or improvements.  I am discouraged.  Products that state certain results and I use a product fathfully and not seeing any changes, its maddening.  Clinique&#x27;s moisturizing gel is FABULOUS. It is a MUST for daily use, morning and at night.  Save your time and money, $132.00, on Laser Focus if you are 60 years or older, stay out of the sun , wear sunscreen and a huge brimmed hat.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work on all types of skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the results and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I like clinique in general but I have come to really like this product. It is thin and leave a great feeling on the skin. I am way too young for wrinkles but I do feel my skin softer after a few weeks of use</li>
            <li> I have not bought this product.  In comparing this product here and at Sephora, this product costs $20 more at Amazon then it does at Sephora.</li>
            <li> I purchased this several weeks ago and saw a difference in a few days.  It is the only thing that is lessening wrinkles not only around the eyes, but around the mouth as well.  I recommend it, but give it time, it improves wrinkles the more you use it.</li>
            <li> I am 27 years old and the huge mistake of not wearing sunscreen up until a few years ago. And I just recently started noticing crows feet and forehead wrinkles a few months ago so I thought I would try this product based on the star rating that I got and the recommendation that I got from several people from clinique. I have been using this product for close to 3 months now and I haven&#x27;t seen a single change in the wrinkles around my eyes or my forhead . I&#x27;ve actually noticed more wrinkles around my eyes and forehead. the only positive thing that I did notice about this product was that it did help with some sun spots or sun damage. Do not buy this product if you are looking for a wrinkle reducer because it does not work. Save your money!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I received a sample which lasted about 2 weeks. I definitely noticed the brown spots on my face dimishing after the bottle was gone. I just purchased a full size bottle yesterday in hopes of seeing results with lines.</li>
            <li> As a swimmer, I have allowed my skin to be abused.  I was given a sample of this product when purchasing another Clinique item at a store.  Though initially dubious about the claims made for this item, I found that skin on my face and chest was clearly smoother and less wrinkled by the end of my one month trial.  Even my dermatologist, who checks my body twice a year because of years of sun exposure, is impressed by the difference.  I gratefully accept the discounted price at Amazon, as well as the short delivery time.</li>
            <li> Save your money.......one Clinique product that doesn&#x27;t do a thing. Love Clinique products but this one just doesn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li> High end product, I feel the skin become soft after using, like face returned to 18 years old, is very good</li>
            <li> I had some sun damage signs around my eyes and decided to try this product. I really like it, i can see the lines are less visible and i have been using it for about a month now. I recommend it to my friends!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 33 and used this cream 2 times a day for 6 weeks on my forehead. I saw no change even though it claims you will see results in 4 weeks. It was a waste of money</li>
            <li> It is good for minor wrinkles - it is worth to try but if you want something stronger I suggest other brand.  The skin becomes bright, but not awesome.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I had purchased retail for much more money.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Great product. Fast shopping. Was recommended this by a esthi friend, we will see if it works-it has only been 1 month. Suggest 3 before you see results</li>
            <li> It may not have made all the wrinkles disappear but, nothing does. But certainly takes down the puffiness make them less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I am 28 Years old and have worked night shifts for 6 years, Therefore I have dark circles and puffiness. I also am noticing some fine lines under my eyes so I wanted a product that does it all..Talking with a clinique consultant, She assured me that this product was my one stop shop. She sold me by saying it was the same as a lazer treatment and I would see visible changes in just a few days. I was looking for a quick fix so I was super excited to try it. I have been using the product for about a month and sadly I have seen some changes... I HAVE EVEN MORE WRINKLES THEN I DID BEFORE! My eyes are still puffy, my dark circles are still there and I&#x27;m noticing my fine lines are now even deeper. I do have a sensitive eye area, maybe more then most, but it sometimes stings and that worries me. I probably should stop using it. Everybody is differnt with difffernt skin issues but my main concern was getting rid of the dark circles and puffiness and this product did nothing it was promised to do for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product says it will take 12 weeks to see a difference. 12 WEEKS??? and of course one bottle lasts for about 3 or 4. So they want us to buy 4 bottles at 70 bucks a pop before we \\&quot;MIGHT\\&quot; Be satisfied?? come on!</li>
            <li> I received the bottle at the beginning of September and it&#x27;s already empty!!! I didn&#x27;t use it too often or in huge doses, just as recommended in instruction. Any of my creams and serums in this kind of volume haven&#x27;t finished so fast (slightly more than a month) So I make a consequence that the BOTTLE WAS NOT FULL! As they deliver it without package I can assume that this bottle was in use, and was returned or kinda like this. So I&#x27;d recommend  to buy a new bottle from clinique or sephora.</li>
            <li> When this first came out and I purchased a bottle, I liked what it did for my eye area.  It has hyaluronic acid, although it is late on the ingredient list, which suggests there isn&#x27;t much of it in there.  But I too believe it dried parts of my face, and I got MORE wrinkles above my lip, which is what I was trying to address. Since I am profoundly allergic to ANY fragrance of any kind, Clinique is one of the few lines I can use and probably the best quality of all the truly hypo-allergenic products available.  I agree that Turnaround is better, and I too miss the real Anti-Gravity line.  The Laser Focus is somewhat effective on my neck, around my eyes and on my forehead, but I try to avoid using it anywhere in between.  It doesn&#x27;t help the slight sag I&#x27;m getting on my jowls.  I think this is a good product for maintaining good skin but I don&#x27;t think it addresses all that much that another product, particularly Retin-A, couldn&#x27;t. And I&#x27;m sorry to say that since, on the whole, I love Clinique, have been using it for 30 years, look ten years younger than I am, but find that they discontinue some of their best products and the replacements sometimes aren&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a free sample of this new product for about 4 weeks and yes, it did diminish slight laughter lines around my eyes.  Initially I was quite impressed and even bought a 30ml bottle of it, though not yet started it.  BUT after NOT using the sample for only 2 days, my eyes look puffy, I have bags under my eyes which doesn&#x27;t happen to me, even after a bad night&#x27;s sleep. I had to lie down this morning with a cold flannel over my eyes to get rid of the puffiness.  Other reviewers have noted the same thing, please see reviews on Amazon.com (staff at a Clinique counter would tell you it&#x27;s not an issue, sadly they don&#x27;t know what they are talking about in the case of this product). I&#x27;ve used other Clinique products for years and very happy with them (e.g. Clinique repairwear eye cream and Turnaround Concentrate are very nice), and I&#x27;ve used other serums (e.g. Ultima Swiss Hyaluronic Serum), but this Clinique serum is a no go, my full 30ml bottle is going back to the shop today.  Please don&#x27;t buy this product, or even try a sample, unless you intend to keep on buying it and using it every day for the rest of your life!</li>
            <li> I would give the product 4 1/2 stars but you can&#x27;t do a half star. I just started using this product a week and I see a difference. I am 54 years old and have a few lines here and there but mostly smile lines around the eyes. I Don&#x27;t do Botox but would like to keep a youthful appearance and this really does work. My lines are not as noticeable. My skin seems more radiant. I do look younger than my age and would like to keep it that way.  It works and it is the most affordable product out there compared to the other Skin Care Lines that are also sold in the Better Department Stores. If I were to spend more money on a serum I feel it should be on a product from a dermatoligist&#x27;s office and not from another cosmetic company. I have been using Clinique products for a few years now and they are great for sensitive skin and do not use a lot of fragrance&#x27;s in their products.</li>
            <li> seems to take the texture of my skin back decades---maybe different for each--I have delicate skin --and not everything does anything--</li>
            <li> I got one of those 5 oz samples. I used it only on 1 side of my face, I&#x27;m at about 8 wks now (lasts longer for me for some reason). It took at least 4 wks to notice, but the side treated has noticeably smaller pores &amp; reduced lines. Frankly, it&#x27;s the first Clinique skin product I&#x27;ve tried that works. I&#x27;m 57. I will be buying this.</li>
            <li> Love this product...expensive, but it does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> I used this product for two months faithfully twice a day.  I did not see any improvement at all.  I have tried many products and most work good at plumping up your skin, but this is the worse of the bunch.  You&#x27;d be better off buying the cheapest product at CVS.</li>
            <li> I am 42 years old and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles for my age, but living in the arid high desert plains I am trying to take better care of my skin. I had heard the dramatic claims for Repairwear and how it gets results comparable to expensive laser procedures and thought that with such a bold statement of remarkable results there might be a chance to see some actual positive changes in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and at about the fourteen day mark I had noticeable differences in my skin; the texture was improved somewhat but the *real* difference was the fine lines near my eyes were definitely softened and less of them. I haven&#x27;t had this kind of result in getting rid of fine lines with any other product. I have tried serums and creams from the famous (and expensive) La Mer on down to drug store brands and I have to say this is the best wrinkle reducing formula I have tried, hands down, not even a close comparison as far as visible results. I am also impressed with how quickly results were seen as it only took about half the time that Clinique claims one would see changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it is NOT a moisturizer and I have to add moisturizer and sunscreen separately to my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is kind of expensive and not every product works the same for every person; department stores accepts returns on this type of thing so if you&#x27;re unsure whether this will work for you, that may be a good place to look first. Also of note, for some reason the product likes to work its way up under the cap and collect at the top of the bottle so close tightly to avoid waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this purchase and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Used the product once so far but love the feel of my skin already.  Will give this product a month to see if there are any results as promised</li>
            <li> My mom have been using this product for years. It was my fist time to buy this product online, but it was much diluted when compared to all the same products I bought in the retail store.  There are some products cheap and good online but the clinique sold by this link was not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly suggest you buy skin care products in the retail store.</li>
            <li> Once you get past the poorly designed packaging that forces you to perform a ridiculous application method, and the opaque bottle that does not allow you to see how much you have left, the product inside works well to reduce fine lines and wrinkles.  You need to keep using it though, so be prepared to make a committment.</li>
            <li> The product is great, works well.  This is why I give it two stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What they fail to tell you is what happens when you stop using the product - I received a sneak preview of what my face is going to look like in a number of years. The light crows feet grew worse than when I first started using the product, and my eyes looked sunken because of the creases around my \\&quot;bags.\\&quot;  I am 36, if this helps the reader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has since rebounded, but I would have been better off not going through the whole exercise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, but buyer beware - you very well might not like what happens when you discontinue use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this COMBINED with the repairwear uplifting cream which I apply nightly.  My review is based on these products combined.  I use the serum morning and night, and during the day I also apply Clinique Youth Surge (a sunscreen).  I had been one of those people who had pretty good skin without trying.  I hardly even took off my makeup at night.... yikes, I know, I KNOW!  Bad girl.  My best girlfriend has the best skin I&#x27;ve ever seen at 39 years old so I decided to adopt her routine and I have to say WOW.  My skin has never looked better in my life, and I am 32 years old.  It&#x27;s tighter, firmer, brighter, more even, and fine under my eyes (the only place I had them) are severely diminished after a few months of a diligent routine.  Use this in combination with a couple other things and you WILL see results!  I am over the moon happy with mine!</li>

I arrive before the scheduled date, excellent prioducto. very good, good, good.</li>
            <li> It does nothing but make your skin horrible. Save your money. Expensive and does not work. I have read other bad reviews and some good ones so I figured I would try it. Trust me its a waste of money</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product after using it for one week not only did I notice an improvement but so did my friends and family.</li>
            <li> It a really good product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Isn&#x27;t terribly expensive and works wonders on my face..  My lines are less visible and the few brown spots I have are fading.  I use it on the top of my hands too because that is the main place for brown spots to appear.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and notice my skin is getting better.  I love using this and it is so refreshing.</li>
            <li> It works, I defently recomended I saw results faster than what it says no more line expressions under my eyes...fresh,young looking!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for almost a year. I have been pleased with the results it has given my face. It lasts a long time so the price is easier to live with. I will definitely keep using it in the future.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a friend in October and this was my second bottle of this size.  Have had several compliments on my 70 year old sun-damaged skin since using it twice per day.  Amazon is better value that duty-free at the airports.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any difference after using this product for two weeks, but I am going to keep using the product until it is gone.</li>
            <li> I first used this when I got a free sample from Clinique at the mall.  I like the way it makes my face feel and I can see a difference in the brightness of my skin.  I have extremely sensitive skin and this hasn&#x27;t bothered me.  It does feel a little tingly when I put it on but it hasn&#x27;t made my face break out or turn red like other products I have used.  Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I am an  allergic woman and use Clinique since many years ago. So, I prefer all its products.I recommend them .</li>
            <li> Not quite sure how well it works on wrinkles but makes my skin looking smoother. Overall will recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product from Macy&#x27;s in the past. The consistency was different &amp; this product had an odor like it was old &amp; expired. I had to throw it out. I would not order again from here</li>
            <li> A month prior to ordering this product I scheduled a lazer treatment. While using Hulu Plus, the ad for this product came on all the time. At first I paid no attention to it. Then I came on here and read reviews, ordered it and without exaggeration, saw results in a week!  I am so impressed with the results that I cancelled my appointment and saved $300!! Over the years I have purchased hundreds if not thousands of dollars worth of &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; creams, lotions and potions. I cannot believe that I can now stop searching and wasting money. I found magic in a bottle!</li>
            <li> Good product, packaging was just so,so!</li>
            <li> love it but is time to change it, I m 35, i have beautiful skin, I used 3 bottles and my skin looks nice but lately i notice new lines on my face, maybe is time for me to get something to target lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> This product goes on smooth and absorbs into the skin very quickly.  A plus, for sure.  However, I did not notice any reduction to fine lines or fading of dark skin patches.  Not sure if I would spend the money on it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note, the seller was super quick to deliver and that was appreciated!  I would recommend the seller.</li>
            <li> I like everything about this product. I feel my skin looks more even, a little tighter, and my eyes aren&#x27;t as puffy in the morning as they used to be.  If you have oily skin, just use this day and night but if your skin is dry, use this on your skin, wait for 5-10 minutes to dry/soak in, then put on moisturizer before you go to bed.  :-)</li>
            <li> User states that it is just another product billed as such with common results.  Never purchased another bottle after first.  Also expensive for ?</li>
            <li> I love Clinique products anyway, but I do actually see visible results from this!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this and was so disappointed.  I have always taken care of my skin so didn&#x27;t have a lot of deep lines or wrinkles. I put on as directed and my skin became red and blotchy.  My lips became very chapped and was using chap stick 24/7.  My wrinkles appeared more pronounced.  I went back to my usual routine, using hydraulic acid and a good rich  moisturer and my face is back to normal.  Won&#x27;t use this again.  I understand this has a lot of silicone and don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price or results.</li>
            <li> It seems totally counter-intuitive, but I would absolutely swear that this product is making the super-fine lines around my eyes worse. I am only 29, but am starting to have a fine netting of lines around my eyes. I got a product sample on a Wednesday, and I would swear that after 2 days of applying it, it has made the dark circles under my eyes more prominent, the skin appear even finer and more translucent, I can see a vein where I couldn&#x27;t before! And the lines I would swear are deeper.  The same for the smile lines around my mouth - they seem to be deeper as well, what the heck?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very freaked out and disappointed, as my friend raved about it, it worked for her. But everyone&#x27;s skin and body reacts differently to products. I think after reading the review of the 28 year old who had a similar reaction, I will be smart and simply discontinue use. I hope that my skin snaps back to normal, Yikes!&lt;br /&gt;Used the product a total of 8 times over 4 days - going to discontinue due to adverse reaction.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT,,,FAST DELIVERY,,THANX</li>
            <li> buen producto originales saludos, recomiendo a este vendedor y el tiempo de entrga fue el esperado Good  Good  Good  Good</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I had expected and arrived within a few days of ordering it. I plan on ordering again at a later date.</li>
            <li> Excellent product fast delivery works well.</li>
            <li> I decided to for this product.  I&#x27;m 60 years old, and my days of expecting a product to come along that&#x27;s going to take 10 years off me are long gone.  I&#x27;m realistic enough to know that sun damage and aging can&#x27;t be removed, except by surgery.  That said, I was surprised by this product.  I used Clinique years ago, but as I aged, I moved on to skin care products for \\&quot;mature\\&quot; skin (what they mean is wrinkled). But, I got the sample of this serum and used it, and within a few days I knew something was going on.  I can&#x27;t exactly explain it.  My skin just looked better.  Softer, somehow.  Anyway, I used the first 2 week sample and got the next 2 week sample, and by the end of the 4 weeks I was hooked!  Did it remove my wrinkles and age spots?  No.  Did I suddenly look 40 again?  Of course not.  But, I think some of the fine lines have softened and some of the spots are lighter. But, the big difference is in the texture.  My skin is smoother.  Some places by my nose where the skin was just a little bit reddened and sort of rough looking are much less noticeable.  If I get a little red spot, it disappears overnight with this serum.  The skin under my eyes looks better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, there&#x27;s no huge, dramatic difference.  As I say, I&#x27;m way past the age where I expect a big change to come from a bottle of anything.  But, still, my skin is improved.  Maybe it&#x27;s all in my head...if so, so what?  I feel better and I think I look better.  So, I&#x27;ll keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  I started using Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion again after about 30 years, and I love it.  It must work in conjunction with the serum, because since I use both, I&#x27;m very pleased with my skin.</li>
