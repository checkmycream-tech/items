            <li>It is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>If you want a really great quality makeup bag, spend more money to get a real TB bag, yes they are pricey, but I just bought one of her totes</li>
            <li>I wanted a stylish and affordable make-up case.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more for friends and family.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better in person.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad I have both sizes for me.</li>
            <li>i love this make up purse</li>
            <li>It also has a cute Tory Burch-like pattern in its interior.</li>
            <li>and I thought it would take many weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li>but I am ok with that.</li>
            <li>Love this purse, have tori burch ella tote</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!!</li>
            <li>They are perfect, fold very flat and you can put a lot of stuff in them.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this cosmetic bag!</li>
            <li>and I loved them so much I bought 10 more and giving them as Christmas presents.  </li>
            <li>I bought a bag in every color and could fit the most into this one.</li>
            <li>Looks nice and it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li>I just wanted to write a review because I have ordered many of these little makeup bags and all of mine have been in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to buy a knockoff that looks real.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>What wasn&#x27;t fine for me was the quality otherwise.</li>
            <li>(16 days to be exact) :) It looks even better in person than in the picture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect little gift for someone.</li>
            <li>It is also cheap.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m about to fit my makeup as well as my VS  body spray and lotion.</li>
            <li>The gold hardware on both pouches are shiny, but also don&#x27;t look too cheap.</li>
            <li>Very cute little makeup bag, love it!</li>
            <li>The design most resembles a large rectangular pencil case.</li>
            <li>This product is very convenient and super stylish but the zipper is a total fail,&lt;br /&gt;have to grease it up with a bit of oil and your good to go.</li>
            <li>The bag was about the length of my hand do its perfect for a travel makeup bag or a small clutch for a night on the town!</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>in this pouch and the bright coral color makes it easy to find in my black purse.</li>
            <li>It would make a great gift as long as the person is not expecting it to be the real thing.  </li>
            <li>This product seems to be pretty good quality... especially for the price!  </li>
            <li>Arrived on schedule and is exactly like the picture!</li>
            <li>Great to carry makeup in your purse or as a little wristlet/clutch.</li>
            <li>and it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth it</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, too!</li>
            <li>the piece that holds the zipper broke right off.</li>
            <li>Great designer look a like for less but also very practical.</li>
            <li>It holds so much makeup, so it is super convenient.</li>
            <li>I have found different uses for each bag, and I&#x27;m happy I got two different ones.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping</li>
            <li>I plan to order more of them in different colors.  </li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m online ordering several more for my friends and family.</li>
            <li>this bag look similar to authentic bag.</li>
            <li>i use it for my makeup and it holds everything pretty well.</li>
            <li>I want more, when will these be back in stock???!!&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!  </li>
            <li>I think I will order more in different colors!!</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like Tory Burch and has a nylon outer material.</li>
            <li>The coral color combined with the gold hardware is really really pretty.</li>
            <li>Both pouches feel pretty durable though.</li>
            <li>I had no plans on buying anything like this at first but for the price</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s tiny and so adorable it fits my makeup</li>
            <li>This makeup bag is small, but a good size.</li>
            <li>this bag looks super classy.  </li>
            <li>The so called TB bag is not of very high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rated this product high because the quality and product are exactly what the vendor described.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not zip very well nor is it lined inside.</li>
            <li>I really like the look and size of it.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to add that these are very roomy</li>
            <li>It shipped fast from China</li>
            <li>I really thought I would like this bag.</li>
            <li>This is a roomy bag, it was made well, and a very sturdy bag.</li>
            <li>and this looks like the real thing and</li>
            <li>Both pouches may look like the real TB from afar, but upon close inspection, they are not even close to being the real thing.</li>
            <li>The real TB?</li>
            <li>The gold hardware on the front makes it really look like a tory burch bag.</li>
            <li>so I still wouldn&#x27;t be out to much money.</li>
            <li>It rips easily and not even worth the little amount this is priced at.</li>
            <li>With that said, I am completely happy with what I received, and here&#x27;s my review for both the pink and the black pouch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered the black and it looks more like a make-up bag than a wristlet</li>
            <li>The material is nice and the one I received is actually a little different in style and was bigger, which was fine with me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great size for your make up and other little gadgets.  </li>
            <li>I would rather them up the quality and pay more than pay so little and get something that is basically disposable.</li>
            <li>The gold charm on the zipper is not as shiny as the large gold coin on the pouch, and it looks a little cheap.</li>
            <li>The bag arrived in a timely manner and was exactly the same as the description.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised by the quality!</li>
            <li>The bag would allow several long powder brushes, lip or eye pencils and compacts comfortably.</li>
            <li>My mom wanted a cheap little makeup bag</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this makeup bag to anyone who wants that \\&quot;Tory Burch\\</li>
            <li>I used it for light makeup, nothing heavy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so surprised at the quality of the textiles used.</li>
            <li>The pouch I received, when opened up completely, is about 7&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The shipping is fast from international shipping standards, and I received both before the estimated arrival time.</li>
            <li>I would definitely order the other colors if this product becomes available again.</li>
            <li>so you can fit tons of makeup, lotions, small hand sanitizers etc.</li>
            <li>The pink one&#x27;s design and size is exactly as pictured and described on amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this little bag!!!</li>
            <li>The black pouch I received definitely looks more &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; and expensive than the pink one just because the quality and the craftmanship is superior than that of the pink one.</li>
            <li>Loved it, however the little strap was broken off when it arrived.</li>
            <li>I was definitely surprised when the pouch came and it opened up really big when some of the reviews mentioned the bag was small, but I actually like it more, especially after I received the pink one.</li>
            <li>and I have a friend who has the same bag in pink except its real</li>
            <li>black one I ordered came first and it looks completely different from what&#x27;s pictured.</li>
            <li>The seams of the bag are not carefully aligned so my pouch is actually quite misshapen.</li>
            <li>The black pouch is made very well.</li>

            <li> I wanted to add that these are very roomy</li>
            <li> It shipped fast from China</li>
            <li> I really thought I would like this bag.</li>
            <li> This is a roomy bag, it was made well, and a very sturdy bag.</li>
            <li> and this looks like the real thing and</li>
            <li> Both pouches may look like the real TB from afar, but upon close inspection, they are not even close to being the real thing.</li>
            <li> The real TB?</li>
            <li> The gold hardware on the front makes it really look like a tory burch bag.</li>
            <li> so I still wouldn&#x27;t be out to much money.</li>
            <li> It rips easily and not even worth the little amount this is priced at.</li>
            <li> With that said, I am completely happy with what I received, and here&#x27;s my review for both the pink and the black pouch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered the black and it looks more like a make-up bag than a wristlet</li>
            <li> The material is nice and the one I received is actually a little different in style and was bigger, which was fine with me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great size for your make up and other little gadgets.  </li>
            <li> I would rather them up the quality and pay more than pay so little and get something that is basically disposable.</li>
            <li> The gold charm on the zipper is not as shiny as the large gold coin on the pouch, and it looks a little cheap.</li>
            <li> The bag arrived in a timely manner and was exactly the same as the description.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised by the quality!</li>
            <li> The bag would allow several long powder brushes, lip or eye pencils and compacts comfortably.</li>
            <li> My mom wanted a cheap little makeup bag</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this makeup bag to anyone who wants that \\&quot;Tory Burch\\</li>
            <li> I used it for light makeup, nothing heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so surprised at the quality of the textiles used.</li>
            <li> The pouch I received, when opened up completely, is about 7&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The shipping is fast from international shipping standards, and I received both before the estimated arrival time.</li>
            <li> I would definitely order the other colors if this product becomes available again.</li>
            <li> so you can fit tons of makeup, lotions, small hand sanitizers etc.</li>
            <li> The pink one&#x27;s design and size is exactly as pictured and described on amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this little bag!!!</li>
            <li> The black pouch I received definitely looks more &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; and expensive than the pink one just because the quality and the craftmanship is superior than that of the pink one.</li>
            <li> Loved it, however the little strap was broken off when it arrived.</li>
            <li> I was definitely surprised when the pouch came and it opened up really big when some of the reviews mentioned the bag was small, but I actually like it more, especially after I received the pink one.</li>
            <li> and I have a friend who has the same bag in pink except its real</li>
            <li> black one I ordered came first and it looks completely different from what&#x27;s pictured.</li>
            <li> The seams of the bag are not carefully aligned so my pouch is actually quite misshapen.</li>
            <li> The black pouch is made very well.</li>
            <li> I can fit all the small loose items I normally throw in my purse (hair ties, small lotion, hair pins, lip glosses, nail file, eye drops, tampons, etc.)</li>
            <li> I got it in the black and when I received it in the mail I was so surprised by the quality of it!</li>
            <li> Small enough to fit in my purse but big enough to put all the little things in like make ups or any other nick nacks you might have loose in your purse.</li>
            <li> It arrived much MUCH earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s called pink, the actual color is coral.</li>
            <li> It was delivered earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The pink one came a week later even though I purchased the black and pink one at the same time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this&#x27;s couple months ago  a long with other colors.</li>
            <li> The little wrist strap that came with both pouches are useless IMO, since it looks cheap and looks like the strap on an umbrella.</li>
            <li> It is obviously not real Tory Burch, so the quality does not come with the bag.</li>
            <li> The inside is a dark grey with the emblem as a pattern.</li>
            <li> The coral one is not nearly as well made as the black one.</li>
            <li> I thought ok for the price if I received it and hated it at least I didn&#x27;t spend very much</li>
            <li> The pink pouch is quite small, about the size of a standard Coach wristlet, except the width is thicker.</li>
            <li> This cosmetic bag (black) is a little bigger than the other colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering ordering other colors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s your average size make-up bag.</li>
            <li> I ordered the black one</li>
            <li> The BLACK pouch I received is NOT what was pictured and described here on amazon.</li>
            <li> I uploaded a picture I found on google of what the black pouch I received looks like.</li>
            <li> and it barely looks like a rip-off.</li>
            <li> the black and the pink pouches are made of this shiny thick nylon material that resembles the longchamp le pliage tote&#x27;s material.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments I should have purchased a few for Xmas</li>
            <li> I use it for my everyday touch up make up.  </li>
            <li> The second I opened the plastic wrapper the bag came in, the zipper was broken.</li>
            <li> The zipper is a little stiff</li>
            <li> For $5.00 this little travel bag is a match made in heaven!</li>
            <li> I love the badge on this but the quality is horrible.</li>
            <li> The zipper on both aren&#x27;t the smoothest, but it&#x27;s by no means difficult to open.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this bag.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who sees it up close will immediately know it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> Plus they look expensive!</li>
            <li> But when I put stuff in it, the bad sewing job isn&#x27;t as noticeable.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was so excited to get this cosmetic bag! It holds so much makeup, so it is super convenient. However, you get what you pay for. It is obviously not real Tory Burch, so the quality does not come with the bag. I unzipped it the moment I bought it and the piece that holds the zipper broke right off. The bag is still usable, but now it has no handle. If you want a really great quality makeup bag, spend more money to get a real TB bag, yes they are pricey, but I just bought one of her totes and it is totally worth it. The stitching Is beautiful and it is super durable!</li>
            <li> This is a really great bag.  The Tory Burch symbol is inside also.  I&#x27;m giving these away for Christmas.  Great Price!!</li>
            <li> The so called TB bag is not of very high quality.&lt;br /&gt;It does not zip very well nor is it lined inside.</li>
            <li> Love it! its clean, arrived quicker than I thought it would and works great. The inside looks good as well and it barely looks like a rip-off.</li>
            <li> I wanted a stylish and affordable make-up case.  This one is both--and it is a knock off.  It is well made (a sturdy zipper and seams).  It is also cheap.  I really like the look and size of it.  I plan to order more of them in different colors.  It would make a great gift as long as the person is not expecting it to be the real thing.  Also, the inside of the bag is very nice.  It has a beautiful design.  The bag is versatile and could be used like a wristlet.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and within a week the zipper broke, and the gold logo on the side started to fade.  If you want a durable cosmetic bag, do not order this</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the bag. It&#x27;s your average size make-up bag. Very pretty. I also like the inside lining. You can even use it as a wristlet.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to write a review because I have ordered many of these little makeup bags and all of mine have been in perfect condition. It&#x27;s nice to be able to buy a knockoff that looks real. I would definitely recommend this makeup bag to anyone who wants that \\&quot;Tory Burch\\&quot; look for a fraction of the price! I wanted to add that these are very roomy so you can fit tons of makeup, lotions, small hand sanitizers etc. in them with no problem. I will be ordering more for friends and family. You really can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> This bag is awesome.  It&#x27;s even better in person.  It shipped fast from China and I loved them so much I bought 10 more and giving them as Christmas presents.  Very nice bag!</li>
            <li> This bag is awesome! It&#x27;s even better in person! The side handle is removeable and the inside pattern is a wonderful touch! Very happy with this!</li>
            <li> I bought three of these for gifts and kept one for myself. They are perfect, fold very flat and you can put a lot of stuff in them. Plus they look expensive! Every time I take mine out of my bag everyone looks at it and comments on it.  I&#x27;m online ordering several more for my friends and family. It&#x27;s a perfect little gift for someone.</li>
            <li> Small enough to fit in my purse but big enough to put all the little things in like make ups or any other nick nacks you might have loose in your purse.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be pretty good quality... especially for the price!  The zipper is a little stiff but I think that will loosen up with time.</li>
            <li> This product is very convenient and super stylish but the zipper is a total fail,&lt;br /&gt;have to grease it up with a bit of oil and your good to go.</li>
            <li> I really thought I would like this bag. It&#x27;s a great size for your make up and other little gadgets.  I used it for light makeup, nothing heavy.  After just 2 weeks, the zipper broke into several pieces!  Not happy with this bag.  I told my friends not to order it.  In this case you do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> this bag look similar to authentic bag. I love it and I&#x27;m about to fit my makeup as well as my VS  body spray and lotion.</li>
            <li> Good size but I did want the smaller one for my sister.  But I&#x27;m glad I have both sizes for me.</li>
            <li> The bag arrived in a timely manner and was exactly the same as the description. Loved it, however the little strap was broken off when it arrived.</li>
            <li> i love this make up purse its so amazing. however the zipper should have been different. It matched my pocket book</li>
            <li> this case is so cute! i love it! i use it for my makeup and it holds everything pretty well.</li>
            <li> Very nice makeup bag perfect fit for my purse and I&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments I should have purchased a few for Xmas I think I may do so</li>
            <li> It is very cheaply made. Anyone who sees it up close will immediately know it&#x27;s fake. That&#x27;s fine. What wasn&#x27;t fine for me was the quality otherwise. The zipper broke immediately. I would rather them up the quality and pay more than pay so little and get something that is basically disposable.</li>
            <li> This has been one of my favorites.  This is a roomy bag, it was made well, and a very sturdy bag.</li>
            <li> This adorable cosmetic bag is durable, roomy, and gorgeous - it goes with everything, and fits all my makeup and odds-and-ends. Super fast shipping, too!</li>
            <li> Arrived on schedule and is exactly like the picture! Very cute little makeup bag, love it! For five bucks it was a great deal and I may order more for my friends :-)</li>
            <li> I rated this product high because the quality and product are exactly what the vendor described. This a must!! Especially if you are obssessed with Inspired TB.</li>
            <li> The bag was about the length of my hand do its perfect for a travel makeup bag or a small clutch for a night on the town! Absolutely worth it</li>
            <li> This is a perfect size for my makeup.  It is well made a looks like a more expensive case than it is.  I feel proud to pull it out of my handbag.</li>
            <li> So happy with the bag!! It arrived much MUCH earlier than I expected. (16 days to be exact) :) It looks even better in person than in the picture. I ordered the black one and I have a friend who has the same bag in pink except its real, you cannot tell the difference in the 2 besides the color!</li>
            <li> This cosmetic bag (black) is a little bigger than the other colors. I bought a bag in every color and could fit the most into this one. Great designer look a like for less but also very practical. My bag looks just like what is shown in the pictures.</li>
            <li> This makeup bag is small, but a good size. I was really surprised by the quality! I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so well made. It also has a cute Tory Burch-like pattern in its interior. I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I love these bags I bought two !!! And decided to keep both !! A great size and excellent quality.</li>
            <li> I hesitated ordering this bag since it would be coming from Hong Kong and I thought it would take many weeks to arrive. The estimated shipping arrival was Tuesday April 23, 2013 - Thursday May 9, 2013 and I had placed the order March 28th. It arrived April 17th! I&#x27;m so surprised at the quality of the textiles used. The medallion has good weight, the zipper has the logo as well, the sewing is done well and the lining has the replica logo. I ordered the black and it looks more like a make-up bag than a wristlet but I am ok with that. The bag would allow several long powder brushes, lip or eye pencils and compacts comfortably. Overall I would say this replica bag gets a B+ to A- so it&#x27;s well worth the wait considering it&#x27;s a steal. I would definitely order the other colors if this product becomes available again.</li>
            <li> this bag looks super classy.  I&#x27;ve gotten compliments about it every time I pull it out of my purse.  I use it for my everyday touch up make up.  The material is really nice.  Will be getting others in different color for xmas gifts.</li>
            <li> I love this little bag!!! I want more, when will these be back in stock???!!&lt;br /&gt;Fast service, easy to deal with!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, very classy and quality looking!  Thank you so much!  I think I will order more in different colors!!</li>
            <li> I love the badge on this but the quality is horrible. It rips easily and not even worth the little amount this is priced at. Such a shame!</li>
            <li> Love this purse, have tori burch ella tote and it matches the nylon handbag perfectly. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My mom wanted a cheap little makeup bag and I got her this and it&#x27;s great . Looks nice and it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and this looks like the real thing and the quality is REALLY good and it looks authentic! I was not disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Amazingly great quality for the price. I&#x27;m considering ordering other colors. Item came a week early than as expected. Great to carry makeup in your purse or as a little wristlet/clutch. The interior has a nice TB lining throughout.</li>
            <li> For $5.00 this little travel bag is a match made in heaven! Looks exactly like Tory Burch and has a nylon outer material. The inside is a dark grey with the emblem as a pattern. Compared to cosmetic bags at Target, Walmart, etc. This is just as good and cheaper!</li>
            <li> The BLACK pouch I received is NOT what was pictured and described here on amazon. With that said, I am completely happy with what I received, and here&#x27;s my review for both the pink and the black pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The black one I ordered came first and it looks completely different from what&#x27;s pictured. The pouch I received was much larger in dimension, and the design of the pouch was different too. The design most resembles a large rectangular pencil case.The pouch I received, when opened up completely, is about 7&amp;#34; x 4&amp;#34; x 4&amp;#34;, and big enough for all my makeup. This pouch is definitely too big to be a wristlet or clutch and can only be used as a cosmetic case or toiletry pouch when traveling. I uploaded a picture I found on google of what the black pouch I received looks like. I was definitely surprised when the pouch came and it opened up really big when some of the reviews mentioned the bag was small, but I actually like it more, especially after I received the pink one. The black pouch is made very well. All the seams are evenly sewn, and even the inner patterned lining have the patterns lined up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pink one came a week later even though I purchased the black and pink one at the same time. I guess they ship each color separately. The pink one&#x27;s design and size is exactly as pictured and described on amazon. Even though it&#x27;s called pink, the actual color is coral. The coral color combined with the gold hardware is really really pretty. The coral one is not nearly as well made as the black one. The seams of the bag are not carefully aligned so my pouch is actually quite misshapen. But when I put stuff in it, the bad sewing job isn&#x27;t as noticeable. The pink pouch is quite small, about the size of a standard Coach wristlet, except the width is thicker. I can fit all the small loose items I normally throw in my purse (hair ties, small lotion, hair pins, lip glosses, nail file, eye drops, tampons, etc.) in this pouch and the bright coral color makes it easy to find in my black purse. Having this pouch actually makes switching purses easier since I don&#x27;t have to dig to find everything I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the black and the pink pouches are made of this shiny thick nylon material that resembles the longchamp le pliage tote&#x27;s material. Both the pouches are lined with a taupe brown and beige TB-esque pattern. The gold hardware on both pouches are shiny, but also don&#x27;t look too cheap. The zipper on both aren&#x27;t the smoothest, but it&#x27;s by no means difficult to open. The gold charm on the zipper is not as shiny as the large gold coin on the pouch, and it looks a little cheap. The black pouch I received definitely looks more &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; and expensive than the pink one just because the quality and the craftmanship is superior than that of the pink one. Both pouches feel pretty durable though. The little wrist strap that came with both pouches are useless IMO, since it looks cheap and looks like the strap on an umbrella. I have found different uses for each bag, and I&#x27;m happy I got two different ones. The shipping is fast from international shipping standards, and I received both before the estimated arrival time. Both pouches may look like the real TB from afar, but upon close inspection, they are not even close to being the real thing. But for under $6 a pouch and made in Hong Kong, what do you expect? The real TB?</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! I had no plans on buying anything like this at first but for the price I couldn&#x27;t say no. I got it in the black and when I received it in the mail I was so surprised by the quality of it! Its the perfect size and I use it as a makeup bag. The gold hardware on the front makes it really look like a tory burch bag. The inside has a really nice interior that also has the tory burch logo stamped. Along with that the zipper also is a logo!! Definitely looks a lot more expensive than it actually is! I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice knock off product. It was delivered earlier than expected. The material is nice and the one I received is actually a little different in style and was bigger, which was fine with me. It&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li> The second I opened the plastic wrapper the bag came in, the zipper was broken. It was not in good quality.</li>
            <li> I ordered this&#x27;s couple months ago  a long with other colors. I thought ok for the price if I received it and hated it at least I didn&#x27;t spend very much &amp; I could just donate them or give them away as gifts, and especially I don&#x27;t like to return things and order things overseas so I still wouldn&#x27;t be out to much money. I received it on time and to my surprise it was great quality inside and out it&#x27;s tiny and so adorable it fits my makeup and I carry it in my tote bag. I gave obe to my mother and she loves it. I totally would recommend this item to everyone.</li>
