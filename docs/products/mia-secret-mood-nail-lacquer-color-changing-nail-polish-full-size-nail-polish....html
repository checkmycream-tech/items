            <li>Nice colors</li>
            <li>but it just kind of looks funky on and wont stay on.</li>
            <li>Nice polish</li>
            <li>I own all types of polish , even manicured gel polish at the salon</li>
            <li>so you would def need a good top coat.</li>
            <li>Nice polish</li>
            <li>It takes many coats to get a good color and after a while it comes off.</li>
            <li>These came in nice colors</li>
            <li>My grand daughter calls it my magic polish lol so cute.</li>

            <li>I love this finger nail polish it made my nail lokk nice on love mood colors it really enjoyable in yes this nice product to have in enjoy</li>
            <li>My wife love it, it is funny when they change color with temperature, nice idea, good product.</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s a consequence of the polish being able to change color, or maybe it&#x27;s the fact that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I wish I could give a better review for the odea</li>
            <li>Nail Polish is ok.</li>
            <li>I think of a mood ring this is more like magic nail polish</li>
            <li>I thought the quality would have been better.</li>
            <li>MY GIRLS LOVE THIS</li>
            <li>For the most part, all but one color didn&#x27;t change.</li>

            <li>the nail polish doesn&#x27;t stay on more then 15 minutes tried more coats then tried top coat and then just gave up.</li>
            <li>it seems when I add top coat</li>
            <li>no matter how many coats you put on.</li>
            <li>I Should have read more reviews before I bought this.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>and I love how it changes in color at any point</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and yes you are going to need a top coat  on nail polish</li>
            <li>And it did change colors was top coat for me</li>
            <li>Color is not changing in most of them and will not stay on.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors are more reactive, it seems.</li>
            <li>Nice color, and the purple changes into a perfect bubble gum pink.</li>
            <li>Someone else said this is better for kids</li>
            <li>I love that.</li>

            <li>I LOVE MY POLISH</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, some of the colors don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I also put a shellac top coat over it and it stayed on for two to three weeks.</li>
            <li>Love the color changing.</li>
            <li>Love it, i am happy with my purchase, fast delivery</li>
            <li>It did most of its changing in the bottle.</li>
            <li>We have use the nail polish and we love it.  </li>
            <li>I love nail polish</li>
            <li>As many have stated before, these polishes just don&#x27;t hold up.</li>
            <li>But do not expect to make it more than a day or two without a chip</li>
            <li>Skip this - it doesn&#x27;t stay on for more than a day even with a top coat.</li>
            <li>Polish was cheap!</li>
            <li>I thought they would be much better than they were.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>and I put a top coat on.</li>
            <li>Do not recommend, this polish is chalky more like matte</li>
            <li>and they show up better.</li>
            <li>I love the way the polish changes color based on the temperature.</li>
            <li>2 coats is ok.</li>
            <li>But also you do better with a lot of polish on the brush</li>
            <li>I love this polish.</li>
            <li>love the colors....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>, so you have to use many layers</li>
            <li>I love It</li>
            <li>Love the colors.</li>
            <li>Tried a top coat and bottom coat and still chipped.</li>
            <li>Dries with a matte finish  needs a Google glossy top coat</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Could not wait to get it on my nails and watch the magic.  </li>
            <li>Really cute....</li>
            <li>I love the color change, but all the polishes chipped within hours.</li>
            <li>Even with a top coat.</li>
            <li>Cute Colors</li>
            <li>but that is ok.</li>
            <li>if there was more colors.&lt;br /&gt;Product got here in a timely manor.</li>
            <li>Love the colores thanck you</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get this product.</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t really complain about the polish chipping, just make sure you have a good top coat.</li>
            <li>And chip off pretty easy even with a good top coat.</li>
            <li>They also chip easily if you don&#x27;t put a top coat on.</li>
            <li>Good quality and fast shipping love this seller</li>
            <li>and it is amazing and exciting to watch it change.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend painting a light, opaque color onto your nails before applying 2-3 coats of this mood polish on top to get good/even coverage.</li>
            <li>Chips easily, but other then that, this is great stuff!!</li>
            <li>Wish it wouldn&#x27;t peel off as easily</li>
            <li>chips easily</li>
            <li>we could try, dries on like a chalk and scrapes off easily.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t change color easily and started chipping within hours</li>
            <li>They also chipped really easily probably because you need 3+ layers of nail polish</li>
            <li>Polish chipped easily.</li>
            <li>But it dries to a chalky finish and chips extremely easily.</li>
            <li>This polish is best for little kids.</li>
            <li>I have used mood polish in the past and it was beautiful and amazing..</li>
            <li>The way they apply smooth and evenly.</li>
            <li>I like the green the best!</li>
            <li>I understand that they are cheap</li>
            <li>Wish all internet dealings went as smooth.</li>
            <li>It looks kind of chalky when its on and doesnt go on very even.</li>
            <li>Enjoy, I did.</li>
            <li>Good price for 6 nail polishes since I was buying them for a 3 year old, but they don&#x27;t change color.</li>
            <li>Six year old loved it though.</li>
            <li>This polish really does chip no matter how many top coats you do.</li>
            <li>I like the blue and orange the best, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>More like a runny plastic and peels right off.  </li>
            <li>I love these wear them every day even though they chip off right away</li>
            <li>But if you are looking for the right product, you may want to spend a bit more.</li>
            <li>Very fun</li>
            <li>These polishes were nice, but you have to apply about 4 coats to achieve an even vibrant color.</li>
            <li>These are super cute and fun to use.</li>
            <li>Was excited to get this</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this product until I got it and realized it has a matte finish</li>
            <li>The other three were awesome and look pretty.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I received my mood polish.  </li>
            <li>But once I top coated it with a clear glittery color polish I get so many compliments</li>
            <li>My husband bought this for our daughter and she was super excited.</li>
            <li>, I loved the colors, specially the blue one.</li>
            <li>It dries very matte so a top coat is required unless you like the matte look.</li>
            <li>Being a lacquer, they will also float on water to make really cool designs that change colors.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite is the fast drying top coat I used.</li>
            <li>so that was cool.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cool to see.</li>
            <li>There was a problem with the shipment but the seller fixed it, was really nice to me, always polite and trying to figure out why i didnt got the package in time...</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price though.</li>
            <li>So if you are looking to try it out, its not bad of a price.</li>
            <li>This polish dries to a matte finish and will easily chip if you don&#x27;t finish with a clear top coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is pretty cool!</li>
            <li>But, all in all this is a product that is true to its description and it is worthy of purchase.</li>
            <li>So far I have only tried 2 of these colors, one worked perfectly and was gorgeous while the other never changed from its original polished color.</li>
            <li>Have tried other brands that work great.</li>
            <li>My kids&#x27; love this polish, but it chips off more than regular nail polish.</li>
            <li>The mood color polish dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I am overall happy with this, they came in quick and all except one really do change.</li>
            <li>The polish changes colors great, but the polish is very thin and takes a lot to get good coverage.</li>
            <li>so it looked more normal</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>Some of the colors are bright, but some look chalky after they dry.</li>
            <li>These are adorable for a young girl who loves the idea of nail polish that changes color!</li>
            <li>Fast accurate and smiles on my daughter&#x27;s face</li>
            <li>I bought this for fun, it&#x27;s supposed to change color when you go from outdoors to indoors.  </li>
            <li>but they are really fun colors.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s so much fun that I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, i think it would be good polish for a kid or young adult since it comes off so easity.  </li>
            <li>polish is considerably brittle, so a top coat is practically mandatory.</li>
            <li>tht is even putting a clear coat over the top</li>
            <li>Pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I rarely write a review, but I felt so ripped off with this purchase,</li>
            <li>I really like the natural ombr&amp;eacute; effect that happens when your nail beds are warm and air around the tips of your nails are cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Honestly I had not yet the chance to try it, but Nail saloons here charge $5-10 extra to use a color changing polish</li>
            <li>its on correctly, its pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Especially when you are in between temperatures, you get a nice hombre color</li>
            <li>I love these colors and delivered early.</li>
            <li>it is fun to have on your nails.</li>
            <li>I used two coats and a clear top coat...</li>
            <li>which for me is still pretty cool.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The polish does go on very matte and does not dry to a shine but a good top coat made it shine and last.</li>
            <li>It also chips off right away.</li>
            <li>right away would never buy again</li>
            <li>Cool and fun but needs many coats and a very thick top coat even after that it chips easy.</li>
            <li>all chip VERY easily, you may have to apply multiple layers and they STILL chip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I replied, &amp;#34; I will not pay $18 just for you to paint my nails in the changing nail color polish.&amp;#34; I was really surprised when she accepted mine and actually did a good job on the polish job.  </li>
            <li>product is ok it just takes a few more coats</li>
            <li>One day I love it, the next I am not crazy about it.</li>
            <li>but you have to apply about 4 coats for it to really show up nice enough to see.</li>
            <li>The orange and pink changes phenomenally!</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast which was a plus,  </li>
            <li>they chip very fast.....</li>
            <li>I like them very much</li>
            <li>thank you very much.</li>
            <li>However, they dry fast (which is good considering you usually need 3-4 coats for good coverage).</li>
            <li>I always apply a couple coats of quick dry top coat.</li>
            <li>that would be my first pick.</li>
            <li>I would love to have my money back..</li>
            <li>My daughter has fun with the color changing but it chips too fast.  </li>
            <li>The first was the sherbert color.</li>
            <li>and it didnt change colors until I ran hot water over my nails ..</li>
            <li>They actually do change colors, which I love.</li>
            <li>and I do not recommended to buy to overpriced your better off buying regular nail polish</li>
            <li>Works in hot water too.</li>
            <li>I only tried two coats so maybe if I try more.</li>
            <li>Overall just wasn&#x27;t satisfied with this item at all.</li>
            <li>The color change under hot water and outdoor heat.</li>
            <li>first then the color.</li>
            <li>aside, the ones that DID change were pretty neat.</li>
            <li>They do still change even with multiple top coats.</li>
            <li>doesnt last more than 48hrs.</li>
            <li>Most of them stayed the same color.</li>
            <li>I eventually tried putting a coat of matte polish in a similar color to make it more opaque, which helped).</li>
            <li>Got better QUALITY AT SECOND HAND</li>
            <li>I have only tried the yellow/orange and I love it.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty.</li>
            <li>It does change color under hot water or when your nails/fingers get hot.</li>
            <li>People see you with one color &amp; then you get your nails hot &amp; let them change</li>
            <li>I will tell my sister about it, she is also interested</li>
            <li>Love the idea of changing color nail polish but only lasted a day on my fingernails.</li>
            <li>pink orange and green are the best..</li>
            <li>Dries pretty fast too.</li>
            <li>The polishes that don&#x27;t contain sparkles dry in a matte finish and need a top coat to make it shine.</li>
            <li>The finish was kinda chalky, but a shiny quick dry top coat fixed that.</li>
            <li>The color changes, it really does, but it doesn&#x27;t just chip off, it peels off in large sheets.</li>
            <li>This product works very good on fake nails.  </li>
            <li>This was a fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Very dull/matte finish.</li>
            <li>but when you use it as a enhancer with another color it really didnt matter to me.</li>
            <li>They really do change color</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really change colors</li>
            <li>and I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Again I really want to like this stuff...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It did arrive fast</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it...</li>
            <li>so when I saw the price for 6 bottles I bought it, it came fast and prompt</li>
            <li>I really wish they all work, I was loking foward to the blue/purple one and that is one that didn&#x27;t work.:</li>
            <li>Really doesnt work that well</li>
            <li>it drys fast.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied with product.</li>
            <li>Others not so much.  </li>
            <li>It don&#x27;t really change colors</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t see that they change a whole lot.</li>
            <li>Fast</li>
            <li>This product has been diluted to much.</li>
            <li>Chipping occurs with most polish if YOUR NAILS ARE LONG !!!!</li>
            <li>I love them other than that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried 1 of the 6 polishes but the color never changed from the original color that was polished on</li>
            <li>The blue doesnt really change but the others a cool.</li>
            <li>I used the light purple turn to pink first</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t mind the extra prep and finish work required for a good result with this product because it is a fun color changing polish, you end up with a wide array of colors, and it&#x27;s a solid alternative to the gel mood polish.</li>
            <li>all work best with a white base coat, 2-4 coats of the product and a transparent top coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is such a cool idea.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super fun to watch them go from one to the other.</li>
            <li>sent a new one to me that got here really fast...</li>
            <li>Luckily it didn&#x27;t actually get on the others.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say as I blame them though, it is indeed fun and exciting when a product performs as expected and advertised!</li>
            <li>I didnt like the finish its very chalky looking every with a clear coat.</li>
            <li>The green has become my favorite.</li>
            <li>Pink/Rose is OK but the bllue/ light blue stayed Dark blue.</li>
            <li>colors are different from those displayed....not even worth a one star</li>
            <li>The rest really don&#x27;t change colors, but the blue one is really pretty regardless.</li>
            <li>BUT I will say it doesn’t last long maybe two/three days top before it chips.</li>
            <li>But I haven&#x27;t given up, going to try it a few more times, it is neat.</li>
            <li>This product&#x27;s color shift is more mild than the gels I have used in the past, however I prefer regular polish to gel so that I can change my nail color more often with less damage to my natural nails.</li>
            <li>where I live at they don&#x27;t sell mood change polish...</li>
            <li>It did change colors and i used it on my daughter and it dry fairly quickly</li>
            <li>The green to yellow, pink to peach,and the stars to purple have ALL chipped with the use of a very good base and top coat !!!</li>
            <li>I did try a white coat under them, and that looked a little better, but it still chipped fast.</li>
            <li>All but 2 of the colors did change and the ones that didn&#x27;t change are pretty enough to wear.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay on for to long without chipping but its fun for the day.</li>
            <li>Received two of the exact same colors and it wasn&#x27;t the selection in the pic. ..</li>
            <li>first then you only need one or two coats of mood polish.</li>
            <li>I understand that this is cheap polish, but it should at least stay on your nails for a day or so before it comes off completely; even if it is for kids or just for fun</li>
            <li>It stayed the same color that it was when I first put it on.</li>
            <li>I had my daughter put a white undercoat on first</li>
            <li>Your nail has to be under really hot water for it finally turn color.</li>
            <li>I was so excited for these nail polishes, I&#x27;ve always wanted to try mood nail polishes, but these chip literally 2 seconds after drying, they don&#x27;t even last a day, and the only way they change color is in water, so unless you&#x27;re washing your hands in cold/hot water you don&#x27;t see the difference in color.</li>
            <li>While I enjoyed the color change for the brief time that the polish stayed on my nails, the fact that it came off so fast makes this polish a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li>I fear the one purple that turns to light purple may be a slight dud however.</li>
            <li>This polish chips easily by itself, but it works great on a white base.</li>
            <li>(Its a really dull finish without the top coat).  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it mood changes however its a dull color..</li>
            <li>I used two clear coats &amp; 3 color coats on a foundation coat.</li>
            <li>Color shifting is not as clear as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I almost wanted to put a clear coat over it</li>
            <li>I buffed my nails, put on a clear coat, then put 3 coats of this nail polish on</li>
            <li>Once the clear is applied it brings it together, however it&#x27;s not anything close to the color on the bottle</li>
            <li>EVEN WITH NO CHIP CLEAR NAIL POLISH</li>
            <li>Got it for my 12year old niece</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 14 year old daughter and she loves the color changes.  </li>
            <li>nearly inudistiinguishable on the label</li>
            <li>I wish I had not wasted the money</li>
            <li>some of them have very minimum visual effect &amp; some required hand to be almost at the &amp;#34;freezing&amp;#34; point for the color to change.</li>
            <li>Will stick with professional salons from now on!!!&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>I have tried 3 of the colors so far.</li>
            <li>Tried every color more then once and applied  at least 3 coats.</li>
            <li>I contacted them the very day I received the product because I tried the polish on myself and it didn&#x27;t work, it also chips and peals off the same day you polish your nails.</li>
            <li>I TAKE THE OLD POLISH OFF</li>
            <li>Complete rip off.</li>
            <li>The only personal problem I have is that there are too many pink colors I love the blue and green</li>
            <li>The polish goes on unevenly and requires a second coat for more coverage.</li>
            <li>After letting it dry and putting on two coats of clear polish on top ( then letting those dry), a ran my fingers through my hair, and immediately the polish from 5 nails popped off in one big nail shaped chip....</li>
            <li>Let them dry first.  </li>
            <li>and i love the polish for the price its a steal ,two coats which truly take less than 1 minute to dry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how it works, but when my fingers are warm the nail bed is pink and the tips are purple.</li>
            <li>That said, we found that the polish did not last as long as regular polish, but what fun it was to wear while it did!</li>
            <li>Green,  Orange, and purple are cool.</li>
            <li>The cream coats, pink, green and purple are very cheap looking.</li>
            <li>The warmer the air the more likely the secondary color will appear.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time,  polish works when you only use one coat and chips very easily even with a base coat and top coat or without.</li>
            <li>She had a different brand of blue was really excited to have the other colors.</li>
            <li>The blue and dark purple don&#x27;t really change too much but</li>
            <li>They all dry with a matte finish and take several coats to make a consistent color.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately for me I use my hands a lot at work so the nail polish doesn&#x27;t stay on for very long, but they sure are fun.</li>
            <li>I want my nail polish to last if I am going to put time into putting it on; I know that polish chips after wearing it for several days but this polish had been on my fingers for less than an hour before it came off in one huge chunk, not just chips.  </li>
            <li>The red and blue are the only ones that have a metallic finish, and they change very little, no matter how many coats</li>
            <li>It has a barely noticeable color change.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried one color so far, but it doesn&#x27;t change.  </li>
            <li>(I have only tried one color so far).  </li>
            <li>Only certain one&#x27;s changed and the others go on and dry like children&#x27;s paint .</li>
            <li>Will not be buying and spreading the word on social media to not buy!</li>
            <li>The color is flat and flakes off unless you have a clear coat.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure why this polish is really getting so many negative reviews</li>
            <li>I have to get use to the other colors very opaque though.</li>
            <li>a green a light pink and a purple</li>
            <li>(2 coats was nowhere near enough and even 3 was still a bit sheer-</li>
            <li>But out of all of them the metallic pink has the best base color to it.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li>The others do change with temperature,  but the change is so subtle that it isn&#x27;t very exciting.</li>
            <li>Oddly enough, the color changing effect of polish is really very good, at least on the colors that actually changed, which is roughy half of them; one of the purples had a label that showed it going from the lavender that it was to a very slightly lighter color of pink-</li>
            <li>I would only recommend this if you have long nails or have then professionally done.</li>
            <li>The ones that didn&#x27;t work- redish pink to pink, purpleish blue to light blue, glittery purple to pink.  </li>
            <li>Less than 24 hrs of applying the polish the next day it chipped and some even came off the whole nail.</li>
            <li>This particular product is NOT worth $19.00.</li>
            <li>The pink did change color until a clear coat is applied.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Nice colors</li>
            <li> but it just kind of looks funky on and wont stay on.</li>
            <li> Nice polish</li>
            <li> I own all types of polish , even manicured gel polish at the salon</li>
            <li> so you would def need a good top coat.</li>
            <li> Nice polish</li>
            <li> It takes many coats to get a good color and after a while it comes off.</li>
            <li> These came in nice colors</li>
            <li> My grand daughter calls it my magic polish lol so cute.</li>
            <li> i love it, it is a great product probe all colors and look spectacular, have no complaint, the price is great too</li>

            <li> Very cheap product.</li>
            <li> I love this finger nail polish it made my nail lokk nice on love mood colors it really enjoyable in yes this nice product to have in enjoy</li>
            <li> My wife love it, it is funny when they change color with temperature, nice idea, good product.</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s a consequence of the polish being able to change color, or maybe it&#x27;s the fact that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give a better review for the odea</li>
            <li> Nail Polish is ok.</li>
            <li> I think of a mood ring this is more like magic nail polish</li>
            <li> I thought the quality would have been better.</li>
            <li> MY GIRLS LOVE THIS</li>
            <li> For the most part, all but one color didn&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> I love these polished, the colors.</li>
            <li> Gift recipient was well pleased with the item, she wears it every day.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for my grand-daughter&#x27;s joy in this gift.</li>
            <li> and I love the look!&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li> the nail polish doesn&#x27;t stay on more then 15 minutes tried more coats then tried top coat and then just gave up.</li>
            <li> it seems when I add top coat</li>
            <li> no matter how many coats you put on.</li>
            <li> I Should have read more reviews before I bought this.</li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> and I love how it changes in color at any point</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and yes you are going to need a top coat  on nail polish</li>
            <li> And it did change colors was top coat for me</li>
            <li> Color is not changing in most of them and will not stay on.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors are more reactive, it seems.</li>
            <li> Nice color, and the purple changes into a perfect bubble gum pink.</li>
            <li> Someone else said this is better for kids</li>
            <li> I love that.</li>
            <li> On my toes, the polish stays more so the heated color..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Love my color changer nail polish.</li>
            <li> granddaughter loves it more than me though..</li>
            <li> this will make the color POP so much better</li>
            <li> would love to see more copies to work with.</li>
            <li> will chip so ladies please stop complaining , perfect for the summer after reading these reviews i still ordered the product because everyone&#x27;s different and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t go by what I read</li>
            <li> I LOVE MY POLISH</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, some of the colors don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I also put a shellac top coat over it and it stayed on for two to three weeks.</li>
            <li> Love the color changing.</li>
            <li> Love it, i am happy with my purchase, fast delivery</li>
            <li> It did most of its changing in the bottle.</li>
            <li> We have use the nail polish and we love it.  </li>
            <li> I love nail polish</li>
            <li> As many have stated before, these polishes just don&#x27;t hold up.</li>
            <li> But do not expect to make it more than a day or two without a chip</li>
            <li> Skip this - it doesn&#x27;t stay on for more than a day even with a top coat.</li>
            <li> Polish was cheap!</li>
            <li> I thought they would be much better than they were.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this nail polish.</li>
            <li> and I put a top coat on.</li>
            <li> Do not recommend, this polish is chalky more like matte</li>
            <li> and they show up better.</li>
            <li> I love the way the polish changes color based on the temperature.</li>
            <li> 2 coats is ok.</li>
            <li> But also you do better with a lot of polish on the brush</li>
            <li> I love this polish.</li>
            <li> love the colors....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> , so you have to use many layers</li>
            <li> I love It</li>
            <li> Love the colors.</li>
            <li> Tried a top coat and bottom coat and still chipped.</li>
            <li> Dries with a matte finish  needs a Google glossy top coat</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this nail polish.  </li>
            <li> Could not wait to get it on my nails and watch the magic.  </li>
            <li> Really cute....</li>
            <li> I love the color change, but all the polishes chipped within hours.</li>
            <li> Even with a top coat.</li>
            <li> Cute Colors</li>
            <li> but that is ok.</li>
            <li> if there was more colors.&lt;br /&gt;Product got here in a timely manor.</li>
            <li> Love the colores thanck you</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this product.</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t really complain about the polish chipping, just make sure you have a good top coat.</li>
            <li> And chip off pretty easy even with a good top coat.</li>
            <li> They also chip easily if you don&#x27;t put a top coat on.</li>
            <li> Good quality and fast shipping love this seller</li>
            <li> and it is amazing and exciting to watch it change.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend painting a light, opaque color onto your nails before applying 2-3 coats of this mood polish on top to get good/even coverage.</li>
            <li> Chips easily, but other then that, this is great stuff!!</li>
            <li> Wish it wouldn&#x27;t peel off as easily</li>
            <li> chips easily</li>
            <li> we could try, dries on like a chalk and scrapes off easily.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t change color easily and started chipping within hours</li>
            <li> They also chipped really easily probably because you need 3+ layers of nail polish</li>
            <li> Polish chipped easily.</li>
            <li> But it dries to a chalky finish and chips extremely easily.</li>
            <li> This polish is best for little kids.</li>
            <li> I have used mood polish in the past and it was beautiful and amazing..</li>
            <li> The way they apply smooth and evenly.</li>
            <li> I like the green the best!</li>
            <li> I understand that they are cheap</li>
            <li> Wish all internet dealings went as smooth.</li>
            <li> It looks kind of chalky when its on and doesnt go on very even.</li>
            <li> Enjoy, I did.</li>
            <li> Good price for 6 nail polishes since I was buying them for a 3 year old, but they don&#x27;t change color.</li>
            <li> Six year old loved it though.</li>
            <li> This polish really does chip no matter how many top coats you do.</li>
            <li> I like the blue and orange the best, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> More like a runny plastic and peels right off.  </li>
            <li> I love these wear them every day even though they chip off right away</li>
            <li> But if you are looking for the right product, you may want to spend a bit more.</li>
            <li> Very fun</li>
            <li> These polishes were nice, but you have to apply about 4 coats to achieve an even vibrant color.</li>
            <li> These are super cute and fun to use.</li>
            <li> Was excited to get this</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product until I got it and realized it has a matte finish</li>
            <li> The other three were awesome and look pretty.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received my mood polish.  </li>
            <li> But once I top coated it with a clear glittery color polish I get so many compliments</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for our daughter and she was super excited.</li>
            <li> , I loved the colors, specially the blue one.</li>
            <li> It dries very matte so a top coat is required unless you like the matte look.</li>
            <li> Being a lacquer, they will also float on water to make really cool designs that change colors.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite is the fast drying top coat I used.</li>
            <li> so that was cool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cool to see.</li>
            <li> There was a problem with the shipment but the seller fixed it, was really nice to me, always polite and trying to figure out why i didnt got the package in time...</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price though.</li>
            <li> So if you are looking to try it out, its not bad of a price.</li>
            <li> This polish dries to a matte finish and will easily chip if you don&#x27;t finish with a clear top coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is pretty cool!</li>
            <li> But, all in all this is a product that is true to its description and it is worthy of purchase.</li>
            <li> So far I have only tried 2 of these colors, one worked perfectly and was gorgeous while the other never changed from its original polished color.</li>
            <li> Have tried other brands that work great.</li>
            <li> My kids&#x27; love this polish, but it chips off more than regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> The mood color polish dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I am overall happy with this, they came in quick and all except one really do change.</li>
            <li> The polish changes colors great, but the polish is very thin and takes a lot to get good coverage.</li>
            <li> so it looked more normal</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Some of the colors are bright, but some look chalky after they dry.</li>
            <li> These are adorable for a young girl who loves the idea of nail polish that changes color!</li>
            <li> Fast accurate and smiles on my daughter&#x27;s face</li>
            <li> I bought this for fun, it&#x27;s supposed to change color when you go from outdoors to indoors.  </li>
            <li> but they are really fun colors.</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s so much fun that I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, i think it would be good polish for a kid or young adult since it comes off so easity.  </li>
            <li> polish is considerably brittle, so a top coat is practically mandatory.</li>
            <li> tht is even putting a clear coat over the top</li>
            <li> Pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I rarely write a review, but I felt so ripped off with this purchase,</li>
            <li> I really like the natural ombr&amp;eacute; effect that happens when your nail beds are warm and air around the tips of your nails are cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Honestly I had not yet the chance to try it, but Nail saloons here charge $5-10 extra to use a color changing polish</li>
            <li> its on correctly, its pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Especially when you are in between temperatures, you get a nice hombre color</li>
            <li> I love these colors and delivered early.</li>
            <li> it is fun to have on your nails.</li>
            <li> I used two coats and a clear top coat...</li>
            <li> which for me is still pretty cool.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The polish does go on very matte and does not dry to a shine but a good top coat made it shine and last.</li>
            <li> It also chips off right away.</li>
            <li> right away would never buy again</li>
            <li> Cool and fun but needs many coats and a very thick top coat even after that it chips easy.</li>
            <li> all chip VERY easily, you may have to apply multiple layers and they STILL chip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I replied, &amp;#34; I will not pay $18 just for you to paint my nails in the changing nail color polish.&amp;#34; I was really surprised when she accepted mine and actually did a good job on the polish job.  </li>
            <li> product is ok it just takes a few more coats</li>
            <li> One day I love it, the next I am not crazy about it.</li>
            <li> but you have to apply about 4 coats for it to really show up nice enough to see.</li>
            <li> The orange and pink changes phenomenally!</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast which was a plus,  </li>
            <li> they chip very fast.....</li>
            <li> I like them very much</li>
            <li> thank you very much.</li>
            <li> However, they dry fast (which is good considering you usually need 3-4 coats for good coverage).</li>
            <li> I always apply a couple coats of quick dry top coat.</li>
            <li> that would be my first pick.</li>
            <li> I would love to have my money back..</li>
            <li> My daughter has fun with the color changing but it chips too fast.  </li>
            <li> The first was the sherbert color.</li>
            <li> and it didnt change colors until I ran hot water over my nails ..</li>
            <li> They actually do change colors, which I love.</li>
            <li> and I do not recommended to buy to overpriced your better off buying regular nail polish</li>
            <li> Works in hot water too.</li>
            <li> I only tried two coats so maybe if I try more.</li>
            <li> Overall just wasn&#x27;t satisfied with this item at all.</li>
            <li> The color change under hot water and outdoor heat.</li>
            <li> first then the color.</li>
            <li> aside, the ones that DID change were pretty neat.</li>
            <li> They do still change even with multiple top coats.</li>
            <li> doesnt last more than 48hrs.</li>
            <li> Most of them stayed the same color.</li>
            <li> I eventually tried putting a coat of matte polish in a similar color to make it more opaque, which helped).</li>
            <li> Got better QUALITY AT SECOND HAND</li>
            <li> I have only tried the yellow/orange and I love it.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty.</li>
            <li> It does change color under hot water or when your nails/fingers get hot.</li>
            <li> People see you with one color &amp; then you get your nails hot &amp; let them change</li>
            <li> I will tell my sister about it, she is also interested</li>
            <li> Love the idea of changing color nail polish but only lasted a day on my fingernails.</li>
            <li> pink orange and green are the best..</li>
            <li> Dries pretty fast too.</li>
            <li> The polishes that don&#x27;t contain sparkles dry in a matte finish and need a top coat to make it shine.</li>
            <li> The finish was kinda chalky, but a shiny quick dry top coat fixed that.</li>
            <li> The color changes, it really does, but it doesn&#x27;t just chip off, it peels off in large sheets.</li>
            <li> This product works very good on fake nails.  </li>
            <li> This was a fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Very dull/matte finish.</li>
            <li> but when you use it as a enhancer with another color it really didnt matter to me.</li>
            <li> They really do change color</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really change colors</li>
            <li> and I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Again I really want to like this stuff...</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It did arrive fast</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it...</li>
            <li> so when I saw the price for 6 bottles I bought it, it came fast and prompt</li>
            <li> I really wish they all work, I was loking foward to the blue/purple one and that is one that didn&#x27;t work.:</li>
            <li> Really doesnt work that well</li>
            <li> it drys fast.</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied with product.</li>
            <li> Others not so much.  </li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t really change colors</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t see that they change a whole lot.</li>
            <li> Fast</li>
            <li> This product has been diluted to much.</li>
            <li> Chipping occurs with most polish if YOUR NAILS ARE LONG !!!!</li>
            <li> I love them other than that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried 1 of the 6 polishes but the color never changed from the original color that was polished on</li>
            <li> The blue doesnt really change but the others a cool.</li>
            <li> I used the light purple turn to pink first</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t mind the extra prep and finish work required for a good result with this product because it is a fun color changing polish, you end up with a wide array of colors, and it&#x27;s a solid alternative to the gel mood polish.</li>
            <li> all work best with a white base coat, 2-4 coats of the product and a transparent top coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is such a cool idea.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super fun to watch them go from one to the other.</li>
            <li> sent a new one to me that got here really fast...</li>
            <li> Luckily it didn&#x27;t actually get on the others.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say as I blame them though, it is indeed fun and exciting when a product performs as expected and advertised!</li>
            <li> I didnt like the finish its very chalky looking every with a clear coat.</li>
            <li> The green has become my favorite.</li>
            <li> Pink/Rose is OK but the bllue/ light blue stayed Dark blue.</li>
            <li> colors are different from those displayed....not even worth a one star</li>
            <li> The rest really don&#x27;t change colors, but the blue one is really pretty regardless.</li>
            <li> BUT I will say it doesn’t last long maybe two/three days top before it chips.</li>
            <li> But I haven&#x27;t given up, going to try it a few more times, it is neat.</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s color shift is more mild than the gels I have used in the past, however I prefer regular polish to gel so that I can change my nail color more often with less damage to my natural nails.</li>
            <li> where I live at they don&#x27;t sell mood change polish...</li>
            <li> It did change colors and i used it on my daughter and it dry fairly quickly</li>
            <li> The green to yellow, pink to peach,and the stars to purple have ALL chipped with the use of a very good base and top coat !!!</li>
            <li> I did try a white coat under them, and that looked a little better, but it still chipped fast.</li>
            <li> All but 2 of the colors did change and the ones that didn&#x27;t change are pretty enough to wear.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on for to long without chipping but its fun for the day.</li>
            <li> Received two of the exact same colors and it wasn&#x27;t the selection in the pic. ..</li>
            <li> first then you only need one or two coats of mood polish.</li>
            <li> I understand that this is cheap polish, but it should at least stay on your nails for a day or so before it comes off completely; even if it is for kids or just for fun</li>
            <li> It stayed the same color that it was when I first put it on.</li>
            <li> I had my daughter put a white undercoat on first</li>
            <li> Your nail has to be under really hot water for it finally turn color.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for these nail polishes, I&#x27;ve always wanted to try mood nail polishes, but these chip literally 2 seconds after drying, they don&#x27;t even last a day, and the only way they change color is in water, so unless you&#x27;re washing your hands in cold/hot water you don&#x27;t see the difference in color.</li>
            <li> While I enjoyed the color change for the brief time that the polish stayed on my nails, the fact that it came off so fast makes this polish a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I fear the one purple that turns to light purple may be a slight dud however.</li>
            <li> This polish chips easily by itself, but it works great on a white base.</li>
            <li> (Its a really dull finish without the top coat).  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it mood changes however its a dull color..</li>
            <li> I used two clear coats &amp; 3 color coats on a foundation coat.</li>
            <li> Color shifting is not as clear as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I almost wanted to put a clear coat over it</li>
            <li> I buffed my nails, put on a clear coat, then put 3 coats of this nail polish on</li>
            <li> Once the clear is applied it brings it together, however it&#x27;s not anything close to the color on the bottle</li>
            <li> EVEN WITH NO CHIP CLEAR NAIL POLISH</li>
            <li> Got it for my 12year old niece</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 year old daughter and she loves the color changes.  </li>
            <li> nearly inudistiinguishable on the label</li>
            <li> I wish I had not wasted the money</li>
            <li> some of them have very minimum visual effect &amp; some required hand to be almost at the &amp;#34;freezing&amp;#34; point for the color to change.</li>
            <li> Will stick with professional salons from now on!!!&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> I have tried 3 of the colors so far.</li>
            <li> Tried every color more then once and applied  at least 3 coats.</li>
            <li> I contacted them the very day I received the product because I tried the polish on myself and it didn&#x27;t work, it also chips and peals off the same day you polish your nails.</li>
            <li> I TAKE THE OLD POLISH OFF</li>
            <li> Complete rip off.</li>
            <li> The only personal problem I have is that there are too many pink colors I love the blue and green</li>
            <li> The polish goes on unevenly and requires a second coat for more coverage.</li>
            <li> After letting it dry and putting on two coats of clear polish on top ( then letting those dry), a ran my fingers through my hair, and immediately the polish from 5 nails popped off in one big nail shaped chip....</li>
            <li> Let them dry first.  </li>
            <li> and i love the polish for the price its a steal ,two coats which truly take less than 1 minute to dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it works, but when my fingers are warm the nail bed is pink and the tips are purple.</li>
            <li> That said, we found that the polish did not last as long as regular polish, but what fun it was to wear while it did!</li>
            <li> Green,  Orange, and purple are cool.</li>
            <li> The cream coats, pink, green and purple are very cheap looking.</li>
            <li> The warmer the air the more likely the secondary color will appear.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time,  polish works when you only use one coat and chips very easily even with a base coat and top coat or without.</li>
            <li> She had a different brand of blue was really excited to have the other colors.</li>
            <li> The blue and dark purple don&#x27;t really change too much but</li>
            <li> They all dry with a matte finish and take several coats to make a consistent color.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me I use my hands a lot at work so the nail polish doesn&#x27;t stay on for very long, but they sure are fun.</li>
            <li> I want my nail polish to last if I am going to put time into putting it on; I know that polish chips after wearing it for several days but this polish had been on my fingers for less than an hour before it came off in one huge chunk, not just chips.  </li>
            <li> The red and blue are the only ones that have a metallic finish, and they change very little, no matter how many coats</li>
            <li> It has a barely noticeable color change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried one color so far, but it doesn&#x27;t change.  </li>
            <li> (I have only tried one color so far).  </li>
            <li> Only certain one&#x27;s changed and the others go on and dry like children&#x27;s paint .</li>
            <li> Will not be buying and spreading the word on social media to not buy!</li>
            <li> The color is flat and flakes off unless you have a clear coat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure why this polish is really getting so many negative reviews</li>
            <li> I have to get use to the other colors very opaque though.</li>
            <li> a green a light pink and a purple</li>
            <li> (2 coats was nowhere near enough and even 3 was still a bit sheer-</li>
            <li> But out of all of them the metallic pink has the best base color to it.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li> The others do change with temperature,  but the change is so subtle that it isn&#x27;t very exciting.</li>
            <li> Oddly enough, the color changing effect of polish is really very good, at least on the colors that actually changed, which is roughy half of them; one of the purples had a label that showed it going from the lavender that it was to a very slightly lighter color of pink-</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this if you have long nails or have then professionally done.</li>
            <li> The ones that didn&#x27;t work- redish pink to pink, purpleish blue to light blue, glittery purple to pink.  </li>
            <li> Less than 24 hrs of applying the polish the next day it chipped and some even came off the whole nail.</li>
            <li> This particular product is NOT worth $19.00.</li>
            <li> The pink did change color until a clear coat is applied.  </li>
            <li> They do chip really fast, I do suggest a thick, clear, topcoat on it.</li>
            <li> hate that it chips so easily that you cant even wear it for a full day.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other people got who left bad reviews because my polish works great.</li>
            <li> Although the changing colors is cool the nail polish dries very dull looking.</li>
            <li> But, the next morning I woke up and half of the nails were complete removed of the polish.  </li>
            <li> , colors are flat.  </li>
            <li> I do not like how flat looking it is...</li>
            <li> Just a flat colored primer is all...</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t last very long without chipping.  </li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t bad at all and apply a layer of clear on top</li>
            <li> They enjoyed the fact that their nails changed colors when going outside in the cold.</li>
            <li> If you squeeze your eyes and open them back up the pressure of your eyes being closed would make you think the nail polish changed color.  </li>
            <li> I did apply a base coat and a top coat which helped the color look much nicer.  </li>
            <li> But they dry flat.</li>
            <li> Also, it goes on very clumpy and dull.  </li>
            <li> and she 2 . Was a little thick but not bad</li>
            <li> So after reappling the nail polish, after it dried i put on some clear coat &amp; it helped it from chipping.</li>
            <li> Blue stayed dark blue as well as the others.</li>
            <li> The shipping aspect could improve, it was a long wait</li>
            <li> This is not nail polish it is a waste of money not even my nine year old like it.</li>
            <li> I have only used the purple/pink and it&#x27;s what I expected.</li>
            <li> Blue and Pink did not change color at all.  </li>
            <li> You need to have really long nails to get the &#x27;mood&#x27; effect.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the pink and blue would be noticeable...</li>
            <li> Will see how long it stays on my toes.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors but poor coverage, need several coats .</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical about it working because I have tried nail polish like this in the past not this brand that has not worked.</li>
            <li> The green in particular, it&#x27;s not pretty (almost olive but..not)</li>
            <li> It does change color with hot or cold temperatures mainly when you wash your hands or take a shower .  </li>
            <li> They may only last for a little while</li>
            <li> (other nail polishes last 5 or 6 days in my nails)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One nail polish was dry shipping took awhile</li>
            <li> and they all dry matte.  </li>
            <li> do you don&#x27;t pull off what you already put on or let every coat dry fully &amp;</li>
            <li> I put it on in the middle of the day, and before the day was over, i ended up taking it off because all my nails had big chips missing.  </li>
            <li> am thinking of trying to mix the clear with the color to see if it will bind better to the base coat.  </li>
            <li> the pink is very thick trouble getting the polish on the nail smooth.</li>
            <li> The dark blue &amp; purple don&#x27;t change colour but stay on without bubbling &amp; peeling.</li>
            <li> The onlly one that actually works is the pink and purple one and the yellow and green one.</li>
            <li> so thin you can&#x27;t get enough on to make it look decent.</li>
            <li> These are not high end polishes.</li>
            <li> These do change colors, but they are not high quality.</li>
            <li> and again its only been half a day and its flaking off again.</li>
            <li> Yes it color changed but only slightly</li>
            <li> The amount of money you pay for this nail polish and only half of them work.  </li>
            <li> The metallic pink and blue barely change, or at least not as noticeably as the others.</li>
            <li> When you apply the polish it streaks really bad and doesn&#x27;t cover the entire nail easily.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be like Dol Sol</li>
            <li> The colors never really changed for me no matter what I did.</li>
            <li> I put on Green and almost immediatly it turned yellow</li>
            <li> The colors did not change as expected.</li>
            <li> because then I would have realized that everyone else had the same problem with this crappy polish...plete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I wish I could do a partial refund...</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Its chips to fast and goes on thin.</li>
            <li> Not much of a change and the color is chalky.  </li>
            <li> Ive used with base coat as well as top coat, but the polish constantly chips.</li>
            <li> The green and orange colours change dramatically, while the pink and purple change enough to be noticable.</li>
            <li> The only downside that I have is that the polish chips off (even after applying a base and top coat).</li>
            <li> Need to do some work on the ones that do not change and fix them or lower your price in half because only half of them work.</li>
            <li> then I thought and the time in which it came was a little long</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this nail polish after applying within half an hour its chipping flaking and peeling off total waste of time and money</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this polish solely due to quality purposes.</li>
            <li> Other colors are just not changing like they are supposed to.  </li>
            <li> They chip about easier than other polishes and some colors don&#x27;t change as advertised.  </li>
            <li> but the other 4 worked as expected!</li>
            <li> I tried about four of the colors, then put them away for touch ups on other projects.</li>
            <li> but the other 4 work well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like any other mood polish.</li>
            <li> the other side</li>
            <li> I thought it would be glossy; not worh the $25 spent on this nail polish, the color change is very small can barely notice.</li>
            <li> However once your eyes focused you will see that it is the same DULL, NON CHANGING MOOD NAIL POLISH.  </li>
            <li> teh blue does not change as shown it only changes to blue versus the royal blue when cold, it is hard to notice</li>
            <li> the color change is not noticeable not like pictured at all... is not worth the money at all..</li>
            <li> Not worth the money...</li>
            <li> Not worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth the money...</li>
            <li> and she says it is just not worth it.  </li>
            <li> By the next day it&#x27;s already chipped off at least one or two nails.</li>
            <li> this is not worth the money</li>
            <li> Its quite disappointing to do a fresh manicure and in no time, your nails look like you never did them.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth buying.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Even with a base and top coat on it chipped within a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> would I recommend this product no very cheap for the price</li>
            <li> My daughter loves to paint her nails, changes the color every other day!</li>
            <li> the other three just got a lil lighter !</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t change colors unless in extreme hot or cold.</li>
            <li> I am trying to return this item, because it is pretty horrible with the overall quality, Dont buy this product unless you absolutely want to waste your money!</li>
            <li> The mood color change works..the only down side is that the polish chips very fast :(</li>
            <li> So the polish lasted about a week &amp; half.</li>
            <li> All of them have chipped horrendously in less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Peels and chips in less than a day,doesn&#x27;t change color like it should.</li>
            <li> I tried running cold and hot water over  my nails but still no change.</li>
            <li> but they do not change with my body temperature or if hot or cold water is applied.</li>
            <li> ran my finger nails under hot water and cold water .</li>
            <li> i tried everything hot water cold water etc waist of money</li>
            <li> It changes with hot &amp; cold.</li>
            <li> Was suppose to change colors with hot or cold water.</li>
            <li> Quality is no better than any other average nail polish.</li>
            <li> Too bad there are not more colors available in the mood change</li>
            <li> My little cousin loves it.</li>
            <li> I would suggest this as a little girls slumber party \\&quot;mani/pedi day\\&quot; polish, since it will fall off by bedtime without the need for nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> The  pink blue  &amp; the blue mauve didn&#x27;t work, but the others did, but they have badly stained my nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bad thing they peel and crack almost instantly; even putting a layer of clear protective coat.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried green yet.</li>
            <li> Stopped working within a few months.</li>
            <li> There were dried drippings on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Money wasted.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff chips within a few hours of applying and stains my nails when trying to remove it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this</li>
            <li> For adults, however, this polish is a waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> but when I put the Polish on well my nails it streaked it peeled of and dried matted</li>
            <li> Not all colors changed just the green one</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it chipping.</li>
            <li> Stinks bad doesn&#x27;t work not worth the price and 1 star being nice.  </li>
            <li> The other colors changed as soon as the fingers warmed up, or after washing my hands ( the nails that the polish managed to stay on through the hand washing at least).</li>
            <li> did not receive mood nail polish just plain colors.</li>
            <li> The blue change is very subtle.</li>
            <li> The color change is very, very slight.  </li>
            <li> Wasted my hard earned cash.  </li>
            <li> and you can barely see the change for the blue one unless it is under cold water, plus the color stickers were wrong on a few</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately , I have only had it on about 4 hours &amp; it has already chipped !</li>
            <li> Either Amazon or Fulfilled by Amazon&#x27;s packaging needs to be improved as all 6 of these arrived in one small bubblewrap bag.  </li>
            <li> As in the header, the pink was already broken and leaking.  </li>
            <li> not sure if that affected the results</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> The second coat is as horrible as the first.</li>
            <li> waste of my time and money!</li>
            <li> but I do that with other polish not because this was thin.</li>
            <li> Accually only half works so very sad.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in a store.</li>
            <li> Garbage , did not work plus the color was dull no shine</li>
            <li> The nail polish was dull and the color did not change colors at all.  </li>
            <li> I like the product quality, but the mood change seems to turn the polish dull.  </li>
            <li> This product is not worth buying!!!  </li>
            <li> Well, that at least saved me from a time consuming polish removal process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You will need at least 2 coats for it to look good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I polished my nails Saturday night late.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be a $30 bottle of polish, but nail polish should at least stay on your nails for an hour or two after you apply it.  </li>
            <li> Waste of time and money!!</li>
            <li> Color change is subtle, but works.  </li>
            <li> IT IS NOT A GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Extreme disappointment.</li>
            <li> This polish comes on with a very dull finish  </li>
            <li> Color doesn&#x60;t change and very dull.</li>
            <li> the polish looks very dull when it dries.  </li>
            <li> The one with glitter was very hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed on this product and it peels off fast.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, very dull &amp; no shine, doesn&#x27;t change colors....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your MONEY !!!</li>
            <li> This product is the worse I&#x27;ve ever purchased from amazon, I purchased it for my kids and they were also dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Three of the six bottles were leaking and broken.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I received the box and it was broken.</li>
            <li> was not happy with product after applied</li>
            <li> Really thin coat</li>
            <li> Hopefully i will save someone else the disappointment of buying this polish; I wish that I had read the reviews ( i usually do and forgot to this time for some reason-</li>
            <li> Hopefully i will save someone else the disappointment of buying this polish; I wish that I had read the reviews ( i usually do and forgot to this time for some reason-</li>
            <li> My polish did not change color wether hot or cold, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was so ugly on my nails that I hardly gave it time to anyway.  </li>
            <li> I looked up information to return the product but unable to because as stated by product provider, they don&#x27;t have means to pick up the product.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sorry i did....</li>
            <li> But unfortunately it just keeps peeling off.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it changes randomly though, so it must be the weather.  </li>
            <li> and they gave me the wrong delievery day some of the nail polishes are not like the colors shown in the image and some dont change color that was a dissapointment</li>
            <li> so sad i dont like it</li>
            <li> Not particularly impressed.</li>
            <li> sorry for the inconvenience,</li>
            <li> Some are faint while others you can see the change.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> horrible doesnt last a day let alone</li>
            <li> Plus the quality is very poor,</li>
            <li> Very poor quality...</li>
            <li> I know to make each coat very thin.</li>
            <li> Terrible the Polish dried dull and did NOT change colors horrible product waste of my money</li>
            <li> but I was afraid that would affect the color changing.</li>
            <li> however they aren&#x27;t MOOD CHANGERS they change depending on the heat of your fingernails and or how cold they are.</li>
            <li> Too bad they didn&#x27;t ALL work</li>
            <li> They all had this ugly yet matte finish and needed a million coats to be seen.</li>
            <li> but here, because you will be frustrated and disappointed by this product.</li>

            <li> The 2 glitter ones would not color change at all :(</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone :(  </li>
            <li> The 4 matte colours change but bubble &amp; peel within an hour or so :(</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s why i got this nail polish, but i was disappointed when it never changed colors.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not what I was expecting. Although the colors are beautiful, the quality of the polish is lackluster at best. Ive used with base coat as well as top coat, but the polish constantly chips. Maybe that&#x27;s a consequence of the polish being able to change color, or maybe it&#x27;s the fact that you get what you pay for. The shipping was very fast which was a plus,  but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this polish solely due to quality purposes. It dries very matte so a top coat is required unless you like the matte look. The stars color doesn&#x27;t change. The blue change is very subtle. The orange and pink changes phenomenally! I haven&#x27;t tried green yet. I wish I could give a better review for the odea is great and the colors are really pretty.</li>
            <li> Wish it wouldn&#x27;t peel off as easily</li>
            <li> the color change is not noticeable not like pictured at all... is not worth the money at all..</li>
            <li> Nail polish chipped with in 2hrs</li>
            <li> Nail Polish is ok. It&#x27;s not mood when I think of mood changing I think of a mood ring this is more like magic nail polish not what I thought it was</li>
            <li> None of these changed colors.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors do not work!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried all of the colors yet.  I did try the dark/light blue and the brighter pink/purple.  The color change is very, very slight.  Also, it goes on very clumpy and dull.  I did apply a base coat and a top coat which helped the color look much nicer.  But, the next morning I woke up and half of the nails were complete removed of the polish.  It came off in one solid peel.  Well, that at least saved me from a time consuming polish removal process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking of trying to mix the clear with the color to see if it will bind better to the base coat.  Cross your fingers.</li>
            <li> I bought this for fun, it&#x27;s supposed to change color when you go from outdoors to indoors.  It did not do this.  Plus the quality is very poor, chips easily, colors are flat.  I won&#x27;t buy it again and don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> If I could have given it 0 star&#x27;s that would be my first pick. Does not work does not change color only if under water</li>
            <li> Awasome colores! But they dry flat. And chip off pretty easy even with a good top coat. At over $3 per bottle I thought the quality would have been better.</li>
            <li> This was a fast delivery. I purchased a different product from another company before this one and none of the nail colors changed. I have had great results from these polishes. All but 2 of the colors did change and the ones that didn&#x27;t change are pretty enough to wear. They do chip really fast, I do suggest a thick, clear, topcoat on it.</li>
            <li> The polish never last for 2 days.</li>
            <li> MY GIRLS LOVE THIS AND IT ALWAYS MAKES THEM HAPPY.</li>
            <li> The blue nail polish does NOT change color.  The pink did change color until a clear coat is applied.  The color is flat and flakes off unless you have a clear coat.  Do not purchase this.  It is a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Stopped working within a few months.</li>
            <li> Nail palish started to peal ten minuties later</li>
            <li> For the most part, all but one color didn&#x27;t change. I love them other than that.</li>
            <li> One bottle the purple had been opened. There were dried drippings on the bottle. It wasn&#x27;t even full.&lt;br /&gt;The Polish DID NOT turn colors as promised.&lt;br /&gt;VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT! Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> i love it, it is a great product probe all colors and look spectacular, have no complaint, the price is great too</li>
            <li> Was excited to get this but it chipped off within minutes after drying.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t match up to the product.</li>
            <li> I love these polished, the colors. The way they apply smooth and evenly. They give gest coverage and are just a great polish!</li>
            <li> These are the same colors as shown and they change like they are shown! Being a lacquer, they will also float on water to make really cool designs that change colors. You can go on youtube to find videos as to how to do water marbling nail art.</li>
            <li> My polish did not change color wether hot or cold, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy nail polish flakes off !!!!!</li>
            <li> Poor quality, very dull &amp; no shine, doesn&#x27;t change colors....</li>
            <li> This product is the worse I&#x27;ve ever purchased from amazon, I purchased it for my kids and they were also dissatisfied. This particular product is NOT worth $19.00. I looked up information to return the product but unable to because as stated by product provider, they don&#x27;t have means to pick up the product. On rating this product you must click one of the stars, that&#x27;s the only reason why I give this product one star, it does Not deserve that one star.</li>
            <li> Three of the six bottles were leaking and broken. Thee three we could try, dries on like a chalk and scrapes off easily. Very dull/matte finish.</li>
            <li> I do not like how flat looking it is... No shine to it all...Just a flat colored primer is all...Not worth the money... The pictures show it shiny, don&#x27;t let that fool you. I have used mood polish in the past and it was beautiful and amazing..I would love to have my money back..</li>
            <li> It does change colors but a couple of the colors didn&#x27;t even last one day without chipping off. Not worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> This item was purchased as a gift.  Gift recipient was well pleased with the item, she wears it every day.  Thanks for my grand-daughter&#x27;s joy in this gift.</li>
            <li> I received my nail polish about three weeks ago. I took it to my local nail shop where I get my nails done and had them to apply one of the colors. The lady loved the results as she was applying, as she looked and then asked,  Why I did not used their polish?  I replied, &amp;#34; I will not pay $18 just for you to paint my nails in the changing nail color polish.&amp;#34; I was really surprised when she accepted mine and actually did a good job on the polish job.  This was a very good investment for me. Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;Lillian from Atlanta, Georgia</li>
            <li> The polish changes colors great, but the polish is very thin and takes a lot to get good coverage. This polish is best for little kids.</li>
            <li> Love them! Very fun and I love the look!&lt;br /&gt;Take your time 3 coats and use a good top coat! Seche Vite is the fast drying top coat I used. No chipping! I like the green the best!</li>
            <li> Fast accurate and smiles on my daughter&#x27;s face</li>
            <li> the nail polish doesn&#x27;t stay on more then 15 minutes tried more coats then tried top coat and then just gave up. Wouldn&#x27;t buy It again</li>
            <li> Awful!!! Application coverage so thin you can&#x27;t get enough on to make it look decent. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Never been soooooo mad!  Money wasted.  Will not be buying and spreading the word on social media to not buy!</li>
            <li> This is exaclty whar I was looking for. I have tried all colors and they change according to the temperature of your body. The green has become my favorite. teh blue does not change as shown it only changes to blue versus the royal blue when cold, it is hard to notice but when you use it as a enhancer with another color it really didnt matter to me. I would only recommend this if you have long nails or have then professionally done. The shipping aspect could improve, it was a long wait and i forgot that I had ordered them. however the packaging was good.</li>
            <li> They may only last for a little while but they are really fun colors. They really do change color</li>
            <li> Good price for 6 nail polishes since I was buying them for a 3 year old, but they don&#x27;t change color. Some of the colors are bright, but some look chalky after they dry.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves to paint her nails, changes the color every other day! She loves this stuff and it was a good price so I am happy :-)</li>
            <li> This is not nail polish it is a waste of money not even my nine year old like it. Only certain one&#x27;s changed and the others go on and dry like children&#x27;s paint . I would give it no star&#x27;s  but it made me</li>
            <li> My daughter has fun with the color changing but it chips too fast.  Even with a base and top coat on it chipped within a couple of hours.  Still, it&#x27;s so much fun that I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Green,  Orange, and purple are cool. The others do change with temperature,  but the change is so subtle that it isn&#x27;t very exciting. They also chip easily if you don&#x27;t put a top coat on.</li>
            <li> Its a scam, the worst product ever.</li>
            <li> We used these polishes on three separate girls the day we got them and all the paint peeled off overnight.  Does NOT go on well. More like a runny plastic and peels right off.  Very disappointed and considering returning despite the hassle it will be.</li>
            <li> These are not high end polishes. However, they dry fast (which is good considering you usually need 3-4 coats for good coverage).</li>
            <li> This polish comes on with a very dull finish  it seems when I add top coat then the colors don&#x27;t change.This was a poor investment!!!</li>
            <li> Some colors do not stay one your nails no matter how many coats you put on. Other colors are just not changing like they are supposed to.  It to mention that a cap was taken off before sealing the box and the was nail polish all of et everything.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth the money... they chip very fast..... just go to the salon and get it there it&#x27;s last longer...... don&#x27;t buy them.... i&#x27;m sorry i did....</li>
            <li> Not a well made product.  Got it for my 12year old niece and she says it is just not worth it.  Color doesn&#x60;t change and very dull.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  This product chipped almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Really a great idea. But not some of the colors don&#x27;t change colors. The orange/yellow does great. Green/yellow great.Pink/Rose is OK but the bllue/ light blue stayed Dark blue. The purple won&#x27;t change either.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THEM!!!! worst nail polishes ever. I received it on Friday, put them on yesterday and already they look horrible. After I polished my nails, I went to a party and it was embarrassing that my nails was chipping already. I am very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I Should have read more reviews before I bought this. These do change colors, but they are not high quality. They all dry with a matte finish and take several coats to make a consistent color. I wish I could send them back. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I really love it. But unfortunately it just keeps peeling off.</li>
            <li> I like the colors and the color changing.  Sometimes it changes randomly though, so it must be the weather.  You will need at least 2 coats for it to look good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate that it chips so easily that you cant even wear it for a full day.  I put it on in the middle of the day, and before the day was over, i ended up taking it off because all my nails had big chips missing.  You get what you pay for, i guess.  On the plus side, i think it would be good polish for a kid or young adult since it comes off so easity.  My little cousin loves it.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t change color easily and started chipping within hours</li>
            <li> Very poor quality...colors are different from those displayed....not even worth a one star</li>
            <li> My kids&#x27; love this polish, but it chips off more than regular nail polish. If it lasted a week, I would give it 5 stars. By the next day it&#x27;s already chipped off at least one or two nails.</li>
            <li> Two of the nail polishes did not change colors.  I tried running cold and hot water over  my nails but still no change.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in a store. Clairs use to have something like this but was discontinued.Also can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife and daughters, they love them! My wife got out the hair dryer when we first got them and heated up one side of one of the bottles and when it began to change the color she and the girls practically cheered with joy! lol.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say as I blame them though, it is indeed fun and exciting when a product performs as expected and advertised!</li>
            <li> The  pink blue  &amp; the blue mauve didn&#x27;t work, but the others did, but they have badly stained my nails.&lt;br /&gt; Thankyou&lt;br /&gt;  Margaret Mahoney</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used two of the polishes. The first was the sherbert color. It has a barely noticeable color change. The second was the deep purple. The color change is great. Unfortunately , I have only had it on about 4 hours &amp; it has already chipped ! I have not done anything that should have caused this. I used two clear coats &amp; 3 color coats on a foundation coat. I know to make each coat very thin.</li>
            <li> The blue doesnt really change but the others a cool. My kids call them &amp;#34;magic nails&amp;#34;. I understand that they are cheap but you get what you pay for so you can&#x27;t really complain about the polish chipping, just make sure you have a good top coat.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any changes in the color... I expected it to be like Dol Sol I have nail polish from that company and I love how it changes in color at any point the sun hits my nails it instantly changes color...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me I use my hands a lot at work so the nail polish doesn&#x27;t stay on for very long, but they sure are fun.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product until I got it and realized it has a matte finish and it didnt change colors until I ran hot water over my nails .. also only three colors out of the set I purchased actually looked like they changed color the other three just got a lil lighter !</li>
            <li> The green and orange colours change dramatically, while the pink and purple change enough to be noticable. The red and blue are the only ones that have a metallic finish, and they change very little, no matter how many coats I apply.&lt;br /&gt;They all work best with a white base coat, 2-4 coats of the product and a transparent top coat.&lt;br /&gt;The polish is considerably brittle, so a top coat is practically mandatory.</li>
            <li> Garbage , did not work plus the color was dull no shine</li>
            <li> Color shifting is not as clear as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product if it was color shifting polisch you want, but continue to look for another brand.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase.It came quickly and was exactly as described.Wish all internet dealings went as smooth. No surprises or letdowns.</li>
            <li> Good size bottle. Beautiful colors. They actually do change colors, which I love. The bad thing they peel and crack almost instantly; even putting a layer of clear protective coat.</li>
            <li> They chip about easier than other polishes and some colors don&#x27;t change as advertised.  Over-all I like the color though</li>
            <li> I love these wear them every day even though they chip off right away tht is even putting a clear coat over the top</li>
            <li> I love it. It doesn&#x27;t stay on for to long without chipping but its fun for the day.</li>
            <li> Always get compliments on these polishes. Folks want to know where I got them!</li>
            <li> The nail polish was dull and the color did not change colors at all.  I would not order this again.</li>
            <li> I like the nail polish It did change colors and i used it on my daughter and it dry fairly quickly and she 2 . Was a little thick but not bad and yes you are going to need a top coat  on nail polish or it going to look chalky. And it did change colors was top coat for me</li>
            <li> I purchased this mood nail polish thinking it would be like the mood nail polish at the nail salons.  WRONG!!!! This is the worst mood polish I ever purchased it does not change colors at all.  If you squeeze your eyes and open them back up the pressure of your eyes being closed would make you think the nail polish changed color.  However once your eyes focused you will see that it is the same DULL, NON CHANGING MOOD NAIL POLISH.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this product.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really change colors</li>
            <li> Great for children! Don&#x27;t buy for your wife though.. Colors only change when you initially paint it on, and don&#x27;t change again. Very low quality polish. Six year old loved it though.</li>
            <li> The colors never really changed for me no matter what I did. They also chipped really easily probably because you need 3+ layers of nail polish</li>
            <li> where I live at they don&#x27;t sell mood change polish... I came across this and I really like this product. 100% satisfied!!</li>
            <li> Received two of the exact same colors and it wasn&#x27;t the selection in the pic. ..got a off white two yellow a green a light pink and a purple..disappointed</li>
            <li> One nail polish was dry shipping took awhile and they gave me the wrong delievery day some of the nail polishes are not like the colors shown in the image and some dont change color that was a dissapointment will not order again from seller and I do not recommended to buy to overpriced your better off buying regular nail polish this is not worth the money</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 year old daughter and she loves the color changes.  It tells me what kind of mood she&#x27;s in, now all I need to do is get my wife to wear it, daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TH in BonneTerre, Mo</li>
            <li> Nice colors but they do not change with my body temperature or if hot or cold water is applied. Very disappointing. Quality is no better than any other average nail polish.</li>
            <li> it was to change color and it don&#x27;t i will never buy this again so sad i dont like it</li>
            <li> Chips easily, but other then that, this is great stuff!!</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product. Color is not changing in most of them and will not stay on. In 2 days max you have no nail polish on your nails.</li>
            <li> These actually work!!!  Some of the colors are more reactive, it seems. It works like a mood ring. The warmer the air the more likely the secondary color will appear. Pretty cool. Works in hot water too. Let them dry first.  Use two coats...</li>
            <li> Only 4 of the colors actually changed color with temperature. The 2 glitter ones would not color change at all :( but the other 4 worked as expected!</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the worst nail polish I have ever bought.  It is thin and does not go on smoothly, but leaves gaps and lumps.  I rarely write a review, but I felt so ripped off with this purchase, that I had to warn others.  In no way did it change colors. It was so ugly on my nails that I hardly gave it time to anyway.  I ended up removing it immediately.  I did try a white coat under them, and that looked a little better, but it still chipped fast. I tried about four of the colors, then put them away for touch ups on other projects.</li>
            <li> I like the looks but the nail polish comes off after a couple of days of having it on, so I would think about it before you buy it.</li>
            <li> This stuff chips within a few hours of applying and stains my nails when trying to remove it. Mine doesn&#x27;t even change color. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this</li>
            <li> Terrible the Polish dried dull and did NOT change colors horrible product waste of my money</li>
            <li> I have only used the purple/pink and it&#x27;s what I expected. Nice color, and the purple changes into a perfect bubble gum pink. I really like the natural ombr&amp;eacute; effect that happens when your nail beds are warm and air around the tips of your nails are cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend painting a light, opaque color onto your nails before applying 2-3 coats of this mood polish on top to get good/even coverage. This polish dries to a matte finish and will easily chip if you don&#x27;t finish with a clear top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the extra prep and finish work required for a good result with this product because it is a fun color changing polish, you end up with a wide array of colors, and it&#x27;s a solid alternative to the gel mood polish. This product&#x27;s color shift is more mild than the gels I have used in the past, however I prefer regular polish to gel so that I can change my nail color more often with less damage to my natural nails.</li>
            <li> This is such a cool idea. My husband bought this for our daughter and she was super excited. I also wanted to try.&lt;br /&gt;The color definitly changes. I put on Green and almost immediatly it turned yellow so that was cool. I didnt like the finish. It looks kind of chalky when its on and doesnt go on very even. I only tried two coats so maybe if I try more. I almost wanted to put a clear coat over it so it looked more normal but I was afraid that would affect the color changing. Flakes off. I put two coats on last night and when I woke up this morning I noticed it had already started to flake off. I have never seen nail polish do that before ever... So I removed it and put on another color (again 2 coats) and again its only been half a day and its flaking off again. Again I really want to like this stuff... but it just kind of looks funky on and wont stay on. Someone else said this is better for kids and i agree.</li>
            <li> Brought the six and only two out of the six changed colors. Less than 24 hrs of applying the polish the next day it chipped and some even came off the whole nail. I went to the nail salon again and got the same thing buy used there mood nail polish and it didn&#x27;t chip at all colors changed as bottle said. Overall just wasn&#x27;t satisfied with this item at all. Took a while to get a return label. Haven&#x27;t gotten a refund yet for this item. Talked to others that purchased items online thru amazon and they got there refund back before seller even got the item back. Just wouldn&#x27;t never order something again I could go to the store to get.</li>
            <li> Good quality and fast shipping love this seller</li>
            <li> I received the box and it was broken.</li>
            <li> I appreciate this polish. Worked well for me. I haven&#x27;t seen any chipping. I always apply a couple coats of quick dry top coat. I do have to apply a couple of layers of the mood polish for desired color. The mood color polish dries quickly. I love that. The color change under hot water and outdoor heat. On my toes, the polish stays more so the heated color.. I&#x27;m pleased. Quick delivery</li>
            <li> Love my color changer nail polish. Great idea.. granddaughter loves it more than me though.. So gave them to her.. Thanks</li>
            <li> you dont have to use 4 or 5 coats just add one white coat of polish first then the color. this will make the color POP so much better</li>
            <li> Color change is subtle, but works.  My daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> Does not change colors&lt;br /&gt;I ran my finger nails under hot water and cold water . No change</li>
            <li> The base colors for these leave a lot to be desired. The cream coats, pink, green and purple are very cheap looking. The green in particular, it&#x27;s not pretty (almost olive but..not) and they all dry matte.  The metallic pink and blue barely change, or at least not as noticeably as the others. But out of all of them the metallic pink has the best base color to it.&lt;br /&gt;That aside, the ones that DID change were pretty neat. The colors they change into are neon and it&#x27;s super fun to watch them go from one to the other. They do still change even with multiple top coats.</li>
            <li> Nice polish I just wish all of them work instead of just 3 of 6  ..pink orange and green are the best..</li>
            <li> I like them very much and yes they do change very nicely would love to see more copies to work with.</li>
            <li> These are adorable for a young girl who loves the idea of nail polish that changes color! The polishes that don&#x27;t contain sparkles dry in a matte finish and need a top coat to make it shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure why this polish is really getting so many negative reviews you get what you pay for  ... and i love the polish for the price its a steal ,two coats which truly take less than 1 minute to dry isn&#x27;t bad at all and apply a layer of clear on top and there you go !!!! Chipping occurs with most polish if YOUR NAILS ARE LONG !!!! I own all types of polish , even manicured gel polish at the salon will chip so ladies please stop complaining , perfect for the summer after reading these reviews i still ordered the product because everyone&#x27;s different and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t go by what I read I LOVE MY POLISH</li>
            <li> None of these worked. Extreme disappointment.</li>
            <li> for the price \\&quot;YES\\&quot; for the quality and lasting effect &#x27;NO\\&quot;. it has a matte color so you would def need a good top coat. doesnt last more than 48hrs. The good part is that it does change colors</li>
            <li> They chipped in chunks within a couple of hours. They also did not change color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, some of the colors don&#x27;t work. It also chips off right away.</li>
            <li> It does change color with hot or cold temperatures mainly when you wash your hands or take a shower .  I would not recommend this nail polish after applying within half an hour its chipping flaking and peeling off total waste of time and money</li>
            <li> Cool and fun but needs many coats and a very thick top coat even after that it chips easy. Awesome polish for kids.</li>
            <li> Product is descent not the best quality though</li>
            <li> The polish works great if you put it over a whit coat first then you only need one or two coats of mood polish. I also put a shellac top coat over it and it stayed on for two to three weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried one color so far, but it doesn&#x27;t change.  Not particularly impressed.</li>
            <li> They do not change colors according to the temperature. I have used many coats to try and get it to work and sadly it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> some of the colors did not change, the only one that really worked was the green to neon yellow.  Blue and Pink did not change color at all.  I ordered thru Amazon, to make sure I was getting the best products available.  will not order from this company again.</li>
            <li> Nice polish thanks..works great</li>
            <li> Love the color changing. Dries pretty fast too.</li>
            <li> Love it, i am happy with my purchase, fast delivery</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this product. Unfortuntly it took several coats to for it not to look streaky and every nail chipped the very next day. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> does not work as advertised</li>
            <li> I love this finger nail polish it made my nail lokk nice on love mood colors it really enjoyable in yes this nice product to have in enjoy</li>
            <li> Loved the colors  get lots of compliments from it.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth buying!!!  It takes many coats to get a good color and after a while it comes off.</li>
            <li> Not bad. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> The colors did not change as expected. Most of them stayed the same color. It did most of its changing in the bottle. I personally would like to try a different brand or company.</li>
            <li> Great gift for a very sPecial diva of any age. It gets  5*&#x27;s fRom me.</li>
            <li> The onlly one that actually works is the pink and purple one and the yellow and green one. The rest really don&#x27;t change colors, but the blue one is really pretty regardless.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail polish set to use on my nieces and they got a really big kick out of it! They enjoyed the fact that their nails changed colors when going outside in the cold. The only downside that I have is that the polish chips off (even after applying a base and top coat).</li>
            <li> So far I have only tried 2 of these colors, one worked perfectly and was gorgeous while the other never changed from its original polished color. I&#x27;m hoping the rest change colors the way they&#x27;re meant to.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and was in great condition.  We have use the nail polish and we love it.  Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> I love nail polish but, when it starts to chip!!!! That&#x27;s when the dislike comes in. I polished my nails Saturday night late. Sunday morning I notice that the blue had already started chipping and I had not done anything. The green to yellow, pink to peach,and the stars to purple have ALL chipped with the use of a very good base and top coat !!! Don&#x27;t waste your MONEY !!!</li>
            <li> As many have stated before, these polishes just don&#x27;t hold up. The color changes, it really does, but it doesn&#x27;t just chip off, it peels off in large sheets. Great for a night out, 6-12 hours of durability. But do not expect to make it more than a day or two without a chip</li>
            <li> Good polish !  Let my fingnails grow to wear it. Then got acrylic over lay on nails. Found out mood polish won&#x27;t change color through acrylic!!!!  So I gave polish to girlfriend..  She loves it and it does change for her..</li>
            <li> This is the WORST nail polish that I have ever purchased. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be a $30 bottle of polish, but nail polish should at least stay on your nails for an hour or two after you apply it.  I buffed my nails, put on a clear coat, then put 3 coats of this nail polish on (2 coats was nowhere near enough and even 3 was still a bit sheer- I eventually tried putting a coat of matte polish in a similar color to make it more opaque, which helped). After letting it dry and putting on two coats of clear polish on top ( then letting those dry), a ran my fingers through my hair, and immediately the polish from 5 nails popped off in one big nail shaped chip....I have never seen this happen with nail polish ever. I understand that this is cheap polish, but it should at least stay on your nails for a day or so before it comes off completely; even if it is for kids or just for fun I want my nail polish to last if I am going to put time into putting it on; I know that polish chips after wearing it for several days but this polish had been on my fingers for less than an hour before it came off in one huge chunk, not just chips.  I would suggest this as a little girls slumber party \\&quot;mani/pedi day\\&quot; polish, since it will fall off by bedtime without the need for nail polish remover. For adults, however, this polish is a waste of time and money.  Oddly enough, the color changing effect of polish is really very good, at least on the colors that actually changed, which is roughy half of them; one of the purples had a label that showed it going from the lavender that it was to a very slightly lighter color of pink- nearly inudistiinguishable on the label let alone on nails). The other colors changed as soon as the fingers warmed up, or after washing my hands ( the nails that the polish managed to stay on through the hand washing at least). While I enjoyed the color change for the brief time that the polish stayed on my nails, the fact that it came off so fast makes this polish a complete waste of money. I do NOT recommend buying this polish; go to 5 BELOW and pick up their color change polish for 3 for $5 ( they even have polish that changes color in sunlight)- buy your nail polish ANYWHERE but here, because you will be frustrated and disappointed by this product. Hopefully i will save someone else the disappointment of buying this polish; I wish that I had read the reviews ( i usually do and forgot to this time for some reason- damn) because then I would have realized that everyone else had the same problem with this crappy polish...plete waste of money.

            <li> This polish really does chip no matter how many top coats you do. Its quite disappointing to do a fresh manicure and in no time, your nails look like you never did them.</li>
            <li> This product works very good on fake nails.  The only personal problem I have is that there are too many pink colors I love the blue and green</li>
            <li> Arrived on time,  polish works when you only use one coat and chips very easily even with a base coat and top coat or without.</li>
            <li> These items work just as described.  Either Amazon or Fulfilled by Amazon&#x27;s packaging needs to be improved as all 6 of these arrived in one small bubblewrap bag.  As in the header, the pink was already broken and leaking.  Luckily it didn&#x27;t actually get on the others.</li>
            <li> was not happy with product after applied it did not change color an i tried everything hot water cold water etc waist of money</li>
            <li> My wife love it, it is funny when they change color with temperature, nice idea, good product.</li>
            <li> It did arrive fast I was happy but when I put the Polish on well my nails it streaked it peeled of and dried matted would I recommend this product no very cheap for the price</li>
            <li> Awful. Not worth the money. I had seen a friend who had mood polish and her nails were beautiful so I bought this hoping my nails would look good but NOPE. I wish I had not wasted the money</li>
            <li> Skip this - it doesn&#x27;t stay on for more than a day even with a top coat.</li>
            <li> Just awful. The green/fellow was the worst. They all had this ugly yet matte finish and needed a million coats to be seen. Wasted my hard earned cash.  I should have read the reviews.</li>
            <li> All colors didn&#x27;t change! Polish was cheap! Returned it and got a refund!</li>
            <li> My best friend was in tears when she got this</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it... She won&#x27;t stop playing with her nails, so many ways to make them change colors!!!</li>
            <li> This polish chips easily by itself, but it works great on a white base.</li>
            <li> They were nothing to write home about.  I thought they would be much better than they were.  You need to have really long nails to get the &#x27;mood&#x27; effect.</li>
            <li> A couple of them do not change colors...but the other 4 work well.</li>
            <li> Honestly I had not yet the chance to try it, but Nail saloons here charge $5-10 extra to use a color changing polish so when I saw the price for 6 bottles I bought it, it came fast and prompt</li>
            <li> product is ok it just takes a few more coats then I thought and the time in which it came was a little long</li>
            <li> thank you very much. sorry for the inconvenience, but i got my order finally, and i appreciate it lots. xoxo thank you</li>
            <li> This polish is a joke. Stinks bad doesn&#x27;t work not worth the price and 1 star being nice.  Got better QUALITY AT SECOND HAND STORE!------!!!!-</li>
            <li> 3 of them worked good, The pink/purple, yellow/green and the yellow/mango. I really wish they all work, I was loking foward to the blue/purple one and that is one that didn&#x27;t work.:(</li>
            <li> did not receive mood nail polish just plain colors. didn&#x27;t want to hassle with shipping it back.</li>
            <li> The polish goes on unevenly and requires a second coat for more coverage. I find that when I apply the 2nd coat, it no longer acts as mood polish. Also, if using a topcoat, you will not get the color changes.&lt;br /&gt;When its on correctly, its pretty cool. Especially when you are in between temperatures, you get a nice hombre color effect.&lt;br /&gt;Its touch and go. One day I love it, the next I am not crazy about it.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter don&#x27;t like some of them. They don&#x27;t change  color.</li>
            <li> I love these colors and delivered early. Couldn&#x27;t be happier! Everyone compliments my nail.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors but poor coverage, need several coats . Also , only tips of nail change color  if they change at all. Rest of nail stays same as color put on.</li>
            <li> Really doesnt work that well</li>
            <li> These polishes were nice, but you have to apply about 4 coats to achieve an even vibrant color. Polish chipped easily.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors divided them with my grand daughter.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this nail polish. I was kind of skeptical about it working because I have tried nail polish like this in the past not this brand that has not worked. To my surprise it works well and I would definitely recommend it to others. I have acrylic nails on and it works and stays on for about 2 weeks. I have not had a problem with chipping and I put a top coat on.</li>
            <li> I have only tried the yellow/orange and I love it. The polish does go on very matte and does not dry to a shine but a good top coat made it shine and last. I had no chipping at all, just wear on the tips after about 5 days.</li>
            <li> Very cheap product. Smears as you polish as if it&#x27;s drying with each stroke. The colors are pretty. It changes with hot &amp; cold.</li>
            <li> Not all changes colors</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting.  Very disappointed on this product and it peels off fast.</li>
            <li> I didnt like the finish its very chalky looking every with a clear coat. The colors change but some of them have very minimum visual effect &amp; some required hand to be almost at the &amp;#34;freezing&amp;#34; point for the color to change.</li>
            <li> granddaughter loved these</li>
            <li> Love them! Look beautiful on my nails.</li>
            <li> Yes! These are super cute and fun to use. That said, we found that the polish did not last as long as regular polish, but what fun it was to wear while it did!</li>
            <li> This polish works well depending on the color. Some give a bigger change than others.</li>
            <li> The product is good but not all of the polishes change color like it shows. Some are faint while others you can see the change. Not bad for the price though.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it dries quickly. But it dries to a chalky finish and chips extremely easily. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> it does work like promised but you have to apply about 4 coats for it to really show up nice enough to see. It does change color under hot water or when your nails/fingers get hot. it drys fast. The problem that i have encounter is that it does chip as soon as it drys. no matter what you are doing. So after reappling the nail polish, after it dried i put on some clear coat &amp; it helped it from chipping. So the polish lasted about a week &amp; half. My daughter loves painting her nails with this nail polish. it is fun to have on your nails. People see you with one color &amp; then you get your nails hot &amp; let them change it&#x27;s amazing &amp; they get a kick out of it.</li>
            <li> the polish looks very dull when it dries.  would not buy again.  color does change though.</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied with product. Should have checked reviews before buying product.  Polish chips within minutes after put on. Looks like something for kids.  Will stick with professional salons from now on!!!&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with nail polish :( Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone :(  The 4 matte colours change but bubble &amp; peel within an hour or so :( The dark blue &amp; purple don&#x27;t change colour but stay on without bubbling &amp; peeling.</li>
            <li> My product wasnt a lie. I have exactlly was I was expecting. I will tell my sister about it, she is also interested</li>
            <li> Cracks – peels off after it dries.</li>
            <li> Some of these worked GREAT! Others not so much.  I used two coats and a clear top coat...not sure if that affected the results (Its a really dull finish without the top coat).  The ones that didn&#x27;t work- redish pink to pink, purpleish blue to light blue, glittery purple to pink.  The other three were awesome and look pretty.  Too bad they didn&#x27;t ALL work...I wish I could do a partial refund...Oh well.</li>
            <li> These were gifts. She had a different brand of blue was really excited to have the other colors.</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t really change colors</li>
            <li> This product does change color depending on what your body temperature is. Very happy with this nail polish will share with friends.</li>
            <li> Was suppose to change colors with hot or cold water. It didn&#x27;t change colors at all. It stayed the same color that it was when I first put it on.</li>
            <li> Do not recommend, this polish is chalky more like matte I thought it would be glossy; not worh the $25 spent on this nail polish, the color change is very small can barely notice.</li>
            <li> These came in nice colors but I can&#x27;t see that they change a whole lot. I had my daughter put a white undercoat on first and they show up better.</li>
            <li> I love the way the polish changes color based on the temperature. It&#x27;s really cool to see. However, it doesn&#x27;t last very long without chipping.  I had to touch up my nails within an hour of painting them.</li>
            <li> Chips after one day....but changes color! So I guess for the money it works! Too bad there are not more colors available in the mood change</li>
            <li> Very happy with these product.colors are nice and it makes a great gift to teens and adult females that likes to be stylish with nail fashion.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much very beautiful</li>
            <li> My wife loves all of the colors, and the perfect price.</li>
            <li> Arrived as shown in the ad</li>
            <li> Your nail has to be under really hot water for it finally turn color. Not worth buying.</li>
            <li> This polish is horrible. It started peeling off the same day I put it on. I would not purchase this product again. Not worth the money. Very unhappy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other people got who left bad reviews because my polish works great. It&#x27;s just like any other mood polish. I did 3-4.costs of polish but I do that with other polish not because this was thin. 2 coats is ok. It changes color as soon as you put it on so some folks might have thought it wasn&#x27;t covering well cuz they couldn&#x27;t see the party that had lightened. But also you do better with a lot of polish on the brush do you don&#x27;t pull off what you already put on or let every coat dry fully &amp; you won&#x27;t have that issue. Enjoy, I did. I love this polish. Great color, coverage &amp; temp transition.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipment!&lt;br /&gt;The color changes arent as drastic as advertised, but acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;They all chip VERY easily, you may have to apply multiple layers and they STILL chip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I painted 6 of my nails each with a different color. All of them have chipped horrendously in less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Wish this could be returned. Peels and chips in less than a day,doesn&#x27;t change color like it should. Total waste of money. Have tried other brands that work great.</li>
            <li> This nail polish was not as wonderful as I&#x27;d hoped it would have been.  I like the product quality, but the mood change seems to turn the polish dull.  I also wish that the manufacture would include a note as to what mood the colors represent.  But, all in all this is a product that is true to its description and it is worthy of purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried 1 of the 6 polishes but the color never changed from the original color that was polished on</li>
            <li> Out of all the colors. Only purple/pink and yellow/green polish actually changed colors. Blue stayed dark blue as well as the others. So if you are looking to try it out, its not bad of a price. But if you are looking for the right product, you may want to spend a bit more.</li>
            <li> I have tried 3 of the colors so far. I was hoping the pink and blue would be noticeable...they are not.  The orange to yellow is though.  It is pretty cool!</li>
            <li> Love the idea of changing color nail polish but only lasted a day on my fingernails. Will see how long it stays on my toes. Just got the colors yesterday. Adding pictures of nails. 1st one is from Friday night. 2nd is how it wore off by Saturday night. Will try another color. This is without any topcoat. Was told to try with topcoat to see if it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Just perfect for our granddaughter. She loves it</li>
            <li> love the colors....the pinkish purple,blue polish doesn&amp;#34;t change! the pink is very thick trouble getting the polish on the nail smooth.</li>
            <li> The blue and dark purple don&#x27;t really change too much but the rest work good.</li>
            <li> I am trying to return this item, because it is pretty horrible with the overall quality, Dont buy this product unless you absolutely want to waste your money!</li>
            <li> I got all 6 but one was not a mood changing not so happy about that one</li>
            <li> Its alright. Its chips to fast and goes on thin. But i just add alot of layers.  It&#x27;s ok i guess</li>
            <li> Some of the polishes did not change colors as showed. The one with glitter was very hard to remove. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I received all polish was wrapped in separate bubble wrap. The colors are great as described and received quicker than expected shipping date, very happy.</li>
            <li> Not all colors changed just the green one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great how that change the color, but it doesn&#x27;t stay more than one day.</li>
            <li> The mood color change works..the only down side is that the polish chips very fast :(</li>
            <li> Tried just a couple but so far:&lt;br /&gt;- They don&#x27;t change color&lt;br /&gt;- Really thin coat, so you have to use many layers&lt;br /&gt;- Didn&#x27;t last 2 days (other nail polishes last 5 or 6 days in my nails)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the other side, I loved the colors, specially the blue one. It seems a matte color at first but has a great shine in the sun. Just wish it would last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree that it would be a great nail polish for kids. I&#x27;m gonna give a couple to my 8 yo cousin and I bet she&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> does not change colors like advertised</li>
            <li> This polish did not change at all for me, and I tried three coats twice!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it mood changes however its a dull color.. But once I top coated it with a clear glittery color polish I get so many compliments</li>
            <li> horrible doesnt last a day let alone an hour chips right away would never buy again</li>
            <li> Yes it color changed but only slightly</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY! Colors dont change. Chip in 2 mins. Tried every color more then once and applied  at least 3 coats. Colors still will not change. Waste of time and money!!</li>
            <li> The bast product .It is working for me</li>
            <li> I purchased this set thinking the color would change. I tried two colors of the six and nothing, no change at all, not even a bit different in tone. Would not recommend spending $$</li>
            <li> I love It it works good it does change with mood and also with the temperature of water</li>
            <li> No, the color didnt change</li>
            <li> bought the 6 pack polish and only 1 of the polishes changed colors. Will not buy anymore of this product.</li>
            <li> Polish chips off within 1 day. Love the colors.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for these nail polishes, I&#x27;ve always wanted to try mood nail polishes, but these chip literally 2 seconds after drying, they don&#x27;t even last a day, and the only way they change color is in water, so unless you&#x27;re washing your hands in cold/hot water you don&#x27;t see the difference in color. I was hoping it changed color in the sun, so you can see the changes often.</li>
            <li> Although the changing colors is cool the nail polish dries very dull looking.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even have it on an hour before the paint was chipping. Tried a top coat and bottom coat and still chipped. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> This product has been diluted to much. When you apply the polish it streaks really bad and doesn&#x27;t cover the entire nail easily. The second coat is as horrible as the first. Once the clear is applied it brings it together, however it&#x27;s not anything close to the color on the bottle and it doesn&#x27;t change colors. I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE BUYING THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS SELLER! I contacted them the very day I received the product because I tried the polish on myself and it didn&#x27;t work, it also chips and peals off the same day you polish your nails. IT IS NOT A GOOD PRODUCT AT ALL!</li>
            <li> Dries with a matte finish  needs a Google glossy top coat</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this nail polish.  I&#x27;m not sure how it works, but when my fingers are warm the nail bed is pink and the tips are purple. (I have only tried one color so far).  Makes a beautiful impression on your hands.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received my mood polish.  Could not wait to get it on my nails and watch the magic.  The colors are so bright.  I used the light purple turn to pink first and it is amazing and exciting to watch it change.  My grand daughter calls it my magic polish lol so cute. Well to my surprise NOT ALL the colors work.  I was so very disappointed.  Accually only half works so very sad.  The amount of money you pay for this nail polish and only half of them work.  I do like the colors even though they don&#x27;t work that is why you got 3 stars instead of 1.  Need to do some work on the ones that do not change and fix them or lower your price in half because only half of them work.</li>
            <li> There was a problem with the shipment but the seller fixed it, was really nice to me, always polite and trying to figure out why i didnt got the package in time... sent a new one to me that got here really fast... The nail polish are great!! they were a gift for my sister and she loved it!! they change the color if her hands are warm and when they are cold they change back... Really cute....if you are thinking about buying them, go ahead, they are really good</li>
            <li> WHY BECAUSE IT CHIPS THE NEXT DAY EVEN WITH NO CHIP CLEAR NAIL POLISH I TAKE THE OLD POLISH OFF THEN WASH HANDS AND THEN I POLISH MY NAILS AND THE POLISH STILL CHIPS WHY............ MAKE ME THINK I SHOULD HAV NOT BOUGHT THIS POLISH I JUST DID MY NAILS YESTERDAY ALL MY NAILS ARE CHIPS I HATE THA NOW I HAVE TO TAKE IT OFF AND DO THEM ALL OVER I HATE THAT</li>
            <li> I love it!  The finish was kinda chalky, but a shiny quick dry top coat fixed that. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it chipping.</li>
            <li> needs multiple coats and also never did a mood change for me. i have these colors, but not in mood changing and that&#x27;s why i got this nail polish, but i was disappointed when it never changed colors.</li>
            <li> I love the color change, but all the polishes chipped within hours. Even with a top coat.</li>
            <li> Cute Colors and they do change somewhat...any age can pull off the colors BUT I will say it doesn’t last long maybe two/three days top before it chips.</li>
            <li> I am overall happy with this, they came in quick and all except one really do change. however they aren&#x27;t MOOD CHANGERS they change depending on the heat of your fingernails and or how cold they are. which for me is still pretty cool. I fear the one purple that turns to light purple may be a slight dud however. and you can barely see the change for the blue one unless it is under cold water, plus the color stickers were wrong on a few but that is ok.</li>
            <li> Not much of a change and the color is chalky.  But I haven&#x27;t given up, going to try it a few more times, it is neat.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t change colors unless in extreme hot or cold.</li>
            <li> perfect everyone loves this  Thank you</li>
            <li> Complete rip off. I purchased for my niece and the polish doesn&#x27;t change colors.....waste of my time and money!</li>
            <li> I like the blue and orange the best, fast shipping. I have to get use to the other colors very opaque though.</li>
            <li> The colors are great I would by more if there was more colors.&lt;br /&gt;Product got here in a timely manor.</li>
            <li> The colors are good and look LIKE the picture, but it wears of after a couple of hours. It doesn&#x27;t last a day.</li>
            <li> Love the colores thanck you</li>
