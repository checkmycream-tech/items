            <li>Great for joint discomfort and other connective tissue problems- has a nice smell - absorbs well</li>

            <li>Edgar Cayce had it right!</li>

            <li>The oil soaks in enough, doesn&#x27;t leave you all greasy and gross, and smells so wonderful!</li>
            <li>Et ma peau est super exigente c&#x27;est pour dire.</li>
            <li>I love the rose smell and it mixes well with other oils.</li>
            <li>Also a great bath oil, a few drops is all it takes.</li>
            <li>I use it when I get out of the shower and my skin has never felt more soft.</li>
            <li>also useful to dab in hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about my aura, but my skin certainly glows!</li>
            <li>Love it, but was open and all over package no reply from company</li>
            <li>I use the Heritage rosewater as a spray on toner first.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve put essential oil in it and that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;- High quality oil, your skin will absorb it quickly (just don&#x27;t use too</li>
            <li>There is also a slight warming sensation when you rub it in which is nice.</li>
            <li>This is a very high quality oil that your skin absorbs well, just don&#x27;t apply too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Besides the Aura-glow, roses are a very high frequency.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Women always ask me what I use, as I look very moisturized.</li>
            <li>I use it as a moisturizer along with a few drops of rose hip seed oil.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this oil to anyone looking for a skin moisturizer or a hair oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also apply a few drops for shiny, more manageable hair.</li>
            <li>I look very young and vibrant because of this oil.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin and leaves it feeling silky and soft.  </li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and have had remarks about how young I look.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it by itself, usually mix it with coco butter or another unscented oil so that it&#x27;s not to strong.</li>
            <li>I recently met Melissa Gilbert, TV star, who asked me how I keep my neck so young looking</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 67 yrs old w/ low thryoid, which causes very dry skin.</li>

            <li> Edgar Cayce had it right! Great for joint discomfort and other connective tissue problems- has a nice smell - absorbs well</li>
            <li> Gives a great glow and has a nice smell.  I would recommend this product if looking for a body oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this rose scented oil forever. I love that it smells like old fashioned rose. I don&#x27;t use it by itself, usually mix it with coco butter or another unscented oil so that it&#x27;s not to strong. Received it in good condition and double wrapped in case it leaked. I will buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Love it, but was open and all over package no reply from company</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using aura glow for 4 years as a moisturizer for my face, it is the only thing I use. I apply about 3 tiny drops to my fingers, rub it into my hands and then rub it all over my face. Within a few minutes it sinks into my skin and my skin becomes extremely soft. This is a very high quality oil that your skin absorbs well, just don&#x27;t apply too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women always ask me what I use, as I look very moisturized. I look very young and vibrant because of this oil. You can also use a little bit of this oil as a hair gel replacement, if you have short hair. I use it sometimes instead of pomade or gel and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this oil to anyone looking for a skin moisturizer or a hair oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Has a nice clean smell&lt;br /&gt;- High quality oil, your skin will absorb it quickly (just don&#x27;t use too much)&lt;br /&gt;- Very good moisturizer, and it makes a great hair oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- None that I can think of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Country of Origin: Made in USA</li>
            <li> Only a few words to say about this product...I will never be without it again.  It absorbs into the skin and leaves it feeling silky and soft.  I use it as a moisturizer along with a few drops of rose hip seed oil.  I use the Heritage rosewater as a spray on toner first.  My skin looks clearer and my skin tone has improved.  Also a great bath oil, a few drops is all it takes.</li>
            <li> Good.  Has the right smell for rose-oil, a good consistency, good value too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If, of course, you want the smell of roses - could be too floral for some, or if you&#x27;re not in the mood for that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, when I want rose, I reach for this!</li>
            <li> I love this oil, I highly recommend this brand to anyone who wants a oil to moisture and smell like a heavenly rose .. This is for you!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this rose oil product.  I am 60 years old and have had remarks about how young I look.  I tell people that I use Aura, especially on my neck.  I recently met Melissa Gilbert, TV star, who asked me how I keep my neck so young looking and I told her Glow Rose Oil.  I later presented her with a bottle of Aura Glow.  She has vowed to try it on her skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aura Glow for a few years. I used to use coconut oil. I still do sometimes, but it can be a pain once it hardens and its hard to spread. I keep this in the shower and put it on before I get out while my skin is still wet. Its the best, and I love that it has Edgar Cayce&#x27;s name on it. Plus, all I ever want is to smell like roses all of the time. The rose scent is the best.</li>
            <li> great product at a good price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good massage oil, works well, smells nice too. A friend told me it helped with pain in her foot, but I didn&#x27;t experience any pain relief from just a massage oil. (Granted, I have a herniated disc and nerve damage, so, yeah.)</li>
            <li> One you start using this body oil as a moisturizer, you&#x27;ll never want to go back to lotion.</li>
            <li> Excellent Service;  Accurate Product Description</li>
            <li> I bought this at a health food store a few years ago and have stuck with it ever since. Roses are my favorite scent and I love Edgar Cayce, so I was quickly sold. I don&#x27;t know about my aura, but my skin certainly glows! Just shaven legs look shiny and lovely. The oil soaks in enough, doesn&#x27;t leave you all greasy and gross, and smells so wonderful! I use it when I get out of the shower and my skin has never felt more soft. There is also a slight warming sensation when you rub it in which is nice. My bottle lasts a long time and I use it every week.</li>
            <li> Great smell! Very useful! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> smells good - makes hands skin very soft&lt;br /&gt;especially after bath. also useful to dab in hair&lt;br /&gt;before washing for hair\scalp health</li>
            <li> I have used this oil for yrs. Other products can&#x27;t compare. I used it all over after a shower, even my face. I have very dry skin. I&#x27;m 67 yrs old w/ low thryoid, which causes very dry skin. The oil smells wonderful also. Besides the Aura-glow, roses are a very high frequency. Thanks for the wonderful product. Years ago I started using this from the Edgar Cayce products.&lt;br /&gt;JB, CA</li>
            <li> I have used two bottles and am on the third and it is the best body bath oil one can have! The oil does not sticks and remain in your hands unlike other oil like baby oil. It has lovely rose&lt;br /&gt;Aroma and rich texture. It makes you wonder how they make it that it is not greasy in your hands!&lt;br /&gt;I am going to by a few for Christmas gifts!</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely wonderful and keeps my skin moisturized and glowing for days.</li>
            <li> I use this alone or add it to other lotion.  I love the rose smell and it mixes well with other oils.</li>
            <li> This oil leaves a very subtle fragrance when applied to slightly damp skin after a shower. I also apply a few drops for shiny, more manageable hair.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely. Great for skin, feet, hair, &amp;  intimate play.</li>
            <li> This oil is great ! I use it for everything now. It is almost a week i use it and my skin has never been so nourished ! I use it on my face, my body and my hair. Amazing !&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great at first then there is another smell i don&#x27;t like. So I&#x27;ve put essential oil in it and that&#x27;s ok. Excellent product !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Produit INCROYABLE !! Je l&#x27;utilise depuis une semaine déjà et ma peau n&#x27;a jamais été aussi bien nourrie ! Je l&#x27;utilise sur le visage, le corps et mes cheveux, impeccable. Et ma peau est super exigente c&#x27;est pour dire. Cependant, il y a une arrière odeur si je puis dire. J&#x27;ai donc rajouté de l&#x27;huile essentielle et tout est parfait maintenant, l&#x27;arrière odeur est moins désagréable. Qualité/prix imbattable pour ce petit souci d&#x27;odeur vite arrangé ! :)</li>
