            <li>Such a great product and a great deal!</li>
            <li>Then it keeps her smelling nice all day.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s contamination, or perpetual multiplying of bacteria, from the residual left-over in a warm &amp; moist environment under the plastic cap.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my own fault, I should have zoomed in on the photo and read more carefully.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great, smells nice and keeps sweat away when working in a hot kitchen.</li>

            <li>I love it, and I&#x27;m getting more than the twin pack.</li>
            <li>All in all I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and it glides on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>Many years with it.</li>
            <li>Love this product, i can workout with it and not worry one bit.</li>
            <li>Love the scents.</li>
            <li>I tent to get a rash from most brands.</li>
            <li>I WISH YOU HAD MORE OF A CHOICE IN THE SCENTS OF THIS</li>
            <li>STILL SATISFIED.</li>
            <li>Too many chemicals ingredients:  :</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time, in good condition, and the  price is right.</li>
            <li>I liked Shower Fresh more.</li>
            <li>There are a variety of scents available on Amazon so that if you don&#x27;t like this one, you can find another one more to your liking.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, it didn&#x27;t work 100%, but for the average person, I&#x27;m sure it would be wonderful.  </li>
            <li>The Shower Fresh scent is nice, too.</li>
            <li>good price - fast shipping</li>
            <li>It has a nice fresh scent without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and no fuss.  </li>
            <li>The price is also easy in the wallet.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nauseatingly strong</li>
            <li>Being able to use Subscribe and Save for items I use every day is a savings and convenience I didn&#x27;t realize that I would appreciate so much!!</li>
            <li>Light fragrance.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly without leaving a smear and appears to work well.</li>
            <li>even in hot, humid island climate, this stuff works pretty good for me.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite deodorant; the scent is very clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love that leaves you feeling fresh and keep you clean.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good deal for the only kind of deodorant that works well for me.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite deodorant!</li>
            <li>Was definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>Have used this product for many years and it has not failed me yet</li>
            <li>Works great all day long!</li>
            <li>I advised her to put Calamine lotion on a CLEAN &amp; fold-up paper towel, and wipe herself every morning, then THROW AWAY that used paper.</li>
            <li>Not to strong, but strong enough to smell nice.</li>
            <li>Only a couple of cents more than sam&#x27;s but with fast free shipping I smell good and dont have to drive 30 miles to get them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good at keeping me dry and also easy to wash off in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It saves money and its good to be stocked for next month</li>
            <li>The only deodorant that consistently works impeccably on me.</li>
            <li>Somehow the old standby original formula works even better than all the clinical protection ones.</li>
            <li>This was a pretty good deal, as it was about the same price from Walmart (I paid $5.43)</li>
            <li>The one star deduction is for the white streaks this leaves on your nice bras or shirts if you get dressed too quickly after applying it....</li>
            <li>but I have found that there are other scents that are pleasant as well.</li>
            <li>i like its smell and lasting is also very good , i have an office job of 10 hours it works properly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought both Shower Fresh and Powder Fresh Scent.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s much more than I expected for so cheap!</li>
            <li>I do like Secret the best when it comes to deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I like the shower fresh scent</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery as well.</li>
            <li>Long lasting great product</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my shirt!</li>
            <li>Ever since I had my last pregnancy, I stay hot and sweat a lot more than I used to.</li>
            <li>and it works really well!</li>
            <li>The Shower fresh has a good odor and the scent is long lasting.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite hard working deodorant and i love having it on my subscribe and save list</li>
            <li>I like how smoothly it goes on, and the solid doesn&#x27;t burn freshly shaved underarms like the gel does.</li>
            <li>Not perfect, but very good.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Susbcribe &amp; Save.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Secret stick deodorant x 2 are great to have on hand.</li>
            <li>The shipping is fast  </li>
            <li>I use this deodorant and it works very well for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>Not an overpowering scent but scent does last for hours even through light exercise.</li>
            <li>it worked better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sweat that much</li>
            <li>Secret is one of my most favorite deodorants.</li>
            <li>The cheaper brands of deodorant used to work fine for me, but now there are only two that will keep my dry and odor free.</li>
            <li>Keeps you dry and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>this will keep you fresh fro the entire day</li>
            <li>I usually have to have clinical protection products, but this kept me relatively dry and odor free for most of the day.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This has a nice subtle smell.</li>
            <li>I have always used secret and been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>she developed an allergy to it.</li>
            <li>While reading many reviews on natural deodorant, I saw people reporting that such deodorant worked for a few days, then stopped working.</li>
            <li>I have always liked Secret.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s dry &amp; clean &amp; fresh, and no more perpetuation of stinky bacteria from day, to day, since she throws away that piece of paper after using.</li>
            <li>This scent can be harsh &amp; strong, and it leaves sticky white residues all over clothes.  </li>
            <li>I tried this sent because the two pack was so cheap compared to the grocery store where I usually buy things like this.</li>
            <li>I think I sweat maybe a little more than average</li>
            <li>I always use secret deodorant,it smells refreshing and works well.</li>
            <li>Love secret deodorant.  </li>
            <li>name Secret is well chosen as it is secretive about its most damaging ingredient.</li>
            <li>Typically,  Secret is the most reliable daily use deodorant on the market for my needs.</li>

            <li> I am pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time, in good condition, and the  price is right.</li>
            <li> I liked Shower Fresh more.</li>
            <li> There are a variety of scents available on Amazon so that if you don&#x27;t like this one, you can find another one more to your liking.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, it didn&#x27;t work 100%, but for the average person, I&#x27;m sure it would be wonderful.  </li>
            <li> The Shower Fresh scent is nice, too.</li>
            <li> good price - fast shipping</li>
            <li> It has a nice fresh scent without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and no fuss.  </li>
            <li> The price is also easy in the wallet.  </li>
            <li> The scent is nauseatingly strong</li>
            <li> Being able to use Subscribe and Save for items I use every day is a savings and convenience I didn&#x27;t realize that I would appreciate so much!!</li>
            <li> Light fragrance.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly without leaving a smear and appears to work well.</li>
            <li> even in hot, humid island climate, this stuff works pretty good for me.  </li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite deodorant; the scent is very clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love that leaves you feeling fresh and keep you clean.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good deal for the only kind of deodorant that works well for me.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite deodorant!</li>
            <li> Was definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years and it has not failed me yet</li>
            <li> Works great all day long!</li>
            <li> I advised her to put Calamine lotion on a CLEAN &amp; fold-up paper towel, and wipe herself every morning, then THROW AWAY that used paper.</li>
            <li> Not to strong, but strong enough to smell nice.</li>
            <li> Only a couple of cents more than sam&#x27;s but with fast free shipping I smell good and dont have to drive 30 miles to get them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good at keeping me dry and also easy to wash off in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It saves money and its good to be stocked for next month</li>
            <li> The only deodorant that consistently works impeccably on me.</li>
            <li> Somehow the old standby original formula works even better than all the clinical protection ones.</li>
            <li> This was a pretty good deal, as it was about the same price from Walmart (I paid $5.43)</li>
            <li> The one star deduction is for the white streaks this leaves on your nice bras or shirts if you get dressed too quickly after applying it....</li>
            <li> but I have found that there are other scents that are pleasant as well.</li>
            <li> i like its smell and lasting is also very good , i have an office job of 10 hours it works properly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought both Shower Fresh and Powder Fresh Scent.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s much more than I expected for so cheap!</li>
            <li> I do like Secret the best when it comes to deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I like the shower fresh scent</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery as well.</li>
            <li> Long lasting great product</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my shirt!</li>
            <li> Ever since I had my last pregnancy, I stay hot and sweat a lot more than I used to.</li>
            <li> and it works really well!</li>
            <li> The Shower fresh has a good odor and the scent is long lasting.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite hard working deodorant and i love having it on my subscribe and save list</li>
            <li> I like how smoothly it goes on, and the solid doesn&#x27;t burn freshly shaved underarms like the gel does.</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but very good.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Susbcribe &amp; Save.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> Secret stick deodorant x 2 are great to have on hand.</li>
            <li> The shipping is fast  </li>
            <li> I use this deodorant and it works very well for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> Not an overpowering scent but scent does last for hours even through light exercise.</li>
            <li> it worked better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sweat that much</li>
            <li> Secret is one of my most favorite deodorants.</li>
            <li> The cheaper brands of deodorant used to work fine for me, but now there are only two that will keep my dry and odor free.</li>
            <li> Keeps you dry and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> this will keep you fresh fro the entire day</li>
            <li> I usually have to have clinical protection products, but this kept me relatively dry and odor free for most of the day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This has a nice subtle smell.</li>
            <li> I have always used secret and been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> she developed an allergy to it.</li>
            <li> While reading many reviews on natural deodorant, I saw people reporting that such deodorant worked for a few days, then stopped working.</li>
            <li> I have always liked Secret.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s dry &amp; clean &amp; fresh, and no more perpetuation of stinky bacteria from day, to day, since she throws away that piece of paper after using.</li>
            <li> This scent can be harsh &amp; strong, and it leaves sticky white residues all over clothes.  </li>
            <li> I tried this sent because the two pack was so cheap compared to the grocery store where I usually buy things like this.</li>
            <li> I think I sweat maybe a little more than average</li>
            <li> I always use secret deodorant,it smells refreshing and works well.</li>
            <li> Love secret deodorant.  </li>
            <li> name Secret is well chosen as it is secretive about its most damaging ingredient.</li>
            <li> Typically,  Secret is the most reliable daily use deodorant on the market for my needs.</li>
            <li> Last all day long with no problem.</li>
            <li> I still use secret but only powder fresh</li>
            <li> It lasts long.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a &amp;#34;deodorant only&amp;#34; (minus the antiperspirant) - for women; I don&#x27;t think such a thing exists.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Secret &#x27;powered fresh&#x27; for years.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> and it has kept me dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Always an avid fan of secret solids.</li>
            <li> I received a double pack which had an Amazon coupon, so I paid less than $3 for them.</li>
            <li> It does what it should - keeps the sweat smell cut down and keeps me drier longer than other brands when I am working with the horses outside in the heat.</li>
            <li> I have tried various brands of deodorants, but always come back to the Secret Solid.  </li>
            <li> I also like it because it&#x27;s a smaller size than I usually keep at home in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I buyed it for my wife who&#x27;s allergic to almost every other brand</li>
            <li> These give me BO for some reason and it&#x27;s so sad because they smell great. :(</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s the least flowery of the bunch and doesn&#x27;t interfere with my perfume on a regular day.</li>
            <li> Keeps the sweat down.</li>
            <li> Calamine lotion kept her dry, plus no more rash.  </li>
            <li> Other deodorants cause irritation, even some other Secret deodorants, but not the Solid.</li>
            <li> My previous deoderant was discontinued</li>
            <li> But, lesson learned - wait a few minutes</li>
            <li> Secret is the only deodorant I have used in over 20 years.  </li>
            <li> Secret is a terrific product.</li>
            <li> I feel fresher and less stinky if you must know!  </li>
            <li> This is my usual brand and size.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s like putting on lotion usually.  </li>
            <li> After having used a Dove deodorant which ruined a few shirts by leaving bleached stains and another Secret deodorant which did not prevent perspiration, I ordered this</li>
            <li> I like the subtle scent.</li>
            <li> anti perspirants are not good for health.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Secret is one of those brands.</li>
            <li> I have been using Secret since I can remember.</li>
            <li> My daughter switched from Secret to calamine lotion ($1.49 a bottle).  </li>
            <li> I ordered Secret deodorant thinking it is a deodorant and not an anti perspirant.</li>
            <li> I always thought their stuff was it or the highway, since I had tried some other &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; non brand stuff that were just bad.</li>
            <li> have used Secret for years!</li>
            <li> I Secret deodorants!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with secret deodorant!  </li>
            <li> Ugh, I tried this deodorant and hate it.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible and chemically.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> The best deodorant I ever used.....</li>
            <li> this will keep you fresh fro the entire day</li>
            <li> Love the auto delivery. Item works well as shown.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought both Shower Fresh and Powder Fresh Scent. I liked Shower Fresh more. Light fragrance. Works well. There&#x27;s plenty of it. It lasts long.</li>
            <li> In good condition, corresponds to what is offered and complies with expectations</li>
            <li> This is a very good deodorant with a nice fresh scent.  I also like it because it&#x27;s a smaller size than I usually keep at home in the bathroom.  I like to keep one in my backpack or overnight bag at all times just in case I&#x27;m in need of it.  It&#x27;s easy to use and no fuss.  It&#x27;s good at keeping me dry and also easy to wash off in the shower.  I recommend it.  There are a variety of scents available on Amazon so that if you don&#x27;t like this one, you can find another one more to your liking.  This one happens to suit me best but I have found that there are other scents that are pleasant as well.</li>
            <li> I am a &amp;#34;powder fresh&amp;#34; scent wearer.  The shower scent is okay. If you know you like it already, you can get a great deal. Shipping product in the summer, received with no problems.</li>
            <li> Love love this product and pricing.  Never have to put on my list before shopping.  Thanks Susbcribe &amp; Save.</li>
            <li> Great scent, plus awesome value.  Somehow the old standby original formula works even better than all the clinical protection ones.</li>
            <li> Keeps you dry and comfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the pic&#x27;s. I Recomend</li>

            <li> been using this product for years and happy to have as a subscribe and save product.</li>
            <li> Long lasting great product and I liked the price!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for the cost. The artwork is excellent. The stretching and canvas isn&#x27;t the best but it&#x27;s much more than I expected for so cheap! I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Works really well. I love the smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my shirt!</li>
            <li> i like its smell and lasting is also very good , i have an office job of 10 hours it works properly i am satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Such a great product and a great deal! I love that leaves you feeling fresh and keep you clean. Last all day long with no problem.</li>
            <li> I have allergies and some deodorant will cause a rash. Found this years back and thought It is just not for women. It is perfect for my skin with no rash and stays on all day. Price is great on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love the twin pack! It saves money and its good to be stocked for next month</li>
            <li> I do like Secret the best when it comes to deodorant.  I feel fresher and less stinky if you must know!  I have used this for a very long time.  Amazon had it at a good price!</li>
            <li> As described, packed well. Great product, great value, great seller, and arrived on time!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this deodorant.  It goes on easy and smells nice.  Then it keeps her smelling nice all day.  The price is also easy in the wallet.  Will get again.</li>
            <li> The only deodorant that consistently works impeccably on me.</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells really good and prevents sweating during the day. I have always used secret and been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Secret &#x27;powered fresh&#x27; for years. I tried this sent because the two pack was so cheap compared to the grocery store where I usually buy things like this. I was SO impressed with the sent, I love it.</li>
            <li> Great buy. Only a couple of cents more than sam&#x27;s but with fast free shipping I smell good and dont have to drive 30 miles to get them.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works great. Has a great smell and feel. It easily last the entire day and that&#x27;s with an hour workout tagged onto the end. Keeps the sweat down.</li>
            <li> These give me BO for some reason and it&#x27;s so sad because they smell great. :(</li>
            <li> Ever since I had my last pregnancy, I stay hot and sweat a lot more than I used to. The cheaper brands of deodorant used to work fine for me, but now there are only two that will keep my dry and odor free. Secret is one of those brands. I like how smoothly it goes on, and the solid doesn&#x27;t burn freshly shaved underarms like the gel does. The Shower Fresh scent is nice, too. Not to strong, but strong enough to smell nice.</li>
            <li> I have tried various brands of deodorants, but always come back to the Secret Solid.  It gives protection without irritation.  Other deodorants cause irritation, even some other Secret deodorants, but not the Solid.</li>
            <li> My previous deoderant was discontinued so I looked at lots of beauty reviews and articles before trying this. I am very happy with it. I like the subtle scent. It doesn&#x27;t smell like deoderant. I think I sweat maybe a little more than average and it has kept me dry.</li>
            <li> This is my usual brand and size. It is $1 cheaper than buying at my local store.</li>
            <li> have used Secret for years!</li>
            <li> GF says that this is the best deodorant</li>
            <li> Secret stick deodorant x 2 are great to have on hand. It is the stick deodorant my underarms don&#x27;t react to. I would order again because the shipping was so swift as well as I love the product.</li>
            <li> I always use secret deodorant,it smells refreshing and works well.Found this on Amazon,The price for two was a very good buy.</li>
            <li> even in hot, humid island climate, this stuff works pretty good for me.  AND it doesn&#x27;t leave the white chalky stuff under arms.</li>
            <li> My husband actually uses this and he says it works better than any &amp;#34;male&amp;#34; deoderant he has tried.  He likes this scent since it is gender neutral.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a &amp;#34;deodorant only&amp;#34; (minus the antiperspirant) - for women; I don&#x27;t think such a thing exists.  When I read the description title over this item and it said &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;antiperspirant&amp;#34;, I thought I finally found it.&lt;br /&gt;It is a wonderful product, so I gave it 5 stars - but it wasn&#x27;t described accurately by Amazon. When it arrived, there it was indeed, on the label, so it isn&#x27;t what I wanted at all. It&#x27;s my own fault, I should have zoomed in on the photo and read more carefully.&lt;br /&gt;Could someone correct that in case someone else my mistake?</li>
            <li> Works great all day long!</li>
            <li> Ugh, I tried this deodorant and hate it. It leaves white residue all over the inside of my shirts.  So gross.  I will never buy again.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favourite - I&#x27;m still amazed at the variety of deodorants I can get through Amazon.com and will continue to purchase through Amazon.com - especially this one.</li>
            <li> The price is at a discount. The shipping is fast  It is good to have a spare.  This is my regular brand</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product. Would highly recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells nice and keeps sweat away when working in a hot kitchen. It also holds up during a workout.</li>
            <li> Works, smells fabulous!!!</li>
            <li> good price - fast shipping</li>
            <li> Good price.  I was puzzled as to why there wasn&#x27;t a plastic cap underneath the cap like when u buy at stores.</li>
            <li> Works great and has a pleasant smell, reminds me of babies.</li>
            <li> Good deodorant pricey for just two deodorant</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good deal for the only kind of deodorant that works well for me. I keep them in my office, car, bags, and several different rooms of my house so I can always use it on the go.</li>
            <li> Typically,  Secret is the most reliable daily use deodorant on the market for my needs. It does what it should - keeps the sweat smell cut down and keeps me drier longer than other brands when I am working with the horses outside in the heat. I like the shower fresh scent - it&#x27;s the least flowery of the bunch and doesn&#x27;t interfere with my perfume on a regular day. The one star deduction is for the white streaks this leaves on your nice bras or shirts if you get dressed too quickly after applying it....just...ick. But, lesson learned - wait a few minutes and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> Very good deodorant. Better price with subscribe and save than any retail store even if you have a coupon</li>
            <li> It works! It smells great! It is a good price.  Done and done!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this deodorant. It goes on nice and smooth. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. And it has a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> Ok, I am a Dove person. I always thought their stuff was it or the highway, since I had tried some other &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; non brand stuff that were just bad. This one I got with a coupon, and I&#x27;m in love. It feels a lot smoother, it really is invisible (sometimes Dove transfers to clothes, this one doesnt), and it has an awesome clean smell. I love it, and I&#x27;m getting more than the twin pack. Was definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite deodorant; the scent is very clean and refreshing. This was a pretty good deal, as it was about the same price from Walmart (I paid $5.43) and I didn&#x27;t have to pay tax or shipping. In addition, Amazon had a $1 off coupon for this product that made the price even lower! I hope to find this same deal the next time I need deodorant.</li>
            <li> I use this deodorant and it works very well for me. It smells great and it works all day. It&#x27;s very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I received a double pack which had an Amazon coupon, so I paid less than $3 for them. I only bought one set because I&#x27;m picky about scents. I thought mayby with the price the scent wasn&#x27;t so good, but I was surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a nice subtle smell. It&#x27;s a solid, but I have not had any problems with it sticking to or staining my clothes. It gave protection all day which is great because it&#x27;s summer. All in all I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better. Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> I have been using Secret since I can remember. The twin pack is a great buy.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I buy. It works really well. I work with horses so its really good stuff.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite deodorant! The smell is amazing and it glides on so smoothly. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Secret is the only deodorant I have used in over 20 years.  Wouldn&#x27;t dream of using anything else.</li>
            <li> Great price for two pack! Not an overpowering scent but scent does last for hours even through light exercise. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve ever used another deodorant. It is a staple item at my home. It has a nice fresh scent without being overpowering. The scent lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Secret is a terrific product. I personally do not like this scent. I still use secret but only powder fresh</li>
            <li> Nice scent.  Does the job.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, in good condition, and the  price is right. Secret is one of my most favorite deodorants.</li>
            <li> The best deodorant ever! I buyed it for my wife who&#x27;s allergic to almost every other brand and it&#x27;s been excellent. And the odor is great too.</li>
            <li> Excelent. Many years with it.</li>
            <li> I Secret deodorants! The Shower fresh has a good odor and the scent is long lasting. I would recommend this to anyone, great buy.</li>
            <li> The scent is nauseatingly strong</li>
            <li> this is my favorite hard working deodorant and i love having it on my subscribe and save list so i don&#x27;t have to remember to pick it up at the store.</li>
            <li> Always an avid fan of secret solids. I wont use anything else. Its a great bargain. too. Super fast delivery as well. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this product, i can workout with it and not worry one bit.</li>
            <li> Excellent product as always. Love secret deodorant.  Like the smell. Well reasoned price.</li>
            <li> Being able to use Subscribe and Save for items I use every day is a savings and convenience I didn&#x27;t realize that I would appreciate so much!!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years and it has not failed me yet</li>
            <li> Does a great job and smells great, too.</li>
            <li> Our favorite deoderant!  Love the scents.</li>
            <li> After having used a Dove deodorant which ruined a few shirts by leaving bleached stains and another Secret deodorant which did not prevent perspiration, I ordered this and I&#x27;m really happy with it. It does have a scent to it, but it&#x27;s quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance and good price too!</li>
            <li> Great price for an excellent product</li>
            <li> Great product,great price and it works really well!</li>
            <li> I tent to get a rash from most brands. Especially ones aimed at men. These aren&#x27;t overpowering and don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Like I just stepped out of a chemical shower. It&#x27;s an intoxicating scent.</li>
            <li> Good price / good product</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS USE THIS PRODUCT. I WISH YOU HAD MORE OF A CHOICE IN THE SCENTS OF THIS THOUGH. STILL SATISFIED.</li>
            <li> Price was fair and it does the job. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Great scent and it worked better than I expected.  I usually have to have clinical protection products, but this kept me relatively dry and odor free for most of the day.  Not perfect, but very good.  I don&#x27;t sweat that much but oh the armpit odor!  Must be body chemistry and TMI I realize, but almost nothing works at all for me, it&#x27;s like putting on lotion usually.  No wetness or odor protection whatsoever, but this I could tell I had applied.  Like I said, it didn&#x27;t work 100%, but for the average person, I&#x27;m sure it would be wonderful.  NICE, NICE scent~  Good price for a two pack!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with secret deodorant!  It smells great and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible and chemically.  I used it twice and threw both sticks in the trash.</li>
            <li> Works and smells great.  Also great price too.</li>
            <li> This scent can be harsh &amp; strong, and it leaves sticky white residues all over clothes.  Too many chemicals ingredients:  : Aluminum Zirconium Trichlorohydrex Gly Inactive Ingredients: Cyclopentasiloxane, Stearyl Alcohol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, PPG-14 Butyl Ether, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Petrolatum, Phenyl Trimethicone, Talc, Cyclodextrin, Fragrance, Mineral Oil, Behenyl Alcohol.     My daughter switched from Secret to calamine lotion ($1.49 a bottle).  Calamine lotion kept her dry, plus no more rash.  While reading many reviews on natural deodorant, I saw people reporting that such deodorant worked for a few days, then stopped working. There&#x27;s a group of bacteria on one&#x27;s armpits, and if one keeps using the same stick, the same rock, the same \\&quot;roll-on\\&quot; ... there&#x27;s contamination, or perpetual multiplying of bacteria, from the residual left-over in a warm &amp; moist environment under the plastic cap.     My kid broke out in rash from \\&quot;Secret\\&quot; after a year of using ... she developed an allergy to it. I advised her to put Calamine lotion on a CLEAN &amp; fold-up paper towel, and wipe herself every morning, then THROW AWAY that used paper. It works !! She&#x27;s dry &amp; clean &amp; fresh, and no more perpetuation of stinky bacteria from day, to day, since she throws away that piece of paper after using.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product.  It goes on smoothly without leaving a smear and appears to work well.</li>
            <li> What a good price for  this deodorant.  Works well.</li>
            <li> I ordered Secret deodorant thinking it is a deodorant and not an anti perspirant. The name is misleading. I had to give it all away as I know anti perspirants are not good for health.&lt;br /&gt;The name Secret is well chosen as it is secretive about its most damaging ingredient.</li>
