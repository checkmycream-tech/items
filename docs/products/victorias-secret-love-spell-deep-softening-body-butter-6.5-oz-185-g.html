            <li> I love Victoria&#x27;s Secret Body butter, it smells absolutely amazing!  It makes my skin feel so smooth and soft!  I put it on after the shower and it lasts all day.  I put it on again at bedtime. And my husband loves hoe it smells!</li>
            <li> Love body butter and this is a good one.  Creamy, smooth, leaves skin feeling soft and loved!  I&#x27;d buy again.  Nice soft smell.</li>
            <li> My lotion arrived in a reasonable amount of time, but otherwise I was disappointed.  The lotion was supposed to be creamy, but it was molded into one big ball.  Kind of like clay or play-doh.  I don&#x27;t know if it got too hot, if it was really old, or what.  I was greatly disappointed.</li>

            <li> I love Victoria secret love spell body butter. The packaging was well packed and I would definitely recommend it :-)</li>
            <li> Only $12 in the store well plus tax I guess its the same as online, I think it was frozen on the way over here I opened it and the top of the lotion was not a smooth flat surface it looked touched or something I&#x27;m not sure because I already have this same body butter in a different smell and it did not look like that when I opened it, and the texture feels kind of different but Im not sure because this is my first time using body butter. It smells great though and goes with the body lotion and spray I have for it from victorias secret. I suggest to just take the trip to the mall.</li>
