            <li>it works amazing</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It mists nicely and evenly when spraying legs, face, shoulders, but I cannot get it to spray evenly on my arms.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li>I love it for my face and legs, but would not recommend using it on your arms (the hardest part for me to tan).</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast but was just wrapped in brown paper so it had kind of gotten beaten up and the cap was broke.</li>
            <li>The mist is light</li>
            <li>an the smell isn&#x27;t the best, but eventually fades after a few hours..</li>
            <li>I  love this tanning spray i have tried so many different ones, i seen this one at Exotic Tans,its always sold out</li>
            <li>TO WASH MY HANDS CLEAN OF MY IDARK BRONZING LOTION</li>
            <li>I have spots on me that are white and spots that are brown..not a good look.</li>
            <li>Its a must have im very picky for me to love it</li>
            <li>This is a really good/dark body tan when you are able to do an overnight set.</li>
            <li>MAKE SURE YOUTR SKIN IS SMOOTH PRIOR TO APPLYING!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product, not only because it really works so well, but it was delivered within 2 days!</li>
            <li>I must admit, this stuff does give a very rich, natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>and I was right.</li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t spray just right</li>
            <li>Also, when it starts wearing off, It gets very, very blotchy.  </li>
            <li>It turned my skin orange and doesnt apply very well!</li>
            <li>It sprays on easily, dries quickly with the aid of a blowdryer and gives you a deep natural tan, NO ORANGE color what so ever.</li>
            <li>I would really recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve made the decision that tanning in a bed is not good for me, or my skin, this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>It either drips, or leaves concentrated splotches that I end up blotting with a kleenex and do not get as much color.</li>
            <li>Very .</li>
            <li>Very.</li>
            <li>honestly my hands an body turnd green..</li>
            <li>If you know anything about self-tanning and have tried several different options Paully D bronzing spray will become your top favorite-cant live without one after the very first try!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was more than i expected!</li>
            <li>Spraying yourself takes some practice, but this gives nice dark color and looks natural.</li>
            <li>Apply several quick sprays as needed thoughout the week to keep the healthly bronze tan.  </li>
            <li>The price is way too high for the product.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>AND WENT RIGHT BACK TO THIS LOTION!</li>
            <li>Tan is good but not thrilled with the overall product.</li>
            <li>Well i do not usually spray tan</li>
            <li>I would suggest Pauly D product to anyone eho wants a quick dark tan!</li>
            <li>I was pasty white and it looks really good for a day or two if you put it on correctly (which is very hard to do).</li>
            <li>The spray left a green tinge and it was very light.</li>
            <li>Completely covered my bathroom.</li>
            <li>Does not look natural on the face.</li>
            <li>but youll look super black</li>
            <li>I have been spray tanning myself for several years and always trying new products.</li>
            <li>Lightly mist yourself a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>The top spray nozzle was broken and couldn&#x27;t be replaced with another one.</li>

            <li> First off, I am VERY dark brown.</li>
            <li> So if you can live with the mess and blotches, give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I have used several sunless tanning sprays, and while this isn&#x27;t the worst one I&#x27;ve tried - it&#x27;s really not the best easier.</li>
            <li> Although the color itself is dark I had personally had to motion back and forth several times to feel like I covered myself.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> that looks very natural on my pale complexion.</li>
            <li> The scent is not too terrible (mild in comparison to others I have used) and the color develops instantly, which is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li> have very pale skin, typical for natural blonde/blue eyes eastern europian woman.</li>
            <li> (I am half spanish and tan EVERYDAY)</li>
            <li> This is a good product for people that already have at least a base tan.</li>
            <li> and it was way too dark for me</li>
            <li> cuz your already dark as heck&amp;#34; so i was like wth</li>
            <li> eventually yes I became dark brown</li>
            <li> It dries and you can reapply to get dark.</li>
            <li> IT MADE ME SUPPPEERRR BLACK,</li>
            <li> so I had to go over myself a few times to feel like I would achieve a dark tan.</li>
            <li> I GET SO DARK!</li>
            <li> I thought the Jersey shore cast had to know a little something about self tan</li>
            <li> and is very dark.</li>
            <li> It comes out green gets on your hands and everywhere.  </li>
            <li> AT ALL, I think its for pale people that cant tan.</li>
            <li> I TRIED JWOWWS, WAS NOT SATISFIED</li>
            <li> Then it dried on the orangey side which was too late to correct.  </li>
            <li> We had a really hard time spraying this on evenly.  </li>
            <li> VERY MESSY!</li>
            <li> It starts to flake and &amp;#34;crease&amp;#34; in the inside part of my arm where it bends at the elbow - maybe I am doing something wrong?</li>
            <li> She turned a orange color and it streaked leaving behind what looked to be stretch marks on her!</li>
            <li> , ill give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I got this product and really am not to happy with it!</li>
            <li> It streaks like crazy and the color is so fake...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna have to suck it up and go to the salon and pay the $40. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this one.</li>
            <li> Sorry Pauly D!!</li>
            <li> I had to scrubb for days to get this crap off!!  </li>

            <li> If you know anything about self-tanning and have tried several different options Paully D bronzing spray will become your top favorite-cant live without one after the very first try!&lt;br /&gt;I have very pale skin, typical for natural blonde/blue eyes eastern europian woman. This self-tanner literally does the magic trick turning me into a bronzed babe from the tropics in a matter of 4-5 hours!!! It is not just my favorite tanning product but my life saver! :) Would recomend it to all my friends and anyone who appreciates quality at home tanning on a budget!</li>
            <li> I was pasty white and it looks really good for a day or two if you put it on correctly (which is very hard to do). HOWEVER It does not come off well at all...I have spots on me that are white and spots that are brown..not a good look. I would not buy this product again. Next time I need an insta-tan...I&#x27;m gonna have to suck it up and go to the salon and pay the $40. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Awesome! Love it!! Used product before with great results. I would suggest Pauly D product to anyone eho wants a quick dark tan!</li>
            <li> this is the BEST tanning spray i have used. goes on amazingly. and is very dark. recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> BEST TANNIGN SPRAY EVER! I GET SO DARK! (I ALSO TAN IN TANNING BED IN BETWEEN)IT LASTS WEEKS!!! MAKE SURE YOUTR SKIN IS SMOOTH PRIOR TO APPLYING! MOISTURIZE DAILY AND IT WILL LAST! ITS A BROWN TAN, NOT ORANGEY! I TRIED JWOWWS, WAS NOT SATISFIED AT ALL! AND WENT RIGHT BACK TO THIS LOTION! IT IS AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I  love this tanning spray i have tried so many different ones, i seen this one at Exotic Tans,its always sold out so i went on to amazon i thought i would try it......................Its a must have im very picky for me to love it means everyone will .......</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I am brown not orange! Love it! Spraying tip: if it runs or drips you are holding it too close to your body and over spraying. Lightly mist yourself a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead so I use all kinds of instant tan products and this one is at the bottom...It streaks like crazy and the color is so fake...Yuck!!  I had to scrubb for days to get this crap off!!  Sorry Pauly D!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product, not only because it really works so well, but it was delivered within 2 days! I didn&#x27;t even have to wait!&lt;br /&gt;the product doesnt leave you feeling sticky, or looking orange. I would really recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve made the decision that tanning in a bed is not good for me, or my skin, this is the next best thing. PLUS, who doesn&#x27;t want instant results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> We had a really hard time spraying this on evenly.  Then it dried on the orangey side which was too late to correct.  Will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I thought the Jersey shore cast had to know a little something about self tan and I was right. Spraying yourself takes some practice, but this gives nice dark color and looks natural.</li>
            <li> I have used several sunless tanning sprays, and while this isn&#x27;t the worst one I&#x27;ve tried - it&#x27;s really not the best easier. I love it for my face and legs, but would not recommend using it on your arms (the hardest part for me to tan). It mists nicely and evenly when spraying legs, face, shoulders, but I cannot get it to spray evenly on my arms. It either drips, or leaves concentrated splotches that I end up blotting with a kleenex and do not get as much color. It starts to flake and &amp;#34;crease&amp;#34; in the inside part of my arm where it bends at the elbow - maybe I am doing something wrong? I have never had this problem with a sunless spray. The scent is not too terrible (mild in comparison to others I have used) and the color develops instantly, which is a huge bonus. I would give it 5 stars if I could figure out how to get it to work for my arms. It gives a deep, brown color (no red/orange at all) after only one application (I had to do two or three with Snooki&#x27;s sunless spray to achieve the same level of darkness) that looks very natural on my pale complexion.</li>
            <li> It was damaged when it arrived. The top spray nozzle was broken and couldn&#x27;t be replaced with another one.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for people that already have at least a base tan. I have light/red skin and it was way too dark for me and if you don&#x27;t spray just right you end up with blotches. But overall it&#x27;s a goo product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and it was horrible! She turned a orange color and it streaked leaving behind what looked to be stretch marks on her!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! it works amazing and i&#x27;ve already ordered it multiple times! Just waiting on more! It is a great price also for this. I have already reccommended it to friends/ family. It was more than i expected!</li>
            <li> - 1. This is my biggest con. I got TWO SPRAYS out of this. The mist is light so I had to go over myself a few times to feel like I would achieve a dark tan. Although the color itself is dark I had personally had to motion back and forth several times to feel like I covered myself.&lt;br /&gt;2. Very . Very. VERY MESSY! Completely covered my bathroom. Even in the shower it still made my shower gross after I rinsed it out.&lt;br /&gt;3. The price is way too high for the product.&lt;br /&gt;4. The tan lasted about 4-5 days.&lt;br /&gt;Will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  It sprays on easily, dries quickly with the aid of a blowdryer and gives you a deep natural tan, NO ORANGE color what so ever. Apply as needed until the desired color is acheived.  People stop me and ask what island have I just been to.  Apply several quick sprays as needed thoughout the week to keep the healthly bronze tan.  Evenly covers uniformly with the aid of a cotton ball.  Great stuff!  The best I ever found.  The best on the marker today!!</li>
            <li> First off, I am VERY dark brown. (I am half spanish and tan EVERYDAY) sun and in the bed. Well i do not usually spray tan AT ALL, I think its for pale people that cant tan. anyway, my girl at my tanning salon suggested this product to me. &#x27;&#x27;I know you dont spray but youll look super black cuz your already dark as heck&amp;#34; so i was like wth, ill give it a shot. Well, I ordered some bottles. camein, I exfoliated my skin very well but YUCK!!!!!!!! YES IT MADE ME SUPPPEERRR BLACK, BUT I WENT TO THE TANNING BED ABOUT TWO HOURS LATER AND GUESS WHAT I USED THE *SHOWER IN THE BOTTLE* TO WASH MY HANDS CLEAN OF MY IDARK BRONZING LOTION AS ALWAYS AND ALLLLL THE PAULY D SPRAY TAN JUST STARTED DRIPPING OFF AS SOON AS A LITTLE WATER TOUCHED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NEVERRRRR BUY IT AGAIN EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> So I bought this with mixed feelings, I have to say it does work, but I used this almost like a mystic tan I used my hands an spread it in, bmt honestly my hands an body turnd green..I don&#x27;t get it...eventually yes I became dark brown an the smell isn&#x27;t the best, but eventually fades after a few hours..</li>
            <li> I have been spray tanning myself for several years and always trying new products. I was disappointed in this one. The spray left a green tinge and it was very light. I am a big fan of Jwowws and Snookis</li>
            <li> This is a really good/dark body tan when you are able to do an overnight set. It dries and you can reapply to get dark. lasts 3-4 days. I would buy this again. Does not look natural on the face.</li>
            <li> I got this product and really am not to happy with it! It turned my skin orange and doesnt apply very well! The shipping was very fast but was just wrapped in brown paper so it had kind of gotten beaten up and the cap was broke.</li>
            <li> I must admit, this stuff does give a very rich, natural looking tan.  The problem with it is that if you spray it inside, like in your bathroom, the whole place gets green.  It comes out green gets on your hands and everywhere.  Now I go outside to spray it to avoid this.  Also, when it starts wearing off, It gets very, very blotchy.  It doesn&#x27;t wear off evenly.  So if you can live with the mess and blotches, give it a try.  Tan is good but not thrilled with the overall product.</li>
