            <li>To Buy More ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜˜</li>
            <li>I saw these rings on some peoples hand and love the look.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay -</li>
            <li>Cute</li>
            <li>I utterly love these rings, they are so God damn cute.</li>
            <li>They are lovely.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, most of them are adjustable, but the wider-banded ones aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The rings are spectacular and fit like a glove.</li>
            <li>its okay</li>
            <li>Fun and cute rings, good addition to jewelry collection.</li>
            <li>By the 3rd wear they looked like rose gold lol.</li>
            <li>Cool rings for every fashionista out there!</li>
            <li>They feel durable and will probably not fall apart easily.</li>
            <li>The rings came pretty promptly, and were an amazing bargain.</li>
            <li>The sizes are huge, no sizes posted on listing, I guess i should have asked before purchasing and wasting money.</li>
            <li>huge.</li>
            <li>these turned brown within the 1st weeks, I got a rash on 2 of my fingers from wearing it, its really cheap</li>
            <li>The Rings Fit</li>
            <li>Looks cheap ...</li>
            <li>Cheap,  do not buy.</li>
            <li>These rings will turn colors on you if you&#x27;re wearing them say in the summer or warm places, but I think if you stick to winter with these rings then maybe they won&#x27;t turn as much.</li>
            <li>Overall, great quality for the price.</li>
            <li>All rings fit one finger.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cheap looking and doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>I lived the rings but some didn&#x27;t fit my finger though but</li>
            <li>Purchased them, received them in 2 weeks, and I love them so much!</li>
            <li>it right up!</li>
            <li>If you intend to only wear these once or twice theyre a good buy.</li>
            <li>Fast and love the product</li>
            <li>But Other Than That Product Was Great</li>
            <li>On the one hand, they were pretty much what I expected, which is a cheap knockoff of very cool rings, and the seller was great, they arrived on time, etc.</li>
            <li>Came quick.</li>
            <li>Nice rings but to fit to big.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>luckily I took a jewelry class</li>
            <li>These rings are decent costume jewelry, great for dressing up for a dinner or a date, but not to wear all day, or on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>so I know how to make them smaller :) I&#x27;ll wear them today!</li>
            <li>I suggest putting on some clear nail polish just to make sure the finishing does not fade away.</li>
            <li>Love the rings,  I can mix up with other pieces :)</li>
            <li>Everyone was right.</li>
            <li>they are exactly what i wanted for such an amazing price.</li>
            <li>fit smaller than id thought they would, but its easy to make them work.</li>
            <li>Not to mention I got them a lot sooner then expected, and just ordered more for my sister!</li>
            <li>The gold fades off quickly but you can just put some clear coat on it as a quick fix.</li>
            <li>They have a pretty shimmer &amp; shine.</li>
            <li>Most of these are too big to even keep on.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;d like to say that I wear a size 9 in rings</li>
            <li>This product is inexpensive, and you get exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Cute to wear occasionally.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not midi rings they only fit on the first digit.</li>
            <li>: use clear nail polish on the inside so it doesn&#x27;t get ruined quickly.</li>
            <li>They rust extremely fast and fit loosely, especially since I have relatively large fingers.</li>
            <li>its very good the first week, and after that they turn a dark green</li>
            <li>The rings are nice but WAY to big for my fingers fit like regular rings in fact they are too big for regular rings but the shipping was fine.</li>
            <li>Worth the price and delivered early.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>But the quality was very poorâ€¦.they&#x27;re</li>
            <li>I got compliments on them, even as they were escaping my fingers, so I went ahead and bought the real thingâ€¦.</li>
            <li>They are way to big to fit any finger but my thumb.</li>
            <li>Non of them fit they are too big...</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>some of them fit but some are too big</li>
            <li>The arrived earlier than expected, nice packaging.</li>
            <li>It just feels really cheap and wrong in the sense that, the metal is more suitable for making a bangle due to its thickness rather than a ring.</li>
            <li>They are made of cheap metal, and within the first minute of wearing them made my fingers itch and start to turn green.</li>
            <li>Recommend putting clear nail polish on them!</li>
            <li>The rings are all one size, and are pretty big.</li>
            <li>I coated them with clear polish</li>
            <li>It came early and I was pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li>I wore the rings fit like three hours and finger turned green</li>
            <li>Definitely not everyday rings.</li>
            <li>Very cute rings, the thin circle rings are kinda big though.</li>
            <li>But one problem is they might be too small for some people to fit on their fingers.</li>
            <li>After reading many of the other reviews on this product, I was skeptical because these rings are so cheap.</li>
            <li>BUT the thinner rings are actually key chain rings (a great disappointment).</li>
            <li>turn your fingers and ring green quick.</li>
            <li>But these are not really mid finger rings unless I just have small fingers because they fit on every finger even my thumb.</li>
            <li>They also don&#x27;t have the classy effect of rings similar to this.</li>
            <li>I ended up taking some wire cutters and modified the smaller bands (The thick ones are one solid piece, so I wasn&#x27;t able to shrink them).</li>
            <li>After just first day of wearing them (over 5hrs) it started to change colors - less gold and started to have a silver/gray shades.</li>
            <li>Not only did they quickly change from gold to a gross brownish color, but my fingers were green for days after as well.</li>

            <li> Not only did they quickly change from gold to a gross brownish color, but my fingers were green for days after as well.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that i had  gotton my rings in the mail and opened them right away.</li>
            <li> but the thin ones are adjustable and the thick ones fit on my first and middle finger!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obvious the gold color will not last long.</li>
            <li> They came fast but my fingers are too small for some of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to put clear nail polish on them to keep my finger from turning green though.</li>
            <li> To avoid the green finger thing a coat of clear nail polish fixes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too upset about the thin rings the price is worth the thicker ones.</li>
            <li> They are all one sized, so they are a little too big for me</li>
            <li> A Little Big.</li>
            <li> Left my finger a little green, but nothing a little clear nailpolish couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Those rings never fit to big</li>
            <li> Instantly turned fingers green after an hour of wear</li>
            <li> When I took the rings off they left my hands with green tint.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> , I think the edges would&#x27;ve been sharp.</li>
            <li> so that may help you reason with how big or small these rings are.</li>
            <li> All the rings are a tiny bit big to be considered midi rings, but the thin gold ones can be adjusted.</li>
            <li> i was thing to get a couple of edgy mid ring</li>
            <li> They are really loose on me, but I have small hands, and they are still wearable for me.</li>

            <li> it doesnt say the size, but definitely too big maybe they are a size 9!</li>
            <li> fit smaller than id thought they would, but its easy to make them work. they look cute with almost any outfit!</li>
            <li> I no they are cheap but they are faded and broken not satisified</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t for women with small fingers, ring size 4-5. These things were even too big for my thumb. Waste of money, bc I can&#x27;t even wear them. The quality of them are nice though. Too bad.</li>
            <li> The arrived earlier than expected, nice packaging. They have a pretty shimmer &amp; shine. They feel durable and will probably not fall apart easily. I suggest putting on some clear nail polish just to make sure the finishing does not fade away.</li>
            <li> I give this a 3 star for a reason&lt;br /&gt;1. It came early and I was pleasantly surprised&lt;br /&gt;2. The rings aren&#x27;t knuckle rings&lt;br /&gt;3. They are all one sized, so they are a little too big for me&lt;br /&gt;4. These rings are only colored fake gold&lt;br /&gt;5. Metal hoops</li>
            <li> These rings look like the pictures and considering the price I won&#x27;t complain about the quality. But these are not really mid finger rings unless I just have small fingers because they fit on every finger even my thumb.</li>
            <li> Came so fasttttt ! I love my rings they are exactly what i wanted for such an amazing price. I will order more soon</li>
            <li> i love it its perfect</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them</li>
            <li> The quality is low, which is what one should expect for the price. These rings are decent costume jewelry, great for dressing up for a dinner or a date, but not to wear all day, or on a daily basis. They simply won&#x27;t hold up if used regularly. That said, they look pretty awesome on! They are really loose on me, but I have small hands, and they are still wearable for me.</li>
            <li> 1 time use. These things changed in one day. They also don&#x27;t have the classy effect of rings similar to this. It just feels really cheap and wrong in the sense that, the metal is more suitable for making a bangle due to its thickness rather than a ring.</li>
            <li> They turned my fingers green....</li>
            <li> these turned brown within the 1st weeks, I got a rash on 2 of my fingers from wearing it, its really cheap so I guess u get what you pay for. wont be buying again.</li>
            <li> they look way to gawty for my taste i was thing to get a couple of edgy mid ring but i did not i can only use 3 of them</li>
            <li> It Came A Couple Weeks Before It Said So Proud About That The Rings Fit A Little Big. But That&#x27;s Because I Have Skinny Fingers But Other Than That Product Was Great Looking Forward To Buy More ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜˜</li>
            <li> They get stuck on my fingers, they have turned my fingers green in the area where I&#x27;ve had the ring on all day and they changed colors already..</li>
            <li> Came quick. Nice rings but to fit to big. I only could of wore them for a day until they started slippin off and lost some.</li>
            <li> I saw these rings on some peoples hand and love the look. I like that I can change them at anytime</li>
            <li> I love these rings!! They are a tad bit smaller than I thought but that&#x27;s okay - I use the mini ones as mid-rings.</li>
            <li> The rings are nice but WAY to big for my fingers fit like regular rings in fact they are too big for regular rings but the shipping was fine.</li>
            <li> Great set of rings !! Pair them up with different styles , different looks !  I think it&#x27;s a great look for night or during the day</li>
            <li> These rings are regular size 7-8. It&#x27;s obvious the gold color will not last long. I like the different sized widths.</li>
            <li> They look nice but the color doesn&#x27;t stay. Worth the price and delivered early. Makes the hand look elegant! Good.</li>
            <li> The rings came pretty promptly, and were an amazing bargain. But they turn color with air/water exposure.  I wore some once, and went to put them away and they were already a different color than the ones I hadnt worn. By the 3rd wear they looked like rose gold lol. If you intend to only wear these once or twice theyre a good buy. If you plan to keep them even a season, id go with another brand.</li>
            <li> Most of these are too big to even keep on.  I am not sure if they were made for men or what?</li>
            <li> Those rings never fit to big</li>
            <li> Turned my fingers green within a couple hours. Quick delivery</li>
            <li> Cute but you get what you pay for. I wore the rings fit like three hours and finger turned green</li>
            <li> Looks cheap ... Save your money</li>
            <li> its very good the first week, and after that they turn a dark green</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not midi rings they only fit on the first digit. That being said they are still very cute and well made considering the price. I&#x27;m going to put clear nail polish on them to keep my finger from turning green though. Yes, I would recommend these. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I put two stars just because of the fact that when I wore them one flew of my hand because they were so big.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these rings also. They are very nice. Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Rings turned my fingers green within less than 5 hours. Cheap,  do not buy.</li>
            <li> On the one hand, they were pretty much what I expected, which is a cheap knockoff of very cool rings, and the seller was great, they arrived on time, etc. But the quality was very poorâ€¦.they&#x27;re basically gold washers and they&#x27;re HUGE! I have small fingers, but these kept flying off my handsâ€¦.if they were smaller though, I think the edges would&#x27;ve been sharp. I got compliments on them, even as they were escaping my fingers, so I went ahead and bought the real thingâ€¦.</li>
            <li> Very cute rings, the thin circle rings are kinda big though.</li>
            <li> When I first got the rings they were great they however or fake so within a day they turned copper or brass lol</li>
            <li> Turned me green. And once you take them out of the plastic, they tarnish. Not a good product at all. You get what you pay for. Also, they run very small. They are from China.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I still have these rings lol. Everyone was right. These rings will turn colors on you if you&#x27;re wearing them say in the summer or warm places, but I think if you stick to winter with these rings then maybe they won&#x27;t turn as much. I wouldn&#x27;t buy there&#x27;s again though. They also were different sizes for me because my hands are bigger. My ring finer is a 7 1/2 so that may help you reason with how big or small these rings are.</li>
            <li> The thicker rings are great quality they fit just right and are a great styling piece BUT the thinner rings are actually key chain rings (a great disappointment). The gold fades off quickly but you can just put some clear coat on it as a quick fix. I&#x27;m not too upset about the thin rings the price is worth the thicker ones.</li>
            <li> turn your fingers and ring green quick.</li>
            <li> Instantly turned fingers green after an hour of wear</li>
            <li> Wonderful look, they were so pretty and they look amazing. But one problem is they might be too small for some people to fit on their fingers. To me they fit perfectly and they look amazing, but it&#x27;s just something to think about</li>
            <li> I utterly love these rings, they are so God damn cute. My only complaint is that i had  gotton my rings in the mail and opened them right away. I had them on for only about five minutes and they turned my finger green. When i had removed them. I guess you get what you payed for. I still love them and very stylish.</li>
            <li> They are lovely. But they are really small. Thankfully, most of them are adjustable, but the wider-banded ones aren&#x27;t. They are made of cheap metal, and within the first minute of wearing them made my fingers itch and start to turn green. Recommend putting clear nail polish on them!</li>
            <li> Good looking rings for a way lower price on here than in my neighborhood.</li>
            <li> They are way to big to fit any finger but my thumb.</li>
            <li> Nice rings I use some for toe rings love them I coated them with clear polish so they wont  change</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really cute! Left my finger a little green, but nothing a little clear nailpolish couldn&#x27;t fix. Not to mention I got them a lot sooner then expected, and just ordered more for my sister!</li>
            <li> The sizes are huge, no sizes posted on listing, I guess i should have asked before purchasing and wasting money.</li>
            <li> Fast and love the product</li>
            <li> I have been looking around for these rings everywhere online and I&#x27;ve finally found them! Purchased them, received them in 2 weeks, and I love them so much! They all fit perfectly :)</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;d like to say that I wear a size 9 in rings so my fingers are in no way skinny. After reading many of the other reviews on this product, I was skeptical because these rings are so cheap. All the rings are a tiny bit big to be considered midi rings, but the thin gold ones can be adjusted. I noticed some people were saying these rings turned their fingers green. I have not had this problem, but if this happens to you, you can always use nail polish to coat the inside of the ring. Overall, great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> When I took the rings off they left my hands with green tint.&lt;br /&gt;They are way too big - my ring size is a 6.5</li>
            <li> Product does not fit my fingers. All rings fit one finger. The gold finish must have worn off by the time they made it to me. They looked dull. Wish the rings were adjustable. Delivery did take a while</li>
            <li> They rust extremely fast and fit loosely, especially since I have relatively large fingers. None of them are midi rings</li>
            <li> The ring sizes are all about 7-8 and I&#x27;m usually a 6 but the thin ones are adjustable and the thick ones fit on my first and middle finger! To avoid the green finger thing a coat of clear nail polish fixes it right up! I love them!</li>
            <li> Non of them fit they are too big... huge. ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž i lost my money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cheap looking and doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> turns green after one wash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a size 7/8 in ring so these are a bit too small for me but I love them!! Tip: use clear nail polish on the inside so it doesn&#x27;t get ruined quickly. They&#x27;re simple gold rings so, you can wear them with everything! happy customer :))</li>
            <li> The rings are spectacular and fit like a glove. I would recommend these to my closest friends. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I lived the rings but some didn&#x27;t fit my finger though but its okay I still loved it. Next time please put a size that way we will know what size the rings are.</li>
            <li> They came fast but my fingers are too small for some of them. luckily I took a jewelry class so I know how to make them smaller :) I&#x27;ll wear them today!</li>
            <li> Pros: Looks really great when you wear them as a set&lt;br /&gt;Cons: 1. All of them are too big that they can fall off, 2. After just first day of wearing them (over 5hrs) it started to change colors - less gold and started to have a silver/gray shades.</li>
            <li> Cool rings for every fashionista out there!</li>
            <li> Love the rings,  I can mix up with other pieces :)</li>
            <li> It made me mad how my fingers started turning green the second time i wore them, water didnt even touch my hand and it turned green &amp; thats not cute but i guess u pay for what u get smh</li>
            <li> These looked So beautiful when i got then that i wore them a few says after i for them. Had then on for about 5 hours and my fingers turned a scary green colour</li>
            <li> The rings turned an ugly brown the minute any water touched them. Not happy with these.</li>
            <li> Please do not order these!!!! I wore these for an Eridan Ampora cosplay and they got stuck to my fingers and stopped circulation!!! In the end i had to use a wire cutter and pry the ring off, and succeeded in shredding up my finger in the process.  Not only did they quickly change from gold to a gross brownish color, but my fingers were green for days after as well.</li>
            <li> It took times but finally i got it .my daughter like it</li>
            <li> very nice I love them!!</li>
            <li> The rings are all one size, and are pretty big. I ended up taking some wire cutters and modified the smaller bands (The thick ones are one solid piece, so I wasn&#x27;t able to shrink them). After wearing them for the day, the thicker bands left green discoloration on my finger, but nothing horrible. This product is inexpensive, and you get exactly what you pay for. Take that into consideration.</li>
            <li> Fun and cute rings, good addition to jewelry collection.</li>
            <li> some of them fit but some are too big</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for.  Cute to wear occasionally.  Definitely not everyday rings.</li>
            <li> this product is very good</li>
