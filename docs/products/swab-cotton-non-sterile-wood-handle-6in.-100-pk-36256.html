            <li>Strong wooden handles and durable cotton swab head.</li>

            <li>My Only Problem With The 6\\&quot; Q-tips Are The Wooden Sticks Breaking Very Easy.</li>

            <li>Rip-off product, good for nothing.  </li>
            <li>Cotton stays on the head and handles are just the right length for detailed work that requires a little bit more reach than an ordinary Q- tip.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like the extra length for getting at places that are hard to reach, good for tape heads also, I do wish the cotton would stay on the stems a little better,</li>
            <li>Strong handles, no lint, and long enough to reach all the nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li>After actually getting a chance to use these I have to say they are absolute junk!</li>

            <li>The wood shaft is soft enough to not scratch or damage items.</li>
            <li>I use the swabs to clean and lube hard to reach areas of some of my guns.</li>
            <li>These swabs reach those  hard to reach nooks in inkjet printers so clean copies can be printed.  </li>
            <li>These items leave no fuzz, lint, behind they are great for cleaning inside grip or any hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>Every time I try to use them to clean hard to reach places, they snap in two and simply frustrate me.  </li>
            <li>These are great for random cleaning operations on small equipment.  </li>

            <li> The only downside is the long stick is very thin and breaks easy.</li>
            <li> About six inches long with a Q-tip like swab on the one end.  </li>
            <li> Long cotton swabs used for cleaning guns.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something with just a little bit longer reach than a standard swab for doing flower pollination, I&#x27;m just a hobbyist and</li>
            <li> I wish they had made it a little thicker or out of plastic like regular cotton swabs.</li>
            <li> Item worked very well and had tight wrapped cotton, so there were no issues with fraying or fuzzies left behind on the products I was cleaning.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, and these cotton swabs are just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I needed long ones to reach hidden places.</li>
            <li> the wood strength is not consistent.</li>
            <li> most times I get the job done any ways, and over all they do not to bad when under heavy duty use.</li>
            <li> You need a ton of Q-tips to get in the hard to reach areas, and a lot of times, they are just simply to short and too flimsy to do the job.</li>
            <li> The swabs pictured have at least twice the cotton that the swabs that I paid for and received actually have!  </li>
            <li> These little gens make cleaning odd areas a breeze and should be part of any gun owners cleaning kit.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty difficult to write a negative review for cotton swabs</li>
            <li> I use them for cleaning tight spots in my cat water fountain!  </li>
            <li> The heads are very tightly bound, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with unraveling or lint.</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;swabs&amp;#34; have so little cotton at the tips that I almost have to squint to see it!</li>
            <li> Also, the cotton swabs are quite small, which means these are one... and done.</li>
            <li> I use these for cleaning guns, small parts, electronics, etc..</li>

            <li> I use thes for cleaning and oiling my AR receiver parts.</li>
            <li> This product came on time and was just what I was looking for.  Will order again when needed for sure!  I use them for cleaning tight spots in my cat water fountain!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Good swabs for cleaning things.</li>
            <li> Do the job just right....</li>
            <li> When you think of &amp;#34;birch wood&amp;#34; you think of some rigidity and strength. A bit of pressure on these sticks while cleaning however and they snap, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to any one. Also, the cotton swabs are quite small, which means these are one... and done.</li>
            <li> These swabs are exactly what I needed.  I use them for cleaning my dogs&#x27; ears as well as cleaning out bottle straws when the liquid sticks on the inside of the straws.</li>
            <li> I really like the product. I use it to clean a filter.Wish the stick was a bit longer but better then nothing. It holds up well for the cleaning I do with it. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Carcinogen warning. Thank god they have to put those label. Don&#x27;t use for oral, ear, or skin care as you normally would use swabs</li>
            <li> They are fine. General purpose swabs.</li>
            <li> Oh i know, you aren&#x27;t suppose to shove cotton swabs in your ear to clean inside but I do and you know you do too.  I recommend these for such a purpose because A. I have never had a stick break  and B. the cotton part is not too thick, just perfect for scooping around inside your ear canal.</li>
            <li> I use these for cleaning guns, small parts, electronics, etc.. and I love that the cotton part can be wet with alcohol or cleaning fluids and NOT come off during use.  The wood shaft is soft enough to not scratch or damage items.</li>
            <li> Exactly as listed quick service</li>
            <li> Makes the detail work and cleaning up off craft &amp; art work easier.</li>
            <li> We use them to clean out our dogs ears to help rid them of ear mites.  I use the swabs to clean and lube hard to reach areas of some of my guns.</li>
            <li> These cotton swabs work good on cleaning guns and getting into tight spots. They are fragile and you cannot put too much pressure on them before they snap.&lt;br /&gt;JR Long Beach, CA</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. You can use it make up or health reasons. It was nice. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great quality swaps for cleaning electronics.  Haven&#x27;t had any issues.  The heads are very tightly bound, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with unraveling or lint.</li>
            <li> i use these to clean my guns and i have no complaints what so ever. it&#x27;s pretty difficult to write a negative review for cotton swabs and i&#x27;m not going to write one now. they do what they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> These are great for random cleaning operations on small equipment.  Could also be used for many other things.  About six inches long with a Q-tip like swab on the one end.  The sticks are thin and not terribly strong but they work.</li>
            <li> After actually getting a chance to use these I have to say they are absolute junk! They have ZERO ability to take any side load. If you swab something in and out they work substandard. If you try to swab along a surface they break.  Tooth picks have more strength than these. I don&#x27;t know what wood they use but these are worthless.</li>
            <li> These items leave no fuzz, lint, behind they are great for cleaning inside grip or any hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Cotton is heavy and won&#x27;t stay on the applicator very well.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality break easily</li>
            <li> These work really well for cleaning your cat or dog&#x27;s ears.  Just remember: only clean the outer portion of the ear.</li>
            <li> I use the swabs for many applications, from  cleaning electronic circuits, to medical swabs. Like the extra length for getting at places that are hard to reach, good for tape heads also, I do wish the cotton would stay on the stems a little better, most times I get the job done any ways, and over all they do not to bad when under heavy duty use. Judgment or common sense dictates here. Over all I&#x27;m pleased with product, shipping and handling included.</li>
            <li> These swabs reach those  hard to reach nooks in inkjet printers so clean copies can be printed.  They are very useful in this labor.</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning guns.</li>
            <li> IT IS JUST WHAT I NEEDED</li>
            <li> These little gens make cleaning odd areas a breeze and should be part of any gun owners cleaning kit. Cheap and a great time saver.</li>
            <li> it is often said that many shooters shoot their firearms just to claen them.  These swabs do an excellent job in continuing the fun.</li>
            <li> When I run out will be buying more. Great price.  Was delivered in a timely fashion.  Use them to clean out my puppy&#x27;s ears.</li>
            <li> My Only Problem With The 6\\&quot; Q-tips Are The Wooden Sticks Breaking Very Easy. I Use Them For Detailing Autos And Trucks But You Can&#x27;t Put Much Pressure On Them.</li>
            <li> Long cotton swabs used for cleaning guns.  Work great though they are a little brittle, cannot really apply much pressure or they just snap.  But decent.</li>
            <li> I needed these to clean the ink in my printer. I needed long ones to reach hidden places. worked great.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic for cleaning hard-to-reach places.  I purchased them to clean the tight spots in the aquarium filter and was really impressed that 1 swab held up so well.</li>
            <li> Arrived just as I was told.  Works great for small cleaning spaces.  When I get low, I will re-order.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the cheapest 6in swabs I could find and these fit the bill. I don&#x27;t need them for anything that requires high durability or strength and I am happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something with just a little bit longer reach than a standard swab for doing flower pollination, I&#x27;m just a hobbyist and these work well enough for me to be happy.</li>
            <li> Good tips but QA needs to improve for the stems. the wood strength is not consistent.</li>
            <li> Very good for cleaning electronics,applicators,cats and dogs ears etc. Anyplace a longer than usual qtip is needed.Some swabs come with cotton on both ends,not all packages do. Check.</li>
            <li> they are very thin....they break if used to hard or lots of pressure is on them... but otherwise they are great!</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;swabs&amp;#34; have so little cotton at the tips that I almost have to squint to see it! The swabs pictured have at least twice the cotton that the swabs that I paid for and received actually have!  A total waste of my money:-(</li>
            <li> Great Price and great quality.  Tips don&#x27;t fall off or leave any cotton particles behind.  Would highly recommend this product for the price.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what Amazon says they are, cotton swabs on a six inch wooden stick. Nothing more nothing less. I would and will buy again, great for gun cleaning.</li>
            <li> I use these to clean my pistols. Great quality and you can&#x27;t beat the price. These will go on my reorder list!!!</li>
            <li> I got these for cleaning and getting in those hard to reach areas. The sticks are a little thin so they can easily snap, but aside from that, they work great!</li>
            <li> Thanks!  These are better than I exspected &amp; very useful.  Consider putting them&lt;br /&gt;on &amp;#34;home page&amp;#34; of your ads.  Smile!</li>
            <li> Perfect for those hard to reach places while cleaning your firearms.  For the price, an indispensable tool on my workbench!</li>
            <li> This is what I have been frustrated over when cleaning rifles. You need a ton of Q-tips to get in the hard to reach areas, and a lot of times, they are just simply to short and too flimsy to do the job. These are nice and long, sturdy, and inexpensive. To clean your rifle properly, this is just a must have.</li>
            <li> The only downside is the long stick is very thin and breaks easy. I wish they had made it a little thicker or out of plastic like regular cotton swabs. Over all is good. i use them to clean small parts</li>
            <li> Good for both cleaning skittish cats&#x27; eyes and electronic equipment.</li>
            <li> These work great for cleaning our dogs ears.  She seems to get mites and we have to go into her ear to clean them out.  The Vet uses these.</li>
            <li> They work for cleaning my firearms</li>
            <li> Strong handles, no lint, and long enough to reach all the nooks and crannies. Bought theses to clean guns, but ended up using them on just about everything.</li>
            <li> how do you review cotton swabs? It&#x27;s cotton on the end of a stick...</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, and these cotton swabs are just what I expected. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!! :) Get them ASAP.</li>
            <li> Good quality q-tips. But the package is very small. If you intend to use regularly, you should by more for sure!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product, Ty!</li>
            <li> What can I say, they are cotton swabs, I use them to clean my Cocker Spaniel&#x27;s ears. They look just like the one&#x27;s the Vet uses.</li>
            <li> There are actually exactly 100 in the bag which is surprising - someone who was equally as OCD as me counted them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside of these after some use is some of the sticks splinter and crack after use if you apply a fair bit of pressure to them, but for most uses they work fine.  The extra length is just what I needed.</li>
            <li> These swabs changedy life.  They swab so good it cured my EBOLA. They saved me from freezing in the wilderness by providing kindling. And saved me from thugs when their inherent ninjutsu weaponry use came in handy as darts.  Yep! Some dandy useful swabs!  I&#x27;m buying more soon!</li>
            <li> Rip-off product, good for nothing.  The sticks they use are so flimsy that they break under the slightest pressure. They used so little cotton on the tips that the end of the stick pokes through rendering them useless. These are cheap in price and cheaper in quality.  Every time I try to use them to clean hard to reach places, they snap in two and simply frustrate me.  Do Not Buy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;m able to reach the middle of my back with these. I bought these to apply cream to my back</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted for the small use applications that need a longer length.  Perfect for eyebrow waxing and such</li>
            <li> My husband uses thest to clean electronics.  They are very stable and he is completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Ordered to keep wound clean &amp; doctored.  The only problem is they are not sterile which I will have to have next time I order.</li>
            <li> My order of five bags of one hundred arrived quickly and without any issues. I purchased them specifically for the cleaning of my personal firearms. They are excellent tools for such a purpose.</li>
            <li> use these to clean a lot of different items</li>
            <li> The wood rods break very easily.</li>
            <li> Strong wooden handles and durable cotton swab head. Perfect for DIYers. I purchased these to clean the tape path on my reel to reel and they work great. Cotton stays on the head and handles are just the right length for detailed work that requires a little bit more reach than an ordinary Q- tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The swabs I received came in an autoclave bag so I am assuming that these could be sterilized for medical usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gonna order a stack of these and keep them in a mason jar for future projects.</li>
            <li> These are great for light cleaning and are strong and do not leave any residue or marks on anything cleaned.</li>
            <li> Excellent value; other brands were more expensive but no visible difference in quality and performance. Happy that I ordered ten packs!</li>
            <li> come in very handy,use them for gun cleaning</li>
            <li> Great stuff, Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> Item worked very well and had tight wrapped cotton, so there were no issues with fraying or fuzzies left behind on the products I was cleaning.</li>
            <li> I have paid $1.49 for same size pack on Marine Base when they have them in stock.  Great product nice price</li>
