            <li>What a dream!It has a nice scent</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I&#x27;ve found a great all natural deodorant that works.  </li>
            <li>I put on some all natural body mist to myself and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>I have now had a full successful week with this</li>
            <li>The scent is not overpowering and it is certainly refreshing.</li>
            <li>I felt like I was losing more product by using the scoop.</li>
            <li>whatever you want to make it more &amp;#34;spreadable&amp;#34; so it doesn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;peely&amp;#34; and gunk up in your armpit.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Me keeps me stink free!</li>
            <li>it was clear that it did a lot more than just smell good.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with it and am planning on trying it now that winter is pretty much over.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the aluminum free brands and none of them work on me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to be really good about living as clean and natural as I can and cut out chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>This is a great and works all day especially in the hot midwest summers.  </li>
            <li>You not only smell good</li>
            <li>It works which is most important aside from the natural benefits!</li>
            <li>I have used your ALL ME for 3 days and in very hot humid weather...</li>
            <li>I have probably spent more than 40 dollars trying to find the right kind</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life this deodorant did not leave one bit of smell at the end of the day!</li>
            <li>I also like that the deodorant has a fresh smell in the jar but doesn&#x27;t stay on you like a perfume.</li>
            <li>Like so many others, I&#x27;ve tried lots of natural deodorants that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really worth it, for your health and your LIFE.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the initial eucalyptus scent, but it does go away very quickly, and leaves a nice, very light fresh scent throughout the day.</li>
            <li>The minty smell is not super good</li>
            <li>After searching high and low I&#x27;ve finally found an all natural deodorant that works and smells great!  </li>
            <li>I hiked 2 miles with this on a moderately hot day around 74</li>
            <li>This stuff really WORKS!</li>
            <li>and it REALLY WORKS, even during the hot, sweaty, sticky days of summer here in MI.</li>
            <li>Being a bit of a skeptic, I&#x27;ve been testing it out in my workouts (I live in AZ and run every day, I know hot and sweaty!), and even did the second-day test (ew, but you know it happens)</li>
            <li>I truly recommend it and I will definitely come back for more!</li>
            <li>and this lasted the whole way no smell after 9 hours.  </li>
            <li>It keeps me smell free for over 24 hours with only one application.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and they really didn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>And it really, really works.</li>
            <li>This deodorant really works, the reason I gave it four stars, is b/c</li>
            <li>But I am a fan of All Me, and am excited to finally make the switch!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to finally find an all natural deodorant that actually does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend it to everyone.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and am very picky about what I put under my arms.  </li>
            <li>Mixing it is not hard at all.</li>
            <li>Let me just say one thing that will tell it all, I live in Florida.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to go back to the unnatural deodorant, since it wasn&#x27;t keeping me covered for the whole day.</li>
            <li>My old deodorant does not work!  </li>
            <li>I look forward to future all natural products from the makers of ALL ME!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m switching to a new natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as convenient as a stick or roll on, but it&#x27;s worth the little bit of extra time it takes to apply, knowing I&#x27;m not putting cancer-causing chemicals directly on my skin to be absorbed!</li>
            <li>I have tried to go natural in the deodorant department for years, but have always given up because they just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making something that works and is all natural.  </li>
            <li>After going through a lot of natural options that just weren&#x27;t getting the job done, my friend introduced me to this stuff</li>
            <li>Wow, I am amazed.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have been searching for a deodorant that really works for a very long time.  </li>
            <li>So many times we get our hopes up with promises that a product really works, and then we meet diappointment when it fails.</li>
            <li>It can get a little dry over time as the oil seems to get used up more in the first half of the jar, but just add some lavendar oil or</li>
            <li>it irritates my arm pits (I have very sensitive skin), and cant even tolerate the Aluminum in regular deodorant.</li>
            <li>(everything was fine), I got really serious about using natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all natural is such a bonus!</li>
            <li>I have bought a bunch of different all natural deodorants at health food stores and either don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a natural deodorant that actually works &amp; my search is over!</li>
            <li>I just use the plastic spoon it comes with and give it a little mix every time right before I put it on.</li>
            <li>down to the last few uses of my first purchase of ALL ME, so I decided to use my old deodorant to \\&quot;save\\&quot; some until I get my new order.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve went through countless natural deodorants all not lasting, smelling bad after awhile, and not as good quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>I really put this one to the test as a mom of 3 and through my very active lifestyle.</li>

            <li> I have tried other natural products</li>
            <li> I have tried at least 5 \\&quot;natural deodorants\\&quot; that don&#x27;t work and \\&quot;not so natural ones\\</li>
            <li> Every single person that is using it feels the same way I do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated putting chemicals on my body, especially in an area so close to so many vital organs --EEK!  </li>
            <li> With all the reports that conventional deodorants with aluminum may have adverse effects on our bodies, I&#x27;ve tried All Me Natural Deodorant for the past three days</li>
            <li> I workout hard, am constantly on the run &amp; All</li>
            <li> but I found that they didn&#x27;t work, especially after a hard workout at the gym.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to try it because It really works!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s liquid, and messy when applying.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; deodorant this past year</li>
            <li> No More.  </li>
            <li> you aren&#x27;t putting any harsh chemicals in your body!</li>
            <li> One small note: when you switch to natural, you may need a week or two for all the bad stuff that&#x27;s been stuck in your lymph nodes to work</li>
            <li> all the other all-natural deodarant failed me.</li>
            <li> At our house, we are always looking for products that don&#x27;t contain ingredients that are unhealthy for our bodies or the planet!  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve went through countless natural deodorants all not lasting, smelling bad after awhile, and not as good quality ingredients. I hiked 2 miles with this on a moderately hot day around 74+ degrees and this lasted the whole way no smell after 9 hours.  I put on some all natural body mist to myself and it&#x27;s perfect. I have probably spent more than 40 dollars trying to find the right kind and i finally found it. Mixing it is not hard at all. I just use the plastic spoon it comes with and give it a little mix every time right before I put it on. You can also apply it to your pit with the mixer and just wash the mixer. I have now had a full successful week with this and it is GREAT!! It comes in a great package too. I have to say this does really work!!! :D</li>
            <li> I like this product. The scent is not overpowering and it is certainly refreshing. However, the application is not as convenient. It would be nice to have an easier and cleaner means of application. I felt like I was losing more product by using the scoop. For this reason I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for me.  It not only makes me not smell, but if I am stinky, it takes it away when I apply it!  It can get a little dry over time as the oil seems to get used up more in the first half of the jar, but just add some lavendar oil or whatever you want to make it more &amp;#34;spreadable&amp;#34; so it doesn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;peely&amp;#34; and gunk up in your armpit.</li>

            <li> I feel like I have been searching for a deodorant that really works for a very long time.  All Me is amazing!  I highly reccommend it to everyone.  I took it on vacation with me this summer to Florida in the 100 degree heat. It worked so good.  I never smelled and never felt sticky.  I love it.  Been telling all my friends and family about it and buying it for them!  Every single person that is using it feels the same way I do. The fact thats it&#x27;s all natural is such a bonus! Thank you so much for creating this wonderful product!</li>

            <li> If you want to try a deodorant with no aluminum then this is the ticket! It works which is most important aside from the natural benefits!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the aluminum free brands and none of them work on me. I really put this one to the test as a mom of 3 and through my very active lifestyle. It definitely works and I didn&#x27;t have to reapply! What a dream!It has a nice scent and it&#x27;s so great to know I&#x27;m not harming my body with any toxic chemicals. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have tried to go natural in the deodorant department for years, but have always given up because they just don&#x27;t work. But I am a fan of All Me, and am excited to finally make the switch! Being a bit of a skeptic, I&#x27;ve been testing it out in my workouts (I live in AZ and run every day, I know hot and sweaty!), and even did the second-day test (ew, but you know it happens)...and it really is amazing. No stinky! I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the initial eucalyptus scent, but it does go away very quickly, and leaves a nice, very light fresh scent throughout the day. This product is not an anti-perspirant, but I did noticed it helped some on the wetness front as well. Totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have tried a few &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; deodorant this past year and they really didn&#x27;t do much for me.  After 2 days of using ALL ME it was clear that it did a lot more than just smell good.  I have sensitive skin and am very picky about what I put under my arms.  I think this is a great product and will be using from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product now for about a month.  I had itching from the beginning which was somewhat tolerable but recently had the skin under my arms start to peel!  I&#x27;m switching to a new natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making something that works and is all natural.  This is a great and works all day especially in the hot midwest summers.  You not only smell good but you also feel great knowing you aren&#x27;t putting any harsh chemicals in your body!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s liquid, and messy when applying. I wore it and I didn&#x27;t feel there was a difference in all day wear. I really wanted to go back to the unnatural deodorant, since it wasn&#x27;t keeping me covered for the whole day.</li>
            <li> Let me just say one thing that will tell it all, I live in Florida.  This product has been amazing.</li>
            <li> At our house, we are always looking for products that don&#x27;t contain ingredients that are unhealthy for our bodies or the planet!  This deodorant is made without the toxins found in commercial ones AND it works!!  I tested it for a week in hot, sticky weather and am happy to say I did not stink!  I also like that the deodorant has a fresh smell in the jar but doesn&#x27;t stay on you like a perfume.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a natural deodorant that actually works &amp; my search is over! I workout hard, am constantly on the run &amp; All Me keeps me stink free! So excited &amp; telling everyone I know to buy it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I&#x27;ve found a great all natural deodorant that works.  I have tried other natural products but I found that they didn&#x27;t work, especially after a hard workout at the gym.  With all the reports that conventional deodorants with aluminum may have adverse effects on our bodies, I&#x27;ve tried All Me Natural Deodorant for the past three days and I am thrilled to say that it works great!  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life this deodorant did not leave one bit of smell at the end of the day! The minty smell is not super good but it fades and all the smell that remains is....none! The best part is that it does not smudge on clothes or leaves stains like some deodorants do. Worth the purchase! I am happy with it and am planning on trying it now that winter is pretty much over.</li>
            <li> Like so many others, I&#x27;ve tried lots of natural deodorants that didn&#x27;t work. A friend raved about this one and I decided to give it a try. It works. It&#x27;s not as convenient as a stick or roll on, but it&#x27;s worth the little bit of extra time it takes to apply, knowing I&#x27;m not putting cancer-causing chemicals directly on my skin to be absorbed! It smells good and it keeps me smelling good.</li>
            <li> After a breast cancer scare about 6 years ago (everything was fine), I got really serious about using natural deodorant. After going through a lot of natural options that just weren&#x27;t getting the job done, my friend introduced me to this stuff and it REALLY WORKS, even during the hot, sweaty, sticky days of summer here in MI. I don&#x27;t glisten, I SWEAT, and this stuff keeps me from getting stinky--even through to the next morning. It even passes the dreaded &amp;#34;sleeveless shirt&amp;#34; test. One small note: when you switch to natural, you may need a week or two for all the bad stuff that&#x27;s been stuck in your lymph nodes to work it&#x27;s way out. Use powder during that transition. It&#x27;s really worth it, for your health and your LIFE.</li>
            <li> I love it!! I am hooked. So many times we get our hopes up with promises that a product really works, and then we meet diappointment when it fails. I can truly say that this product delivers as promised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m down to the last few uses of my first purchase of ALL ME, so I decided to use my old deodorant to \\&quot;save\\&quot; some until I get my new order. My old deodorant does not work!  Thankfully, I just purchased my second order and got an extra to give as a gift! I look forward to future all natural products from the makers of ALL ME!!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you, Thank you! For making a product that we can feel good using...healthy and a product that works! I have tried at least 5 \\&quot;natural deodorants\\&quot; that don&#x27;t work and \\&quot;not so natural ones\\&quot; that don&#x27;t work either. I have used your ALL ME for 3 days and in very hot humid weather...IT WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff really WORKS! Wow, I am amazed. It&#x27;s so nice to finally find an all natural deodorant that actually does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. It feels good, it smells AMAZING! And it really, really works. I truly recommend it and I will definitely come back for more!</li>
            <li> I initially had low expectations, b/c all the other all-natural deodarant failed me. This deodorant really works, the reason I gave it four stars, is b/c it irritates my arm pits (I have very sensitive skin), and cant even tolerate the Aluminum in regular deodorant. The product seller even emailed me back, to say it could be the Rosemary oil causing it.  Great Product!!!</li>
