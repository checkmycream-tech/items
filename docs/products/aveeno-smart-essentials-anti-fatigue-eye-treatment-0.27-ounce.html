    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s just amazing!!</li>
            <li>Great results for a $10 product.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t happy with the amount of product I&#x27;d have to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this eye roller with great results, yet couldn&#x27;t find it any longer at the store &amp; ordered from here online.  </li>
            <li>Yes  is this product very nice, I like the marck, is for my skim, which used every day of my life.</li>
            <li>--I could do it for hours, it feels so nice!),</li>
            <li>Even on days that I have a good rest and used this, it did nothing.     </li>
            <li>For me, So far-so good.</li>
            <li>I like this product and it does a good job.  </li>
            <li>This product feels nice under the eyes and smells good too.</li>
            <li>the product feels nice under the eyes and smells good too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to give it an honest chance, but I&#x27;m going to throw it away.  </li>
            <li>*really* nice</li>
            <li>It gets one star just for being so pleasant to roll on, but can&#x27;t give it any more because it doesn&#x27;t do anything but feel lovely going on.</li>
            <li>Was great once I started keeping it in the fridge for some quick puffy eye relief after work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to say that this works, but I honestly have not noticed a difference</li>
            <li>My first roller (purchased at store) worked great &amp; lasted months.  </li>
            <li>Pleased with the product and how it performs.  </li>
            <li>The product does cost more than when I was able to buy it in the store.</li>
            <li>I love aveeno products.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The one redeeming quality is the scent...</li>
            <li>It feels cool and refreshing with a nice scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably use this product from time to time because it feels cool like using a cucumber slice, but I definitley plan to keep looking for a more effective product.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and it really feels nice to roll on (</li>
            <li>but i guess I would have to say it&#x27;s the best eye roller out of any other I have used, any eye roller with caffeine works better.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t honestly say I see much difference.</li>
            <li>After about 3 weeks of consistent daily use I have noticed that my eyes feel more refreshed and my under eye circles have been greatly diminished.</li>
            <li>, you look so tired!&amp;#34;) with some darkening, but mostly puff &amp; bag.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the mild tingling after applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product felt cool with a burning sensation</li>
            <li>But luckily I had no effects from the burning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say if you have acute eye puffiness of any kind, sneezing, allergies, sinus, crying, then use it to reduce the balloon effect.</li>
            <li>The area under the eye is very sensitive and you shouldn&#x27;t need to apply very much for it to be effective.  </li>
            <li>I notice that it greatly reduces puffiness if you use it after crying, it starts to tingle</li>
            <li>Overall, it feels nice and cool at first</li>
            <li>The product usually works great.  </li>
            <li>After two days people were saying i looked more awake and one person even said younger.  </li>
            <li>Got exactly what I ordered in a timely manner.  </li>
            <li>and I like to apply it at night sometimes, or first thing in the morning, before i apply my makeup.</li>
            <li>You apply it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night and it rolls on just like deodorant leaving a very clean finish - so clean that you have to be careful not to overdue it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had the roller problem that other people have mentioned but if I give the tube a good shake for 2 seconds either before applying or when the product doesn&#x27;t dispense then the problem is fixed.</li>
            <li>Clever marketing ploy in pretty packaging.</li>
            <li>I would just roll it under my eyes, the little silver ball felt nice to the touch, but that&#x27;s about it.    </li>
            <li>I wish it were available in local stores.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dark circles, but I have a problem with puffiness under the eye and wanted something that would help my eyes look brighter and more youthful/vibrant.  </li>
            <li>It did feel nice at first, although I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was really reducing the puffiness, but I would sometimes have trouble with the roller ball to work properly</li>
            <li>If I use this it doesn&#x27;t happen, my eyes feel normal.</li>
            <li>And I mean really hurt where I made a mental note to post a review because I don&#x27;t know if it was just me or if others experienced this problem too.  </li>
            <li>I was sad, because I&#x27;ve had such very good luck</li>
            <li>My problem tends to be more dark circle related than the puff factor.</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was really helping any puffiness, but the roller ball is problematic and doesn&#x27;t function properly.  </li>
            <li>I have puffy eyes from early mornings with the kiddos and sometimes even waking up before them just to get a cup of coffee and watch the news in peace.  </li>
            <li>This is the first one that feels dry almost.</li>
            <li>I have used other rollers in the past and liked them.</li>
            <li>but that doesn&#x27;t make up for physical discomfort in a sensitive area!</li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;m back to the search for something more convenient than trying to hold two cold tea bags on my eyes while getting ready for work!</li>
            <li>in an hour I notice that the puffiness under my eyes subsides and I don&#x27;t need as much cosmetic products to decrease the appearance of my dark circles.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise Idk if it really works for dark circles.</li>
            <li>w/ other Aveeno products (I couldn&#x27;t live without their moisturizer or their calming face wash).</li>

            <li> I have not had nor used this product long enough to evaluate the results.  </li>
            <li> I would think it might take as long as a month to see any results.  </li>
            <li> I owned this product before, and for some reason, although it came in a brand new package and everything, it seems that there isn&#x27;t much fluid inside, a little let down</li>
            <li> I am assuming that this may be a a result of how dry my skin can get during the winter.</li>
            <li> Bone dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various cosmetic products to help reduce the puffiness and dark circles</li>
            <li> and I really like the results over the past few days.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was a fluke because my skin was dry at the moment, so I tried it again a few weeks later.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the product, as my eyes were dry from the cold midwestern weather.</li>
            <li> Or you can just drink green tea daily.</li>
            <li> but after having used it twice a day (after brushing my teeth am &amp; pm) for just over a month, I&#x27;ve seen absolutely no effect, ever.</li>
            <li> I had to rush to school in the morning and neglected the green tea capsules and my dark circles came back.</li>
            <li> I did look into some other eye products but settled on this because of price, ease of application, and option to buy online or in store.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the package purchased here, I find its empty!</li>
            <li> I read green tea helps with overall health and eyes anyway, so give green tea capsules a try.     </li>
            <li> Seemed to help a little but not much.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this product to fix the dark circles under my eyes but wanted to help the puffy and baggy-eyes feeling.</li>
            <li> and I noticed my dark circles reduced.</li>
            <li> The dark circles and puffiness have not subsided at all.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would help to lighten up the dark under eye circles I have during allergy seasons and stress.</li>
            <li> helps make the dark circles look lighter also.</li>
            <li> I bought this item hoping it would help with my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> and I have dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> The dark circles and puffiness have not subsided at all.</li>
            <li> my eyes do appear brighter and less puffy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a slight difference.  </li>
            <li> Wondering if the other negative reviews are because it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li> I expected to see dark circles to at least lighten.</li>
            <li> There might have been minimal change in my slight puffiness, but it&#x27;s hard to say.</li>
            <li> it burns my eye lids, used little bit every time, and my skin didn&#x27;t get used to it.</li>
            <li> I keep this little bottle in my fridge</li>
            <li> I tried to use it a few times and gave up.</li>
            <li> and it was still too much trouble.</li>
            <li> What worked though a bit for me was consuming green tea extract.</li>
            <li> NOT the ones that are fat burning, just a green tea extract capsule.</li>
            <li> Or you can buy green tea powder, also known as Matcha.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few weeks ago and have been using it faithfully twice a day as suggested on the box.  </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use it after crying my eyes look like balloons because I have severe sinus problems as well, and crying irritates them.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product off and on for a few months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I didn&#x27;t use a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too lazy to brew tea every day</li>
            <li> so I would be there trying to rub the delicate skin under my eyes over and over and over again.</li>
            <li> At least the one I purchased didn&#x27;t..</li>
            <li> But, within a second or so, it started BURNING really bad.</li>
            <li> becuase I got tired of the roller ball problem since it was happening all the time.  </li>
            <li> (I also do a lot of reading which always makes my eyes feel exhausted.)</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have particularly dry skin, so I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately, after using it for weeks, I see no difference in the appearance of my eyes.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately, after using it for weeks, I see no difference in the appearance of my eyes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I opened the product after the return date option.</li>
            <li> I have very tired eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nasty stuff.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used other rollers in the past and liked them. This is the first one that feels dry almost. I tried to use it a few times and gave up.</li>
            <li> This product felt cool with a burning sensation I&#x27;m not sure why I didn&#x27;t use a lot. I&#x27;m gona continue to use it until it&#x27;s finish.The burning sensation annoys me!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this product to fix the dark circles under my eyes but wanted to help the puffy and baggy-eyes feeling. It did feel nice at first, although I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was really reducing the puffiness, but I would sometimes have trouble with the roller ball to work properly so I would be there trying to rub the delicate skin under my eyes over and over and over again. I would even try to rub it on my hand to get the product to come out and it was still too much trouble. I stopped using it for a couple of months becuase I got tired of the roller ball problem since it was happening all the time.  Then when I finally decided to use it again, it stung my skin!  And I mean really hurt where I made a mental note to post a review because I don&#x27;t know if it was just me or if others experienced this problem too.  Overall, it feels nice and cool at first, I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was really helping any puffiness, but the roller ball is problematic and doesn&#x27;t function properly.  At least the one I purchased didn&#x27;t..</li>
            <li> I have used it for about a week, once in the morning, once at night.  I go back and forth once under each eye. my eyes do appear brighter and less puffy. After two days people were saying i looked more awake and one person even said younger.  Great results for a $10 product.</li>
            <li> Not sure what was going on with my eyes, but this thing would give my under eyes a burning sensation and I didn&#x27;t use too much. It even says to use a \\&quot;generous amount\\&quot;. I would just roll it under my eyes, the little silver ball felt nice to the touch, but that&#x27;s about it.    My undereyes also became itchy.    It did no lightening to my undereyes whatsoever.     I have very tired eyes. I&#x27;m a student in college who procrastinates and stays up all night on the computer. Even on days that I have a good rest and used this, it did nothing.     I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle. But luckily I had no effects from the burning. Just a bit itchy.     What worked though a bit for me was consuming green tea extract. Or you can just drink green tea daily. I&#x27;m too lazy to brew tea every day so I just take a capsule every day and I noticed my dark circles reduced. One day I was looking in the mirror and I&#x27;ve been taking the capsules for a week or two and I noticed no darkness around my eyes, I was amazed.     I had to rush to school in the morning and neglected the green tea capsules and my dark circles came back. That is what has led me to believe they worked for my under eyes (I&#x27;d take it in the morning WITH breakfast). I read green tea helps with overall health and eyes anyway, so give green tea capsules a try.     NOT the ones that are fat burning, just a green tea extract capsule. They are around here on amazon... it&#x27;s from Now Foods. There are others but that&#x27;s the one I bought.    Or you can buy green tea powder, also known as Matcha. Put it in another (NO DAIRY PRODUCTS) and you get an instant boost and it helps with your undereyes from within.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product last Friday  - it&#x27;s now Tuesday and I&#x27;ve noticed a slight difference.  I don&#x27;t have dark circles, but I have a problem with puffiness under the eye and wanted something that would help my eyes look brighter and more youthful/vibrant.  This product doesn&#x27;t make any hefty promises,  but if you&#x27;re looking for something that will give you a brighter look as you begin your day, give it a try.  You apply it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night and it rolls on just like deodorant leaving a very clean finish - so clean that you have to be careful not to overdue it.  The area under the eye is very sensitive and you shouldn&#x27;t need to apply very much for it to be effective.  For me, So far-so good.</li>
            <li> This product feels nice under the eyes and smells good too. But unfortunately, after using it for weeks, I see no difference in the appearance of my eyes. The dark circles and puffiness have not subsided at all. I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few weeks ago and have been using it faithfully twice a day as suggested on the box.  It feels cool and refreshing with a nice scent but I can&#x27;t honestly say I see much difference. There might have been minimal change in my slight puffiness, but it&#x27;s hard to say. My problem tends to be more dark circle related than the puff factor. I&#x27;ll probably use this product from time to time because it feels cool like using a cucumber slice, but I definitley plan to keep looking for a more effective product.</li>
            <li> I have puffy eyes from early mornings with the kiddos and sometimes even waking up before them just to get a cup of coffee and watch the news in peace.  I&#x27;ve tried various cosmetic products to help reduce the puffiness and dark circles but I wasn&#x27;t happy with the amount of product I&#x27;d have to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up at my local WalMart on a whim and I really like the results over the past few days.  I apply the product just after waking and in an hour I notice that the puffiness under my eyes subsides and I don&#x27;t need as much cosmetic products to decrease the appearance of my dark circles.  I also enjoy the mild tingling after applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the roller problem that other people have mentioned but if I give the tube a good shake for 2 seconds either before applying or when the product doesn&#x27;t dispense then the problem is fixed.</li>
            <li> it burns my eye lids, used little bit every time, and my skin didn&#x27;t get used to it., roller was fine,but just the burning couldn&#x27;t take</li>
            <li> I have not had nor used this product long enough to evaluate the results.  I would think it might take as long as a month to see any results.  If the results should be visible sooner, then the product is not helping.</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I ordered in a timely manner.  Pleased with the product and how it performs.  The product does cost more than when I was able to buy it in the store.</li>
            <li> I use it every day, just once a day and the darkness around my eyes is disappearing.  It&#x27;s just amazing!!</li>
            <li> I am using it perhaps it takes time to show results.I expected to see dark circles to at least lighten.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would help to lighten up the dark under eye circles I have during allergy seasons and stress. (I also do a lot of reading which always makes my eyes feel exhausted.) I did look into some other eye products but settled on this because of price, ease of application, and option to buy online or in store. After about 3 weeks of consistent daily use I have noticed that my eyes feel more refreshed and my under eye circles have been greatly diminished. The only con to using this product is the occasional stinging skin during application. I am assuming that this may be a a result of how dry my skin can get during the winter.</li>
            <li> I like this product and it does a good job.  I wish it were available in local stores.</li>
            <li> I keep this little bottle in my fridge and I like to apply it at night sometimes, or first thing in the morning, before i apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> This helps with my chronic allergys that make my eyes puffy. helps make the dark circles look lighter also. it sooths and I usually only remeber to use it once a day and I still see a difference. I love aveeno products.</li>
            <li> I bought this item hoping it would help with my dark circles.  I have used it for one month and I have seen no improvement whatsoever.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have tan skin and I have dark circles around my eyes. After a week I notice a difference.  Yes...it does stink for 10 second or so but it so much better than those expensive brands snd it actually works.</li>
            <li> I notice that it greatly reduces puffiness if you use it after crying, it starts to tingle and you can tell that it&#x27;s working. If I don&#x27;t use it after crying my eyes look like balloons because I have severe sinus problems as well, and crying irritates them. If I use this it doesn&#x27;t happen, my eyes feel normal. I&#x27;d say if you have acute eye puffiness of any kind, sneezing, allergies, sinus, crying, then use it to reduce the balloon effect. Otherwise Idk if it really works for dark circles. but i guess I would have to say it&#x27;s the best eye roller out of any other I have used, any eye roller with caffeine works better.</li>
            <li> the product feels nice under the eyes and smells good too. But unfortunately, after using it for weeks, I see no difference in the appearance of my eyes. The dark circles and puffiness have not subsided at all. I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Yes  is this product very nice, I like the marck, is for my skim, which used every day of my life.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product off and on for a few months.  I&#x27;ve been trying to give it an honest chance, but I&#x27;m going to throw it away.  It&#x27;s nasty stuff.  It rolls on under your eye.  It stings almost immediately.  No noticeable improvement to my undereye area.  I don&#x27;t recommend it all.  Get a moisture cream instead.</li>
            <li> I owned this product before, and for some reason, although it came in a brand new package and everything, it seems that there isn&#x27;t much fluid inside, a little let down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to say that this works, but I honestly have not noticed a difference and I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now. Clever marketing ploy in pretty packaging.</li>
            <li> Seemed to help a little but not much.  A bit greasy on my skin. Was great once I started keeping it in the fridge for some quick puffy eye relief after work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye roller with great results, yet couldn&#x27;t find it any longer at the store &amp; ordered from here online.  My first roller (purchased at store) worked great &amp; lasted months.  Upon opening the package purchased here, I find its empty! Bone dry.  Wondering if the other negative reviews are because it&#x27;s empty. The product usually works great.  The coldness of the silver roller may be giving the illusion it&#x27;s doing something.  Unfortunately I opened the product after the return date option.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and it really feels nice to roll on (*really* nice--I could do it for hours, it feels so nice!), but after having used it twice a day (after brushing my teeth am &amp; pm) for just over a month, I&#x27;ve seen absolutely no effect, ever. I have chronic puffiness under the eyes (&amp;#34;Gosh, you look so tired!&amp;#34;) with some darkening, but mostly puff &amp; bag. I saw no difference in either darkness or puff factor. I was sad, because I&#x27;ve had such very good luck w/ other Aveeno products (I couldn&#x27;t live without their moisturizer or their calming face wash). Guess I&#x27;m back to the search for something more convenient than trying to hold two cold tea bags on my eyes while getting ready for work! It gets one star just for being so pleasant to roll on, but can&#x27;t give it any more because it doesn&#x27;t do anything but feel lovely going on.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the product, as my eyes were dry from the cold midwestern weather. I&#x27;m also a graduate student who starts at a computer all day and has an irregular sleep schedule! When I bought this, I was relieved by the cooling sensation of the silver ball. But, within a second or so, it started BURNING really bad. I thought maybe it was a fluke because my skin was dry at the moment, so I tried it again a few weeks later. Again, it BURNED. I would definitely not recommend this item... and I don&#x27;t have particularly dry skin, so I was extremely disappointed. The one redeeming quality is the scent... but that doesn&#x27;t make up for physical discomfort in a sensitive area!</li>
