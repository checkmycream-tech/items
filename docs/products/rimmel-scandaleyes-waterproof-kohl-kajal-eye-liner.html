    <ol>
            <li>Awesome stuff!</li>
            <li>They have the perfect consistency and color for my complexion.</li>
            <li>Great eyeliner!  </li>
            <li>very good says on my waterline</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it every day but for the times I do, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>great product, just not the color i was expecting</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great compliment to the outer eye</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to do the inside water line and corner of my eye, it matches skin tone well and works great.  </li>
            <li>This is a good color for the darker eyed gals out there like I am.  </li>
            <li>It will come in handy for those morning afters....</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner, it goes on so easy and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>I loved the color and it looked creamy and smooth, but I was nervous</li>
            <li>Blends and smudges easily!</li>
            <li>it allows very precise application.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect concealer for zits and small marks and areas you want to brighten a little...sooooo inexpensive and a great color</li>
            <li>I use this along with my NYX milk eyeliner in my waterline to help me look more awake.</li>
            <li>Love it ...</li>
            <li>Perhaps I will use it as an eyeliner to see if I like it that way better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>I love the color of this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>sure need it some mornings.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, just make sure you wait to apply your mascara AFTER you have completed this step in your make up routine.</li>
            <li>this Rimmel pencil goes on soooo smooth and silky, more so then any pencil I ever used.</li>
            <li>highly recommend, though not all makeup works the same for everyone, this one is so awesome for me, and I love the staying power, but I love even more that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and the fine tip is perfect for covering up minor blemishes.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the quality of this liner and will probably buy other colors from Rimmel.</li>
            <li>a shame because it&#x27;s inexpensive, the color is beautiful, it has a nice, creamy consistency and glides on super smooth, but it just does not last.</li>
            <li>(Yes it came off easily after I washed my face).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and with the sharpened point</li>
            <li>It stays for a long time, good stuff!</li>
            <li>Pigment is good and the pencil is soft so it glides on easily.</li>
            <li>Love that it is nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>It glides on smooth but DOESNT stay at ALL on my oily lids.  </li>
            <li>The color is perfect, it really opens my eyes and gives me bigger, brighter eyes.</li>
            <li>It looks so great, opens up the eye and on the lid it looks super subtle but very cute.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply, stays on a long time, and a good color.</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s not a bad liner.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this eyeliner, it makes my eyes look so much bigger and more awake, but</li>
            <li>Bought this to use on my lower water line to open up my eyes and it works perfectly and last all day!!</li>
            <li>Very creamy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>but this eyeliner with its nude hue and creamy texture looks much more natural!</li>
            <li>Very creamy, goes on the waterline easily, but doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li>great when my eyes look a little red,,,read about this in Allure!</li>
            <li>Especially if I&#x27;m gonna be in front of a camera as it really makes your eyes appear wider and more awake!</li>
            <li>This is a cool, natural color -- great to use as a highlighter or to brighten undereye area slightly.  </li>
            <li>This is really nice on the waterline, because it really opens up your eyes and makes them look bigger, instead of closing them in.</li>
            <li>cause so many makeup products irritate my eyes, especially on my waterline</li>
            <li>It made my eyes look so much bigger and more awake even before highlighter.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I definitely prefer it over white eyeliner and over some of my high end products.</li>
            <li>but i believe formula could be a bit better maybe not that good because i think i got a fake</li>
            <li>while it is not for super watery eyes (you may need some touch ups during the day), a swipe on in inner lower rim just looks so refreshing, way better than white liner as far as being a natural look.</li>
            <li>but the product is very well made and works as advertised</li>
            <li>paper plug should fit snug enough that it will stay inside the barrel, and will keep the liner advanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The paper plug gently pushes it up without smashing it.  </li>
            <li>very natural.this is what i want</li>
            <li>Really, though who has the time for that..&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li>I have very oily eyelids</li>
            <li>first I tried just using the skewer, but the liner is too soft.  </li>
            <li>wasted cosmetic while trying to sharpen a plastic barrel.  :-)</li>
            <li>very well sometimes comes off only if i rub my eyes too much that day</li>
            <li>this color very clear in the eye</li>
            <li>long time i am searching for nice Nude color eyeliner but all the Previous eyeliners i bought they didnt show on my eye very clear ...</li>
            <li>I personally didn&#x27;t have any problems with sharpening (in my trusty covergirl sharpener that I&#x27;ve had since my first eyeliner).</li>
            <li>There is soft wax at the bottom of the liner, so it acts like adhesive to attach the liner to the paper</li>
            <li>It was a little lighter than expected, but that is OK.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen several reviews that expressed frustration on how to sharpen it, since it is a soft cosmetic, and the barrel is plastic.  </li>
            <li>It is okay, but not great.</li>
            <li>It has a very creamy texture and like other reviewers who actually used it as an eyeliner have stated</li>

            <li> current waterline pencil is Tarte Emphaseyes in a nude color which does not irritate my eyes, but doesnt last long at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A definite recommend as long as they don&#x27;t change the formula!</li>
            <li> I would have thought that being waterproof would mean it could hold up to the water line, but maybe I was expecting too much.  </li>
            <li> I worked a long work day and it remained on my waterline!</li>
            <li> , it just doesn&#x27;t stay on very long.</li>
            <li> 1\\&quot; wide.  </li>
            <li> that is the diameter of the hole in the center of the barrel.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> When I do a smokey-eye look with my shadows I will take a small water line from my inner eye to about halfway to brighten my eyes up a little.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping that since this is formulated as an eyeliner that it would really stay put, unfortunately it does not.</li>
            <li> dark smoky look.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my waterline and a little bit on the inside corner of my eyes to brighten them.</li>
            <li> You may need to carry it in your purse if your going out for the evening and apply it again after a few hours.</li>
            <li> The downside is, I&#x27;m not sure I would classify this as waterproof as by the end of the day</li>
            <li> (even a previous white Rimmel pencil irritated my waterline so bad my eyes watered up and turned red).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this along with my NYX milk eyeliner in my waterline to help me look more awake. Works wonders!</li>
            <li> No complaints about this, I like it! I don&#x27;t use it every day but for the times I do, it&#x27;s great. Pigment is good and the pencil is soft so it glides on easily.</li>
            <li> Irritates my eyes. I don&#x27; t wear contacts.</li>
            <li> Love it ... But paid 12 bucks when I saw in store for 4 ..... Ouch</li>
            <li> It was a little lighter than expected, but that is OK. It goes on smoothly, just make sure you wait to apply your mascara AFTER you have completed this step in your make up routine. It stays for a long time, good stuff!</li>
            <li> great product, just not the color i was expecting, i wanted white, and got skin colored.  but the product is very well made and works as advertised</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim cause I loved the color and it looked creamy and smooth, but I was nervous cause so many makeup products irritate my eyes, especially on my waterline (even a previous white Rimmel pencil irritated my waterline so bad my eyes watered up and turned red).&lt;br /&gt;My current waterline pencil is Tarte Emphaseyes in a nude color which does not irritate my eyes, but doesnt last long at all.&lt;br /&gt;So this Rimmel pencil goes on soooo smooth and silky, more so then any pencil I ever used. The color is perfect, it really opens my eyes and gives me bigger, brighter eyes. I worked a long work day and it remained on my waterline! I took a shower and washed my hair (but not my face/makeup, I do that after my shower) and looked in the mirror and it was still on my waterline, about 12 hrs after I applied it. Unbelievable!! (Yes it came off easily after I washed my face).&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend, though not all makeup works the same for everyone, this one is so awesome for me, and I love the staying power, but I love even more that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I read about this eyeliner in a magazine, but instead of using it for it&#x27;s intended purpose, they suggested using it as a concealer. I was intrigued by this idea and decided to give it a try. It applies smoothly and the fine tip is perfect for covering up minor blemishes. I was hoping that since this is formulated as an eyeliner that it would really stay put, unfortunately it does not. It has a very creamy texture and like other reviewers who actually used it as an eyeliner have stated, it just doesn&#x27;t stay on very long. It is okay, but not great. Perhaps I will use it as an eyeliner to see if I like it that way better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen several reviews that expressed frustration on how to sharpen it, since it is a soft cosmetic, and the barrel is plastic.  Here&#x27;s what worked for me:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Use a knife to cut off the bottom tip of the pencil barrel, exposing the hole.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Cut a strip of paper towel 1\\&quot; wide.  Roll it up into a \\&quot;plug\\&quot; that is the diameter of the hole in the center of the barrel.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Insert the paper \\&quot;plug\\&quot; in the hole.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Use a bamboo kitchen skewer to push the plug up, which will advance the eyeliner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper plug should fit snug enough that it will stay inside the barrel, and will keep the liner advanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I tried just using the skewer, but the liner is too soft.  The paper plug gently pushes it up without smashing it.  There is soft wax at the bottom of the liner, so it acts like adhesive to attach the liner to the paper plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No wasted cosmetic while trying to sharpen a plastic barrel.  :-)</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! I use it on my waterline and a little bit on the inside corner of my eyes to brighten them. Especially if I&#x27;m gonna be in front of a camera as it really makes your eyes appear wider and more awake! Easy to apply, stays on a long time, and a good color. I&#x27;ve tried white eyeliner before and it&#x27;s way too chalky looking but this eyeliner with its nude hue and creamy texture looks much more natural!</li>
            <li> Very creamy, goes on the waterline easily, but doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li> This is a good color for the darker eyed gals out there like I am.  When I do a smokey-eye look with my shadows I will take a small water line from my inner eye to about halfway to brighten my eyes up a little.  It&#x27;s a great compliment to the outer eye dark smoky look.  I wear this with contacts and have no sensitivity with it.  The downside is, I&#x27;m not sure I would classify this as waterproof as by the end of the day I find that a lot of it has worn/smudged off.  I would have thought that being waterproof would mean it could hold up to the water line, but maybe I was expecting too much.  All in all, it&#x27;s not a bad liner.</li>
            <li> This is really nice on the waterline, because it really opens up your eyes and makes them look bigger, instead of closing them in.</li>
            <li> long time i am searching for nice Nude color eyeliner but all the Previous eyeliners i bought they didnt show on my eye very clear ...this color very clear in the eye and it look very natural.this is what i want</li>
            <li> Very creamy and easy to apply. Love it.</li>
            <li> I know this is not what these were intended for but I use these as blemish cover up.  They have the perfect consistency and color for my complexion.</li>
            <li> while it is not for super watery eyes (you may need some touch ups during the day), a swipe on in inner lower rim just looks so refreshing, way better than white liner as far as being a natural look. It made my eyes look so much bigger and more awake even before highlighter. I personally didn&#x27;t have any problems with sharpening (in my trusty covergirl sharpener that I&#x27;ve had since my first eyeliner). I think it&#x27;s one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this eyeliner, it makes my eyes look so much bigger and more awake, but literally I blink and it&#x27;s gone from my waterline! I&#x27;ve even tried it on my upper lash line with a primer, nope, still fades away within minutes. My eyelids aren&#x27;t THAT oily either..&lt;br /&gt;The only way I can see this working is if you carry it around in your purse and keep checking a mirror and reapplying and reapplying... Really, though who has the time for that..&lt;br /&gt;Such a shame because it&#x27;s inexpensive, the color is beautiful, it has a nice, creamy consistency and glides on super smooth, but it just does not last.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect concealer for zits and small marks and areas you want to brighten a little...sooooo inexpensive and a great color</li>
            <li> I love the color of this eyeliner.  It looks so great, opens up the eye and on the lid it looks super subtle but very cute.  It glides on smooth but DOESNT stay at ALL on my oily lids.  I just wish they made it in a liquid liner because these kohl&#x27;s just don&#x27;t do it for me at all.  Not in the water line and not on the lid... just doesn&#x27;t stay at all.  I have very oily eyelids and this lasts not even 10 minutes.  I&#x27;m sorry but I can&#x27;t justify a purchase that doesn&#x27;t last an hour!</li>
            <li> This corrects my under eyes from being too red or looking like I didn&#x27;t get enough sleep. You may need to carry it in your purse if your going out for the evening and apply it again after a few hours.</li>
            <li> very good says on my waterline very well sometimes comes off only if i rub my eyes too much that day not there fault but i believe formula could be a bit better maybe not that good because i think i got a fake</li>
            <li> I like this product, brightens up my eyes.. sure need it some mornings.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I definitely prefer it over white eyeliner and over some of my high end products. A definite recommend as long as they don&#x27;t change the formula!</li>
            <li> Bought this to use on my lower water line to open up my eyes and it works perfectly and last all day!!</li>
            <li> This is a cool, natural color -- great to use as a highlighter or to brighten undereye area slightly.  Can be used anywhere on the face as a concealer or highlighter.  Easy to apply and with the sharpened point it allows very precise application.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner, it goes on so easy and it looks great.  I purchased this to do the inside water line and corner of my eye, it matches skin tone well and works great.  I am very happy with the quality of this liner and will probably buy other colors from Rimmel.</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner!  Love that it is nice and soft.  Blends and smudges easily!</li>
            <li> It will come in handy for those morning afters....great when my eyes look a little red,,,read about this in Allure!</li>
