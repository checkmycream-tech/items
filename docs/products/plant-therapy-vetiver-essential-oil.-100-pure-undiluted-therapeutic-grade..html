            <li>Fabulous oil, packaged wonderfully, arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>I do smell amazing.</li>
            <li>The absolute best company to buy from.</li>
            <li>I purchased Vetiver to make my own menstrual cramp relief blend.  </li>
            <li>It has a very strong aroma.</li>
            <li>Very strong earthy smell.</li>
            <li>Very strong oil.</li>
            <li>Great quality and very fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with what I got especially at such a good price!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I don&#x27;t really love this scent.</li>
            <li>I purchased a Plant Therapy diffuser (love it), plus three oils - vetiver, cedarwood, and pine.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Love the company.  </li>
            <li>I knew by reading many reviews.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li>It is ok.</li>
            <li>I had to take the top off and use an eyedropper.</li>
            <li>I have been extremely pleased with the speed in which my orders arrive, the quality of the oils, and PT&#x27;s customer service.&lt;br</li>
            <li>SO I have to take off the lid to get to the lovely oil, which is quite wasteful, but when I&#x27;m finished with it</li>
            <li>Love the oil, just not the dropper.</li>
            <li>; love it</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I believe that Plant Therapy Essential Oils are of good quality at a great price.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this.  </li>
            <li>It is called &amp;#34;khus&amp;#34; or kusa grass in India, used for many purposes, including worship.  </li>
            <li>and I have been able to see a difference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Vetiver doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant smell, to me anyway, but it&#x27;s definitely potent and works very well.</li>
            <li>A classic fragrance in a very handy form.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the good oil.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was a perfect addition to my collection of essential oils.</li>
            <li>It is strong stuff.</li>
            <li>It certainly can&#x27;t hurt and it&#x27;s better than taking sleeping pills all the time!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get fooled into super cheap oils!</li>
            <li>This oil is very strong, but works very well!</li>
            <li>Very pure oil, I&#x27;m super happy with it especially for such a great price!</li>
            <li>I have not gotten to enjoy it because of the smell.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet, but the scent is more pleasant than I expected.  </li>
            <li>The oil is nice and thick in consistency - you will have to warm it up between your hands or in warm water if you want to get a drop out.  </li>
            <li>The Plant Therapy Vetiver is more reasonably priced than the MLM products and has that very thick viscosity and the wonderful true Vetiver aroma I&#x27;ve come to expect and love.</li>
            <li>However, the menstrual cramp relief blend that I made (5 drops sweet marjoram, 3 drops ginger, 2 drops</li>
            <li>Sweet smell.</li>
            <li>I have ordered several different types of oil from this brand and I have been very happy with them all.</li>
            <li>The smell is very woody, and powerful - I blend it with lavender and cederwood, so the smell is better.  </li>
            <li>Has such a wonderful deep smell.  </li>
            <li>I always know I&#x27;m receiving a high quality product when I order from Plant Therapy, &amp; their customer service is top notch.</li>
            <li>Great for calming down, insomnia and keeping focus.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite brand for EO&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The aroma of vetiver is mesmerizing it freshens all rooms in my house and the closets.</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about the smell of Vetiver; it reminds me of Liquid Smoke.  </li>
            <li>Pure and undiluted!</li>
            <li>Love Plant Therapy essential oils.</li>
            <li>I am sleeping without the help of pharmaceutical sleep aids for the first time in years.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with plant therapy essential oils!!  </li>
            <li>We use it primarily for my 10 year old with ADHD.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually sleeping better at night.  </li>
            <li>This is a really good oil for those who are having trouble sleeping.  </li>
            <li>Oil is of good quality, but the bottle created much trouble despite much effort to clean/repair the dropper.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, exactly as listed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to Essential oils, and I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect from this product.  </li>
            <li>This is REAL vetiver oil.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very please with this oil.</li>
            <li>Thanks Lynn</li>
            <li>It DOES have a very &amp;#34;pungent&amp;#34; smell so be prepared for that.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>very earthy smell</li>
            <li>Plant therapy has high quality pure oils.</li>
            <li>It calms him right down and has become an indispensable part of our bedtime routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After trying several brands of essential oils, including the multi-level marketing brands, Plant Therapy has become my favorite.</li>
            <li>A terrific way to introduce essential oil into your bathing or shaving routine, or carry it with you for a lovely scent anywhere you please.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to essential oils, so I can&#x27;t say much about quality, but it certainly works!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more Plant Therapy oils in the near future.</li>
            <li>A nice, thick Vetiver</li>
            <li>I have  bought other Plant Therapy Essential Oils and I am always pleased with them</li>
            <li>Order often directly from their website bit</li>
            <li>It was clogged with what appeared to be old &#x27;hardened&#x27; oil.</li>
            <li>I usually have to take the top off, which is super messy</li>
            <li>It is a little thicker than most oils and harder to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>It took a few seconds for it to drop just one drop - which is probably a good things, because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I would really encourage other to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>We layer Vetiver, Cedarwood, and Lavender (sometimes with Frankincense for an added boost) under her big toes to help boost concentration and calm her down enough to focus.</li>
            <li>Independent third party tested as pure as other pricier brands.</li>
            <li>The oils are high quality, cause no reactions (on my family, I can&#x27;t speak for every consumer obviously) even when used &amp;#34;neat&amp;#34;, and do what they are expected to do.</li>
            <li>This is a true therapeutic oil, not cut with other less expensive ingredients like many essential</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been blending it with other essential oils in my diffuser at night</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s characteristic scent.</li>
            <li> It smells so bad it stresses me out even more.</li>
            <li> Smell horrible but works great</li>
            <li> it is just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I had read that either you loved vetiver or you hated it.  </li>
            <li> like all of the Plant Therapy oils I have purchased so far...just not sure about the consistency of this one, but it seems to work properly.</li>
            <li> Just remove the stopper and use another tool (dropper or pipet) or just be VERY careful tipping it.  </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not very familiar with the smell of vetiver, this had almost no fragrance.  </li>
            <li> (they&#x27;re very bad the first two days), so I am willing to smell a little like Liquid Smoke in order to have the relief.</li>
            <li> you will either love it or hate it.  </li>
            <li> Vetiver is one of those love it or hate it scents.  </li>
            <li> Smells a little off.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little puzzled, thought that there was something wrong with the oil, but then found out that Vetiver is very thick.</li>
            <li> oil is very thick and aromatic, so a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> It is thick and hard to get out of the bottle, so I pop off the plastic dripper to get a few drops (just be careful if you do this too!)</li>
            <li> It is a little thick</li>
            <li> This oil is very thick &amp; exactly as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> As usual from Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li> Does not smell or works like what I used in the past.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if that is the way it is supposed to be, but it is the thickest oil I have ever</li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t be too surprised, but a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Thick and narley.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this, it won&#x27;t come out of the bottle, I guess it&#x27;s to thick.</li>
            <li> A thick oil.</li>
            <li> Label should warn of thick oil.</li>
            <li> The oil is supposed to be thick.  </li>
            <li> oil is VERY thick.</li>
            <li> blend is very thick.  </li>
            <li> I tried a couple of others, but they were thin and watery, and had a burnt note to the aroma.</li>
            <li> It seems to be real thick.  </li>
            <li> Stinks, but I knew it would.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The dropper won&#x27;t work :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Received the product. Now to see if it works for ADD &amp; ADHD. My co-worker says it works wonderfully on her son so I thought I would buy it too. She said you can noticeably tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Fabulous oil, packaged wonderfully, arrived very quickly. I am very pleased with this company. Don&#x27;t get fooled into super cheap oils! This brand is trusted and the oils are legit.</li>
            <li> Great oil at a great prices.  Does just what I wanted it for</li>
            <li> Love Plant Therapy essential oils.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t really love this scent. I&#x27;ve smelled Vetiver before and loved it but this one isn&#x27;t sitting well with me. I know that that happens from blend to blend so can&#x27;t be too surprised, but a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just received this today. I purchased a Plant Therapy diffuser (love it), plus three oils - vetiver, cedarwood, and pine.&lt;br /&gt;This oil is VERY thick. It took a few seconds for it to drop just one drop - which is probably a good things, because a little goes a long way. It has a very strong aroma. And it&#x27;s a very nice aroma!&lt;br /&gt;I was just reading how it can help with sleep problems, when blended with cedarwood and lavender. I think I&#x27;ll try this tonight!&lt;br /&gt;Great product! As usual from Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li> Stinks, but I knew it would. LOL</li>
            <li> Cured my insomnia immediately. I am sleeping without the help of pharmaceutical sleep aids for the first time in years.</li>
            <li> Thick and narley. Great Oil!</li>
            <li> Very strong earthy smell.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was a perfect addition to my collection of essential oils. I&#x27;m very satisfied with what I got especially at such a good price!</li>
            <li> Love the company.  Fast shipping, exactly as listed.  I got this to try on my ADHD child.  I mix this with a few other things to help calm her down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to Essential oils, and I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect from this product.  I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet, but the scent is more pleasant than I expected.  I am looking forward to using this in a blend.</li>
            <li> it is just what I expected.</li>
            <li> This oil smells amazing! It is thick and hard to get out of the bottle, so I pop off the plastic dripper to get a few drops (just be careful if you do this too!)</li>
            <li> GREAT quality; scent as well as consistency. A nice, thick Vetiver and it&#x27;s characteristic scent. I am only purchasing from Plant Therapy for my essential oils from now on. Thank you Amazon for selling these absolutely impressive and reasonably priced oils!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this, it won&#x27;t come out of the bottle, I guess it&#x27;s to thick. I don&#x27;t know how to get it out.</li>
            <li> The absolute best company to buy from. This is REAL vetiver oil. Pure and undiluted! This Vetiver oil is the highest quality I have come across! You will not be disappointed. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> A thick oil. I needed to remove the cap to get the oil out.  I knew by reading many reviews.  Label should warn of thick oil.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy. The aroma of vetiver is mesmerizing it freshens all rooms in my house and the closets. Not like my other cedar wood oil from same company that has no aroma at all.</li>
            <li> This oil is very thick &amp; exactly as I expected it to be. I&#x27;ve been using EO for 2 years now &amp; am expanding my exploration with Vetiver. I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li> I have ordered several different types of oil from this brand and I have been very happy with them all.</li>
            <li> Very strong oil. It helps me fall asleep. I&#x27;m new to essential oils, so I can&#x27;t say much about quality, but it certainly works!</li>
            <li> Great product! Will order again!!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with plant therapy essential oils!!  Again, with vetiver.  The oil is nice and thick in consistency - you will have to warm it up between your hands or in warm water if you want to get a drop out.  The smell is very woody, and powerful - I blend it with lavender and cederwood, so the smell is better.  If you are using vetiver alone the smell is not that pleasant.  But the benefits outweigh the smell.  Great for calming down, insomnia and keeping focus.  Very please with this oil.</li>
            <li> Absolutely happy with the purchase, I have used vetiver ( as a root) for many years in oil. This is&lt;br /&gt;very good quality.</li>
            <li> It is ok. Smells a little off. Bit still worked good! No rashes  Always use on a area of your skin that is un noticeable. Check for rashes. Thanks for the good oil.</li>
            <li> I received this and it won&#x27;t come out of the bottle . It seems to be real thick.  Thanks Lynn</li>
            <li> The only issue that I had with it is that the dispenser did not function properly so I have to take the plastic dispenser out to get the oil.</li>
            <li> This is a true therapeutic oil, not cut with other less expensive ingredients like many essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item is just as described.</li>
            <li> My new favorite brand for EO&#x27;s. This is highest quality vetiver I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> The dropper didn&#x27;t work. I had to take the top off and use an eyedropper. I am not complaining about the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little puzzled, thought that there was something wrong with the oil, but then found out that Vetiver is very thick. Over all this help relax before bed time. I have  bought other Plant Therapy Essential Oils and I am always pleased with them</li>
            <li> Great quality oil from a great company!  I always know I&#x27;m receiving a high quality product when I order from Plant Therapy, &amp; their customer service is top notch.</li>
            <li> After trying several brands of essential oils, including the multi-level marketing brands, Plant Therapy has become my favorite. The oils are high quality, cause no reactions (on my family, I can&#x27;t speak for every consumer obviously) even when used &amp;#34;neat&amp;#34;, and do what they are expected to do. I have been extremely pleased with the speed in which my orders arrive, the quality of the oils, and PT&#x27;s customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vetiver doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant smell, to me anyway, but it&#x27;s definitely potent and works very well. We use it primarily for my 10 year old with ADHD. We layer Vetiver, Cedarwood, and Lavender (sometimes with Frankincense for an added boost) under her big toes to help boost concentration and calm her down enough to focus. She isn&#x27;t a big fan of the scent either, but the effect is very noticeable and when we layer with the other oils, the smell is much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Shipping time was find but the bottle had leaked all over the bubble wrap it was enclosed in. I&#x27;ve never used Vetiver and am not a fan of the smell. I can&#x27;t describe  it but don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing it again. It didn&#x27;t have the wood,earth fragrance I was expecting</li>
            <li> Oil is of good quality, but the bottle created much trouble despite much effort to clean/repair the dropper.  Needed to eventually purchase replacement bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! The smell is so addicting. I use a combo of this, lavender, and chamomile to rub on my baby&#x27;s feet before bed. It calms him right down and has become an indispensable part of our bedtime routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is very thick and aromatic, so a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> Love plant therapy, great products!</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!  The oil is supposed to be thick.  Just remove the stopper and use another tool (dropper or pipet) or just be VERY careful tipping it.  It is strong stuff.</li>
            <li> This oil is very strong, but works very well!</li>
            <li> Smells lovely!!!  I&#x27;m always pleased with Plant Therapy &amp; their products!</li>
            <li> The dropper won&#x27;t work :( SO I have to take off the lid to get to the lovely oil, which is quite wasteful, but when I&#x27;m finished with it I do smell amazing. Love the oil, just not the dropper.</li>
            <li> Does not smell or works like what I used in the past.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Love Plant Therapy oils and their excellent customer service. Order often directly from their website bit it it so great that I can also order on Amazon and use points have have earned on credit cards to purchase even more!</li>
            <li> Earthy smell; love it</li>
            <li> I purchased Vetiver to make my own menstrual cramp relief blend.  I am not crazy about the smell of Vetiver; it reminds me of Liquid Smoke.  However, the menstrual cramp relief blend that I made (5 drops sweet marjoram, 3 drops ginger, 2 drops Vetiver, 10 ml carrier oil) worked wonderfully to ease my cramps (they&#x27;re very bad the first two days), so I am willing to smell a little like Liquid Smoke in order to have the relief. :)  I believe that Plant Therapy Essential Oils are of good quality at a great price.</li>
            <li> I have the hardest getting the oil to come out of the bottle. I usually have to take the top off, which is super messy</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this.  It is called &amp;#34;khus&amp;#34; or kusa grass in India, used for many purposes, including worship.  Has such a wonderful deep smell.  There is no in between on this one - you will either love it or hate it.  I plan on trying this at night to help with sleep.</li>
            <li> Great product! I tried a couple of others, but they were thin and watery, and had a burnt note to the aroma. The Plant Therapy Vetiver is more reasonably priced than the MLM products and has that very thick viscosity and the wonderful true Vetiver aroma I&#x27;ve come to expect and love.</li>
            <li> I have never used Vetiver before.  It DOES have a very &amp;#34;pungent&amp;#34; smell so be prepared for that.&lt;br /&gt;This blend is very thick.  I am not sure if that is the way it is supposed to be, but it is the thickest oil I have ever purchased.&lt;br /&gt;I like all of the Plant Therapy oils I have purchased so far...just not sure about the consistency of this one, but it seems to work properly.</li>
            <li> A classic fragrance in a very handy form. A terrific way to introduce essential oil into your bathing or shaving routine, or carry it with you for a lovely scent anywhere you please. A drop or two on a puck of shaving soap can produce some really surprising results.</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy sells great stuff.  Vetiver is one of those love it or hate it scents.  I happen to be a fan.</li>
            <li> This may be a decent oil, I&#x27;m not sure. The oil won&#x27;t come out of the bottle (if there is even any oil in the bottle) and customer service was no help.</li>
            <li> Great quality and very fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Vetiver is great for pain. It also has a woodsy smell.  It is a little thick so I mix it with Peppermint and Olive Oil and use it to massage my husband&#x27;s back and hands (he details cars) and for any pain that comes up.</li>
            <li> It smells so bad it stresses me out even more. I even mix it with a carrier oil. I have not gotten to enjoy it because of the smell.</li>
            <li> I had read that either you loved vetiver or you hated it.  I love it!!  Diffused at bedtime with cedarwood and lavender, it knocks me out!</li>
            <li> Wonderful and warm. Great winter scent. Love it!</li>
            <li> Very pure oil, I&#x27;m super happy with it especially for such a great price! I will definitely be buying more Plant Therapy oils in the near future. I use it to keep me alert when studying or taking a test. My grades have already begun improving</li>
            <li> Great price. Would buy it again. Sweet smell.</li>
            <li> Great oil for my son who has adhd.  He puts it on the big toes.</li>
            <li> I used this on my knee after surgery it took the pain away! Love this stuff!  It is a little thicker than most oils and harder to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Plant therapy has high quality pure oils. Independent third party tested as pure as other pricier brands. Vetiver is a great oil for ADHD and sleep problems.</li>
            <li> Smell horrible but works great</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not very familiar with the smell of vetiver, this had almost no fragrance.  Had to remove the &#x27;drop controller&#x27; .  It was clogged with what appeared to be old &#x27;hardened&#x27; oil.</li>
            <li> very earthy smell, it helps me relax and drift off to sleep!</li>
            <li> This is a really good oil for those who are having trouble sleeping.  I&#x27;ve been blending it with other essential oils in my diffuser at night and I have been able to see a difference.  I&#x27;m actually sleeping better at night.  I would really encourage other to give it a try.  It certainly can&#x27;t hurt and it&#x27;s better than taking sleeping pills all the time!</li>
