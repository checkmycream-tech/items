            <li>This has an awesome colour, not too bright, but perfectly noticeable.</li>
            <li>However, because it&#x27;s a balm rather than a dense or creamy lipstick, it managed to compliment me surprisingly well!</li>

            <li>I have worn this alone, and also under another lipstick for more intense color with a very smooth look.</li>

            <li>As Baby Lips are notorious for, it goes on smooth and feels like heaven.</li>
            <li>It makes my lips feel ultra smooth and is somewhat long-lasting.</li>
            <li>Still a great product overall.</li>
            <li>The taste is very mild and fades quickly.</li>
            <li>I love it and keep my lips really soft with a cute color.  </li>
            <li>I bought it and used it right away!</li>
            <li>Loved by my teenage goddaughter</li>
            <li>THE PRODUCT IS AS DESCRIBED IN COLOR, TRUE TO COLOR,</li>
            <li>TRUE TO BLEND IN WITH LIP NATURE COLOR.</li>
            <li>The package was kind of old .</li>
            <li>I love all chap stick really</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>I ordered this baby lips off Amazon for the start of the fall and by mid october one of my friends took it from me because she loved it so much.</li>
            <li>I have 4 so far and love the product.</li>
            <li>It is an awesome, deep pink on my medium brown skin tone!</li>
            <li>This is good for people who do there makeup more subtle.</li>
            <li>It feels great on my lips and gives them a little color!  </li>
            <li>But a few blots on a tissue and it was back to feeling perfect again.</li>
            <li>I have to say the commercial was actually very accurate.</li>
            <li>Smells really good though and it it&#x27;s a bright pink, not very neon or loud.</li>
            <li>This Electro color really lives up to its name!</li>
            <li>It makes your lips feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Came earlier than expected and was in great quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives a slight hint of color that&#x27;s not too noticeable, yet pretty in its own way.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s brighter than I would usually go for, as bright colors tend to wash me out.</li>
            <li>I really like these baby lips balms a lot.</li>
            <li>They have a soft, and fun tint.</li>
            <li>sooooo much.</li>
            <li>It came in really fast</li>
            <li>I love the color (pink shock)</li>
            <li>The color is a bit more neon-ish than I expected, but I guessing that&#x27;s the point.</li>
            <li>i have a different lipstick that my mom bought for me from the store, so I very rarely use this one.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert and these really help hydrate my parched lips.</li>
            <li>I will probably buy more in the regular colors as well in the future.</li>
            <li>is a very good product, but not liking me being placed into such a big box if it was just a lipstick, charge by weight in Venezuela, and had to pay over the odds for something so small.</li>
            <li>I had to get a new one.</li>
            <li>I really love the subtle but strong pink tint that it gives your lips and the smell.</li>
            <li>Came really early!</li>
            <li>Still I think this color is a very wearable pink especially if you apply it lightly.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more of a translucent lip balm for everyday use, but this is actually quite matte and goes on very pink/</li>
            <li>Overall I really like this product</li>
            <li>Makes your lips feel irresistibly soft after you&#x27;ve worn it</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll still use it, just not everyday.</li>
            <li>Wished the color was more subtle for a lip balm.</li>
            <li>You can vary the intensity of the color by applying a little less, or more.</li>
            <li>This particular color \\&quot;pink shock\\&quot; looks very intimidating in the tube as it is neon pink.</li>
            <li>When I tried applying it quite thickly to see the kind of color payoff I could get, it did feel a little waxy (no worse than the average lipstick though).</li>

            <li> You can definitely see the pink color on your lips when it is applied.</li>
            <li> It gives you very pink, not dark pink-</li>
            <li> and I have almost all the limited edition \\&quot;neons\\&quot; now.</li>
            <li> leaves a pink tint on ur lips.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t agree with that and would probably be turned off if it did; it almost smells like pink lemonade.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected it .</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very pick about the way glosses and lipsticks smell, some really awful or too potent ones give me headaches.</li>
            <li> Unlike other Baby Lips, this one doesn&#x27;t have a flavor or scent.</li>
            <li> This particular one only has a very faint berry scent, and I could not taste it all.</li>
            <li> I like the subtle hint of red that this lip balm gives my lips</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have that heavy thick feeling of lipgloss.  </li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m totally addicted.</li>
            <li> but I think some of the &amp;#34;dramatic results&amp;#34; are a but exaggerated.</li>
            <li> but this product disappointed me .</li>

            <li> I really like these baby lips balms a lot. I live in the desert and these really help hydrate my parched lips. This particular color \\&quot;pink shock\\&quot; looks very intimidating in the tube as it is neon pink. This is one of the more pigmented colors I have. You can definitely see the pink color on your lips when it is applied. It seems to vary between colors how much actual pigmentation they have. You can vary the intensity of the color by applying a little less, or more. Still I think this color is a very wearable pink especially if you apply it lightly. When I tried applying it quite thickly to see the kind of color payoff I could get, it did feel a little waxy (no worse than the average lipstick though). But a few blots on a tissue and it was back to feeling perfect again. Some of these balms have a very strong scent and/or taste. This particular one only has a very faint berry scent, and I could not taste it all. Overall I really like this product and I have almost all the limited edition \\&quot;neons\\&quot; now. I will probably buy more in the regular colors as well in the future.</li>
            <li> Bought this for someone else, and they don&#x27;t seem to have any complaints other than the color being not as clear as expected.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! This is my go to lip balm!!!!</li>
            <li> The new \\&quot;Electro\\&quot; colors from Maybelline New York are excellent! I love this splendid pop of pink color. It makes my lips feel ultra smooth and is somewhat long-lasting. Of course, you will need/want to reapply during the day -- but this stuff is great. I have worn this alone, and also under another lipstick for more intense color with a very smooth look. The taste is very mild and fades quickly. Excellent stuff -- one of the best tinted lip balms ever. Maybelline, please don&#x27;t ever discontinue this line!!</li>
            <li> I love Baby Lips! I love all chap stick really, I&#x27;m totally addicted. I like these for various reasons. They have a soft, and fun tint. They bring my lips back to life. They have tons of great colors to pick from. Also, they are tasty and smell great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives&lt;br /&gt;-The smell&lt;br /&gt;-The color&lt;br /&gt;-The lightness of the tint&lt;br /&gt;-The Smoothness&lt;br /&gt;-How Great it Makes My Lips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives&lt;br /&gt;-The Price Tag, $2.98 in stores, ouchy!</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter, she loves it. Wished the color was more subtle for a lip balm. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This baby lips balm is great!&lt;br /&gt;It gives a slight hint of color that&#x27;s not too noticeable, yet pretty in its own way.&lt;br /&gt;It;s very hydrating &amp; is a great product to keep in your purse, and to apply as needed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy with this, I&#x27;m absolutely LOVING it sooooo much. Definitely recommend this baby lips!</li>
            <li> Not good. I just used once.</li>
            <li> This product was okay. I liked it and the scent</li>
            <li> This is really great and it gives a really bright pink color. If your looking for a Chapstick with lots of color this is the one for you</li>
            <li> exscatly like the photo. same color and everything</li>
            <li> It came in really fast I love the color (pink shock) I got just what I wanted</li>
            <li> Just bought this after reading the reviews and watching the video showing a model  wearing the color. I have to say the commercial was actually very accurate. It gives you very pink, not dark pink- but a noticeable healthy glow pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pick about the way glosses and lipsticks smell, some really awful or too potent ones give me headaches. This definitely has a smell. Someone commented that it smelled like berry. I don&#x27;t agree with that and would probably be turned off if it did; it almost smells like pink lemonade.</li>
            <li> These give your lips a very light shiny color and moisturize just the right amount.  It doesn&#x27;t have that heavy thick feeling of lipgloss.  Makes your lips feel irresistibly soft after you&#x27;ve worn it your lips just look better and have this really cool texture on them.  This is good for people who do there makeup more subtle.</li>
            <li> I like the subtle hint of red that this lip balm gives my lips but I don&#x27;t think it moisturizes at all. Nonetheless, I like it and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected and was in great quality. The color is a bit more neon-ish than I expected, but I guessing that&#x27;s the point. Still a great product overall.</li>
            <li> I ordered this baby lips off Amazon for the start of the fall and by mid october one of my friends took it from me because she loved it so much. I had to get a new one.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product I love it I give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> An Amazing product. Keeps my lips soft and pink.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected it . I been buying Maybelline lipsticks, lip gloss , for years  but this product disappointed me .</li>
            <li> Came very quick. LOVE the color , makes my lips pop. Many people think I have on lipstick, but It&#x27;s babylips. I have 4 so far and love the product.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more of a translucent lip balm for everyday use, but this is actually quite matte and goes on very pink/red.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll still use it, just not everyday. Bought some eos&#x27; instead.</li>
