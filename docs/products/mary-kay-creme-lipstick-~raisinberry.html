            <li>Goes on nicely with no lipstick taste.  </li>
            <li>am assuming its nice quality make up</li>
            <li>The color is true and creamy, makes your lips look great.  </li>
            <li>I was so glad I could still get the color (raisin berry).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so glad to be able to still get the color (Raisinberry).  </li>
            <li>I do love Mary Kay lipstick</li>
            <li>and I am so glad they continue to offer this color.</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>The replacement tube was better, but part of the surface of the lipstick was disrupted.  </li>
            <li>Goes well with many colors of clothing.</li>
            <li>So glad I was able to find this shade of Mary Kay Lipstick.  </li>
            <li>It is my all time favorite and it has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely my favorite lipstick.  </li>
            <li>This truly is my all time favorite lipstick.  </li>
            <li>I love this shade of lipstick.</li>
            <li>So nice in a rich color and creamy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not change color after you put it on and it is a great color for older people because it is light yet not colorless and goes with everything</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and stays on longer than most lipsticks.  </li>
            <li>This is a great neutral color and I would order from this supplier again most definitely.</li>
            <li>It is my absolute favorite color!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing it didn&#x27;t come out of the mold smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy and rich in color.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited I found it....</li>
            <li>The formula does feel good on the lips and the color does last,</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Came fast, nice &amp; new packaging, can&#x27;t complain about anything.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I have used this product and color several times before and have had many compliments on the color.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t go wrong with Mary Kay, and the fact that I was able to get a good price for it on Amazon was a plus.  </li>
            <li>Mary Kay makes great lipsticks that last and don&#x27;t dry your lips out!!</li>
            <li>It is not sealed so you can&#x27;t be certain that it hasn&#x27;t been opened.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be certain</li>
            <li>Great price and only took a few days to get in the mail.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t really know.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be interested in trying other colors of Mary Kay lipstick, but I think I&#x27;ll try purchasing directly from a Mary Kay rep. and see if the products are defect free.  </li>
            <li>Was really surprised to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The other brands cause marked irritation at the edges of my lips after the first application.  </li>
            <li>The product comes in it&#x27;s original box which is then placed in a small plastic zip lock bag.  </li>
            <li>Have tried other brands and they seem to have a funny taste to them.</li>
            <li>Have purchased this product from Mary Kay directly before and it was the same.</li>
            <li>I do get a mild irritation along the edges of my lips if I apply it heavily, or use it daily.</li>
            <li>The first tube I received had the tip of the lipstick missing.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It lasts and doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips.</li>
            <li> I like this because it is less likely to irritate my lips unlike all the other brands I&#x27;ve tried (Chanel, Lancome, Clinique, Cover Girl, Revlon, Estee Lauder, Urban Decay, etc).  </li>
            <li> The lipstick lasts for several hours - at least I can feel it&#x27;s smoothness on my lips.  </li>
            <li> Always lasts, never lets me down.  </li>
            <li> Have used Mary Kay, Raisinberry for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> Despite that, the color is like a sheer cinnamon - a faintly tinged orange brown.  </li>
            <li> I think the lipstick I purchased was from outdated stock.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with this Mary Kay product.  </li>
            <li> The color is so faint</li>

            <li> I was so glad I could still get the color (raisin berry).  I had used it before in another area I had lived in.  So nice in a rich color and creamy.&lt;br /&gt;My order was perfect.  Thank you so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so glad to be able to still get the color (Raisinberry).  It&#x27;s creamy and rich in color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with this Mary Kay product.  I have used Mary Kay lipstick for the last 10 years.  I think the lipstick I purchased was from outdated stock.</li>
            <li> Color goes with everything on any color skin!!</li>
            <li> I do love Mary Kay lipstick and I am so glad they continue to offer this color. It does not change color after you put it on and it is a great color for older people because it is light yet not colorless and goes with everything</li>
            <li> just what I wanted. Fast delivery. good condition Thank you. I love this color. I was in floeida and didnt have a mary k rep</li>
            <li> This is a great neutral color and I would order from this supplier again most definitely. 5 stars, I got it on time.</li>
            <li> Had this years ago and when it was discontinued could not find it anywhere.  Was really surprised to find it on Amazon.  Has great staying power and the color is still perfect.</li>
            <li> The color is not what I was expecting.  On me, it&#x27;s vey brown and not flattering at all.  The formula does feel good on the lips and the color does last,</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go wrong with Mary Kay, and the fact that I was able to get a good price for it on Amazon was a plus.  The color is true and creamy, makes your lips look great.  To date, I have had the best luck with Mary Kay lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay makes great lipsticks that last and don&#x27;t dry your lips out!!</li>
            <li> This  was sold by &amp;#34;Auntie Ann&#x27;s Attic&amp;#34; and fulfilled by Amazon.  The first tube I received had the tip of the lipstick missing.  There were lines like it had been scraped.  The replacement tube was better, but part of the surface of the lipstick was disrupted.  I&#x27;m guessing it didn&#x27;t come out of the mold smoothly.  The product comes in it&#x27;s original box which is then placed in a small plastic zip lock bag.  It is not sealed so you can&#x27;t be certain that it hasn&#x27;t been opened.  Despite that, the color is like a sheer cinnamon - a faintly tinged orange brown.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting a sheer lipstick. I thought it would be opaque and the color in the picture.  I like this because it is less likely to irritate my lips unlike all the other brands I&#x27;ve tried (Chanel, Lancome, Clinique, Cover Girl, Revlon, Estee Lauder, Urban Decay, etc).  I do get a mild irritation along the edges of my lips if I apply it heavily, or use it daily. The other brands cause marked irritation at the edges of my lips after the first application.  The lipstick lasts for several hours - at least I can feel it&#x27;s smoothness on my lips.  The color is so faint I can&#x27;t be certain I still see it on my lips.  I&#x27;d be interested in trying other colors of Mary Kay lipstick, but I think I&#x27;ll try purchasing directly from a Mary Kay rep. and see if the products are defect free.  This willl also give me an opportunity to try the color before making a purchase .</li>
            <li> Lipstick color changes on my lips, completely different color.  Don&#x27;t like color on my lips.</li>
            <li> Great color.  Goes well with many colors of clothing.</li>
            <li> So glad I was able to find this shade of Mary Kay Lipstick.  It is my all time favorite and it has been discontinued.  So glad to find it!</li>
            <li> This lipstick is great! It is my absolute favorite color!</li>
            <li> Everything was as it should be. Have purchased this product from Mary Kay directly before and it was the same.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely my favorite lipstick.  Goes on nicely with no lipstick taste.  Have used Mary Kay, Raisinberry for a few years now.  Have tried other brands and they seem to have a funny taste to them.</li>
            <li> This truly is my all time favorite lipstick.  Always lasts, never lets me down.  Plenty of color without looking too garish.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Great price and only took a few days to get in the mail. I will be shopping here again.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this one all I can say was it&#x27;s not my color LOL !</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Creamy lipstick. Neutral color that I keep in my purse.</li>
            <li> This product has been discontinued with Mary Kay so I have been looking for it and I&#x27;m excited I found it....</li>
            <li> I love this shade of lipstick. It lasts and doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips.</li>
            <li> gave as a gift by request to someone who loves Mary Kay and lip stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am assuming its nice quality make up but I wouldn&#x27;t really know. Came fast, nice &amp; new packaging, can&#x27;t complain about anything.</li>
