            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also a good price and works great.</li>
            <li>I got remarkable results on using it on my jacket with piffs.</li>
            <li>it is ok, not the greatest.</li>
            <li>Over the years I haven&#x27;t returned many items but it&#x27;s always been a flawless experience.</li>
            <li>we gave it a 4 star since it works great with a good motor (assuming you used good batteries).</li>
            <li>great item , very  pleased, plan on buying another one for my daughter for xmas</li>

            <li>Good price as well.</li>
            <li>it just is not as good as a manual fabric comb.  </li>
            <li>It works so good</li>
            <li>I bought 3, one to replace the one that croaked, and 2 for friends who asked \\&quot;help me maintain my sweaters, yours always look good year after year\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t tend to write reviews, but I felt like I owed one since good reviews guided me to this purchase.</li>

            <li>Best for smooth fabric</li>
            <li>Dollar-for-dollar, this is probably as good as you will get when it comes to lint removers.</li>

            <li>The product is definitely good.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Nothing good to say about it.</li>

            <li>This product is every bit as good as it says.</li>
            <li>yes and good and yes</li>
            <li>Good purchase, we&#x27;ll use it often.</li>

            <li>Good product for the money.  </li>
            <li>good power for the price.  </li>
            <li>Good for removing lint.</li>

            <li>Works really good</li>
            <li>Good product, does what it says.</li>
            <li>It takes a good chunk off but not all them</li>
            <li>It is important to keeping my clothes and my appearence at my best.</li>
            <li>and then it died again (this time for good).</li>
            <li>So maybe if you don&#x27;t mind securing the cover, then it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li>is good stafe and berfict and good and good and</li>
            <li>Worked very effectively and a nice proce</li>
            <li>was very easy to use and worked great.  </li>
            <li>The grip is very good (very important point) and handy.</li>
            <li>Amazon CS was very great to work with and gave me a full refund.</li>

            <li>Favorite sweaters needed help and a friend at work recommended this product whihc works great and refreshes much loved sweaters</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable on my hand and does a great job at removing pills, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product and the price is even more excellent when compared to the cost of new sweaters.</li>
            <li>for best results, lay garment flat on a table, that way you don&#x27;t make a hole by accident. :D</li>
            <li>Kind of a pain to clean, but a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>The delivery was quick!!!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a great buy for the price, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made!  </li>
            <li>Since the face unscrews to allow for better clean-out, it would be great if Remington offered a smaller-holed replaceable face for lightweight material.</li>
            <li>I am very glad this was the one I chose.  </li>
            <li>Having just bought this item, I have now revitalized a favorite sport coat and a great sweater.  </li>

            <li>absolutely amazing.</li>

            <li>This lint remover is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is simply an amazing product.</li>
            <li>This makes the used clothing I sell look amazing.</li>
            <li>thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product to amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I bought this to remove the fuzz from daughters uniform and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is really amazing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that this would work the amazing way that it did.  </li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim since it was so cheap, but I have to say its works great</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>Works amazingly well</li>
            <li>but besides this it worked amazing for removing pills from jackets and hoodies</li>
            <li>This fabric shaver is cheap but works great.</li>
            <li>It was amazing.</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Handy tool to keep around.</li>
            <li>Wonderful, powerful, great price, it toke a while to get here but worth it .</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice catching it on anything or anything like that, but when I took it apart, it appeared the shaft that the blades are connected to had somehow bent, so the blades couldn&#x27;t turn without hitting the mesh cover and stopping.  </li>
            <li>This fabric shaver really works Great!</li>
            <li>Effective at removing lint.</li>
            <li>So handy.</li>
            <li>And note that you need your own AA batteries.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was nice.</li>
            <li>In contrast, the [[ASIN:B000WUXOT2 Sweater Stone]] worked perfectly and is amazingly gentle.  </li>
            <li>Nice price too.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Therefore, I would say it works, but use at your own risk of damaging clothing.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it worked to remove the pills; however, the battery compartment lid and the lint collector kept falling off while I was using it.  </li>
            <li>The blades havet a nice cover to protect it</li>
            <li>Nice gadget to remove those little&lt;</li>
            <li>It works best if held diagonally or vertically, which isn&#x27;t really what I bought it for.</li>
            <li>Saw a fren wit this 1st then got my own 2 when I ruin my daughter sweater now</li>
            <li>Refreshed them really nicely.</li>
            <li>and it works so good on my sofa :)</li>
            <li>This shaver is one of those items you would probably never buy on your own, but you are so grateful for it when it comes in your life.</li>
            <li>She also had a teenager who was delighted that a pair of her pants and favorite shirts were saved with this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a nice job of removing the pills from sweaters.  </li>
            <li>but I honestly don&#x27;t know how you can make a hole with this machine, unless of course you are trying to shave stockings.</li>
            <li>Came in handy.</li>
            <li>Cleans up sweaters nicely.</li>
            <li>I made so many beloved sweaters wearable again.</li>
            <li>So this item kind of works.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to get pills of of a non-wool pea coat that I own.  </li>
            <li>Honest to goodness</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, but it&#x27;d be perfect if it didn&#x27;t clog that often!</li>
            <li>Better then I excepted for the price Loved it.</li>
            <li>He really liked it.</li>
            <li>I can keep my clothes looking nice longer.</li>
            <li>Move it slower will move lint nicely.</li>
            <li>The kind of sweater have longer lint, it will not work well.</li>
            <li>It is nicely made and fits into the hand nicely.</li>
            <li>Seller did a perfect transaction with fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>My wife is thrilled.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it one every kind of fabric</li>
            <li>THAT I SOMEHOW LOST &amp; WAS THRILLED TO SEE AMAZON HAD ONE.  </li>
            <li>There are just some projects that stay fuzzy because of the nature of the kind of fibers used.</li>
            <li>It removes &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; from any kind of fabric.</li>
            <li>I have used this to shave a couple of sweaters since I purchased it and have to say that it is a handy and functional item.</li>
            <li>Nice</li>
            <li>What a handy gadget.</li>
            <li>So happy to find something that works this well and at such a great price!</li>
            <li>Nice Fabric shaver.</li>
            <li>Nice blades.</li>
            <li>tightening the screen also provides a nice &amp;#34;closeness&amp;#34; adjustment.</li>
            <li>The material removed seems to kind of collect in there.  </li>
            <li>Great product and worth every penny!</li>
            <li>This inexpensive sweater shaver works great and was well worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>Perfect for keeping clothes looking new!</li>
            <li>It does a decent job but depending on the situation, it might not do a perfect job.</li>
            <li>I love having this fabric shaver, it works awesome and does exactly what I need it to.</li>
            <li>its not the best thing that will keep you happy for long</li>
            <li>This is a high quality and perfect shaver.</li>
            <li>Very surprising how much lint ends up in the reservoir!</li>
            <li>The best thing about it is that it requires normal AA batteries (which you can find at any home).</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with how it works and hope to get many years of use out of it.</li>
            <li>very pleased :)</li>
            <li>I am very happy, it saved me from buying a new coat.</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly without damaging the fabric, and now my sport coat has a new life.</li>
            <li>so I needed a new one- its great!</li>
            <li>The shaver worked perfectly and it looks like a new coat.  </li>
            <li>wonderful, brought my wooly outdoor research hybrid coat to a brand new standstill.</li>
            <li>But, happy day - this one is great so far.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of de-fuzzing, shaving the top of the fabric, and pulling pills, and stray threads free.</li>
            <li>Better yet, donate it to a good charity :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good machine and easy to use it now continuously..</li>
            <li>One good thing is that all the lint and beads are captured in the tray which makes for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>From the tiniest to the biggest threads, this shaver would gulp anything that comes its way.&lt;br /&gt;The style is good in that I could easily see the lint.</li>
            <li>Works great, removes pills quickly, doesn&#x27;t damage sweater.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and did a good job.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, its self explanatory.   </li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>Very strong and compact</li>
            <li>Once I got the hang of it, it was very easy to use</li>
            <li>Fabric Shaver is hand size and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>lint cover falls off very easily.</li>
            <li>Not so very easy to use, however; and</li>
            <li>Was very easy and got rid of all the lint balls that covered my hoodie!&lt;br /&gt;DEFFFFF</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and plan to buy another one for my sister as a gift.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and a laundry necessity.</li>
            <li>Good product, works just fine.</li>
            <li>Works great, it does exactly what it says it does!</li>
            <li>The suction wasn&#x27;t very good to begin with, so the fabric pills didn&#x27;t come off very well.  </li>
            <li>Even though that sweet sweater, awesome pair of herringbone slacks or those high end yoga pants look good from a distance.</li>
            <li>but I find it more effective removing from the bottom of the device.  </li>
            <li>So far I am impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>Also, the lint gets stuck alot, so i kind of have to disassemble the product many times because the lint gets stuck.</li>
            <li>be sure to take that off lmao</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the product so far.  </li>
            <li>and I will be using it to tidy up many of my sweaters after the wear-and-tear of this winter.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>BY FAR this product works the best!</li>
            <li>Honestly I bought one of these for $1 at Target a couple of years ago and it worked better than this.</li>
            <li>Probably the most effective pill remover</li>
            <li>LOVE IT COME IN HANDY</li>
            <li>but so far it works great!!!</li>
            <li>It works nicely and it helps make my sweaters look better.</li>
            <li>I work with vintage clothing and of course have my own favorite clothes that I wear time and time again.</li>
            <li>She did one of her coats, first thing, and said it came out beautifully.  </li>
            <li>But this fabric shaver is more cost effective.</li>
            <li>It works great, and it is super cheap, so if it breaks then no biggie!  </li>
            <li>So easy to use and does the job!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and very safe too.</li>
            <li>Very glad I purchased this, it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s going strong!</li>
            <li>Like this product, very handy and delivers the job quickly and safely.</li>
            <li>Great product, worked perfectly to remove little fuzz balls from the couch fabric.</li>
            <li>This little thing removes lint balls excellently and for a great price.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, made my girlfriend super happy, which makes me happy...</li>
            <li>I used this today for the first time and it worked great on 2 sweaters...until the blade somehow got caught on the guard and broke it.</li>
            <li>but I am still pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>Works the best after  so many several kind tried.</li>
            <li>This is the first sweater shaver I&#x27;ve bought and am happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>first lol.</li>
            <li>Worked great when it was functioning ;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to use, and best of all, it makes my fuzzy sweaters look like new.</li>
            <li>This little shaver is great , Very handy, Though it takes couple of your minutes but does it job quite fairly.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li>This is very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make it a year with very light use.  </li>
            <li>Great small size allows me to travel with it and batter life is excellent.</li>
            <li>Fits nicely in my hand and was easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy and effective.  </li>
            <li>Gets rid of all the fuzzies easily and effectively.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li>The rotating area is a good size and works quick.</li>
            <li>Received quick and in good condition.</li>
            <li>It saved many of my favorite coats and I can wear them again now cuz I can easily shave off those fabric balls!</li>
            <li>Good product, works well, easy to use and to hold, requires batteries, not too large, good price, recommend to anyone for lint removal</li>
            <li>Most of the time I would just consider them as work shirts or rags, but this this removed the pilling very quickly and made the shirts look good again and made them comfortable to wear again.</li>
            <li>Worked wonders on an old and very loved hand knitted blanket.</li>
            <li>Very good to get rid of fuzz on your sweaters or old clothes.</li>
            <li>It matches the description and is very good to remove the threads poking out of old clothes.</li>
            <li>Still, the device  took about 3 cubic inches of fuzz, including many of the smallest size pills, off of one large sweater and the appearance was greatly improved.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it would, and some reviews said it cut into their clothing (read those, because I haven&#x27;t had this problem and don&#x27;t know if there are certain types of materials or ways of using this that result in that), but it has been great for me.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for and older model that stopped working,  It was easy to find online and was a very good price.</li>
            <li>I bought this little gadget on the many good reviews and it worked magnificently.</li>
            <li>This t-shirt is 60% cotton and 40% polyester like most of my shirts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better out there, but for the price, it does what is needed.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s able to shave off most pills on things that i&#x27;ve used it for.</li>
            <li>The top screws off</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t submit any more knit tops to this brutality.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I bought this and now all the fuzz is gone and my comforter is back to perfect again.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SHAVER, LIKE</li>
            <li>I always try not to buy the cheapest items, but most of us know that Remington has been around for years</li>
            <li>I mostly use it on my wool coat.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it does not drain batteries and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>My sweaters have never looked better.</li>
            <li>Does an okay job</li>
            <li>I love the fact that its battery operated, used to have one that was corded</li>
            <li>and that was a pain, having a portable one is much much better.    </li>
            <li>Sometimes cheap costs a lot!  </li>
            <li>More plastic junk into the landfill...</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This works just okay</li>
            <li>, it takes quite a while to get many sweater burrs.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s worked for many people out there</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Have used it on many sweaters, gloves and socks.  </li>
            <li>Love the Sweater Shaver.  </li>
            <li>I wish the it would hold more lint.</li>
            <li>I can wear my favorite sweaters again  </li>
            <li>I was in need of a way to get rid of the many lint balls that covered some of my our clothing.</li>
            <li>However, it does have a tendency to catch on the thread and has ripped a hole in many of my shirts.</li>
            <li>I plan on purchasing one more for my school costume closet.</li>
            <li>MAKE SURE</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>I enjoy taking nice care of my clothes, so I tried this.</li>
            <li>Would recommend for sure.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask of a 6 dollar product?   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already used it on my 2 favorite sweaters.  </li>
            <li>Have been looking for something to save my favorite sweaters.  </li>
            <li>Surprising powerful for its size.</li>
            <li>I will say that sometimes the fuzz gets stuck in the top chamber</li>
            <li>My boyfriend wears sweaters all winter &amp; they become the most heinous fuzzy beast-like things.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I purchased it.</li>
            <li>and they love it.</li>
            <li>and my skirt looks so much better.</li>
            <li>i had the most stubborn fuzz on my fabric mattress cover.</li>
            <li>Love this lint remover.</li>
            <li>De-pilling is also strangely satisfying.</li>
            <li>I had bought a sofa and it had many pills of fabric</li>
            <li>I love my shaver, Ive restored alot of shirts that had lint all over.</li>
            <li>You will absolutely love the product.</li>
            <li>and you need to make sure there is no material stuck in the shaving part of this item as it will catch onto the material and create a hole.</li>
            <li>then that, i love this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>need I say more.</li>
            <li>My mom, and her kind heart, bought me a huge bulky shaver that needed 2 D batteries thinking it would save time.</li>
            <li>( Also, remember to take the plastic guard off the top of the blade.  </li>
            <li>It works much better that way :) )</li>
            <li>Most of the time, the shavings do not fall out when opening to toss out.</li>
            <li>I have many jackets and coats that got fuzzy on the exterior and interior...</li>
            <li>Since then I seldom wore those jackets and coats again, but I love them</li>
            <li>My favorite sweater felt almost like sandpaper</li>
            <li>Batteries not included so be sure to have some around.</li>
            <li>This shaver works brilliantly on my son&#x27;s pilly wool diaper covers, and natural fiber inserts.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m searching for more clothes and fabrics to shave....</li>
            <li>But it sure does remove pills.</li>
            <li>This product is okay</li>
            <li>I was nervous about trying it out again after that, but I have not had any more problems since I have been using it correctly.</li>
            <li>I love that this guy fits in my purse....</li>
            <li>because most often, I want to use it while</li>
            <li>Love having this tool in my sewing kit.</li>
            <li>Considering how much most people need a gadget like this, this cannot be beaten for price or ease of use.</li>
            <li>We are really pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Just put the sweater on top of my dresser and glided the fabric shaver along, not putting pressure on it as per the instructions.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so it seems to set the sweater up for even more pills.  </li>
            <li>lol For the money, you really wont find a better product.</li>
            <li>Works OK.</li>
            <li>It works ok.  </li>
            <li>I used to have a hand shaver that worked better.</li>
            <li>It would catch most of the snags, but eventually the blades would get clogged up.</li>
            <li>i *love*</li>
            <li>This has really been great.</li>
            <li>It gets rid of most of the visible pills.</li>
            <li>This product was okay to remove some of the fabric fuzzes...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually better than the one I used as a kid.</li>
            <li>I have many \\&quot;DeFuzzers\\</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have so many clothes that has lint on them which makes them look worn out...especially sweater material.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>( We do we need to add more words on Amazon?</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to many people.  </li>
            <li>This 5 stars is an appropriate rating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say my sweaters are 70% better looking than they were before use.  </li>
            <li>This fabric shaver is the only one I&#x27;ve ever used, but I was very impressed with how well it trimmed my cashmere sweaters that had started to pill.    </li>
            <li>the regular squarish one, it work the best of them all.</li>
            <li>Now I can wear many of my sweaters that I kept in the closet for the longest time.</li>
            <li>and they love it too.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>My sweater looked 10 times better after shaving</li>
            <li>--- use the fabric shaver and add years to your favorite sweater.  </li>
            <li>I love this item and have used one for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li>So pleased with this.</li>
            <li>I even was able to use it on a couple of ties as the stitching on the pattern began to come loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does an OK job.  </li>
            <li>I wish there was something that worked better.</li>
            <li>Better then doing it by hand.</li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>Love this lint shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of cheap.</li>
            <li>BUT IT WORKS BETTER</li>
            <li>This works better than most I have tried.</li>
            <li>Works as it said it would, satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li>A sweater stone worked better.</li>
            <li>glad i purchased it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>MY wife has a wool pea coat that needed some love as well</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It was just ok.  </li>
            <li>It works ok.  </li>
            <li>However I am extremely glad I did.</li>
            <li>I am extremely glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>I had to buy more for the family after I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li>will recommend it for sure.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to be able to still find these shavers.</li>
            <li>Looked all over and glad I found this item for me.</li>
            <li>But I thought this product would be more versatile.</li>
            <li>It functions ok.  </li>
            <li>I ruined one of my favorite blankets with it.</li>
            <li>Great product fast delivery would buy again</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a great job at removing pills from my sweaters and it is very time consuming to use.  </li>
            <li>i have this lovely angora sweater that had these pills covering it.</li>
            <li>but it had so many balls of fabric all over it she thought and hideous and didn&#x27;t want him wearing it anymore</li>
            <li>Added more words to finish review.</li>
            <li>Functions perfectly and is addictive to use.  </li>
            <li>I machine wash most of my sweaters</li>
            <li>My kids love shaving their clothes also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try and return it and invest in something better.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I was that amazed with this shaver, but I haven&#x27;t found a better one either.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Works OK</li>
            <li>I got this to fix a couple of my favorite cardigans that had a lot of fuzzballs on them.</li>
            <li>Purchase satisfied.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>I had a favorite that was covered with them.  </li>
            <li>I never had one before to compare it, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I love my Remington Clothes shaver.  </li>
            <li>This inexpensive item works as well or better than the others.</li>
            <li>I have even used it on rayon, and it has worked stunningly well.</li>
            <li>Makes my clothes look so much better</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t wear it any more becuase of all the lint on it.</li>
            <li>Well, mostly.  </li>
            <li>The device also makes a satisfying noise as you run it over your garment.</li>
            <li>It works better on socks and wool.</li>
            <li>There were so many that from a distance the slacks looked like they were polka dotted -</li>
            <li>It is definitely cheap, however does the job!  </li>
            <li>and that works much better.</li>
            <li>I can safely say is collects 99% of lint on my clothes.</li>
            <li>and i LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I am considering purchasing one more to keep it in stock.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m better off using my DeFuzzIt</li>
            <li>Just like one I had many years ago.</li>
            <li>Over the holidays my husband and I hosted a Christmas party where many sweaters were worn.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t agree more.</li>
            <li>After I&#x27;ve used it more I will try to comment again.</li>
            <li>I would recommend getting a better quality product.</li>
            <li>If it stops working remove the top cover and take the fuzz out of the end where the fan blade is and you are set to go.</li>
            <li>It seems we are importing more and more merchandise from China, and all the while Americans are losing their jobs because of it.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Completely satisfied with purchase.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I haven&#x27;t used it more than 2 times since the many months</li>
            <li>I love this purchase and recommend it to anyone--we&#x27;ve all got fuzzies that need to be gone somewhere.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a ton of power, and I&#x27;m glad it doesn&#x27;t since it would probably tear up my clothes if it did.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this thing.  </li>
            <li>IT SAVED MANY CLOTHES</li>
            <li>I love my crate and barrel couch but the fabric after a couple months started pilling up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It happened to be a featured &amp;#34;Add-On&amp;#34; so I bought 2 more as gifts.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this fabric shaver.</li>
            <li>It has resurrected many of my sweaters, gloves, and wool coats from the closet.</li>
            <li>I have a couple of pairs of pants that I love but they pill up in the wash.</li>
            <li>But still I love it.</li>
            <li>Use with care and think twice if it&#x27;s something you love or want to ever wear again.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to try and remove pilling from a favorite jacket.</li>
            <li>The metal top just chipped away.  </li>
            <li>and it should still grip the pilled knots without sucking in the healthy fabric.</li>
            <li>People who wear a lot more wool than me?</li>
            <li>I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.</li>
            <li>I got a better on at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>Thsi one works ok, thoukgh</li>
            <li>we love it use it alot</li>
            <li>Maybe someone more diligent with more patience will have more luck.</li>
            <li>Nice light weight and tucks away in your suitcase.</li>
            <li>However, I do find that I have go go over some areas more than once.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Just got this package 2 minutes ago, pulled out my favorite sweater</li>
            <li>; is more a case of &amp;#34;Buyer</li>
            <li>; is more a case of &amp;#34;Buyer</li>
            <li>happy with the whole purchase..</li>
            <li>I use it on my sweaters for the most part...</li>
            <li>However it is not the most sturdy thing either...  </li>
            <li>Once I got this, I realized the durability seemed much better than what I had.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get one sweater done and part of another one.  </li>
            <li>Bought this to bring pilled clothes back to life and was more than impressed with the results.  </li>
            <li>The size is smaller than I thought but works great!</li>
            <li>I could not be more impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing really sexy about it.  </li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>Works better than what I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Seller/Shipper could also do a better job with packaging.</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews, I thought that this shaver would have operated better.</li>
            <li>I was able to revive alot of my Hoodies  </li>
            <li>Overall very happy with the purchase, though.</li>
            <li>and the thing ripped a hole in my favorite bra (seems like it was doomed to begin with).  </li>
            <li>So if you are patient or just really nee the fuzzies off its great.</li>
            <li>This is something that I searched for and others had it for much more.</li>
            <li>Over all I love this product.</li>
            <li>the job done :)</li>
            <li>I would recomend this to my friends. :)</li>
            <li>I love this depiller.  </li>
            <li>Awesome product, especially for the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep at it, but don&#x27;t expect your clothes to look \\&quot;like new\\&quot; again or to be able to keep your clothes that you love forever because of this miracle shaver.  </li>
            <li>It has made my peacoat look better.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did since it is much better than the one I was borrowing</li>
            <li>i love these for my leggings</li>
            <li>This works ok...</li>
            <li>Just okay.</li>
            <li>I love sweater dresses but my dryer leaves them covered in lint.</li>
            <li>It sure beats having to wear a bad-looking garment or having to eliminate it from the wardrobe.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased this.  </li>
            <li>I reviewed this type item for a while and was reluctant to purchase on line, but am so glad I did take the chance with this one.  </li>
            <li>It saved me money by saving some of my favorite clothes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Look for something more durable and save your money.</li>
            <li>Have not been more satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this gadget.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>This one was the top one that met my needs.  </li>
            <li>i should not have she has been able to remove the fuzzys off those sweaters and</li>
            <li>I love this peorduct</li>
            <li>Then I look at it after 10 minutes and see how much more I have to go.</li>
            <li>And cheap!</li>
            <li>The sweaters look much better after shaving them.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt if it touches your skin, so you&#x27;re safe there.</li>
            <li>But I feel like some of the thinner sweaters and many shirts may get eaten through.</li>
            <li>Its also very miniature, which is great for things like travel.</li>
            <li>I found this one at Walgreens and paid a lot more then I could get it here...</li>
            <li>so I make sure its turned off....</li>
            <li>it sure is easier then using the rollers...</li>
            <li>and it does a better job</li>
            <li>Its more like a hair cut.  </li>
            <li>The thinner the cotton, the better it works.  </li>
            <li>and I bought this to freshen up the items that were looking more worn.</li>
            <li>This does take off most fabric nubs.  </li>
            <li>Takes off most of the unwanted fabric parts sticking out.</li>
            <li>This thing works like magic.</li>
            <li>and it dropped it and broke it, but this one was cheaper and works better</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>Ok so I know this is just a fuzz shaver</li>
            <li>and I love removing the pills from pajama pants, tights, workout pants and even some tops that have pilled.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping for better results on my sweaters.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I should have read better.  </li>
            <li>It does the job well for the most part.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>and I was sure it broke.</li>
            <li>It does remove that stubborn lint that forms after many washes.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This in one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made on Amazon- a total \\&quot;must have\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This is a better product than the shaver that you can plug into the wall.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better fabric shavers.  </li>
            <li>This one is okay.  </li>
            <li>, most of us should already have those on hand.</li>
            <li>bought this because my favorite sweater looked</li>
            <li>and I am most pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Its helped me keep some of my favorite knitwear.  </li>
            <li>I love that&#x27;s gotten out of control.</li>
            <li>but sure enough, this works perfectly!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the tradeoff you make for something that&#x27;s going to clear pills from your fabric at an incredible pace</li>
            <li>I have now used this shaver many times on a variety of materials.</li>
            <li>I love these machines.  </li>
            <li>I am glad to have it.</li>
            <li>and I am highly pleased of my purchase.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>and it was entertaining to use this thing while watching TV.  </li>
            <li>A rewarding feeling.</li>
            <li>Just as advertised, gets most of the lint out of clothing g r e a t g r e a t</li>
            <li>I have been using it for more than a year.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned many shavers over the years.  </li>
            <li>I even bought a plug in one, thinking it might work better.</li>
            <li>9/30/2013- Still love it.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend uses it on her cotton/vinyl tank top without issues.</li>
            <li>and it worked its magic on it all.</li>
            <li>and my sweaters look better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>But i guess I won&#x27;t be able to use it on my cashmere sweaters if it was stronger.</li>
            <li>Love using this product.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to use it, because everytime</li>
            <li>This has saved my wool knit coat soooo many times.  </li>
            <li>I am highly satisfied.</li>
            <li>This shaver does work and it works ok</li>
            <li>The more robust material does not cut well.</li>
            <li>I filled the storage compartment with pills!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The product is okay .</li>
            <li>Tape works better</li>
            <li>It works ok -</li>
            <li>The product is ok but sweaters that pill are almost hopeless.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to stay away from any sweaters containing acrylic.  </li>
            <li>I found that varying the direction made it more thorough.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad it works and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>The sweaters look so much better.</li>
            <li>It has saved so many of my shirts and sweaters.</li>
            <li>I love vintage clothing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve removed lint, nubbies, fuzz off a shawl I had, pills on cushions where legs rub the fabric...and they&#x27;ll be more.  </li>
            <li>Ok, Ease of use and quality of performance: A+.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy another one as soon as I get my refund and give it one more try.  </li>
            <li>Barely touching the fabric</li>
            <li>I take the top off and blow off the blade after every use.</li>
            <li>I adjusted the batteries got it to work for 30 more seconds</li>
            <li>I have revived sweaters, mattresses, socks, blankets, pillows and more.</li>
            <li>Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>the blades get stuck every so often and you have to take the top and hte blades out and dig put</li>
            <li>Does an okay job.</li>
            <li>I really, really love this shaver.</li>
            <li>This takes most of the pills on our sweaters without snagging the fabric.</li>
            <li>It mainly use it for neck ties and its been perfect so far just not the best for a whole sweater.</li>
            <li>Cleaned up my new ottoman beautifully.</li>
            <li>Very handy though I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This fabric shaver makes great work of fleece clothing in particular, and I was pleased to have some of my clothing renewed.  </li>
            <li>Nice strong spinning blade that doesn&#x27;t snag too easily.  </li>
            <li>So far so good, works a miracle!</li>
            <li>The results were great and my sweater looks brand new!</li>
            <li>Mine has worked great, my shirts look bran new!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying a new one because it still so great love</li>
            <li>Have used it for several hours and still going strong - very impressed for an $8 product!</li>
            <li>this removed all of them very cleanly.  </li>
            <li>Light weight and suitable for travel.</li>
            <li>This product works pretty good for what it is designed to do.  </li>
            <li>I gotta say this is a pretty good product for the money.</li>
            <li>I primarily use it to remove pills from bedding/sheets and it works excellently if you use it as directed----just make sure you keep the discharge vessel cleaned out thoroughly and remove the cover to remove any shorn fabric that will likely start to tangle the spindle.  </li>
            <li>Loved it so much I bought a spare!</li>
            <li>First, the good news:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>My son in college loved it so much I bought one for him too!</li>
            <li>It works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The shaver works pretty good</li>
            <li>It also had pretty good battery life.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, feels good in your hand, and zips right along.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li>Well worth it!!</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s a great tool for keeping your sweaters looking brand new.  </li>
            <li>Works great as my sweater looks like new.  </li>
            <li>This shaver worked great on removing the lint and making my sweaters look like new.  </li>
            <li>It works great to remove the lint balls that form on the elastic on bras, making them look new.</li>
            <li>Works great, makes clothes look like new again.  </li>
            <li>I was shaving the balls off cashmere sweaters and it did a great job and the sweaters look like new again.</li>
            <li>I can understand why some people may have experienced rips on more sensitive clothing types.</li>
            <li>The razor is super nice</li>
            <li>; Easy to use, does what is advertised, what more do you want?</li>
            <li>Just be sure that the fabric has no lumps or wrinkles or you will easily make a hole in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;waste&amp;#34; is sometimes easily opened while gripping the device.</li>
            <li>This thing is fantastic for such a great price too!</li>
            <li>However, the effect is better than the old one, so I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Thought I would get a good product with all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>This product is light weight, inexpensive, and has made my beautiful couch and chairs look  like new again.  </li>
            <li>I got this one pretty quickly and it worked great.</li>
            <li>But I have used it mostly on sweaters, not any fine fabric like silk.</li>
            <li>Works fine on most fabrics.  </li>
            <li>The sweater now looks fine and a wardrobe favorite is saved.</li>
            <li>looks almost as good as new!!</li>
            <li>Overall, this is very good.</li>
            <li>you can clean it very easily  and easy to use also...</li>
            <li>but I find it more effective removing from the bottom of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is pretty lightweight and operates on two AA batteries which are not included.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how great this works.</li>
            <li>I did nick one sweater slightly (fortunately it was in an inconspicuous spot, and I was able to darn the hole).</li>
            <li>The best six bucks I ever spent.</li>
            <li>Get yourself a pack of cheap bic razors at the dollar store for better performance and value.</li>
            <li>This is the first sweater shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, and so far it has done a perfect job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product on my cheap t-shirts, my sweaters, my favorite tank tops.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for over a year and it is working great so far.</li>
            <li>But you just have to make sure you shave lightly.</li>
            <li>For the price, it does a great job, and with the clear container</li>
            <li>this thing is great, far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer cut too many corners making this cheap shaver.  </li>
            <li>This is another item that I ordered mostly because it was cheap, I needed it, and I did not want to go to the store.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it on a fleece and a wool sweater and it has worked great.  </li>
            <li>(sound like a Goldilocks story? :-)</li>
            <li>Good and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It does a good fast job.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I bought it for all my sisters-in-law</li>
            <li>It is actually kind of fun to use.</li>
            <li>These Fabric Shavers really work and this one is as good as the others.  </li>
            <li>So, it may get stuck depending on what you&#x27;re going over, though that may be a good reason if it stops it from taking off too much.  </li>
            <li>I read a review of this before I bought it and laughed about how the purchaser had gone around their whole house shaving everything and taking pictures of it.</li>
            <li>It works plenty fast and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s kind of fun to use.  </li>
            <li>It is not as powerful as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>It was actually quick and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The fabric shaver removes fuzz balls very easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li>and it still works great - makes my sweaters look clean and new!</li>
            <li>but I was able to get all the fuzz balls off the pants and they look as good as new.  </li>
            <li>My nursing tank top and baby wearing shirt are almost as good as new.</li>
            <li>I just wish the lint collector tray was a bit more secure and did not slide off so easily...</li>
            <li>Cheap and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Super light, super good...</li>
            <li>Super quick, powerful, easy, and a great price.</li>
            <li>Cool!</li>
            <li>other than that, great item!</li>
            <li>My husbands sweat pants were full of lint balls!</li>
            <li>Other than that, it does its intended purpose, and has made me one happy purchaser!</li>
            <li>However, this one works much better than the original one I had.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the other fabric shavers I have used this is the best one yet.</li>
            <li>With the first use, this product put holes in my husband&#x27;s favorite shirt!</li>
            <li>Fell in love with my first one 6mths ago.. works great, very durable...</li>
            <li>So full of pills!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attest to whether or not it works well on other fabrics, but it worked perfectly for what I bought it for.</li>
            <li>This shaver is best for jackets and other heavier materials.</li>
            <li>The other one was a charcoal block from the Vermont Country Store that someone said did the best job.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for sweaters and any other fuzz ball making clothing.</li>
            <li>Good little shaver that does a great job.</li>
            <li>But other than that, no complaints - works perfectly.</li>
            <li>This shaver is extremely compact, well designed and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Not such a good plan!  </li>

            <li>the batter cover come out too easily as you are shaving.</li>
            <li>The shaver will easily catch the pilling and pull the knit fabric into the blade area and damage the knit to create holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just wish the cover for batteries and the catch for the lint didn&#x27;t slide off so easy when using this.</li>
            <li>&quot; and this is the absolute best so far.  </li>

            <li>Make sure that you clean the unit out once you are done.</li>
            <li>I do have to clean the blades and shavings under the blades more than id like.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy on batteries.</li>
            <li>snagged easily on fabric ....</li>
            <li>It went very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Return is easy.  </li>
            <li>You might want to be sure and clean the head out by blowing into it after each use.  </li>
            <li>Easy emptying too.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>This item was the first to come up and everyone else gave it good reviews and it is true.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this guy for about 7 months and the battery is going strong.</li>
            <li>gets rid of most of the pilling on my clothes, so, so far so good.  </li>
            <li>The blue is a nice touch and the transparent fabric shavings holder helps to give me a good idea of when to toss out the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend to buy this shaver for everyone who wants to prolong the life of their beloved clothes and enjoy using them for a longer period.</li>
            <li>Batteries were still strong when I was done.  </li>
            <li>The best thing to do is to lightly and quickly run this shaver over the clothing and just make multiple passes to get the lint off.</li>
            <li>It was a good price for a decent product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for over a year now, and going strong.  </li>
            <li>but the motor is not that strong</li>
            <li>Still going strong after a year of moderte use</li>
            <li>nice fabric shaver, at very reasonable price</li>
            <li>can buy &amp;#34;lesser brands&amp;#34; in some cases at retail stores, and this shaver keeps the clothing looking as good as the high end name brands.</li>
            <li>These are so handy for sweaters, blankets, etc., and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I used to have one with more surface area, and i think it was more powerful than this one, but this serves my needs just fine.</li>
            <li>I was so very excited about using this, and it worked great for about an hour, but then I noticed it started to snag on my clothes and that the metal screen had actually started to crack.</li>
            <li>They seemed to be very pleased with the results and thought that it worked very well to remove the &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Easy and quick to use-love it!</li>
            <li>It was my own fault for playing with it, but I haven&#x27;t experienced that with other models.</li>
            <li>but it has done a yeoman&#x27;s job so far -- had a lot of catching up to do!  </li>
            <li>one was my last try to get a good one, and finally I this one does work perfectly.</li>
            <li>This cuts down the time drastically and does a perfect job.</li>
            <li>Best $9 I ever spent!!</li>
            <li>I have used this shaver on alot of things and it is as good as new.  </li>
            <li>Makes clothes look as good as new.</li>
            <li>I have always had a Remington Battery Operated Fabric Shaver and this new one is just as good.  </li>
            <li>For being less than 10 dollars it works wonderful.  </li>
            <li>but that was fine because it was doing its job.  </li>
            <li>But with patience, this one is fine.</li>
            <li>then you should be fine.</li>
            <li>Everything was going fine.</li>
            <li>If you need a cheap, easy to use solution, this one does the trick.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>I was initially impressed with this, but after shaving a couple sweaters and half of my winter coat, it just quit working.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it works fine on sweaters, but I&#x27;m not going to risk it.</li>
            <li>Takes the pills off fabrics fine.</li>
            <li>The shaver works fine</li>
            <li>This worked fine, but the part that collected the lint kept sliding off.  </li>
            <li>and youll be fine.</li>
            <li>It works fine and there is no science to it).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy because they no longer make that style with the satin backing, so it&#x27;s pretty much irreplaceable.</li>
            <li>Gets the pills off furniture just fine</li>
            <li>I  have shirts that are perfectly fine except for the pills,  Now they can be removed and still wearable.</li>
            <li>This product works fine and does the job required.  </li>
            <li>Without the cover on, the blade spins just fine.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be just fine.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend&lt;br /&gt;for fine fabrics.</li>
            <li>This sweater shaver works fine removing the pills from wool sweaters.</li>
            <li>Works fine for the price and it won&#x27;t cut holes in your sweaters unless you are mashing it into the fibers, I have not had an issues.</li>
            <li>Just read the instructions before you use it, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>Altogether a great product that does exactly what it should, and does it very well.</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>I got thru one sweater fine (and cleaned the shavings out of the bin)</li>
            <li>Fortunately, even the head can be removed and replaced easily, so cleaning it out wasn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after buying some fleece sweater jackets and an acrylic sweater (fine knit) from Blair.</li>
            <li>This worked fine for a while, but after using it off and on for about a month, the metal screen on the shaver began cracking and made the product unusable.</li>
            <li>It was fine on the clothes, never caught or pulled threads, and got EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li>it worked fine for a day or two then broke.  </li>
            <li>Will probably not buy again but fine in the meantime.</li>
            <li>Shape makes it easy and comfortable to use and hold.</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine for the price.</li>
            <li>Well it worked perfectly fine until the End mettle piece broke its not mettle just crappy plasticky stuff</li>
            <li>Works great, pretty much what you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li>and you are fine.</li>
            <li>: Takes all the pills off of any fabric you could think of, and quickly too!</li>
            <li>your clothes is super satisfying.</li>
            <li>No problems with snags, it didn&#x27;t eat the batteries too quickly like some do, and the pills and puffs were gone!</li>
            <li>do wish it operated a bit more quickly, though.</li>
            <li>Worked super on both!</li>
            <li>My pill shaver arrived quickly with appropriate packaging.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t use it that much, but when we need, we are glad to have it around!</li>
            <li>It effectively removes pills and fuzz from sweaters, socks, rugs, upholstry, etc, making them look much more like new.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean, easy to change batteries.</li>
            <li>It was smooth and precise on the fabric and its shape and size make it easy to hold.</li>
            <li>This works great and is easy to open to dispense lint shavings.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable, very handy for shaving cotton balls, exactly what I had been looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first shaver - and so far so good!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and does exactly what it promises to do.  </li>
            <li>Awesome little product.  </li>
            <li>This little shaver is the best!!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>This little device really impressed me.</li>

            <li>Perfect little handheld de-fuzzer.  </li>
            <li>Very happy itch this little shaver.</li>
            <li>Overall, I very satisfied with it!</li>
            <li>I have a North Face Denali WindPro and this little shaver did an excellent job.  </li>
            <li>This little fabric shaver is the best one I&#x27;ve purchased to date.</li>
            <li>This little shaver works great!</li>
            <li>This little shaver is awesome!</li>
            <li>This little guy is great!</li>
            <li>An excellent little clothes shaver you can take anywhere.</li>
            <li>This little machine works great!</li>
            <li>Still not as good as my old one, but works fine for the price.</li>
            <li>Using it was quite straightforward,  easy to insert batteries</li>
            <li>A good little motor with good cutters.</li>
            <li>This cheap little thing works awesome</li>
            <li>If you look at the two pictures of the before and after on the bedsheet, you will notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li>CHEAP, cheap, cheap.</li>
            <li>While I do not see a huge difference in my sweaters, this shaver must be working because I see remnants inside.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to clean, which is important.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, so</li>
            <li>It is so light weight and the grip is comforting.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean out and the lint shaving go neatly in it compartment.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic in fact</li>
            <li>then i was back to removing lint from my sweaters, still a great product.</li>
            <li>Go lightly.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This was a great lint shaver the only problem once the cover for the blades crakes the shaver stops working</li>
            <li>Great low</li>
            <li>This model fits well in the hand and is light weight.</li>
            <li>The shavings catch compartment is easy to remove and clean.</li>
            <li>so maybe that&#x27;s why price is so cheap.  </li>
            <li>Amazon sent me a replacement free of charge.</li>
            <li>Works great and immediately cleaned up several of my shirts and sweaters.</li>
            <li>The shaver worked great and all the white fuzz balls are gone and the load of socks usable again!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think this would work since it was so cheap, but I thought I&#x27;d try.</li>
            <li>I tried this fabric shaver 3 times using light to no pressure...</li>
            <li>It was great for the cuffs on my chunkier sweaters, but when it came to my yoga pullover, it didn&#x27;t shave quite close enough to notice a difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Feels cheap.  </li>
            <li>Just brush lightly.</li>
            <li>Well worth the longer use you can get out of your favorite clothes.</li>
            <li>is that it is so cheap.</li>
            <li>have all been there and pulled at something we shouldn&#x27;t have (usually light knits, woven linens)</li>
            <li>Works great is is relatively quiet.</li>
            <li>Used it once for a light weight sweater.</li>
            <li>All it needs is a light touch or you could rip your pants</li>
            <li>and I decided to give this a try as it was cheap (5.99$) with free shipping.</li>
            <li>For smaller jobs I think it would be great.</li>
            <li>This thing is cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Another thing that makes this shaver easy to clean is that the cap screws off.</li>
            <li>Looks cheap, works well.</li>
            <li>If it doesnt seem to be picking up lint as it should, you probably just need a fresh pair of batteries :)  </li>
            <li>This seemed to fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>When I got the product it was a downer to see what cheap \\&quot;Made in China\\</li>
            <li>All the pilling is removed and the unit is easy to use and clean</li>
            <li>it worked great - until the grill broke recently.</li>
            <li>I bought this and it seemed to work great but a piece of the head broke off on the 3rd use and it does not work at all.  </li>
            <li>Though the plastics parts feel cheap, but the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li>now with this item i can enjoy it once again.</li>
            <li>Works great, just wish I would of brought a bigger size,</li>
            <li>It works FABULOUSLY</li>
            <li>And, at the job&#x27;s White Elephant party, it was a sought after item, lol.</li>
            <li>and it took me forever to get a pair of my son&#x27;s wool longies looking fuzz free.  </li>
            <li>had gone from smooth to fuzzy knot&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thrift store shopping: I can buy items that have fabric pills on them (that no one else would buy, and that have made it to clearance) and make them look fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still as smooth as glass.</li>
            <li>You can tell this is a cheap product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean out, and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made and broke after 2 days of use.</li>
            <li>But, it looks too cheaply made...</li>
            <li>But this is quieter, smaller, good design - and most importantly - it gets rid of pilling.</li>
            <li>At only $5.99, this was a great buy.</li>
            <li>THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT COVER DOESN&#x27;T FIT WHEN IT&#x27;S GOT BATTERIES</li>
            <li>works fantastic.</li>
            <li>The trick I found is to NOT to apply pressure and just lightly skim the surface of the fabric.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I would say is that it works great.</li>
            <li>Put a piece of bright tape on the clear cap so you&#x27;ll know to take it off and where you&#x27;ve put it.</li>
            <li>This unit is cheap and should be sold at the dollar store.</li>
            <li>I bought this thing a about a year ago and still fabulous</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s definitely worth buying because it will preserve your clothes a lot better</li>
            <li>Is it cheap?</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with my purchse.</li>
            <li>This shaver worked great on my sweaters that had become a big shabby because of pilling and wear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and it does a nice job on my sweaters.  </li>
            <li>but this was so cheap &amp; got the job done.</li>
            <li>This fabric shaver works great for removing stubbly fuzzies that are stuck to the outside of sweaters and hoodies.</li>
            <li>This one is just cheap.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the product works nicely.</li>
            <li>It works well for my light weight sweaters.  </li>
            <li>I had a cheap pillow case that pilled a lot.</li>
            <li>:  Cheap</li>
            <li>just wished it was much more powerful however.</li>
            <li>Felt cheap</li>
            <li>I use it for shaving the stuff on cheap bed sheets that build up around our house.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important that you recognize that before deciding to purchase this.  </li>
            <li>For what does it profit a man to gain a whole quarter and lose his own shaver?</li>
            <li>This does  a fantastic job of depilling sweaters and coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use it and ended up getting a different one at the drugstore for $4 that works great.</li>
            <li>For a cheap \\&quot;gadget\\&quot;, it works quite well.</li>
            <li>It works very well, and it&#x27;s kind of relaxing to use.</li>
            <li>It could literally fit in the palm of our hand.</li>
            <li>For looking and feeling cheap it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to clean out; just snap it off and dump the shaved fabric then snap it on again.</li>
            <li>Haved used it on several items and it works great.</li>
            <li>Dose his job perfectly, comfortable to handle</li>
            <li>Does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made and performs sub-par</li>
            <li>I am happy with my purchase, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>cheap.  </li>
            <li>In any event I heard a crunch sound.  </li>
            <li>Cheap.  </li>
            <li>Cheap an well built.</li>
            <li>This shaver removes them and returns them to the smooth texture they should be.</li>
            <li>If you need to go over an area just keep going over lightly.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I purchased two more for my sisters.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it was so cheap because I feel like I almost got my money&#x27;s worth out of it regardless, but I&#x27;ll be replacing it with something else.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>I love it so much, I bought three more for gifts.</li>
            <li>I had a beloved 20+ year old knitted hat that now looks close to the day I received it.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>In the old days, the screen was made from a fairly sturdy piece of metal.  </li>
            <li>While using this product, the resevoir should be emptied frequently for optimum performance.</li>
            <li>A must own if you own different items of fleece.</li>
            <li>This is a great thing to have, has extended the life of many otherwise perfect clothes except those annoying fluff balls that appear on wool and linens, perfect!</li>
            <li>Nice and small, making it easily portable, but it does a great job getting all the fuzz off.</li>
            <li>TIP: make sure to hold the clothing taught while shaving (everyone is right about this aspect as well).</li>
            <li>Extremely noticable because it&#x27;s a very bright neon pink-orangey color.</li>
            <li>Very powerful.</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, it is very powerful, don&#x27;t use on lighter fabrics.</li>
            <li>This iten works prety well, very powerful for its size, but the battery cap keeps getting unattached while using it.</li>
            <li>This shaver does a very nice job in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>Anyway it is very powerful and had no problems.</li>
            <li>It is very useful for cotten ball things in shoes.</li>
            <li>Seems very powerful for its size.  </li>
            <li>Very useful device</li>
            <li>VERY POWERFUL.</li>
            <li>It was my own fault that I put a hole in a favorite sweater the first time I used this tool, because I didn&#x27;t read the directions or the reviews about using it GENTLY.</li>
            <li>Not as loud as most and works pretty good.</li>
            <li>It just makes everything look so nice and new all over again!</li>
            <li>While I wouldn&#x27;t say this sweater shaver was amazing, it&#x27;s decent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pleased, as these pants were the primary reason I bought this</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.</li>
            <li>The collector catches all the shaved lent, super easy to empy.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use and helpful when you need it.</li>
            <li>But the battery lid fell off easily and I quickly lost it.</li>
            <li>It works very well, is easy to empty, and the best value you can find in these things.</li>
            <li>BUT - the cover to the compartment that collects the debris comes off super easily</li>
            <li>my favorite sweater looks brand new!!!</li>
            <li>This is the best little gadget I&#x27;ve bought in YEARS!</li>
            <li>Best little shaver I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Awesome little gadget to have!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest: I wasn&#x27;t sure how effective a cheap little fabric shaver would be.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite household tool/appliance!  </li>
            <li>,i don&#x27;t know if it produces more heat than they can stand or what ,i tried this with many batteries,sometimes they leaked or the new ones</li>
            <li>A good thing to have to keep clothes looking fresh and new.</li>
            <li>This shaver gives new life to my oldest and most favorite sweaters, some of which I was embarrassed to wear because they were so ratty looking.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to clean out and to use.</li>
            <li>Efficient, super easy to clean, straightforward design...</li>
            <li>PURCHASED THIS REMINGTON BATTERY OPERATED FABRIC SHAVER HERE ON AMAZON AFTER MY VERY OLD ONE BROKE AFTER MANY, MANY YEARS OF USAGE.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tiny and works amazingly well!</li>
            <li>i was really excited to use this shaver.</li>
            <li>Really powerful!</li>
            <li>This is my first fuzz buster - I love it.  </li>
            <li>At first I could not get the head cleared of lint and then realized the top just unscrews.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long it lasts but it did a great job on a lace blouse</li>
            <li>Most others are non-battery powered combs and I thought that would be pretty nifty to keep around until I saw this one.  </li>
            <li>The fabric shaver was exactly what i needed and was cheap!</li>
            <li>This is a great product, used it on several of my wife&#x27;s delicate sweaters...and it did awesome!</li>
            <li>Worth the six bucks!</li>
            <li>too small, need a shaver for the wonderful pills that pop up on some of our clothing, this is not the one that will remove them</li>
            <li>User friendly and shows results immediately.</li>
            <li>First, I must say I have been nothing but pleased with my Amazon purchases.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already burnt out the batteries, but it has been worth it!  </li>
            <li>It is soooo useful!</li>
            <li>I had so much fun! ..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s does the job and its pretty ok price.  </li>
            <li>This is great for getting minor pilling off clothing or furniture.</li>
            <li>Worth every stinking penny!</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>One thing I did notice is that more pills are removed with more force on the item because I kept on going over the same sections with no avail and realized I had to be more aggressive with it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny in my book!</li>
            <li>first used it on my favorite Nike sport polyester coat that has been fuzzing up because I where it so often</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>fun shaving!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fast and very effective, though you do have to be careful on fabrics with looser weaves or &#x27;stringier&#x27; knits where fibers are more easily pulled in and cut.  </li>
            <li>This little guy sure does a great job.</li>
            <li>Works good , has gotten a little warm , but have been using it for doing a cloak .</li>
            <li>took my time and used this handy dandy pill eater and my socks are like brand new.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d loving  my brand new  </li>
            <li>After reading all of the positive reviews, I decided on this shaver against all the other shavers because it was purported to be the best for its money.  </li>
            <li>Its tiny but offers great value!</li>
            <li>just remember to clean out the lint after you go over a sweater before you start another one.  </li>
            <li>If the blades stop rotating, screw off the cover and use a pair of tweezers to clean out the inside.  </li>
            <li>, just clean it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had an old Remington lint shaver that lasted for about 20 years and worked flawlessly until it finally died.  </li>
            <li>But, the main thing I love about it is that it&#x27;s so easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This shaver works great on regular to heavyweight material, but is way TOO POWERFUL on lightweight stuff.  </li>
            <li>you clean off the heads; after each job.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>It quickly and smoothly takes the pilling off without snagging or damaging the knit.  </li>
            <li>The head also unscrews, the blade comes out, and you can clean the build-up on the inside of the head.</li>
            <li>My 7 y.o. kid used it to clean up some of our sweaters.  </li>
            <li>This was a GREAT purchase, well worth the money, I would have paid double.</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of the best that I have used so far.  </li>
            <li>I needed to clean up some sweaters</li>
            <li>super cheap.</li>
            <li>Every house needs to clean the bumps on items that get those beads..</li>
            <li>Shaved them quickly and smoothly .</li>
            <li>I bought this to clean up the edges of sweater sleeves, waistbands and any area that is fuzzy or pilling.  </li>
            <li>We bought this to clean up burrs on our La-Z-Boy pillows.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver because of the many positive reviews, and of course because of the price.  </li>
            <li>it made my old pilled sweater look much better!</li>
            <li>Powerful really does the job used on linen bar chairs that had pills all over really cleaned up nicely!  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and easy to clean and very affordable.</li>
            <li>I had my shirt full of pills and now its totally clean.</li>
            <li>They come out pretty easily and the first time I just unscrewed the top and shook it in the trash can.  </li>
            <li>It stops working every time it encounters a large pill, pulls fabric, and requires many passes to show any improvement.</li>
            <li>It works ok on certain fabrics but not all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as large as it looks in the picture which I was glad about.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly use it, but wish it were a bit more efficient.</li>
            <li>As other-nothing special, peeling sweater took me .I</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>The Remington got everything off right away, with no issues!</li>
            <li>all right off!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to be right!</li>
            <li>I think the size of the holes in this shaver are just right!  </li>
            <li>It does a nice job, just use it carefully -- very light pressure and don&#x27;t stay too long in one spot.</li>
            <li>My husband finally has a crisp and clean looking coat because of this great tool.  </li>
            <li>I like being able to spruce up older sweaters and sweat shirts!</li>
            <li>Wish it was a little more powerful but for price it works great.</li>
            <li>It really made a huge difference on the pillow I wanted to shave!</li>
            <li>this item is great, I love that its small and can travel with it, but it is noisy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing compared to the old shavers.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as expected, but it helps so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>but when we do, especially on bigger jobs like bedsheets, it can be used for a good 15-20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but when we do, especially on bigger jobs like bedsheets, it can be used for a good 15-20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>My leggings feel as good as they did when I initially bought them.</li>
            <li>The seats and the arm rests were full of them.  </li>
            <li>In the end it removed absolutely nothing and probably did more damage to my items.</li>
            <li>and they were full of lint balls from waist to pants leg.</li>
            <li>used it on some sweaters that were full of those ball thingies.</li>
            <li>Later the superior blades broke while i was using it&amp;it never worked the same again,so it&#x27;s good to buy a spare part  </li>
            <li>But, overall, it does a good job.</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced and works way better than a comb that I had bought before.</li>
            <li>one\\&quot; and that works really well, better than anything I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>my husband did laundry in which one of his favorite fleece coats endend up being washed with something that made it come out looking very fuzzy.</li>
            <li>you should also keep emptying the lint as you go, I think that&#x27;s a good idea to help it last longer.  </li>
            <li>overall its a good product that work.</li>
            <li>&amp; I did return it &amp; got my full refund.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, a terrific product that&#x27;s surprisingly durable and dependable.</li>
            <li>So overall a good buy for the price and does the job.</li>
            <li>Shaving quality is good and one pair of Duracell Alkaline batteries last for four months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased to say that this producye worked very well.  </li>
            <li>I love this item, works very well on all my sweats, shorts and shirts.</li>
            <li>I wanted the full size version.</li>
            <li>I guess just keep your expectations reasonable, it will HELP, not SAVE, your clothes :)</li>
            <li>So, you would know if it is already full.</li>
            <li>Would be sweet if it would come with batteries.</li>
            <li>Otherwise this tool is so cool.</li>
            <li>but I also make sure to hold the areas very taut while working so as to avoid making holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works really well except the lint keeps getting stuck in the top portion because there appears to be a sort of bottleneck going into the lint resovoir.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used others that work a whole lot better.</li>
            <li>This is so cool.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true...</li>
            <li>being said, it worked great on a set of linen that was starting to &#x27;pimple&#x27;, and an old favorite skirt i pulled out of storage.</li>
            <li>Kinda shoddy construction, but functions perfectly for now.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a good value overall.</li>
            <li>I like that you can see when the unit is getting full.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already used it on sweaters that were so full of &#x27;pills&#x27; that I couldn&#x27;t wear them anymore.</li>
            <li>Handy portable device for small jobs....especially good for travel.  </li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s not bad...</li>
            <li>I first tried it on an old sweater that I loved, but was too embarrassed to wear.</li>
            <li>But it was very easy to use and made my sweater look like new again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s essential if you love sweaters - easily take those pills off!</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, but using it on my sofa, it didn&#x27;t really shave off most of the pilling, so I&#x27;ll have to find something stronger?</li>
            <li>This was an impulse buy--I was searching for ways to de-pill clothing and found this link and bought it right away because of the cheap price.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The canister part that is on the shaver does crack pretty easily though</li>
            <li>The item is so easy to use and did exactly what it said.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to do and very quickly.</li>
            <li>seemed too large to fit in the foil&#x27;s holes, and I think the blades struggled to cut through the heftier fibres, plus it occassionally got clogged on the wool - so I am still not sure on the best thing for wool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Two things you should be aware of - it eats batteries quickly, and the collector cup sometimes comes off too easily (like while you&#x27;re using it).  </li>
            <li>I think it would work great on smaller pieces of clothing, but we bought this for our comforter which was WAY too large for this thing.  </li>
            <li>Great tool for removing &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; on sweaters and other knit and/or wool clothing.  </li>
            <li>I primarily decided on the Remington because of price and the overall pretty good reviews.  </li>
            <li>Works great, but due to the design of it, the pills that it has shaved off get stuck under the rotating blade instead of dropping into the pill catcher.</li>
            <li>In my experience it works great for removing pills/balls from sweaters, hats, gloves, &amp; other knits.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work that great on any other sweaters or tops</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase and cannot wait to use it to make my other clothes look like new.</li>
            <li>My favorite sweater feels brand new!  </li>
            <li>Gets all the fuzzies off and makes my clothes look new again! :)</li>
            <li>I love that my sweaters and hats look like new!</li>
            <li>THEY BECAME LIKE NEW! :)</li>
            <li>Yay for not having to buy too many new maternity clothes!</li>
            <li>I love my new fabric shaver!</li>
            <li>One downside to my love of vintage sweaters is pilling, but this fabric shaver makes them look new again!  </li>
            <li>But sure enough, with this shaver and about 5-10 minutes on each sweater, they&#x27;re almost as good as new.</li>
            <li>It does take time to clean up garments, but it is well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>They work fine and really spiffy-ed up my wardrobe and some of my furniture also!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Just wish the head was a bit bigger so you could cover more clothing in less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: Superb.</li>
            <li>I was happy to try it out and was hoping that it would match a previous experience with an earlier version of this model which I loved.</li>
            <li>Since the top was trashed at this point, I continued so as to get practice for the next top.</li>
            <li>Overall a wonderful product would consider buying again if necessary .</li>
            <li>Luckily I stumbled across this</li>
            <li>It works well, but breaks rather quickly.</li>
            <li>purchase if you feel lucky - to be the one who gets the unit that is manufactured</li>
            <li>Love it and apparently it&#x27;s fun to use because my daughter wants to do everything.</li>
            <li>Just wish it had a cord since it goes through batteries quickly.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t damage the material at all and worked quickly.</li>
            <li>And with having kids fleece blankets always just getting thrown in a load of laundry quick</li>
            <li>This product is awesome and returns your clothes back to their former glory.</li>
            <li>The only device which I have that does better costs about 10 times more, and is not portable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and thorough.    </li>
            <li>throw it in your night stand and it will always be there for a quick cleanup before you put that sweater on</li>
            <li>Received quickly.</li>
            <li>The lint accumulates quickly and needs to be emptied often so as not to get clogged up.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and efficient.  </li>
            <li>KILL THE BATTERIES TOO QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>WILL TRY TO SUPER GLUE</li>
            <li>Seems to go through batteries quickly though.</li>
            <li>Super easy to clean, but don&#x27;t shake it about too much as the fuzz/debris that collects in the collection compartment does &amp;#34;dust out&amp;#34; a bit.</li>
            <li>Quick shipper.  </li>
            <li>It works great and fast, but watch out not too shave too close or you&#x27;ll make tiny holes in your clothes.</li>
            <li>I try it turns off just as quick as it turned on.  </li>
            <li>If I buy another one, I will likely try a more robust model with heftier blades that are able to cut through the thicker fabrics.</li>
            <li>but I did not expect for it to die so quickly.</li>
            <li>I honestly had low expectations since it was so cheap, but when it came in the mail</li>
            <li>It moves easily around the fabric and does a great job clearing those little fuzz balls!</li>
            <li>This little device is powerful - easy to use and very effective.  </li>
            <li>I needed a sweater shaver and read all the reviews on Amazon for the most highly rated products.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to someone or my friends if they have favorite coats that suffer from these fabric balls after wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all, I love this fabric shaver, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it. :)</li>
            <li>My old bed was full of pills and though it did take some time to clean it out, the result was fabulous!</li>
            <li>This Remington does pick up pills, gets a very smooth shave, &amp; makes items look new.</li>
            <li>I have a little plastic defuzzer that I got free from the Gap that is most effective.</li>
            <li>By far the best 8 bucks I have spent!.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have had is cleaning out the fuzz in the very top of the shaver, it doesn&#x27;t just come out when you shake it.</li>
            <li>and I just would like to say I am VERY pleased with this product especially for its price.</li>
            <li>but it was pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad that I bought it and think I&#x27;ll just avoid fleece clothing in the future.</li>
            <li>This product broke the very first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Make sure your item is laid out on a flat surface, otherwise you will surely create a hole somewhere.</li>
            <li>It did a fantastic job without taking too much time!</li>
            <li>I have read a few reviews with similar issues, but seeing the great amount of good reviews you could think they were just one of those unlucky purchases.</li>
            <li>This did the exact job I bought it for, regardless of the fact that it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li>Much beloved sweaters that had long ago been banished to the wear-at-home-only category because of</li>
            <li>The unit keeps battery power well and is a good solution for minor pilling on knitwear.  </li>
            <li>I have looked for a long time for a good one.</li>
            <li>However, with this shaver, it was extremely easy to clean them up and make them look brand new!</li>
            <li>It works quickly and safely to restore things to their new condition.</li>
            <li>In a matter of minutes you can easily remove the &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; from you garment and have it looking like new!!</li>
            <li>For my purposes, I would like the shaver a little bigger and more powerful, but it does the job and is perfect for clothing.</li>
            <li>More significantly, this product has literally made many of my old jumpers and sweaters that I was about to throw away look almost brand new.</li>
            <li>It is quite fast and it was super easy to operate.</li>
            <li>but I find the cover where the lint stores comes off too easily and doesn&#x27;t do quite as good a job as the previous one I had</li>
            <li>This is a great size, comfortable to hold, large holding area for those little fuzz balls we all love so much.  </li>
            <li>I decided to limit my losses... why not try the cheap one with reviews as good or better as the more expensive models?  </li>
            <li>I love everything about this new one, including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it, it makes my clothes look new.</li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite new household gadget.</li>
            <li>The sweater is by no means brand new looking but better than it was.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have been happier paying twice the price for a quality product than have to live with this cheap junk!</li>
            <li>, this will make it look new again :)</li>
            <li>My new FAVORITE tool to help me with my ebay sales.</li>
            <li>I bought new batteries just to make sure.</li>
            <li>I am glad to have this on hand for when I need it but it will not restore something to brand new.</li>
            <li>Surprising for the cheap price, it just zipped all those little fuzz balls right off!</li>
            <li>This shaver does a good job in most cases when it&#x27;s a small job.</li>
            <li>It is fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I know about this awesome small device thanks to my co worker.</li>
            <li>AND for the price, if this ones lasts a fourth as long, it is a great purchase!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s extremely easy to operate; you just gently rub it over your fabrics.</li>
            <li>Works well and is very compact for easy storage.  </li>
            <li>I did not know such things exist and was very happy to stumble upon this solution.</li>
            <li>with modern clothing and sweaters pilling more often than higher quality clothing from days of yore...</li>
            <li>This product is reasonably priced and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>My first impression was the power of this little toy, after I placed two AA 1900mAh freshly charged ENELOOP batteries the shaver showed incredible performance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Gave me a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; sweater on its first use!</li>
            <li>My favorite sweater defuzzer by far !</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I needed to remove pilling from sweaters!  </li>
            <li>This product worked so well for exactly what it is supposed to do!</li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>I have been successful using it with other items after the incident.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Has lots of power and took away all of the balls that appeared on my sweater after I washed it the first time!  </li>
            <li>So when wanted to buy another one for a gift this was the logical buy!.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever done a product review!  </li>
            <li>This has been such a help to me, I love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The clothes don&#x27;t look brand new, but they do look a heck of a lot better, which makes this fabric shaver worth it.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well but doesn&#x27;t take off a lot of pills that aren&#x27;t the right size/height/shape to fit through its grill.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect this machine to be so easy and useful.</li>
            <li>This liitle machine works great for med-large cable knit sweaters to tight weave items like sweats and turtlenecks.</li>
            <li>It does rip some lighter fabrics if you don&#x27;t pull it as tight as you can, but it was also great at removing pilling.</li>
            <li>Certainly takes some of the age off some older garments!!!!</li>
            <li>The Remington Battery Operated Fabric Shaver performs adequately on most appropriate fabrics, but doesn&#x27;t clean the surface lint as closely or as quickly as other shavers I have used.  </li>
            <li>But so far it has been working fine!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very simple design and you can take it apart to clean very easily</li>
            <li>I used my new fabric shaver on few sweaters and the coat - works great, no holes :-)</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone who hates fuzzballs and wants to remove them easily and effectively.  </li>
            <li>Fine knit sweaters, it doesn&#x27;t really work at all.</li>
            <li>simple, easy to use, easy to clean out</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the little thing in life that make you happy.</li>
            <li>Great little machine.</li>
            <li>This little thing is great.  </li>
            <li>I did accidentally put a hole in one of my shirts though, (going a little o.c.d with the thing) lol.</li>
            <li>Great little product.  </li>
            <li>Great little shaver.</li>
            <li>Great product, as advertised, used it for little fabric balls on cloth chairs.</li>
            <li>This little shaver works great to remove fuzz and pills.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little fabric shaver, I&#x27;ve had mine now for over a year</li>
            <li>Great little Christmas stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li>I bought this to shave the little fuzzy pills off my sweaters, and it works great without any damage to the sweaters.  </li>
            <li>the little bugger does what it was intended to, no complaints and for a great price.</li>
            <li>This little gadget has been a great help with my wardrobe.</li>
            <li>Otherwise a great little fabric shaver.</li>
            <li>It is a great little shaver.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it as a good buy, but probably not for large jobs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful little detail that can help prevent many times when you&#x27;d have to bend down to clean up</li>
            <li>I had some nice sweaters and even a Patagonia &#x27;better sweater&#x27; that were saved by this little fabric shaver.</li>
            <li>It I faster and more effective to pick off each little pill off your sweater one by one.</li>
            <li>I received this handy little device for Christmas this year, and what a fantastic tool!  </li>
            <li>cheap little shaver works good.</li>
            <li>So yeah, it&#x27;s a little cheap, but it works really good for the price.  </li>
            <li>Nice little compact and easy to clean design.</li>
            <li>Because it was so cheap, I&#x27;m not terribly upset, but I would expect a little more than about a month of use.</li>
            <li>This is just nice to have, easy to empty and use!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i ordered this product worth saving all your old sweaters that need a little tlc with this great product.</li>
            <li>It works great and has restored a few sweaters and towels in my home.</li>
            <li>Downside is I have to keep emptying it every few minutes since it works so great.</li>
            <li>This did great with my heavy wool coat.  </li>
            <li>Given the price, this is fantastic and works very well.</li>
            <li>I have a great pair of skinny dress pants I&#x27;ve had for quite a few years and just can&#x27;t part with them.</li>
            <li>I wear gloves everyday and this is great for getting rid of fuzzies that accumulate on them.</li>
            <li>delicates, far definitely better than the manual lint remover I have.  </li>
            <li>Very solid build, nice design</li>
            <li>I have these microfiber leggings I adore and wear constantly throughout the winter to stay warm.</li>
            <li>This shaver was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Glad I can ship this back for free though.</li>
            <li>Fun.  </li>
            <li>This is one of product worth your money.</li>
            <li>was definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>This product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this item is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>so it was worth the price.</li>
            <li>Certainly worth the money.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth having as part of your acceessories to keep your clothes looking well maintained.</li>
            <li>I got two and my 92 yr old neighbor and I both love it.</li>
            <li>Pretty good but hope the batteries can work for a long time.</li>
            <li>As you can get most of these items on eBay free shipping with the same price and you don&#x27;t need to me</li>
            <li>This thing isn&#x27;t powerful at all - it works for about two seconds and then dies.</li>
            <li>but it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Powerful</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money buy it........</li>
            <li>After a weeks worth of uses it broke on me, not the shaver itself but the cap.</li>
            <li>Works well enough we bought another for a friend who liked ours.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as I was hoping.</li>
            <li>Def worth the money.</li>
            <li>Who knew a grown man could have so much fun shaving off the lint balls off of sweaters.  </li>
            <li>How ever the price is really worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>My stepmother had one when I was a kid, and I always thought it was a lot of fun to shave my clothes... or the sheets... or even pillows.</li>
            <li>and I finally have my own fabric shaver.</li>
            <li>Only used it once so far, but worked great.</li>
            <li>Quieter, faster and more complete.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t work as good as I expected it to</li>
            <li>I used it on my son&#x27;s Mickey blanket (the kind with the plush Mickey Mouse and satin back) and</li>
            <li>Still, i got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>For the price, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I deducted 2 stars for the tearing and noise, but gave it 3 out of the fact it can still be useful and is easier cleanup than a roller.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It also gives life to that old favorite sweater.</li>
            <li>I tried every scenario to achieve success.  </li>
            <li>Def well worth the price for this product</li>
            <li>Powerful and portable.</li>
            <li>For example an old sweater that&#x27;s seen better days.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>But then my favorite shirt is quite old, so it was probably quite worn out already.</li>
            <li>I paid about $8 for it and that&#x27;s about what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Useful product,</li>
            <li>Reasonably powerful</li>
            <li>It was better overall fit than this one.</li>
            <li>you know, like the kind I mentioned above that no one else would buy.</li>
            <li>It takes quite some time to completely shave a top.</li>
            <li>For the price I paid, though, this is hardly worth complaining about.  </li>
            <li>Worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I was more than surprised by the quality of this item.</li>
            <li>it was worth the price just to save that one sweater</li>
            <li>It works well and was worth the money.</li>
            <li>Changed batteries, and product was no longer useful.</li>
            <li>I remember when they were popular YEARS ago and a couch I recently purchased started getting the fuzz balls on it.  </li>
            <li>For the money it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>it might be useful but not for what i bought it for.</li>
            <li>Does the job that it was made for so the purchase was worth it.</li>
            <li>I like how it comes with a cover for the top of the shaver and how the area where the lint collects is clear.</li>
            <li>the money you save by getting this one will not be worth it with the amount of clothes you will ruin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shopping on Amazon (a lot) since the early  90s and this may be my favorite purchase.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Nice if it were bigger.</li>
            <li>If you have the patience and rechargeable batteries defiantly worth it.</li>
            <li>Powerful and compact.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It shouldn&#x27;t be used on thin fabrics, or it will be sucked up, but I am so impressed with how well this works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite fun also.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It works only on curtain kind of sweater.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>product was definitely worth the money (and then some).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit noisy like an electric razor but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Its worth what you pay for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the 9 bucks I paid for it</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>This is a powerful lil&#x27; gadget and works as described.  </li>
            <li>but I really liked the pillow case so this was my last resort.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>This just requires cleaning out more frequently than I would like, which leads me to #2...</li>
            <li>Be sure not to press it directly into the fabric.</li>
            <li>My old one (which was more of a square shape) never had this problem.</li>
            <li>should&#x27;ve spent a lil more to buy a better shaver ..</li>
            <li>Easy to clean by opening the clear holding bin on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Need to use it on my work shorts but also comes in handy after washing hoodies and such.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>so you have to work at it, but worth the price.</li>
            <li>Works better than my old one did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it with much success on my son&#x27;s fleeces.</li>
            <li>Success again.</li>
            <li>For the price, it was worth it to me to save a king-sized quilt from the garbage.</li>
            <li>Clear case shows how full it is, and is easily removed and replaced to empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use and small container holds a fair amount.</li>
            <li>Some user tips I&#x27;d offer: frequent cleanings are necessary to keep it running efficiently, be sure to unscrew the screen and clean blades (don&#x27;t cut yourself), don&#x27;t press the shaver to the garment-hover over it, and enjoy!</li>
            <li>I bought this after trying many other cheap ones, and for the  price, it works great and much better than my other old ones.</li>
            <li>but i use them to keep my black hoodies looking amazing!</li>
            <li>Other than that, I absolutely love it and am so glad I decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li>I.ve used other brands and they worked much better, guess i have keep looking for a better one</li>
            <li>I have used fabric shavers for a number of years now and find them indispensable for knitwear, especially wool sweaters that tend to pill easily and quickly.</li>
            <li>Uses up batteries pretty quick.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a powerful and effective tool to get rid of pilling, but that also means that if the fabric is not on a flat surface, or if it is crumpled, it can make a hole in your shirt.</li>
            <li>This shaver arrived quickly and worked very well!</li>
            <li>It works quickly with out clogging and makes the surfaces look smooth and new again.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you clean it out regularly.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the other fabric shaver I had.  </li>
            <li>I saw the other good reviews for this product</li>
            <li>Not as good a deviceas the other gadget I have used.  </li>
            <li>will other lint remover there is a good chance I will need them.  </li>
            <li>Other than that its a good shaver.</li>
            <li>JUST RIGHT</li>
            <li>she was right</li>
            <li>I just received this and started using it right away.</li>
            <li>I tested it on a rag before I used it on my blanket and it tore right through the material.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>It works, cleans the pills right up.</li>
            <li>Others who purchased this item got it right.</li>
            <li>This takes them right off.</li>
            <li>but I had worn it out right through the metal screen.</li>
            <li>Sucked the material right into it and made a hole</li>
            <li>The power on this shaver is just right.</li>
            <li>I was right.</li>
            <li>the price is right and it works well for what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li>those pills right off.</li>
            <li>and yeah it cleared the lint right up</li>
            <li>So...what size hole in front of the blade is &#x27;just right&#x27;?  </li>
            <li>Dirt cheap, works like a charm, keeps clothes and furniture looking brand new!</li>
            <li>When I used the Remington Fabric Shaver on the fabric pills, they fell off easily into the shaver and my sofa looked new, again.  </li>
            <li>It easily removed every pill and my jacket looks like new again.</li>
            <li>But overall this is an amazing instrument, and I still can&#x27;t believe how reasonably it&#x27;s priced!  </li>
            <li>First, make sure you take off the clear cap on the shaver before using.</li>
            <li>Best $4.99 I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t damage the clothing and really does clean up all of the &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>pretty good quality not much of noise..</li>
            <li>What a great little shaver this is!</li>
            <li>This is a great little fabric shaver!</li>
            <li>This is a great little shaver!</li>
            <li>Totally does the job, very easily getting rid of &amp;#34;pilling.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This little gadget is amazing!  </li>
            <li>This little shaver has successfully shaved my sweaters, shirts, sweats, even my bras without damaging them.  </li>
            <li>Old sweaters become new again with this handy product.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do so well on very large woven knit sweaters aand it picked a lot on those.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a very powerful shaver with a decent amount of suction.</li>
            <li>it fits comfortably in your  hand  easy to move around....and does make a big difference in the look of your garments.</li>
            <li>The shaver is simple and easy to use, is light, and works well.</li>
            <li>Depending on the type of fabric you are de-fuzzing, it can back up quickly and clog the blades at the top.</li>
            <li>It clogs up with wool fibers quickly though, but you can unscrew the top (the blue ring) and remove the perforated metal shield, and pick the wool balls with tweezers.</li>
            <li>I feel like an accomplished housekeeper maintaining my possessions with this easy to use and very portable product.</li>
            <li>Luckily it was at the bottom of a summer dress I mostly wear outside.  </li>
            <li>Put in brand new batteries &amp; it was working fine.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I cannot imagine how any of the more expensive ones could be any better.</li>
            <li>This product worked exactly as advertised and was worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>It looks dinky, but it is powerful and performs exactly the way it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>It completely reconditioned my favorite Columbia Sportswear &amp; Adidas fleece jackets and looking forward to wearing them again more regularly.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll be great for small projects tho.</li>
            <li>It works great on lighter materials like sweaters, but do not buy if you are hoping to remove fuzz, etc from a heavy coat!</li>
            <li>Small but works great.</li>
            <li>The motor has a soft buzzing sound, not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I figured I got a nice long life out of it before it needed replacing, so I went ahead and got another.</li>
            <li>Again, two minor things that haven&#x27;t stopped me from loving this thing.</li>
            <li>This fabric shaver does an adequate job and is certainly easier than picking fuzz by hand.  </li>
            <li>I have searched a long time, tried MANY products and lost many sweaters and other items because of the lintball al over..&lt;br /&gt;  This little unit works GREAT!!!</li>
            <li>It works good, just to small and have to continuously clean.</li>
            <li>Very impressed at how well this little device removed pills from several of my wool sweaters.  </li>
            <li>really sure why, as i made certain to clean it out well before next project.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good power and very good at removing those annoying balls of lint from my daughter&#x27;s dance tights.  </li>
            <li>Other reviewers commented on the catch tray and battery covers coming off more easily than desirable</li>
            <li>The Amazon reviews were a huge help in choosing a new one.</li>

            <li>is smooth and looks almost brand new now.  </li>
            <li>When I pulled out my shaver on the pants, I cleaned them up in no time, they were as smooth as a silk, and they looked just as new as the name brand hoodie.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic and makes sweaters look like new.  </li>
            <li>I took about a half dozen sweaters that I loved, but were filled with pills and returned them to new.  </li>
            <li>It works great on both my light, thin cotton sweaters as well as the chunky knit wool sweaters.</li>
            <li>But for those few minutes it was actually working, it worked great!    </li>
            <li>However, in these,the \\&quot;motor\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t seen to be as strong as my old one, but it still works well</li>
            <li>Just wish it were bigger and a bit more powerful.</li>
            <li>It works great  when i first got it  seem so small.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, this is a perfectly good product that will bring your old clothes back to life.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect this shaver to last more than the season, but it will have proved its worth well.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find the same one I used to own, at a Reasonable price, so I got this one.</li>
            <li>The clear lint trap where the shavings go comes off so easily.</li>
            <li>the bally stuff from the material accumulates quickly inside the chambers ,so you can see its shaving very well...</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, item is described accurately, and it is very efficient and durable.</li>
            <li>I previously had a cheaper product that I loved but it began to rust</li>
            <li>I had so many old sweaters that I just wasn&#x27;t ready to give up yet</li>
            <li>It works great but one of the blades popped off while I was clearing the fuzz out and would not go back in properly.</li>
            <li>The shaver is very gentle on my most delicate fabrics while being incredibly effective at removing lint and pills.  </li>
            <li>I love this item and is small and easy to use!</li>
            <li>$6 is very worth the new life you will give your clothes.  </li>
            <li>You can certainly get bigger and better fabric shavers but for light duty and inexpensive this really gets it done.</li>
            <li>I expected it to work more than 2 times!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that the tiny inexpensive motor like the one in this model has limitations, and it&#x27;s wise to only use it for say, 20 min at a time.  </li>
            <li>The price was right and it&#x27;s a MUST have to get extra years off of your favorite pieces.</li>
            <li>Nice, small, easy to use.</li>
            <li>;)&lt;br /&gt;It collects everything inside the clear chamber and is easy to dump into the trash.</li>
            <li>The reservoir fills relatively quickly and has to be emptied regularly, pretty much once</li>
            <li>It works very, very well.</li>
            <li>YOU ARE VERY GENTLE AND DONT PUT ALOT OF PRESSURE ON THE SHAVER.</li>
            <li>We would have been more happy with a larger more expensive version of this.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much, what a sweater saver.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle to the fabric as well.</li>
            <li>I found this on Amazon and it was very reasonably priced</li>
            <li>so it probably isn&#x27;t getting the kind of use that would wear the head down quickly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended and the price is RIGHT, Bob!</li>
            <li>This shaver does a pretty good job but the part that holds the shavings tends to slip out of place and make a mess.</li>
            <li>This equipment becomes magical when I used the first time did not believe the results, made a short 5 years of use in looking for a new, fantastic.</li>
            <li>They will build up with fuzzballs over time and we have used this shaver on multiple occasions to do a perfect job of removing every single fuzzball so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made so many of my old clothes look new again!</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous about how the shaver would work on synthetic fabric, but my jacket looks good as new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is a good little machine.</li>
            <li>It does a good job at getting rid of the little fabric balls or pills or lint....</li>
            <li>Good little product.</li>
            <li>I really loved this little guy while it was still working, but I&#x27;ve had it three months</li>
            <li>OMG This little item works so good.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy to buy this item as it turned my old sweaters into new ones but soon after a week or so wool got clogged in the blades after very small amount of wool,however,u can clean it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and easy to empty.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to empty.</li>
            <li>I had a lot of pills so it did require multiple cleaning of the device as it got full, but that&#x27;s just fine.  </li>
            <li>Take the shaver for a quick spin over the clothing (like the pants mentioned above) and they can easily be sold on ebay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sometimes gathers balls of wool in the blade chamber but the blades are easy to remove so this is only a mild nuisance.</li>
            <li>My only problem with the product is that the cap covering the shreddings slips off very easily and doesn&#x27;t hold much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy about this product, don&#x27;t press to hard</li>
            <li>it works great some hardly any difference.</li>
            <li>I have been impressed by how much stuff this little shaver can actually pick up.  </li>
            <li>Really works great, brings new life to things that looked worn out due to pilling.</li>
            <li>After I was done, my sweater looked new and clean.</li>
            <li>This product is so simple but makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li>The shaver is pretty lightweight and operates on two AA batteries which are not included.</li>
            <li>Bought this for a friends &amp; it was exactly what she wanted &amp; needed.  </li>
            <li>Gets rid of those rough places in fabric and makes the item look really nice.</li>
            <li>It was delivered exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>and I hope it will last for many years.</li>
            <li>I received this item today and i must say it works exactly how it is supposed to work.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this item, it worked well until the guard broke into pieces.</li>
            <li>our local paper did an article on caring for cashmere sweaters and this product was mentioned as her favorite.  </li>
            <li>I actually purchased it to remove the piling on my sectional, and it works fantastic!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I hoped it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Runs on regular AA batteries - the size most of us have around the house.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>saved my favorite hoodie from looking all pilly and gross  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s not exactly a complicated device</li>
            <li>if it starts getting stuck, be sure to replace the batteries, as theyre probably running low on juice.</li>
            <li>It works exactly as described on jackets, coats, pants, and shirts</li>
            <li>Another draw back is the use of batteries,it would be a lot better if it were with an electric supply</li>
            <li>this motorized lint remover does the job exactly- restored a cotton shirt that looked shabby because of lint pills and made it look crisp again.</li>
            <li>I had a pair of fleece gloves that fuzzed all over and was ready to toss them out, but I came across this product, and it did wonders!  </li>
            <li>It does work and shaves lint off clothing, but in the future I would buy something better constructed.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, it destroyed one of my shirts.</li>
            <li>Pretty bummed out as I used it almost exclusively for a consignment sale</li>
            <li>Great for slacks and thick material shirts</li>
            <li>The shaver worked ok for the first two projects (both sweaters) - removed obviously visible pills and smoothed some (but not all) fuzz.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even test how well it would shave fuzz balls because it won&#x27;t work for more than one second.    </li>
            <li>It put 2 holes in the first t-shirt</li>
            <li>I used the fabric shaver for first time on the top and it did one terrific job!  </li>
            <li>This product works and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>Once I finished, you couldn&#x27;t tell there was any fuzz there in the first place.   </li>
            <li>As my daughters calls it, this &amp;#34;defuzzerator&amp;#34; really works!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really think these sweater shavers work, but they do!</li>
            <li>I can just send it back and get my refund because Amazon&#x27;s customer service just outstanding.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s old satiny smooth condition.</li>
            <li>Exactly how you would imagine this to work.</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>Used it from the first day I got it and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to take.</li>
            <li>small fabric shaver does an awesome job on big wool pillows to get the fabric balls off of them.  </li>
            <li>I either use with item on or pulled over my thigh to have fabric smooth, nearly taught, then shave with circular motion, checking blades occaionally for any lint to be removed.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>first I</li>
            <li>After years of kids and dogs, it was looking pretty dingy and \\&quot;hairy\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I opened this up and spent an hour going to town on everything I own from, sheets, to leggings, to the sweatpants on my body.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Made me very upset and weary of using it again!</li>
            <li>but the metal guard broke during the first use.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints about the shaver at all, and if I ever needed another one would most likely purchase this again.</li>
            <li>I thought at first that the product wasn&#x27;t working</li>
            <li>It is exactly as advertised and for the price I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>and I make sure to remove lint BEFORE it builds back up to the blades so the cleanup is easier.</li>
            <li>I found one finally :-)</li>
            <li>I have had many different sweater shavers through the years</li>
            <li>This thing works exactly as it should.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!</li>
            <li>I get scared it will overheat with how long I use it per session, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I have heard that Brookstone produced a similar product that holds up much better, but I don&#x27;t know if they are still making it.  </li>
            <li>For ages, I had relegated two of my favorite thumbhole hoodies to \\&quot;only wear in house\\&quot; status.</li>
            <li>She was pretty aggressive and holed a sweater.  </li>
            <li>It was not functioning with first use.  </li>
            <li>Is it possible to love a sweater shaver?</li>
            <li>I only was able to use once before it broke-</li>
            <li>As a last stitched effort, I ordered the shaver and am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only a bit more than the cost of dry-cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>This was many years ago when I was only a child and didn&#x27;t know how to respect dogs.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Funny side effect is making the dogs freak out.</li>
            <li>The last one I had was a gift from my mother, probably twenty or more years ago.</li>
            <li>I see fuzzballs on my clothes to make them instantly look better.</li>
            <li>and it really works!</li>
            <li>It works and does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>My first fabric shaver</li>
            <li>After I took the recovery lid off the first time it had a problem attaching after that</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on many different types of sweaters and shirts.</li>
            <li>have no idea ...... forever ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;v had pretty much waaay too much fun &#x27;shaving&#x27;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this on a variety of knits/fabrics, and while a bit more care is needed when using this shaver on raised details (such as cabling), or thinner fabrics</li>
            <li>, yeah, it does exactly what it advertises.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to rehash all the great reviews out there by trying to give the same information.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s higher quality, though, it hasn&#x27;t pilled yet.</li>
            <li>so I could be sure I had installed them properly.</li>
            <li>Shaves pretty well for it&#x27;s size (although the larger ones I&#x27;ve owned shave better).</li>
            <li>You do have to empty the fuzz catching compartment after 1-3 sweaters, depending on the condition of the sweater &amp; the type of fabric</li>
            <li>-- it was my first try using it.</li>
            <li>This fabric shaver does a fairly good job but isn&#x27;t really powerful enough to get off the big pills on a sweater.  </li>
            <li>does exactly what I thought it would do.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally bought it.</li>
            <li>Be careful when using on cashmere items as it may snag and you will have a nice hole.</li>
            <li>and it pretty much saved it!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put too much pressure on the sweater, or it will eat it!</li>
            <li>It revived the garments I tried first</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it well.</li>
            <li>Terrible...didn&#x27;t work even first day</li>
            <li>Very convenient!</li>
            <li>Remington does not fail to meet my expectation for this item.</li>
            <li>Makes life much easier and some clothes can be kept longer!</li>
            <li>, I would absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li>It was my fault, but it should be made aware that this can make holes in your shirts.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure over time it makes a big difference if each time I use it I help my clothes out a bit, so</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re patient, slow and read the instructions - this works great.  </li>
            <li>Only used it once but completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>(1-3x if I am doing a sweater for the first time).</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>For larger areas you&#x27;ll have to sweat more though.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>The shaving action is smooth and efficient.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I need and expect.</li>
            <li>it was exactly what I needed to remove lint from my clothes without any harm to my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>it works great on thick sweaters .....</li>
            <li>Works enough to make a sweater or socks not visibly nubby from afar :)</li>
            <li>This was the first one I&#x27;ve ever purchased</li>
            <li>Fell apart the first time I tried to use it.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m one hundred percent pleased with this.</li>
            <li>This unit does exactly what it should</li>
            <li>This fabric shaver is okay, but I thought I ordered the bigger one....</li>
            <li>but it works okay for smaller things.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m doing one now because this product actually, honestly, really works!  </li>
            <li>so I tried it on a pair of thin-ish athletic socks first</li>
            <li>After I turn it on and try it on the first sock it kept getting caught</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much I have used this since buying it!  </li>
            <li>Works much better than similar gadgets I&#x27;ve purchased in mass retail stores.</li>
            <li>This is my second sweater shaver, and I&#x27;m glad to have it.  </li>
            <li>needless to say she was very very impressed with its price and performance</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on many different fabrics, including delicates, and have not encountered any problems with shaving the fabrics.  </li>
            <li>this is an absolute must-have device!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>I use rechargeable batteries and am able to buzz several sweaters per charging session.</li>
            <li>Thinking of order more for holiday gifts later on.</li>
            <li>There were so many mixed reviews on this</li>
            <li>I have used it several times and also love it.</li>
            <li>, I was pretty underwhelmed when we opened it.</li>
            <li>Maybe would be better on different material</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>This broke before I even finished my first sweater.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like it even better if it were a bit bigger and shaved faster.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I call it the fuzz eater - because it works very efficiently and is almost fun to use.</li>
            <li>It does exactly that.  </li>
            <li>First went over a pair of socks that always seem to come out of the dryer with nubbies all over them.  </li>
            <li>and i used it for the first time</li>
            <li>This shaver really works!</li>
            <li>Only praise. : )</li>
            <li>Using this method (which really should be used no matter WHAT type of fabric!)</li>
            <li>I bought my sofa 6 month ago and the balls comes in from the cloth in a few month, I buy this for my sofa, it works really good</li>
            <li>Tried it on a few pieces of non-delicate clothing and it did a good job there as well.  </li>
            <li>It does a fairly good job on heavy items eg: a coat....</li>
            <li>A few of my bed sheets needed a good shave</li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver based on the reviews of others and WOW it sure made it look like new again.</li>
            <li>This thing makes my favorite old sweaters new again.</li>
            <li>Maybe I will have to go with the old known, better than the new to be known.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, trims effectively, easy to empty.</li>
            <li>Does a great job on the small fuzzies, though!</li>
            <li>It was unable to shave off some particularly mutant fuzzies, but for the most part did a great job.</li>
            <li>This one is just a lot more powerful, and the face holes are a bunch bigger, when I compared it with my older shavers.    </li>
            <li>It might be tedious on a really large job but is perfect for sweaters or armchairs.</li>
            <li>This is a very small shaver but has great strength.</li>
            <li>love this little thing, might order another one, wish there was free shipping though&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure the intended area is flat, so that no drapes get stuck in the blade.</li>
            <li>Make sure everything is flat, or else you might accidentally hit a crease and cut a hole in your fabric.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have the garment on a flat surface</li>
            <li>The blades are nice and sharp; I had no troubles.</li>
            <li>- Be sure to lay your clothes out on a flat surface when you use this.</li>
            <li>Make sure you lay the item of clothing on a flat surface before you begin because if there are any bumps, it could create a hole.</li>
            <li>Remington brand make good quality ones, I was just in a rush to get one, but usually go with ones that have the shaving holes bigger because it will pick up more fuzz.</li>
            <li>I make sure to lay my garment on a flat surface</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t make your clothes look brand new but certainly helps it from looking raggedy!!  </li>
            <li>I have successfully &amp;#34;restored&amp;#34; many of my sweaters to a like-new condition due to this little guy.</li>
            <li>The batteries, which were brand new Energizer brand, gave out in about 5 minutes and didn&#x27;t do a very thorough or clean job of clearing all the fuzz from my fabric.</li>
            <li>The shaver is easy to take apart to empty it or clean the fuzz out from around the blade.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it works great so far.</li>
            <li>More powerful than expected.  </li>
            <li>The battery compartment opened and closed easily, the diagram for the 2 AA batteries was readable and the lint compartment open and shut effectively.</li>
            <li>I ordered the remington fabric shaver to clean up some old sweaters.  </li>
            <li>The fuzz often gets caught in the blades and I have to clean it rather frequently</li>
            <li>Best small appliance I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely too powerful for light fabric</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a cheap and powerful lint remover.</li>
            <li>so I am not sure of its durability over time, but so far it has worked beautifully on some shirts and pj&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The compartment is very easy to detach and empty.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s awesome to see all the little balls of fabric that get collected after you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>This little dude is actually a lot more handy than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that the reserve pops off pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Even though you have to go over some areas several times, this is pretty easy to use and it will eventually work.</li>
            <li>I find it works best if you put the sweater on a hard flat surface.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, event with this, my overlall evaluation is positive.</li>
            <li>I am very cautious when I use this, but it has worked really well!</li>
            <li>it seems to suck through the battery pretty fast...</li>
            <li>My last fabric shaver was a LOT better but broke after several years and is no longer available.</li>
            <li>It works very well and not expensive.  </li>
            <li>Takes a long time, but its better than this junk.</li>
            <li>will see how long it lasts after doing some more items.</li>
            <li>For a  cheap thing that you don&#x27;t need to use often, it serves the purpose, but barely.</li>
            <li>But it is pretty intense.  </li>
            <li>It works very well, and it is exactly what we needed to save some of our clothes.</li>
            <li>but it can pretty much work on everything.</li>
            <li>RUNNING IS MORE THAN THE COST OF THE SHAVER IN THE LONG RUN.</li>
            <li>have a lot more material to shave, and I&#x27;ll see how it does in the long run.</li>
            <li>Be aware that these type shavers are really designed for heavier type fabrics (think of sweaters, comforters, socks...)</li>
            <li>Always a good idea to have one on hand these days since we are so lazy and just through everything in the wash/dryer.</li>
            <li>Works really well, just make sure you use it on a flat surface.</li>
            <li>i had a knitted sweater that i loved but never wore because of all the small lint balls on it.</li>
            <li>Would be good to travel with if needed because of the small size.</li>
            <li>only thing I&#x27;d change on this unit is making the battery compartment cover click closed better &amp; the lint trap can come off easily, but those are little things considering how good this thing works.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use, and all my sweaters that were looking vaguely old now look new again.  </li>
            <li>I was having pretty good luck with this on two or three hoodies until this morning, when it cut a nice sized hole right in the middle front of my expensive cashmere sweater.  </li>
            <li>It works really however if you have a lot of lint on your sweater you will need to clean it out frequently.  </li>
            <li>It did an amazing job with NO pulls and I pressed very hard because some of these were older sweaters with many &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and so far no problems, highly reccomd for a cheap one you cant beat it</li>
            <li>This little shaver has made it look so much better!  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is the cover for the battery compartment slides off really easily when you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li>The back that hold the batteries in comes off easily...</li>
            <li>The only issue is the lint catcher and battery cover come off way too easily when you don&#x27;t want them to.</li>
            <li>It did exactly what i expected it to do plus more.</li>
            <li>Plus it was easy to use and uses regular batteries.</li>
            <li>The pill catcher tends to slip off easily, but not enough of a problem that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the covers for the batteries and the lint trap slide off a bit too easily while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li>Works with 2 batteries, fits easily into your hand and is very simple to use!</li>
            <li>Simple, easy to use and intuitive.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised, and thought maybe it just uses batteries up quickly.</li>
            <li>Takes fabric ends off quite easily and occasionally needs to be emptied.</li>
            <li>It has been used often and on some rough materials and other than needing to be cleaned out fairly often hasn&#x27;t given me any issues!</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t for the battery cover and blue compartment coming off so easily during use, I would have rated this 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive, easy to use, total no brainer of a purchase.</li>
            <li>Love the item, very comfy design but delivery seemed to take a long time though.</li>
            <li>I figured if it ruined them (as some feed back indicated the suction was too strong)</li>
            <li>The batteries lasted for clearing the entire bed and still going strong.</li>
            <li>how long this will last, but it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li>large enough holes without pulling in the fabric, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>10-12 pair of extremely pilled athletic socks now look &#x27;like new&#x27; thanks to this great little product - and the first pair of AA batteries are still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I can adequately express in words my love for this humming little wizard.</li>
            <li>I used this right away on a nice shirt of mine and did not lay the shirt out flat enough</li>
            <li>Batteries ran down kind of fast.  </li>
            <li>Still better than having to vacuum or otherwise clean up all the shavings from a regular sweater stone.</li>
            <li>I have and electric blanket that got these burgundy balls in quite a large section from a comforter that shed.</li>
            <li>Gonna order the large size too</li>
            <li>Takes a while for large garments, but it gets it done.</li>
            <li>ON CERTAIN MATERIALS</li>
            <li>anyways it works and used on certain cloth</li>
            <li>sometimes it stops if the fuzz ball is too large to shave.....</li>
            <li>Also this takes 2 AA BATTERIES, so make certain to order some, too.</li>
            <li>As others have said, the holes are on the large side, so use with care.</li>
            <li>My mom had a large Remington brand fabric shaver for years and years</li>
            <li>Certainly hasn&#x27;t been my experience.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it overall and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>You can tell by the sound that in comparison to other shavers, this one is superior to any other.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re using it on heavy knits you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a satisfying feeling to de-pill my fleece sweaters and make them look like new again.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was going to have to buy a new duvet cover until this fabric shaver was able to remove all the big lint ball tufts and return my duvet to</li>
            <li>My seat were starting to show wear after years of use and this unit was able to remove all the unsightly pills and bring the suede leather insert looking new again.</li>
            <li>That means that you are going to be able to get rid of the fuzz that forms on a new sweater, but you will still be picking any big, unsightly pills off with your fingers.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s back to new love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve already read the reviews about how this shaver extends the life of clothing by making it look new again, thereby allowing you to get more years out of your current clothing and thus saving money.</li>
            <li>Always surprised how light weight the new products have become and feel flimsy.  </li>
            <li>This piece of small device is quite handy to remove fuss and threads in sweaters, woolen hand gloves and other fabric in a smooth and easy manner.</li>
            <li>I even decided to run it over the lower back of some of my polos (a typical place for pills to accumulate) and it worked great.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone who hates fuzzballs and wants to remove them easily and effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We had some old shavers that were a hassle, they were easily over 10 years old.</li>
            <li>as effective is a gentle wire bristled clothing brush (have had one for ions) moved gently up and down the sweater.</li>
            <li>Well I cant afford new furniture right now</li>
            <li>I started using this shaver right after taking it out of the box with new batteries.</li>
            <li>Completely restored three $200+ sweaters to like new upon my first use!!</li>
            <li>However, the metal used to make the shaver head is extremely fine, and a section of mine broke off with the pressure of using the device, within a very short time.  </li>
            <li>perfect little tool to shave away those little lints that form on clothes.</li>
            <li>I have some clothes (blouses, especially) that I&#x27;ve owned for 5+ years and look fine aside from the pilling that comes with age.</li>
            <li>I found this works better for smoother knit wool fabric with finer fibers and less texture and the stone works better for larger sweaters with coarser fibers.</li>
            <li>Pretty decent fabric shaver for the price.</li>
            <li>I bought it for two particular shirts, and I was nervous to use it and ruin my shirts based on some reviews - but the shirts looked pretty rotten as they were,</li>
            <li>and they often had a very high pitched whine to the motor.</li>
            <li>For some reason it really frightens my relatively large (90lbs) dog.</li>
            <li>The holes are large and the blades are very close to the screen.</li>
            <li>IT worked amazing, and I can wear my jacket now because it took all the little balls off it.</li>
            <li>This little shaver is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing little tool.</li>
            <li>I had those little fuzz balls all over my couch and this amazing product took them all off.</li>
            <li>This little gadget does what I needed it to do, and that was to de-pill and de-fuzz two, long-styled sweaters that I own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice little tool.</li>
            <li>I purchased this fabric shaver after some of my dress shirts (The kind of work, weddings, etc) started to develop a ton of little lint balls on them.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice little cover for the shaver head.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lightweight, inexpensive, handy little fabric shaver.  </li>
            <li>I tried it more delicate clothing, and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>Pretty basic, takes a while to really clean a sweater that has a lot of pilling off.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone interested in buying a product of this nature.</li>
            <li>this item is a very good item dont get me wrong.    </li>
            <li>sweater shaver is a simple little thing, lightweight, for a great price.</li>
            <li>Thought it could have been a little more powerful.</li>
            <li>I love this little machine - it is compact but powerful.</li>
            <li>When the shaver starts to sound &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; as if the battery was running down, that&#x27;s the time to clean it out.  </li>
            <li>It does not actually take most of the little pills off of a sweater, but I suppose better than nothing.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much since I paid so little for it, I just needed something easy to clean up my husbands coat.</li>
            <li>Obviously not going to be as powerful as a larger device, but great for travel and small clean ups.</li>
            <li>Really, how hard would it be to make that part more secure?</li>
            <li>but did clean them up to nearly looking like new.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tad noisy and the container gets filled too fast in my opinion but those are the only drawbacks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably great for cotton stuff, but if you&#x27;re looking to doctor up big fluffy sweaters this did not work for me.</li>
            <li>So far it is delicate on clothes and does its job great.</li>
            <li>I got this for my babies woolie covers, but I ended up spending the entire day defuzzing this huge sweater</li>
            <li>/&gt;- light enough to carry in your travel bag to use when needed&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>the sweater I am &amp;#34;defuzzing&amp;#34; has so much to defuzz that it will take some time</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t need to stretch the fabric much with the shaver, so it seemed much kinder on the garments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S SHAVES EXTREMLY FAST</li>
            <li>Until a family relative told us that there in Europe she uses a fabric shaver, we decided to buy a cheap one to test it.</li>
            <li>really fast-</li>
            <li>and my wife really likes it.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I immediately went through all my sweaters &amp; got straight to work .</li>
            <li>I could have paid $25 or more for a shaver that might not work as well as expected.  </li>
            <li>It has made my wool coat of 6 years look much newer.</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY</li>
            <li>just gently glide it over your clothes or else</li>
            <li>It really took off all of the lint balls.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping  </li>
            <li>;works very well..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done 2 whole sweat suits and havnt changed battery&#x27;s yet.</li>
            <li>It put holes in every test fabric/clothing of different weights, no matter how light a hand I used.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item if you have knits you want to revive!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t try it on anything light, just for winter fabrics, but I could tell it would definitely do some damage on thinner material.</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>Even though the metal cover seems to be for protection purpose, however, be very cautious when using it.</li>
            <li>Dont let the size fool you, it has a lot of power and works really well.</li>
            <li>, it did make a whole</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This shaver is very convenient....</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Everything was fast.  </li>
            <li>It works well and looks very sleek.  </li>
            <li>I really like how the receptacle works and how it is see-through.  </li>
            <li>I did the whole couch</li>
            <li>but it really works well.</li>
            <li>My coats look SO MUCH nicer without those fabric balls.</li>
            <li>Time consuming to do a whole sweater.</li>
            <li>Product is great, I&#x27;ve used on several different things / different materials and no problems.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely blown away.  </li>
            <li>Very affordable.  </li>
            <li>You just graze the fabric gently and let the shaver do the work.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this!  </li>
            <li>You have to focus too much on trying to hold it without knocking the covers off.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Is this really what it is?</li>
            <li>Really rejuvenated my clothes.</li>
            <li>Batteries not included and the fuzz catcher is very convenient....</li>
            <li>I was stunned at how much lint was caught in the collector on the front.</li>
            <li>It can be time consuming depending on how much balls are on the sweater</li>
            <li>Removes lint and fabric balls really well cleaned the neck around my hoodies.</li>
            <li>I bought this to see if it could really remove pills like everyone was saying.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s about how much pressure you put.</li>
            <li>I had never even heard of this devise and researched the comments and then really just took a chance.</li>
            <li>it lasted a whole 30 min before biting the dust.  </li>
            <li>Does the job much better than expected</li>
            <li>It takes a light touch to use any shaver properly.</li>
            <li>Works very well on a variety of fabrics.</li>
            <li>but once I received it and began using it I came to find that a wire that plugged into the wall would have gotten in the way-- much like the wire from an iron.  </li>
            <li>This thing really works.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t remove much of the fuzz, believe me.&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really wanting to buy this product, but when I reach the checkout page, it displays a photo for the RTFS-100.  </li>
            <li>Put it through the paces upon receipt and performed very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this one really does shave off the pills!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This thing works very well.</li>
            <li>This is inexpensive and a really neat tool to have.</li>
            <li>Using this and seeing how much comes off</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I was especially surprised as I didn&#x27;t have much expectation given such an cheap price.</li>
            <li>This does absolutely nothing to remove fuzz from any piece of clothing or textile.  </li>
            <li>Anyway why i have to say so much to grade this shaver...</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t cover as much area as the jumbo one did.</li>
            <li>The shield prevents snagging on most fabrics if you are careful.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This razor did not help much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>This fuzz buster really works.</li>
            <li>They remove fuzz and lint balls very well.  </li>
            <li>it worked very well and didn&#x27;t cut into the fabric.</li>
            <li>My whole family is hooked on this thing.  </li>
            <li>and I was about ready to throw them out.</li>
            <li>Only takes primary (non-rechargeable) AA batteries.  </li>
            <li>really wanted it for my wool sweaters and coats</li>
            <li>and that seemed to solve the problem of it nipping too much fabric.</li>
            <li>Cost was reasonable also.</li>
            <li>I bought it to shave the pills off of our courdaroy-style fabric couch, but it really doesn&#x27;t put a dent in them.</li>
            <li>I no longer have all the much polyester, but my synthetic socks do get pills.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li>The batteries go fast.</li>
            <li>This device the whole family enjoys.</li>
            <li>Works very well and can get very close to fabric without putting a hole in your clothes.</li>
            <li>It works really well and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>The battery is consumed fast</li>
            <li>This product really accomplishes the purpose of removing the fuzz and pills.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;twork very well</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so satisfying to see all the &amp;#34;pilling&amp;#34; come off into the compartment that catches the fluff.</li>
            <li>all my sweaters (I really like sweaters).  </li>
            <li>Gently pass it across.</li>
            <li>I felt very cheated.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from a $6 lint remover</li>
            <li>The quality is very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is just another item of cheap Chinese junk.</li>
            <li>Very compact and efficient.</li>
            <li>I really wish I&#x27;d kept the packaging to return this junk.</li>
            <li>but it is very convient for travel.</li>
            <li>Operated better than expected.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended !</li>
            <li>I figured if it was a dud, it wasn&#x27;t much money lost.</li>
            <li>do have to be careful to make sure there isn&#x27;t a thread sticking out of your item</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li>We have used it on furniture and sweaters and it really has improved their appearances</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and product was as described.</li>
            <li>This product works very well and seems to be made durable.  </li>
            <li>Product does not work very well.</li>
            <li>I used it on a really fuzzy baby blanket.  </li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t really do the trick.  </li>
            <li>It really does renew my sweaters.</li>
            <li>About a year ago I bought a similar thing for a cheap price, after a week</li>
            <li>It gets rid of the fuzzies and has not broken.</li>
            <li>i think it holds up real well</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it much yet</li>
            <li>I have to say I did not expect much when I bought this unit</li>
            <li>Gently press on and just swirl it around</li>
            <li>This battery-operated lint remover works very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>After cleaning 3-4 sweaters, intensely.</li>
            <li>really need to spend some time shaving sections in order to see them &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;,</li>
            <li>This is a very efficient tool for depilling knitted goods to keep them new-looking.</li>
            <li>I had 5 or 6 sweaters that I was ready to basically give to Goodwill</li>
            <li>I have been looking for one of these for awhile, does its job very well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Worked a lot better than expected.</li>
            <li>Removes pills from sweaters very well ?</li>
            <li>It took a while to shave the whole shirt</li>
            <li>I have saved sooo much money in sweaters since buying this.  </li>
            <li>works very well</li>
            <li>, empty it often or the fuzz won&#x27;t be able to fall and will not allow it to work as efficiently.</li>
            <li>This worked very well in removing them.</li>
            <li>Really dissapointed with this product.</li>
            <li>The batterie power is just enough to do light pill take away.</li>
            <li>They seem to be making clothes out of cheaper and cheaper fabrics (but the prices keep going up) and everything seems to pill no matter how much you pay for it.  </li>
            <li>It works really well, and has already paid for itself by saving my dress.</li>
            <li>It was also very well priced.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I need to go over an extra linty area 10 times for it to be lint free.  </li>
            <li>it works really well</li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>It works much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I keep replacing them every couple of months though, because they have a real problem with pilling.</li>
            <li>really like these.</li>
            <li>Sure, there was absolutely no reason to do that</li>
            <li>this goes through them fast.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see myself getting much use of this on items like shirts or blouses.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Considered this is very affordable and inexpensive</li>
            <li>With the elongated handle I didn&#x27;t feel I had as much control.</li>
            <li>But it can be very time consuming to do.  </li>
            <li>It also seems gentle on clothes.</li>
            <li>this thing didn&#x27;t really work...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to all sweater lovers!</li>
            <li>But it should be noted; no one wants the fuzz going everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You should only lightly hover over the fabric.</li>
            <li>Much gentler on delicate knits, but still powerful and effective on dense wools and cashmere.</li>
            <li>REASONABLE AND RELIABLE.</li>
            <li>tried picking at them, but how in the world are you ever gonna get the whole sweat shirt done,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It really has helped remove all the lint balls from my slacks and workout clothes.  </li>
            <li>Fast service and neat packaging</li>
            <li>Works really well on pilling pants, sweaters, etc.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li>It operates very well</li>
            <li>cheap , last and does the job.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works fast and hasn&#x27;t cut anything yet.</li>
            <li>This Remington fabric shaver worked very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I bought this primarily to bring life back into wool sweaters.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>Cleans up the wool covers really well.</li>
            <li>Had i spent more time i probably wouldve gotten them all.</li>
            <li>The replacements either didn&#x27;t work straight out of the package or fell apart after one use.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend for every home!</li>
            <li>Really couldn&#x27;t be easier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the stone and the comb, but this really does the job.</li>
            <li>Very time consuming process..</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>Works really well to take off the pulls and</li>
            <li>the (what look like) dust bunnies but are just fabric that got rubbed too much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Like damn a shaved my whole comforter with this s</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the reviews on this product I got it</li>
            <li>It was better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>The battery cover doesn&#x27;t stay on very well.  </li>
            <li>Batteries ran out fast</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve practiced putting ten holes in my top.</li>
            <li>It was somewhat heavy not too much where my hand was aching but a nice feel to it.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t last forever, but try to take good care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be careful with clothing.</li>
            <li>The lint chamber is small and needs to be emptied frequently--instructions say it should not ever be more than 3/4 full.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if it came with an extra blade or options to purchase extra blades.</li>
            <li>So far so good, after a few months of use.</li>
            <li>All in all a great little gadget especially for the price, which is less than most fast food meals!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to everyone that likes looking fresh and new with no lint or fuzziness to their garments.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would be as powerful as it is due to its size, but its just fine for my sweaters.</li>
            <li>The clear part that holds the shavings is easy to remove, but one tip: empty it before it gets full.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the fact that this little magic shaver has larger holes in the head as I think another reviewer mentioned and that allows it to gather more of the fuzzy stuff and pills.  </li>
            <li>The container does fill up pretty quickly and I have on occasion pushed it open by accident and spilled the fuzz.</li>
            <li>This little wonder has done an amazing job on all of my sweaters and fleece items, they look brand new!</li>
            <li>It just tore a hole in a new sweater the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I wanted this to cut off the balls that roll up on my sweater that is pretty new.  </li>
            <li>I took my black light and shone it on my sofa after all the lights were turned out, and wow - what a lot of little pills &amp; fuzzies that showed up glowing bright white under the ultra-violet light!  </li>
            <li>The clear compartment where the shaved fuzzies go is less than secure though and it comes detached easily, but I just wrapped a hair band around it to solve that issue.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and the blades stay sharp longer than most that I have used.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my sister who asked for one for her birthday, so there isn&#x27;t much I can say about it since I left it in it&#x27;s original packaging so that I can wrap it.</li>
            <li>I wish I had read the other reviews that it is only good on heavier materials.</li>
            <li>No its not fancy, and yes takes all of about 25 min to do a large heavily pilled hoodie, but i actually found it kinda relaxing and mostly amusing!</li>
            <li>this product is perfect, mine was not package properly so it came with a little crack which was minor.</li>
            <li>This fabric shaver saved a couple of my favorite sweaters that were in the giveaway pile...and it was kind of fun to watch this thing quickly transform them from aged looking, pill covered sweaters well past their prime back to almost new looking ones.  </li>
            <li>This shaver works very well, but you have to clean it constantly (3 or 4 times per sweater) and it devours batteries.</li>
            <li>Little doors for the batteries and where the shavings go fall off very easily while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other hand held pill removers that have worked much better.</li>
            <li>Better than any other I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li>On most other things, this works like a charm.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about how this product was going to turn out, due to some of the \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; being \\&quot;1 or 2 star\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Fuzz catches underneath blades too often due to buildup of pieces that aren&#x27;t able to go into storage compartment.   </li>
            <li>I originally purchased it to shave the occasional fuzz ball off of my sofa, but it couldn&#x27;t take out any of them.</li>
            <li>product made the sweater looks almost brand-new as well as many other children&#x27;s close that were going to be thrown out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used in on many other cloths,  </li>
            <li>Believe it or not, I looked at many other shavers before selecting this one.  </li>
            <li>sure enough I added this to my cart because of the recognizable name and low price combination.</li>
            <li>I am planing to return it, but I don&#x27;t know how it will work with all this policy of unopened or in the original package, since this one you have to actually break (the package) in order to get out the product.</li>
            <li>I ordered this model based on other reviews and was really pleased with it&#x27;s efficacy.</li>
            <li>It did a very good cropping on the acrylic sweater and fairly good (left a few little pills that are not very visible) on the fleece sweater jackets.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This worked GREAT the first two times we used it but with the THIRD use it started making an odd squealing noise and now it&#x27;s barely working.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pressing pretty hard against a book and it did catch one of my nice sweaters and created a hole.  </li>
            <li>I just tested this item on very nubby cotton/spandex gloves that I wear often and now they look brand new!  </li>
            <li>People are right if you push too hard you can damage fragile or thin fabrics but for the most part its really just awesome.</li>
            <li>Simple to use and clean out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough to take out and the price was great.</li>
            <li>particular brand has worked really well for me for over 10 years-- and this purchase was a gift</li>
            <li>Great product and packs a punch for such a small device.</li>
            <li>It can be open all the part to clean.</li>
            <li>Who knew such a small, inexpensive item could make someone that happy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, light, and fits comfortably in my hand.  </li>
            <li>But my old one worked better, the holes in the metal top were a little bigger, so the fabric balls could get inside and be cut off.  </li>
            <li>Would subtract 1/2 star because in downward position, working item on flat surface, gravity causes contents of storage compartment to compact near blades...and compartment seems apt to detach during use (will just secure with tape as I had to do with previous model).</li>
            <li>The only down side is it takes a while to do a good job.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I had accumulated many, many clothing items that looked completely worn out after only a few wears.  </li>
            <li>You do have to be careful as it&#x27;s very powerful, but it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes of this handy gadget, my sport coat and sweaters looked like new.  </li>
            <li>Best on less delicate items.</li>
            <li>I use this not only on sweaters but on an old couch that tends to pill easily.  </li>
            <li>The fuzz container also comes open quite easily and frequently during use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>One down fall is that the lint lint collecting bin thing does come off pretty easy while using it</li>
            <li>Not sure what other folks are doing, but this has worked brilliantly on everything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really a lazy housekeeper and about as far as obsessively tidy as you can get, but I now understand why people would be interested in depilling all of their cloth, household items.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the money I spent on it, but it only does an OK job removing pills and fuzz from fabric.</li>
            <li>It fits really nicely in your hand and just requires 2 AA batteries which are easier to replace (since i usually have them lying around) than the C batteries that some shavers require.</li>
            <li>Love simple and cheap solutions to everyday problems...</li>
            <li>I am sure that there are other more expensive products out there that would work better for the price and what I needed it for, it does the job.</li>
            <li>It did such a good job that it has made the color come back when I thought the fabric was actually faded.</li>
            <li>Makes your cloths look new, like new!!.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a small head, so it takes a little more time than some of the bigger more expensive models, but it&#x27;s perfect for a quick once over.</li>
            <li>It removed most of them down to the original, flat surface level.</li>
            <li>Despite the fact that this fabric shaver is very cheap, it took me several weeks of consideration before I finally decided to buy it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I have ever loved a cheap little product this much.</li>
            <li>This may go down as one of the most &amp;#34;is this real?&amp;#34; inventions i have ever</li>
            <li>I love this little sweater (and many other items) shaver</li>
            <li>This is good for traveling but for everyday home use this may be too small and can fall apart (lint bin) easily.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately it gets full in the top section too quick and stops working</li>
            <li>This does a good job of removing the fuzzies, but it also munched a little hole in the middle of my sweater.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems a little delicate, but is working perfectly</li>
            <li>It now looks and feels like new!</li>
            <li>but if you take your time, the sweater comes out looking new!  </li>
            <li>If you do buy it don&#x27;t use it on anything you can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li>Keeps sweaters looking new!</li>
            <li>NEW!</li>
            <li>NEW!</li>
            <li>Makes my clothes new again!</li>

            <li>My sweater looks brand new!  </li>
            <li>It made my shirts with pills all over them look brand new!</li>
            <li>I had a sweater with LOTS of pilling and it looks almost new!</li>
            <li>Now the sheets feel like new!</li>
            <li>chronic pilling are like new!</li>
            <li>Lots cheaper than buying a new sweater!</li>
            <li>I feel like I went shopping and got a bunch of new stuff!</li>
            <li>My sweaters/sweatshirts look like new again!</li>
            <li>and they look brand new!</li>
            <li>They look brand new!</li>
            <li>Helps all your clothes that you haven&#x27;t worn in a while and helps them look like new!</li>
            <li>I used it on some of my sons clothes &amp; they almost feel like new again!  </li>
            <li>Managed to make a year-old lambswool sweater look practically new!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made them look like new again!</li>
            <li>Sofa looks like new!</li>
            <li>, It makes your clothing look like new in just a snap!</li>
            <li>The garments look like new!</li>
            <li>My sweaters look like new!</li>
            <li>Also removed the pills that always develop on the heel area of tennis shoes VIOLA like new again!</li>
            <li>This removed the pills &amp; pulls and made his shirts look like new!</li>
            <li>My sister in law borrowed it to remove excess fuzz and lint from a hat, it looks brand new!</li>
            <li>New life has been added to my closet!</li>
            <li>My pea coat and a bunch of my sweaters look brand new again!</li>
            <li>It makes my clothes look like new!</li>
            <li>SWEATER LOOK BRAND NEW!  </li>
            <li>Made it all look like new!</li>
            <li>My coat looks brand new now!  </li>
            <li>Clothes look new again!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to and quickly shaves the little fabric bumps right off the clothes.</li>
            <li>Wish it was able to filter the lint/shaved pieces down a bit better to last a bit longer before emptying/cleaning would be necessary.</li>
            <li>Have the same one I bought years ago, blades stay sharp, easy to remove cover to clean.  </li>
            <li>Works very well and now my sweaters look new again.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to use and makes sweaters and woolen products look like new.</li>
            <li>I got a lot of my clothes to look brand new again especially my old fleeces.  </li>
            <li>Before buying it I was ready to get rid of some clothes but after using this fabric shaver it&#x27;s like a new life was brought to those pieces.  </li>
            <li>(no tearing of the sweater, which really did look like new afterwards).</li>
            <li>Keep this in your laundry room, and you will see how much you need this, I used my for kids cloth and keep it like new.</li>
            <li>It sucks up all the pills and fuzz; my old sweaters look good as new!</li>
            <li>The only downside to this amazing fabric shaver is that you have to empty the chamber quite often.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold and with the see through lint compartment, you know when to empty.  </li>
            <li>My favorite black sweater...</li>
            <li>Easy to use and empty out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and empty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to empty.</li>
            <li>It is easy to remove and empty the fuzzy catcher.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The residue falls into the collector on the shaver and easy to detach to empty.  </li>
            <li>The lint compartment falls off easy, however and you have to empty often.</li>
            <li>I previously had a $4 fabric shaver that worked much better</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it often, but it always works well, and it&#x27;s easy to empty.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to tell when it&#x27;s time to empty.</li>
            <li>It is easy to empty and even easier to use.  </li>
            <li>but after multiple uses and on bigger fabrics with more fuzzballs, I was amazed</li>
            <li>My main concern is the container is made of plastic</li>
            <li>This one just arrived and I tried it on three items:  a fraying silk tie, fraying shirt collars, and the pills on a fleece jacket (the main reason I bought it).  </li>
            <li>If I later find problems with it, I&#x27;ll be sure to come back and revise this review.</li>
            <li>So far works really well on my sweaters without shaving off too much or getting stuck on the fabric.</li>
            <li>Straight out of the package with a fresh pair of batteries installed, the thing worked for one second.  </li>
            <li>I actually placed an order for a larger one that is not battery operated, but use this one much more often.  </li>
            <li>Did a decent job when it was working.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t particularly like the shape.</li>
            <li>I shave off some particularly gnarly lint balls off of a thermal sock.</li>
            <li>No seriously.</li>
            <li>Also, if I was lucky enough to have it pick one up, the shaver would clog and stop.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you actually take off the cap before you actually use it.</li>
            <li>I bought this because my older Remington fabric shaver gave out.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t hold as much as my older one.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just my particular piece?</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase this and would make the jump to something more expensive and hopefully more efficient.</li>
            <li>read all of the reviews here and got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on an older zip-up sweat shirt</li>
            <li>Otherwise, decent product.</li>
            <li>super product...gives 2nd life to pilled sweaters!  </li>
            <li>and it quickly put a big hole in it to the point that I had to throw the sweater out.</li>
            <li>I looked around in my local stores for a while before finally buying online, and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to use this particular one myself.  </li>
            <li>I was considering buying a much more expensive electric shaver, but I&#x27;m glad I followed the reviews and didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>My refund should be quick once they get it back.  </li>
            <li>This little baby makes them very smooth and presentable again.</li>
            <li>I bought this a few years ago and it worked pretty great until it suddenly stopped working for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very loud though, but gets the job done!</li>
            <li>great for shaving all those little balls off your sweater and other clothing.  </li>
            <li>Worked fairly well... until it made a whole in my favorite shirt.. :(</li>
            <li>I left them in the boxes until I got the shaver, then washed them all and shaved them one right after the other, molding the sweaters to my knees first and using a light touch.</li>
            <li>The battery cover does not snap on tightly and comes off very easily and frequently during use.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>Would highly recomend this one.</li>

            <li>Works as long as you keep it clean and don&#x27;t overload it.</li>
            <li>Be sure to lay your item as flat as possible.</li>
            <li>Definitely make sure to use this on a flat surface.</li>
            <li>One note of caution, be careful on fine fabrics and it will pull the material.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this little \\&quot;magic shaver.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon...I was surprised when I searched your site and found them as I&#x27;ve been hunting for a couple of years for a new one!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this little shaver for about 9 months now, and have used it on all sorts of fabrics -- not just sweaters but t-shirts, socks, sheets, and more.</li>
            <li>The little &amp;#34;vacuum&amp;#34; really makes the little pills and snags stand up, and the clippers work great.  </li>
            <li>Sure saves a lot of time and makes items I hadn&#x27;t worn for a while wearable since all the little nubs are removed.</li>
            <li>I have been meaning to buy a fabric shaver for a while, and with some of my favorite clothes getting a little worn-looking, it was time.</li>
            <li>life savor little gadget :-)</li>
            <li>Love this little shaver.</li>
            <li>and I love my little fabric shaver...</li>
            <li>While it looked a little better, I still couldn&#x27;t remove all the pilling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am never throwing away old clothes again!!</li>
            <li>I used this first on a coat that had major pilling.  </li>
            <li>Just wish the lint catcher held a little more....</li>
            <li>This little gadget is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Love this little thing.</li>
            <li>My neighbor lent me her inferior shaver and after an hour of little result I decided to purchase a better one myself.</li>
            <li>My couch looks so much better thanks to this little shaver!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite small, so if covering large areas it can take some time for sure.</li>
            <li>The shaver is a good idea, but this in particular is not powerful, and is not working like I expected</li>
            <li>The motor is strong and the blades are sharp.</li>
            <li>The couch now looks almost new and has at least 10 more years ahead!</li>
            <li>Now instead of buying new pants, they look like new!</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited about this device for a while until I decided to use it on my $200 black peacoat.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I paid less than ten bucks for this thing - I absolutely LOVE what it does!  </li>
            <li>Replacement for my super old Remington fabric shaver that died not long ago, may it rest in peace.  </li>
            <li>I shaved all of my older sweaters and they look new now.  </li>
            <li>Watch out when you clean the top out that you dont loose the little blades.  </li>
            <li>I recommend that you practice on an old sweater before you really go to town with it.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be surprised how much lint accumulates in the storage</li>
            <li>I bought this to use on a wool sweater, and so far this fabric shaver has been working very well</li>
            <li>works very well to refresh a wool coat and sweaters that had developed pills.  </li>
            <li>I am in the process of getting my daughter&#x27;s old baby clothes ready for a consignment sale</li>
            <li>I was surprised with how fast it was delivered and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a corner of the bedsheet and it took just a few minutes to remove basically most of the fuzzballs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>TINY BUT POWERFUL.</li>
            <li>I do not know for how long blades last, but I am going to buy one more shaver for someone else as a practical gift.</li>
            <li>However, within 5 minutes (5 minutes!!!) of normal usage, the \\&quot;metal\\&quot; grate on the cover snapped and broke and as a result</li>
            <li>OK FOR THE PRICE BUT NEED TO READJUST THE BLADES MANUALLY AFTER HEAVY USE CAUSE THEY GET STUCK ON THE SHAVER HEAD</li>
            <li>This product works better on heavy knit and cable knit sweater.</li>
            <li>Even if this only goes through one winter its still worth getting one per year, no doubt.</li>
            <li>but I am sure it will do the trick on a few of my sweaters.  </li>
            <li>This worked okay for a fuzzy cardigan, but broke after a few uses.</li>
            <li>I suppose it depends on the fabric, but if using it on a more delicate fabric, just pull it taut first.</li>
            <li>under ten bucks to restore quite a few sweaters to much better condition is well worth it -</li>
            <li>bit of care and babying can prevent all these downsides, so overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth your while.</li>
            <li>It takes some time to actually get the pills off the sweater, but is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Two of the slacks had a few fuzz balls but one pair had so many</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think this would happen with normal use.</li>
            <li>What I got doesn&#x27;t look like the product shown, regardless i wasted more money on figuring out what the lint remover i have uses as a battery source.</li>
            <li>; because if you don&#x27;t mind the extra fuss, the results are worth the trouble.disassembled out of necessity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>maybe the holes on this one are too big, or it is too powerful?</li>
            <li>I have a few pairs of Ponte Knit leggings from Old Navy, and they are absolute favorite pants.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have tried others, more expensive, but not as effective as the low cost Remington Fabric Shaver.</li>
            <li>When I cleared the blades out, the shaver worked as normal again.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and buy a better fabric shaver, this one is a real lemon and complete waste of money.</li>
            <li>The battery compartment is poorly made and this does not do a good job for pilling.</li>
            <li>Its kind of slow work</li>
            <li>Omg this is awesome, I think I have shaved almost every outfit I own and this little fabric shaver does wonders on you clothing, I am absolutely addicted to this shaver, it may be small but contains plenty of power, my clothes look new again</li>
            <li>I purchased this little guy and was able to restore the coat to brand new condition in about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>i got this little baby to make my sweaters look more new.</li>
            <li>I typically consider myself to be an intelligent person, until this little fabric shaver arrived.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this unit if you have a fabric or material that has unsightly pills and want it to look new again.</li>
            <li>about every 1-2 minutes, so I had to unscrew the top of it and blow to get the fuzzies to get down into the clear part of the shaver.  </li>
            <li>it get the extra fabric on the clothes  out fast and everything looking pretty new.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;[t work on the thing I wanted it to but other things fine</li>
            <li>I am sure this thing could be used for so many other fabric shaving options, I will keep it handy for my next puff cutting projects.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, the functionality of the product is fine.</li>
            <li>Not like new,  but at least I can still wear it and look nice.  </li>
            <li>Great little item.... really powerful and will get all those pesky little bits of fabric off in seconds (especially from fleece and sweaters).</li>
            <li>That is a job better left for the dry cleaner or a sweater</li>
            <li>It is easy enough to put back together...</li>
            <li>Many of them have poor reviews, stating the units broke quickly or they ate holes through people&#x27;s sweaters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does what it says  Extremely affordable   Easy to empty out and clean  Cons:  </li>
            <li>I nearly threw out a great sweater jacket due to heavy pilling.  </li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t use too much pressure and hold the shirt firmly you should be ok!</li>
            <li>When cleaning fabric, I always hold the fabric in my left hand, with my hand beneath the area I&#x27;m cleaning, and then use my right hand to do the fuzzbusting.</li>
            <li>The one on the right is next.</li>
            <li>The $5.99 price is definitely right: It would have cost me close to $200.00 to replace the three sweaters with similar merchandise.</li>
            <li>You have to over and over the same area for it to work right.</li>
            <li>This little shaver works great to remove small to large fuzzballs from clothes and makes them look almost new.  </li>
            <li>What were once pilly and rough, are now smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li>and I still have the original batteries in it even though I&#x27;ve been using it consistently (once or twice a week for about 10 minutes at a stretch) for a few months.</li>
            <li>I used it to remove little &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; on bedsheets which it did with ease restoring them to their original 600 thread count feel!</li>
            <li>The device quickly clipped the fuzz balls and it left behind a clean, smooth surface.  </li>
            <li>It also picks up lint and some hairs at the same time as an extra bonus to the fine job it does on sweaters.</li>
            <li>Since it is so tiny, it takes much longer to shave something with a large surface area, like a jacket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works very well although I must say that if you need to do a large area you may want to consider a larger unit.</li>
            <li>This is a great little shaver but watch out it&#x27;s put a few holes in my sweaters.  </li>
            <li>Great product the only issue I have is the lint holder is too small, needs to remove shaved lint constantly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing to me that something I had bought almost forty years ago lasted so long and this shaver only lasted through several uses (or should I say \\&quot;abuses\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>It was so incredibly cheap, yet it works extremely well.</li>
            <li>If one way missed any, the other way would smooth them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice little gadget, however, it worked for about ten seconds before it quit ... never to work again.  </li>
            <li>I was quite surprised with this little battery powered item and am glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the fuzzys from my old couch will get stuck in the blades and it will stop working, but if I just unscrew the cap a little to put more space between the blades and the cover, it will start working again.  </li>
            <li>It was majorly pilled, and this shaver took off several compartments full.  </li>
            <li>It functions pretty well, but I really wanted it to shave the smaller pills that creep up on new really soft jersey knits.</li>
            <li>I really love this little shaver--it&#x27;s given my old sweaters a new life.</li>
            <li>One issue I have is I have to stop and shake it because it seems to loose ability to cut not because its full.</li>
            <li>They look brand new.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t see it bringing up a wool garment &#x27;as new&#x27;</li>
            <li>My furniture looks new again.</li>
            <li>Made my scarf and look like new.</li>
            <li>and they look brand new.</li>
            <li>so I ordered a new one</li>
            <li>The garmet I recovered is like new.</li>
            <li>My suits that got snagged look like new again.</li>
            <li>Everything looks like new.  </li>
            <li>Must have if you want your clothes looking new again.</li>
            <li>but now they look almost new</li>
            <li>Sweaters and pants are like new again.</li>
            <li>Used it on a living room chair, looks like brand new again.</li>
            <li>Makes my sweatshirts look brand new.  </li>
            <li>I used this on all my sweaters and it made them look almost new.  </li>
            <li>2 minutes with this shaver and the cushions look almost new.</li>
            <li>so I replaced them with new ones:</li>
            <li>It does not make the article of clothing look new....</li>
            <li>Makes them look new.</li>
            <li>This thing makes everything I use it on look brand new.</li>
            <li>look brand new.</li>
            <li>My sweaters, coats looks brand new now.</li>
            <li>My sweater became brand new.   </li>
            <li>A must have for every household...makes your pilling clothes look brand new again.</li>
            <li>My sweaters look new.  </li>
            <li>Everything looks like new, like when I saw it on the hanger in the shop.  </li>
            <li>Made my son  hoodie  brand new  </li>
            <li>It makes aging clothes look brand new.</li>
            <li>Had to go to bed bath and beyond to get a new one</li>
            <li>Makes them look like new again.</li>
            <li>I put in new batteries and still doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>But will this make your sweaters look brand new?  </li>
            <li>So before deciding to just sell it and buy a new couch, we tried this thing.  </li>
            <li>Everything is now brand new.</li>
            <li>but it did not look brand new.</li>
            <li>but this fabric shave just made all of them look brand new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve saved close to $1000 because I didn&#x27;t have to go out and buy new wool sweaters.</li>
            <li>using this cloths are  looking new .</li>
            <li>Now it looks brand new</li>
            <li>It takes off pills/lint with ease, making my sweaters and shirts look like new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve managed to revive sweaters pajamas gloves and not had to purchase new ones.</li>

            <li>The screen is flexible from brand new</li>
            <li>Keeps cloths looking new.</li>
            <li>--means I don&#x27;t have to buy new ones or get rid of the ones I have.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, when the kiddos outgrow clothing, I can make some items look new again if they&#x27;re not stained or otherwise damaged.</li>
            <li>Helps keep all my sweaters and tops looking brand new by shaving off fabric pills.</li>

            <li>I was amazed at how new my sweaters look again.  </li>

            <li>and it makes our clothing look almost like new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a new fabric shaver now.</li>
            <li>Makes stuff look like new and doesn&#x27;t ruin the fabric.</li>
            <li>my couch looks new again.  </li>
            <li>This is made my sweaters just like new.</li>
            <li>Made my socks look new.</li>
            <li>The clothing that I used the shaver on looks brand new.  </li>
            <li>I put brand new batteries in to it</li>
            <li>Makes my clothes look like new.</li>
            <li>It returns shaved fabrics to as new condition.</li>
            <li>And while this is a very effective fuzzbuster (blew my drugstore one out of the water), it has some major flaws that have sent me looking for a replacement, namely:  - The holes in the cap are too big, making this a danger to delicate (and even not-so-delicate) fabrics.</li>
            <li>It took a little while to get it clean, but the difference was night and day!  </li>
            <li>My sweater jacket is completely de-pilled and looks new again!</li>
            <li>It made my old sweaters look like new!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that has old clothes that you want to make look brand new!</li>
            <li>Makes old sweaters like new!</li>
            <li>I then tried it on some old t-shirts and again, they looked like new!</li>
            <li>makes a old fuzzy looking shirt looks new again!</li>
            <li>This made my old hoodies that got fuzz balls on it look like new!</li>
            <li>It made old items look new again!</li>
            <li>Turns my old clothes new again!</li>
            <li>I used this on my old cable knit Ugg boots that had gotten fuzzy and they look brand new!</li>
            <li>You can hear the unit pick up all the annoying pills, what a great sound.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really bummed, the coat isn&#x27;t totally ruined but I feel like it won&#x27;t get as much use</li>
            <li>I have an older suit that had developed some fuzz in some areas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragile, sensitive, but powerful.</li>
            <li>The only ones available at local retailers are about twice the price.  </li>
            <li>I will say that cable knits &amp; chunkier/open-weave designs are trickier because it&#x27;s more likely that you&#x27;ll accidentally shave off a piece of yarn instead of a pill.</li>
            <li>I had no similar experiences, and I believe if you take care to exercise common sense when using this (ie., pulling cloth taut, type of material upon which you choose to use it, not treating it like a hedge trimmer and hacking at the garment) you, too, will not suffer any damage from using this on your good</li>
            <li>For delicate fabrics you have to be more gentle.</li>
            <li>The flaw I find in this is that I find my self spending forever, working on one top, stopping several times to empty it.</li>
            <li>i have used it a few times and it is powerful and useful.</li>
            <li>I love this little thing!</li>
            <li>I love this little thing!</li>
            <li>Love this little thing!</li>
            <li>I love this little thing!  </li>
            <li>I really love this little fabric shaver!  </li>
            <li>Love it a little!</li>
            <li>Also, see the other reviews about it catching on a loose thread or bunched up fabric and tearing holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the look of the RTFS-2 more than the RTFS-100, and I believe it&#x27;ll be more efficient for use in my car as it doesn&#x27;t have a handle that will make tight spots hard to reach.  </li>
            <li>once tried to vacuum the fluff out from the top since it gets stuck in there... sucked that blade right out and into the vacuum hose!!!  </li>
            <li>I did try it on an inconspicuous spot first, and it seemed fine, but it unfortunately made a hole right at the front of my sweater!</li>
            <li>Unless those bed fabrics are torn or very old, there should no need to throw them away.</li>
            <li>They were very surprised.</li>
            <li>but while using it the first time the cheaply made guard on the top broke and now the entire product is useless.</li>
            <li>Also a good amount of power.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  If you use the unit face down (blade down), the balls that get shaved (gigidy) get caught/clogged in the &amp;#34;trap&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It does the job decently, just be sure to empty it frequently to not clog up the blades.</li>
            <li>Same exact operation with a sleek new body.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good, even though it&#x27;s a small device with relatively little power</li>
            <li>this might tear my clothes or not do the job, however i have had this for a few weeks now, and from the moment i slapped in the batteries i am beyond pleased with this mighty little shaver.</li>
            <li>Had a top that was washed in other material such as new towels</li>
            <li>It works very well, and small that easy to carry for traveling.</li>
            <li>Wow, I&#x27;m usually a woman of many words, but I don&#x27;t have much to say about this fabulous little fabric shaver.  </li>
            <li>It works well, hasn&#x27;t destroyed any clothing, and has brought several sweaters back into rotation since they look so much better after a quick shave (a few pairs of socks, too!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>This product really restored my older sweaters back to new again.  </li>
            <li>That can make a pretty big difference.   </li>
            <li>Anyhow, what used to be a painful chore that I only did for my most beloved items of clothing has now become a piece of cake.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been working on, but it has managed to remove a small portion of the top layer of skin on a finger.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this thing out, it ripped a tiny hole in my sweater.</li>
            <li>As far as shaving A+!</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I was excited to try this product to see what it could do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only giving this 3 stars because it stopped so many times due to the blades getting stuck every time</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>My sweaters look exactly the same as they did before I tried this razor.</li>
            <li>I use this very often to keep my pants, sweaters, jackets, and other clothes looking fresh.  </li>
            <li>Pretty basic fabric shaver, does what you need it to do.</li>
            <li>Only did one knit blazer so fat and it seems to work pretty well...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for small jobs.  </li>
            <li>My wife uses it on many different tops &amp; other clothing that get fuzzes.</li>
            <li>This worked okay, but it seems like it needed to be a little bigger and needed a little more power.  </li>
            <li>I first tried using this item on a wool cardigan that had a moderate amout of pilling.  </li>
            <li>Used it on a light tee and sure enough I got a small hole it the shirt where it wasn&#x27;t laying flat.</li>
            <li>chose to buy this, even after reading some of the more negative reviews, because I figured its low price tag was worth the risk.</li>
            <li>Over time something starts to look old and pill-y, I just run this over it and viola!  </li>
            <li>Now two of my favorite tops have a small hole..</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It may be early, but I am hooked!</li>
            <li>there are no problems so far!</li>
            <li>For the money, wow!</li>
            <li>ok for small jobs.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if available now!</li>
            <li>one of the blades came off after first use, didn&#x27;t work properly</li>
            <li>THAN THAT ITS CUTE, SMALL AND WORKS!!!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT</li>
            <li>I bought this a while ago and is still works the same as the first day I got it in the mail.</li>
            <li>This device has a couple small flaws, but once you get used to them you seem to be able to deal with them</li>
            <li>Used it on a old winter jacket and what a difference!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be able to get stuff off your clothes every other shaver you&#x27;ve had left on.  </li>
            <li>very nice, a little smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li>It easily &#x27;shaves&#x27; away little &#x27;balls&#x27; that form on sweaters, shirts and pants.</li>
            <li>Does not pull or snag just goes easily over fabric and takes all the unwanted material and puts in a little holder</li>
            <li>it will only renew your stuff to a certain extent and its made out of cheap plastic like all the other under $10 tools you can buy.</li>
            <li>I wish it was just a bit bigger (especially the container) and easier to clean.</li>
            <li>simple to use and simple to clean out.</li>
            <li>I mean, for the amount of lint I had to remove, I would say I needed one that was bigger and more powerful.  </li>
            <li>Only tip, if fabric super fluffy (like a plush sweater), make sure to use on a flat surface and keep fabric taunt while using.</li>
            <li>I searched online till I found the exact Remington shaver I lost, and it was well worth paying a little shipping to get it here.  </li>
            <li>but the little holder fills up really fast and needs to be emptied when it&#x27;s about 3/4 full.  </li>
            <li>I have looked long and hard to find a good one.</li>
            <li>Made a couple of my old and well used pants look brand new again.</li>
            <li>It made all of my old clothes look brand new .</li>
            <li>This product does wonders in the way that it makes an old sweater look new.</li>
            <li>Also my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s blanket looks new again.</li>
            <li>Used this to remove thousands of pills on a relatively new soft shell (like neoprene) workout jacket.  </li>
            <li>This Remington Fabric Shaver won&#x27;t remove the lint as well on an old sweater as it would on a brand new pair of jeans.  </li>
            <li>It saved me lots of $ buying new sweaters and allowed me keep my old favorites.</li>
            <li>I am busy shaving the fuzz balls off my sweater and fleece, now they look like new.</li>
            <li>My couches were not even a year old and now they look new again.</li>
            <li>It takes old, fuzzy material and makes it look brand new again.  </li>
            <li>The end result, though, was an old pilly sweater looking like it was almost new.  </li>
            <li>Turned an old zip up jacket into feeling like brand new.</li>
            <li>Makes old clothes brand new again.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a shaver that I had bought back in the early eighties that still worked beautifully but needed new blades which I was unable to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this was a product that I was not sure of, but it was great,  Saved quite a few sweater, not to mention leggings.  </li>
            <li>Pills are trapped in the removable compartment and easily disposed.</li>
            <li>This item clogs easily a ended up breaking (the blades bent) just after a few uses.  </li>
            <li>most of the lint you gather doesn&#x27;t go fully into its small storage container though, it gets lodged near the blade section i used a toothpick to remove it</li>
            <li>and it did it quickly with minimal passes.</li>
            <li>this just takes too much time, you have to be careful what fabric you use it on, and it doesn&#x27;t remove that much!</li>
            <li>just wish i knew it was small when i ordered it - i&#x27;d of liked a bit bigger size.  </li>
            <li>I have \\&quot;shaved\\&quot; my favorite dark red sweater</li>
            <li>It works very well and removes pills, lint, and those tiny bits of leaves or whatever that children get embedded in their sweaters that refuse to come out during the normal wash cycle.</li>
            <li>but since it covers a small surface, it takes more time to complete the task.</li>
            <li>It does look nice and seems to have enough power, but the holes in the screen are too small to allow in all of the sweater pills</li>
            <li>(2) if you aren&#x27;t careful, this will quickly rip a hole in your cashmere sweater.  </li>
            <li>but I strongly recommend practicing on an item that you won&#x27;t be upset if you chop a few holes in it.  </li>
            <li>This little machine tends to get clogged up with sweater fuzz rather quickly and doesn&#x27;t seem to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; the nubbins off very well.</li>
            <li>Against my worry, this little thing works just fine.  </li>
            <li>THEN it worked fine, although my ego was a little sore...</li>
            <li>I tried shaking the shaver every so often, to try to get the lint to fall into the reservoir, with limited success.  </li>
            <li>I was afraid that the razors might cut holes in my favorite sweaters - if you&#x27;re scared at first, I&#x27;d recommend that you try it on an older sweater or a pair of socks/gloves first.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well, but needed emptying a little sooner than I&#x27;d have liked (could only do one sweater before having to empty it).</li>
            <li>In the past ive purchased these (fabric shavers) for much cheaper &amp; they actually worked alot better.</li>
            <li>I used it to smooth out some \\&quot;pills\\&quot; on a few collared shirts&#x27; collar areas, and it made the shirts look like new again.</li>
            <li>It is noisier than one I&#x27;ve tried from another brand which is why I only gave it four stars, but it is efficient at removing lint and it&#x27;s easy to empty the reserve.</li>
            <li>Make sure you test it on a less noticeable part of your sweater/shirt before you go ahead and shave the entire piece of clothing.</li>
            <li>The chamber that catches the pills fills up quickly, it is easy enough to empty.</li>
            <li>Does not work so well on the large fuzz balls on hand knitted items that are done with large yarn.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little while to go over large areas, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>For less than ten bucks I just revitalized all my favorite sweaters and even some old jackets.</li>
            <li>thing to note is that it will not pick up any hair or loose particles unless it&#x27;s stuck to the fabric and is small/rounded enough to fit into the shaving head area.</li>
            <li>the only problem is that if you gonna use it on something large  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy that actually bought this for all my dozen plus pairs of smart wool socks that are all pilled up.  </li>
            <li>The On/Off switch moves from On to Off, but this seems to be purely for my entertainment because it never actually shuts the motor.</li>
            <li>If you are looking into shaving large fuzzies, then you might need to look/consider a larger shaver since this one is a compact/travel size.</li>
            <li>This little guy is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I did break one because a piece of thread got into it and tangled inside the blades, breaking the smooth metal surface with the little holes, so it wouldn&#x27;t slide on the fabric because the metal bent and would get caught on the fabric.</li>
            <li>Bought this to remove little \\&quot;fuzzballs\\&quot; that built up on the fabric of my couch, and it does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>This little gadget is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It was fine, but more awkward to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with this little shaver, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Bigger and better in getting rid of the pills that form on some clothes than the little ones  that seem to appear on store shelves just before Christmas.</li>
            <li>THIS SIMPLE LITTLE TOOL CAN MAKE THE MOST PILLED UP</li>
            <li>Love it, this little power machine does wonders only all fabrics.</li>
            <li>and I guess I went over this one spot too hard or too many times.</li>
            <li>Seems like a good little clothes shaver, although I did try it on a few of my thinner shirts and ended up getting holes in them.</li>
            <li>I actually like the way the shaver works in that the blades seem sharp and the motor is strong.  </li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t careful or push too hard, there&#x27;s a good chance you&#x27;re going to cut the fabric itself.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed bringin the \\&quot;new look\\&quot; back to some well-loved sweaters with this little tool which (when used with care!)effectively removes all pill and fuzz!</li>
            <li>does an almost perfect job in every case with only one exception for me when one of my shirts was badly scuffed by a zipline harness I was wearing&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its not that good, its not that bad, its really for very superficial parts.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced it cutting holes in my clothes as others did.  </li>
            <li>the clear container falls off a lot while using it.  </li>
            <li>So the fuzz ends up getting stuck in the blade area, and you have to remove the cap, remove the blades, and clear it out.</li>
            <li>so it requires cleaning before the (clear) body of the shaver even has anything.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ve made it clear</li>
            <li>The blade moves a lot quicker than I expected and it has more power than I expected.</li>
            <li>The clear lint &#x60;reservoir can slip off when your moving around</li>
            <li>You can see clearly in the picture the before and after of the ottoman.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only experienced one hole and that&#x27;s because I was using it carelessly, holding the shirt in my hand.</li>
            <li>fuzz tends to clog up between rotary blades and clear container - have to stop frequently to clear out the blockage</li>
            <li>Being from an old Italian family, the lint balls (or pellini) as we call they really bug us.</li>
            <li>It seems to get fuzz clogged in the area under the blades, preventing some of the fuzz from getting into the clear &amp;#34;waste&amp;#34; container.</li>
            <li>i realised that the head and a clear plastic cap on it&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>TAKE THE CLEAR CAP OF first\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to clear this area with a bent paper clip a couple of times.  </li>
            <li>The clear cover on this is where the shaved fabric ends up</li>
            <li>The clear part fell off immediately and chipped one end before I even got to turn it on.</li>
            <li>I have a whole list of sweaters and things lined up for shaving but with this tiny thing, it will take me eons to complete them all.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t use this frequently</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t use this frequently</li>
            <li>holes, no dead batteries, no hassle cleaning.</li>
            <li>I like , like, like this product so much that I would give it ten stars.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t gotten clogged or had any issues.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed with this product and will be looking for a different model.</li>
            <li>My 11 yr old insists on being the one to use it for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 10 month old&#x27;s pants...</li>
            <li>I now have at least one more season&#x27;s wear out of all three sweaters.</li>
            <li>I told them it was 8 or 9 years old.</li>
            <li>on my delicate sweaters it snags the fabric just by touching it to the sweater.  </li>
            <li>At this price I could buy four of these at the cost I paid for the old one&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This item has to be emptied out quite frequently</li>
            <li>The link does sometimes get stuck near the blade.  </li>
            <li>All fixed and shaving away now.</li>
            <li>It will make your old clothes look a bit newer.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace an old one and went with the reviews on here.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too loud and works like a charm.  </li>
            <li>The real problems with it are that it pulverizes what it removes and then you&#x27;re left with removing that from whatever your fabric has been resting on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this on two cotton tees, two North Face hoodies and my North Face Denali jacket so far.  </li>
            <li>It did take the pills off my old cardigan.</li>
            <li>They had developed a mass of fuzz and bobbles thru washing.</li>
            <li>If you want to get lint or hair off of your clothes I&#x27;d advice going with the old fashioned lint brush....</li>
            <li>Most of the lint does not fall into the reservoir, but gets trapped under the blades, so then I have to open the cover, remove the blades and manually clear out the lint.  </li>
            <li>You really have to go over spots several times to get all the fuzzies off.</li>
            <li>I went over to my brother&#x27;s house to raid his closet for old sweaters and shirts.</li>
            <li>The reservoir doesn&#x27;t really work as intended and the cover constantly slides off no matter how I hold the device.</li>
            <li>It shaves a lot faster, and closer, than the old one did.</li>
            <li>So far, all three of us have no complaints.  </li>
            <li>This Remington Battery Operated Fabric Shaver really works well especially on cashmere.  </li>
            <li>Took care of some old sheets that were pilling up.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Gentle even on my most delicate sweaters.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>product does what it says and this really should be an essential tool in everyone&#x27;s closet.</li>
            <li>I bought this to rescue an old tee shirt dress that was covered in fuzz and pills...</li>
            <li>AS FAR AS REMOVING THE FUZZIES,I HAVE TO GO OVER THE AREA</li>
            <li>and it fixed them.  </li>
            <li>transformed my old sweaters</li>
            <li>It took the pills off in one swipe and did not destroy or even at all do any damage to the pants themself.</li>
            <li>It definitely didn&#x27;t return sweaters to like-new condition, but it really did improve the appearance with a bit of babying it around.  </li>
            <li>Works very well on fleece, doesn&#x27;t work at all on heavier fabrics like wool with larger pils.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used it on a handful of more delicate fabrics as well and never had any issues at all.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is that the lint it collects doesn&#x27;t really go into the collector</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d wait until she was asleep on her dog bed and turn it on near her legs.  </li>
            <li>I fished out old sweaters and pajama pants just to use this on them.  </li>
            <li>The plastic cover that holds the lint in falls off frequently.  </li>
            <li>I def felt like an old man purchasing one of these</li>
            <li>&amp; you got a piece of clothing that looks old because of fuzzes</li>
            <li>So far, it has not made a hole and the batteries have lasted.</li>
            <li>Used it on both light and heavy material.</li>
            <li>My old roomate kept playng with it with the cage off and eventually broke it</li>
            <li>My old one wore out</li>
            <li>things which are pretty minor considering the price.</li>
            <li>It broke the day I got it after 2 minutes of use and is now completely unuseable.</li>
            <li>keep that in mind if you will be using this for adult clothing.</li>
            <li>(it filled up after 1 heavy wool sweater with lots of pilling, and again after 2 fine-gauge cashmere sweaters).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it out on old pants, even a pair of underwear that had pilled in the dryer.</li>
            <li>It also has a separate compartment to collect and dispose of the lint unlike the old ones which you just opened up and it fell out.  </li>
            <li>You might be surprised at the things you&#x27;ll use this on.</li>
            <li>At least I remember these working much better.</li>
            <li>The fabric shaver was affordable and spruced up his old sweaters.</li>
            <li>but they just don&#x27;t work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>However, be warned that it will frequently and unexpectedly put holes in your clothes.</li>
            <li>and I feel that it was in much the same condition after the batteries died than it was before I</li>
            <li>The key is to use it when your clothes are hanging and not to stretch the fabric too much while using it.</li>
            <li>It does not do nearly as well by comparison.  </li>
            <li>This one works just as well as the old</li>
            <li>Thanks, totally recommend this seller.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised it took off all the &amp;#34;fabric balls&amp;#34</li>
            <li>In many of the reviews I read complained of holes being made in the garments, that was not the case for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller than I expected but very usable as is -- you should just empty the fuzz collector more often.  </li>
            <li>So far i used it on a sweatshirt and a pair of leggings that i was embarassed to wear because of all the pills on them.</li>
            <li>Best use for medium to small size lint (small as in a pencil dot and big as in a big size ant.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have problem following the directions, and haven&#x27;t run into much issues.</li>
            <li>and it died completely.  </li>
            <li>but it seems to be doing the trick thus far</li>
            <li>Now I regret tossing my old sweaters.</li>
            <li>but after just a few uses I lost one of the shaving blades and found out on the remington website that this item is discontinued and spare parts are no  longer available.</li>
            <li>I used to have a much larger type of fabric shaver that worked very well.</li>
            <li>I had a larger version of this shaver, but it did not work very well.</li>
            <li>So far I have done two of his jackets, three of mine and my sons jacket.</li>
            <li>The shaving head developed a hole and the device would not work.  </li>
            <li>I have not had any issues with shaving too far and damaging my sweaters.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried it on more delicate pieces tho.</li>
            <li>Product works well, however, the cover both where the fabric being pilled comes into the machine and the battery door slides off quite frequently while in use.</li>
            <li>So just be cautious if you choose to use it on more delicate fabrics.  </li>
            <li>I recently bought a couple nice sweaters that were part polyester, and after a few washes starting pilling!</li>
            <li>Too cheap to return, so a complete waste of money/effort.</li>
            <li>I tried putting a fresh pair of batteries in several times and I kept getting the same result.</li>
            <li>kind of small so for an average sized person it takes a long time to work on a full sweater or shirt or pair of pants.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think it has enough power, but this only 10 bucks so worth it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quite powerful, stronger than I expected.</li>
            <li>Of course doing a whole couch will require quite a few batteries, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Have been able to get a few sweaters back in to shape using this.</li>
            <li>I have had a few different shavers over the years, but this one works better than all the others.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit of a pain to clear the fluff out but not so much it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>If you use this on fairly thick clothing it works ok.</li>
            <li>then but I would try again more slowly and it would get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy this because most people loved it and some people hated it because it ruined clothing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the fastest process, but it is not terrible slow either (and again - I had a lot of pills).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Great compact fabric shaver, but as another user pointed out, this unit is WAY TOO POWERFUL for light and thin fabric</li>
            <li>It does its job slowly but surely.</li>
            <li>Helps to keep clothes looking new and while cheap should last long enough to pay for itself.</li>
            <li>Small and light weight, fits easily in the hand, have used it so far on a few articles of clothing, works as advertised.</li>
            <li>I have to clean up a mess of lint after using it.</li>
            <li>Long story short, I ended up in the emergency room where a nice doctor lady attempted to detach the (now ruined) shaver from my crotch while a half dozen nurses stood around laughing at me.  </li>
            <li>Your sweaters may still be a little pilly but the pills will be more flat.</li>
            <li>- light enough to carry in your travel bag to use when needed - does an almost perfect job in every case with only one exception for me when one of my shirts was badly scuffed by a zipline harness I was wearing - cleaning out the shaved fabrics is pretty straight forward and not too messy if you&#x27;re careful  </li>
            <li>This item would be 5/5 stars if the air was strong enough to circulate and \\&quot;force\\&quot; the fuzzies down into the clear pocket.</li>
            <li>and I even had a little fun going over the fabric and getting rid of those pills!  </li>
            <li>I love having this thing around, no more ruined clothes!</li>
            <li>Its small and compact and easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li>Small form makes it easy to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li>I have small hand and this is easy to hold on to.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this useful little tool.</li>
            <li>I did have to empty the catcher a lot and clean out the internal blades periodically</li>
            <li>Does a decent job, not great but can&#x27;t find one better  for sofa pill balls</li>
            <li>I guess she is aware of what this little thing is capable of.</li>
            <li>The shaver is pretty gentle, a little noisy.</li>
            <li>But it was so inexpensive as long as it lasts a little while I will be OK.</li>
            <li>has a tendency to get caught up in the material if your moving too fast or your clothing isnt totally flat while using it.</li>
            <li>save your clothes and make them look sharp again for a $6 investment... totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>My 7 year old also has a high end, name brand hoodie made out of the same fabric.</li>
            <li>awesome little lint shaver that quick shaves all those annoying lent on your socks.</li>
            <li>after two years and countless washes, it looks like new!</li>
            <li>It left my clothes looking new and my sneakers as if I hadnt worn them!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and does the job, but as with all shavers, you have to be very careful with the pressure</li>
            <li>i own several other types of fabric shavers, this one is just not special at all, to be used on very fine (small) piles only.</li>
            <li>It was both ridiculous and entertaining.</li>
            <li>Does require unscrewing the head ever few minutes to clean out under the blades</li>
            <li>Is small, but that worked fine for me.</li>
            <li>I use the fabric shaver to &amp;#34;depill&amp;#34; the occasional sweater, but mainly on socks.</li>
            <li>Works well and does a decent job of removing piling from sweaters and such.</li>
            <li>I wish Remington would go back to the older L shape design.</li>
            <li>it on a couple of older sweaters with same success.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, I travel for work and I love that it&#x27;s small enough to take with me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still on my original set of batteries and have done probably 20 or so sweaters, along with various other items.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent enough that I wrote a review about it.</li>
            <li>The only concern I have is that the shaver drained the batteries so fast that at the end of the sweater the blade was barely spinning.</li>
            <li>Second, the lint catcher/holder comes off a little too easily when being handled.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this, because I remembered a generic version of one of these I bought years ago, and it was a hunk of junk.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This little guy is light, easy to hold, about half the cost of the last clothes shaver I bought, and actually does what it&#x27;s advertised!  </li>
            <li>I have new sweaters, which I&#x27;ve only worn a couple of times, that have developed fuzz balls and I wouldn&#x27;t wear them because of it.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the few minutes it takes to make your sweater look new again.</li>
            <li>It takes off little strings that are hanging loose on clothing and even the pulls my cat made from &amp;#34;marching&amp;#34; on my favorite teddy bear.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it for very long, but so far it has really cleaned up my sweaters</li>
            <li>only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that fuzz builds up rather quickly around the blades, so you have to keep an eye on that and empty it out.</li>
            <li>Just be careful on a thin shirt with piling- tore a whole right in a light T-shirt.</li>
            <li>works very well and does the job, however, I waited a long time  for it tob e delivered</li>
            <li>The blades act as a fan and fans the lint balls into the collection chamber but if there is too much in the collection chamber or a long thread is tangled in the blades, they will stop rotating.  </li>
            <li>All the piling on each sweater usually on the sleeves and collar are now smooth.</li>
            <li>Although you have to be careful with light fabrics because it can open big holes</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t take long to do a shirt though.</li>
            <li>This shaver is small, cheap, and does the job.  </li>
            <li>It is small but mighty.</li>
            <li>No good for sweaters that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>also i think it&#x27;s kinda convenient since it&#x27;s small and could fit it into my hand or bag to take anywhere and</li>
            <li>Small and mighty shaver.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty powerful for such a small machine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had sweater shavers in the past that have worked fabulously.</li>
            <li>This worked perfectly on my long fiber, fuzzy sweaters--not so much on the shorter fiber ones (sulphur stone for those).</li>
            <li>So cheap, afraid to use it on expensive clothes, worked perfect.</li>
            <li>I used it on all kind of clothes and fabrics, even on my hosiery, just be careful with thin and gentle things.  </li>
            <li>It just seems that it was made to fit to show all pretty in the package, but once it&#x27;s been jimmied open, it&#x27;s just misshapen enough to not fit back where it should</li>
            <li>It was not expensive and worked as expected.</li>
            <li>It works like a charm and in my opinion, pays for itself after you empty the pill-filled reservoir for the first time.</li>
            <li>The Remington Fabric Shaver was exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>This really works on our soft fabric removing all the loose fibers and pills from wear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Considering it&#x27;s mainly the more delicate clothing that I have that pills, this will get limited use.</li>
            <li>The other concern is that the fuzz seems to gather around the top and not &#x27;go down&#x27; into the collector.</li>
            <li>This little tool quickly removes anything on the surface of any fabric without damaging the fabric in any way.</li>
            <li>The shaver did a super job removing the little knots and fuzzies from my sweaters.  </li>
            <li>Small but very powerful, does exactly what&#x27;s expected</li>
            <li>The only inconvenience is the the little plastic cover tends to pop off on its own, but it&#x27;s only a minor issue.</li>
            <li>What did result though was an extremely smooth and soft fabric (and I mean baby soft).</li>
            <li>Works just as expected (and maybe even a little better, considering the price).  </li>
            <li>I never figured this cheap little lint shaver would last</li>
            <li>The debris chamber and blades get jammed by lint a little more often than I&#x27;d like, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>and I feel I&#x27;ve already made my &#x27;money back&#x27; by virtue of all the bobbly (now almost brand new looking) woolen jumpers I was about to throw away.    </li>
            <li>The outside looks like new again and the inside is no longer scratchy.  </li>
            <li>Used twice, new batteries, tried to use 2 weeks later and wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li>Your sweaters will look ALMOST like new, but not quiet.</li>
            <li>I bought it to remove lint off some hoodies and sweatpants and it brought my clothes back to life and made them look practically new.</li>
            <li>Be sure to be very careful or you&#x27;ll break the clear waste fabric holding compartment.</li>
            <li>All of the reviewers who complained of how easy the battery cover and shaving collector fall off were 100% correct.</li>
            <li>I had a different but very similar product which didn&#x27;t really get the job done.</li>
            <li>(For those you really do need a larger sized machine with larger holes.)</li>
            <li>I purchased this fabric shaver a month or so ago, and am only surprised it hasn&#x27;t yet run out of batteries, we use it so frequently.  </li>
            <li>This is a really neat and portable tool, but sometimes (especially on socks)it catches a semi-loose thread and creates an even bigger hole.</li>
            <li>it is rude,not sophisticated, outside look like rude.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super powerful.  </li>
            <li>Takes 2 AA batteries which last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a breeze to empty the lint cup or take the cap off the blades and take the blades out once in a while to really get all the lint completely out.  </li>
            <li>This thing is cool fixes my nasty pilled sweater and made it beautiful again</li>
            <li>The first time I used this little power house, my hat looked brand new, like I have brought it from a store or something.</li>
            <li>This little guy does the trick to clear that right up.</li>
            <li>I recommend a larger version of this product if you plan to use it frequently, but otherwise I would buy again even if the one I have breaks!</li>
            <li>I have gifted this for little &amp;#34;happies&amp;#34; to other family member or as stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>I had some cashmere sleep socks that had gotten some major fuzz on them after a year of use.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop bringing back to life old sweaters!</li>
            <li>No other product will make your old clothes look new, but this little fabric shaver can make it look so much nicer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, powerful, and now the sweaters look almost new.</li>
            <li>I have used the same method (flat surface like thr top of the dryer and stretched the fabric a litte) on other clothes.</li>
            <li>This thing is not for all types of material, but will do many if not most common materials with the right touch.</li>
            <li>It took a while, because I needed the warnings about going too fast and cutting fabric, but the coat, which is a combination of black wool body with knitted sleeves, looks great.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product but after only a month and a half it kept getting jammed then</li>
            <li>Granted, something big and bulky like these long sweaters takes a considerable amount of time to completely go over, but it was either that or buy something new.</li>
            <li>Just make certain, while using it to continually empty out the fuzz that collects.  </li>
            <li>, it is relative quiet and very efficient, a small size that you can throw into a suitcase and quickly use anywhere.  </li>
            <li>Needed a new one and this absolutely works just as well as my previous one.  </li>
            <li>Shaves the little white balls right off!</li>
            <li>What a powerful, little fabric shaver and</li>
            <li>At my first use, it slowed down after few minutes and my first though was:the batteries are new,</li>
            <li>It is a very slow and challenging process removing pills from sweaters with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cover on the compartment that collects the lint is hard to fit</li>
            <li>Too light and dull.</li>
            <li>; usually doesnt make it into the special compartment its supposed to.  </li>
            <li>Even large &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; and threads are left after going over the same area multiple times.</li>
            <li>saved so many outfits now with this little machine, batteries seems to last a long time (using regular coppertop).  </li>
            <li>I love this little gadget, it got all those little fuzz balls off and left my clothes looking new,</li>
            <li>The shaver runs on AA batteries and the shaved pilling ends up in the clear blue compartment.  </li>
            <li>Not a good product the bigger one is better.</li>
            <li>However, the small size is very convenient for traveling and I do think it works very well for its purpose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was skeptical at first but after multiple uses and on bigger fabrics with more fuzzballs, I was amazed</li>
            <li>So I took a gamble and ordered the Remington one from the American Amazon site, resulting in having to pay as much for the delivery as for the product (i.e. double the quoted price in total).    </li>
            <li>My old reliable one was the same shape as the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>So, after purchasing two (one for a back up), they work as well as I remember my old one working.  </li>
            <li>and I can see in the near future</li>
            <li>It stopped working for a second, but I promptly turned it off and fixed the problem.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;P.S. Be careful how much pressure you apply to your clothing/fabric.</li>
            <li>They are more tedious to use than this product but at least you can be sure it won&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li>and it only survived through one complete sale.</li>
            <li>It barely does anything.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nearly invisible and has made me think on several occasions that it isn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li>For example, I bought my 7 year old several pairs of store brand athletic pants made of 100% polyester.</li>
            <li>I was careful to not apply too much pressure.  </li>
            <li>I have a larger clothes shaver that does not work nearly so well as this item.</li>
            <li>It will make holes in your knits if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m using it, I just barely let it touch the surface of the fabric.</li>
            <li>Only used it once so far</li>
            <li>I ordered this to replace an old sweater shaver I had that finally just gave out.</li>
            <li>Apparently the spinning blades cut a piece of the metal grill, which distorted the grill and the blades couldn&#x27;t spin anymore.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an old one that had died after several years.</li>
            <li>The battery door and lint trap door barely stays clipped on however.</li>
            <li>Barely took any fuzz off items.</li>
            <li>Barely worked from the start, then stopped barely working after about 10 minutes of use.</li>
            <li>After using the shaver on several items without incident, I decided to grab an old sock and see if I could make this unit eat a hole through the material (as some reviews state).</li>
            <li>Handle carefully so as not to break it.</li>
            <li>Barely works at removing lint, the motor keeps turning off when its trying to remove lint.</li>
            <li>We had an earlier model that my wife used for years, then an old battery leaked and destroyed it.</li>
            <li>Beware though, if you&#x27;re not careful you can shave holes into some of your thinner shirts.</li>
            <li>- you barely need to touch it</li>
            <li>I did let the collection bin get too full and got a small fuzzball stuck in the blades.  </li>
            <li>but I advise not to try on thin fabrics - unless you like Wear clothes with holes,,,, :)</li>
            <li>I was able to shave one sweater with it, but using it became so frustrating, I eventually just gave up and threw it away.</li>
            <li>Top was broken when I received.  </li>
            <li>Go slow and it will nab any fuzzballs that fit in the screen holes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my super expensive Victoria&#x27;s Secret bras that always seem to snag or collect little fuzzballs on the material.</li>
            <li>Had those fuzzies on some pants/bed spread, used this on it and the little things came right off.  </li>
            <li>Be careful not to push down too much on light fabrics though.</li>
            <li>You need to be a little careful when using it, making sure whatever you are using it on it perfectly flat</li>
            <li>It is very powerful for such a small device.</li>
            <li>Had a new, yellow fleece shirt that was accidentally washed with a towel and literally spotted all over with red fuzz.</li>
            <li>The shaver face is large so that is helpful and the blades seem sharp.</li>
            <li>Some previous reviewers noted that it ripped a hole in their clothes - I think that if you follow the directions (do not push down but rather just stroke the device back and forth, and make sure to not use on pulls in the fabric), there shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.</li>
            <li>After reading other reviews, I was wary of using this product, but given Amazon&#x27;s great return policy &amp; the low price, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>although it took a long time, it is like a brand new couch.  </li>
            <li>and it was a new hoodie; I&#x27;m not surprised.  </li>
            <li>Quickly removes small nubs from fleece.  </li>
            <li>As a result some get overly aggressive shave, some are lucky to get it just right, and others fail to see any results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found it worked really well on an old sweater that needed the little balls of fuzz removed.  </li>
            <li>In my extreme case, the harness I was wearing for my zipline adventure just caused way too much damage.</li>
            <li>Also, if the fabric is really lightweight be careful!</li>
            <li>It saved a sweater for me that I was ready to get rid of due to severe pilling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very small, so fit in my suitcase or purse</li>
            <li>cleaning out the shaved fabrics is pretty straight forward and not too messy if you&#x27;re careful</li>
            <li>This fun little gadget is definitely not meant for thinner materials.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m driving my roommates mad bragging about how good it is and using it on every fabric I can find.</li>
            <li>Also I did notice that it is much less prone to accidental garment nicks than the other brand which is definitely a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>It dramatically improves the looks of most any fabric but just be careful not to press too hard.  </li>
            <li>I know it wasn&#x27;t because of too much pressure on my part because I&#x27;m very careful with it.  </li>
            <li>And if I now take them to the dry cleaners, they will look like new.</li>
            <li>Have not tried it on delicates so might be extra gentle on them.only one problem is that you have to empty it out often.....</li>
            <li>Actually my wife bought it for her dress and wool sweater that are old enough for need one like this.</li>
            <li>while others noted that it barely makes a dent in the fuzz (mine apparently is in the second category), I imagine that all units of this product vary in blade placement which lacks precision.</li>
            <li>Works really well for it&#x27;s size, though you have to be careful not to get fabric caught in it because it&#x27;ll make tiny pin holes in everything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to look for a different product in the near future.</li>
            <li>Works like a charm -- de-pilled a nice expensive wool sweater with ease and for a very low cost.</li>
            <li>; because if you don&#x27;t mind the extra fuss, the results are worth the trouble.</li>
            <li>I did have to work at it slowly and patiently and made sure to empty any fuzz build up in the shaver.</li>
            <li>This is one seriously powerful little fabric shaver!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The process is naturally time consuming as the foil is only about an inch wide, but it worked a treat with only a few swipes back and forth over each area on cotton garments and even successfully on a Metalicus wrap (made out of pantyhose-like material) - even on this delicate material I didn&#x27;t have issues with the fabric being snagged or damaged.  </li>
            <li>I bought this little shaver and it did exactly what I wanted it too.</li>
            <li>This little device does exactly what it should, and quite effectively.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only have 2 major complaints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also a little piece of the plastic on the lint holder broke off the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Firstly, both the battery compartment lid and the little lint storage compartment keep sliding off the body of the shaver.  </li>
            <li>Keep your delicate fine weave sweaters flat.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come back to re-write my review because although my first experience with this product was very disappointing, I have since been very satisfied.</li>
            <li>batteries last a long time - and this little shave does a good job despite its small size!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small on the go device that really shaves your clothes and makes it look brand new.</li>
            <li>It works,  but not super powerful,  takes a really long time to achieve desired effect.</li>
            <li>As long as your not dumb and dont try and use it on expensive delicate fabric its great</li>
            <li>It will get a little bogged down/clogged up, but all you have to do is clean it out, and it&#x27;s back to normal.</li>
            <li>It stopped functioning properly not long after I got it.</li>
            <li>I blamed it on myself at first for not being careful enough or not laying the clothes flat enough.</li>
            <li>When especially I was barely tapping it against fabric it grabbed n tore them ..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth it at a small price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how to address concerns about the suction being too powerful and pulling fabric in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, compact, and powerful.  </li>
            <li>Based on those reviews, I used it timidly at first, but eventually realized that i can press firmly on the sweater and not do any damage at all.  </li>
            <li>I would test this on something heavy duty like a coat first before moving on to the delicates.</li>
            <li>It works ok on some materials, but it is a slow and time consuming process and doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all on other materials.</li>
            <li>The collection thing doesn&#x27;t hold as tight as it did when I first got it, but it does decently enough.</li>
            <li>First, I trialed this product on a long-sleeved cotton shirt that was starting to pill a little at the end of the sleeves.</li>
            <li>I used it mainly for the pilling on my couch due to my cats&#x27; secretive clawing.</li>
            <li>Being military we had to shave our berets whenever we got a new one to prepare it before wearing.</li>
            <li>I used brand new alkaline batteries to no avail (proof: the storage compartment was empty).</li>
            <li>I used it (carefully) on a sweater, and it smoothed the surface to look like new.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a decent device that was discounted nicely, so 3 stars isn&#x27;t too bad considering its just for occasional use.</li>
            <li>Like a previous reviewer stated, I didn&#x27;t expect much from a 6 dollar pill shaver - however -</li>
            <li>Less embarrassing too when I wore them out since my coats look much nicer without the balls.</li>
            <li>I previously owned an Emerson which worked very well until my 18 months child decided to crash it against the floor.</li>
            <li>It then plugs it up in the small area near the head and as a result it stops working evectivly and needs to be emptied very often.  </li>
            <li>But when you first use it you have to wipe the metal part with a dry paper towel until you see no more grey on the paper towel, it left a grey circle on a light pink shirt</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not common if you&#x27;re careful, but use it properly!</li>
            <li>Works as advertised, battery powered so it loses power quickly.  </li>
            <li>I had a larger, corded version of this in the past, but this one is just as powerful.</li>
            <li>I tried the shaver the moment I received it and it completely removed all the little fuzz balls with ease, leaving the cushions looking brand new.</li>
            <li>It made my old hoodies and sweaters look new again by taking off the little fuzzies that have began to pull out over time.  </li>
            <li>After about 5 minutes of this, the unit simply shut down, and I needed to gently tap it to get it started again.  </li>
            <li>Have two other&#x27;s and in fact had just used the older shavers on the same pants.</li>
            <li>But it certainly does the job and gets rid of all those little fuzzies on your clothes.</li>
            <li>Well this little device is your new hero!!</li>
            <li>For small amounts of pilling on fabric it is perfect, for larger, tougher amounts is not so bad.</li>
            <li>It works extremely well, is sharp and so far, very durable.  </li>
            <li>but while shaving my sweater, my sweater was not perfectly flat and it knicked my sweater and now it has a hole in it....</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m wondering how long it will last with taking it off and putting it back on so frequently.</li>
            <li>your clothing item is not completely flat the shaver WILL cut the fabric at the hems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus, it eats batteries and the clear plastic portion that holds the fuzz is too loose and comes off in my hand all the time.</li>
            <li>I guess the few downsides would be that you have to continuously empty it since it fills up really quickly.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this is very cheap made product.  </li>
            <li>This shaver MIGHT work for very, very light sweater, but for anything else, it is completely useless.</li>
            <li>The only complaint is that it is small and gets filled up fast</li>
            <li>this was waay too small for such a big project, but it actually did a great job, tho tedious.</li>
            <li>those tiny little fabrics balls are very hard to pull them one by one off the coats (even after I pulled those fabric balls off, the coat didn&#x27;t look nice neither).</li>
            <li>Be smart people and don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that when using the shaver on a large sweater with heavy pilling, the plastic catchment area can fill up and needs to be emptied halfway through the job.</li>
            <li>so this is a real help with keeping those darn little pills off.</li>
            <li>This little gem has worked very well.</li>
            <li>Yes, this little shaver is a cheapie, but it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>I must say it works really well at getting all the little fuzzies off.</li>
            <li>THE SHAVER IS A LITTLE SMALLL, THE CUP FILLS UP FAST</li>
            <li>It is a little time consuming and does go through batteries fast</li>
            <li>Got it about 3 weeks ago and have used it 3-4 times and it really does shave the little balls off of my clothing.  </li>
            <li>This product lets me shave pills off of my stocking caps and other pilly things to make them look and feel new again...</li>
            <li>this thing is quite powerful and if you press too hard it will put a hole in your sweater</li>
            <li>Since the product is new, the blades are sharp and I only needed to pass over the sweaters once.</li>
            <li>They were starting to get so bad my options were to try a fabric shaver or just donate the shirts to good will.  </li>
            <li>and I generally use it while wearing the gloves so they&#x27;re stretched out.</li>

            <li> Worked great without a lot of effort, jacket looks good again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was able to rehabilitate them with this shaver so that they look awesome.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also a good price and works great.</li>
            <li> I got remarkable results on using it on my jacket with piffs.</li>
            <li> it is ok, not the greatest.</li>
            <li> Over the years I haven&#x27;t returned many items but it&#x27;s always been a flawless experience.</li>
            <li> we gave it a 4 star since it works great with a good motor (assuming you used good batteries).</li>
            <li> great item , very  pleased, plan on buying another one for my daughter for xmas</li>
            <li> This does a very good job and feels very comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li> It works best on fine woven wool sweaters.</li>
            <li> It works fine not the best</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use!</li>
            <li> This lint shaver is an amazing find for a great price.</li>
            <li> this shaver works good.</li>
            <li> but that baby looks so good now.  </li>
            <li> but already I am seeing some good results.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> Pill removal just fair.</li>
            <li> one of the blades broke off so I can&#x27;t give it a good review.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I loved this product when I got it</li>
            <li> Good,</li>
            <li> I used to have one, but it seems to have been lost during the move, so was happy to find this on amazon for a nice price.  </li>
            <li> In fact I bought another one, my luck something that works this good will not be made in anther year.</li>
            <li> This works good.</li>
            <li> Really good at removing fabric pills.</li>
            <li> I had one of these (another brand) sweater fuzz ball shavers years ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li> u can get good batteries&amp;spare parts</li>
            <li> In summary, the Remington fabric shaver is inexpensive, does the job (but proceed with caution), and has a fairly sturdy build.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good price as well.</li>
            <li> it just is not as good as a manual fabric comb.  </li>
            <li> It works so good</li>
            <li> I bought 3, one to replace the one that croaked, and 2 for friends who asked \\&quot;help me maintain my sweaters, yours always look good year after year\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t tend to write reviews, but I felt like I owed one since good reviews guided me to this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had others; this one is really good.</li>

            <li> and it did a good job.</li>
            <li> Good deal.</li>
            <li> good purchase for the money.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product and saw it isn&#x27;t good for lightweight materials</li>
            <li> Best for smooth fabric</li>
            <li> Dollar-for-dollar, this is probably as good as you will get when it comes to lint removers.</li>
            <li> The battery life with 2 AA batteries is good.</li>
            <li> The product is definitely good.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Nothing good to say about it.</li>

            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I bought this to remove the fuzz from daughters uniform and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is really amazing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that this would work the amazing way that it did.  </li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim since it was so cheap, but I have to say its works great</li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well</li>
            <li> but besides this it worked amazing for removing pills from jackets and hoodies</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver is cheap but works great.</li>
            <li> It was amazing.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Handy tool to keep around.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, powerful, great price, it toke a while to get here but worth it .</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice catching it on anything or anything like that, but when I took it apart, it appeared the shaft that the blades are connected to had somehow bent, so the blades couldn&#x27;t turn without hitting the mesh cover and stopping.  </li>
            <li> This fabric shaver really works Great!</li>
            <li> Effective at removing lint.</li>
            <li> So handy.</li>
            <li> And note that you need your own AA batteries.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was nice.</li>
            <li> In contrast, the [[ASIN:B000WUXOT2 Sweater Stone]] worked perfectly and is amazingly gentle.  </li>
            <li> Nice price too.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Therefore, I would say it works, but use at your own risk of damaging clothing.</li>
            <li> I liked the way it worked to remove the pills; however, the battery compartment lid and the lint collector kept falling off while I was using it.  </li>
            <li> The blades havet a nice cover to protect it</li>
            <li> Nice gadget to remove those little&lt;</li>
            <li> It works best if held diagonally or vertically, which isn&#x27;t really what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> Saw a fren wit this 1st then got my own 2 when I ruin my daughter sweater now</li>
            <li> Refreshed them really nicely.</li>
            <li> and it works so good on my sofa :)</li>
            <li> This shaver is one of those items you would probably never buy on your own, but you are so grateful for it when it comes in your life.</li>
            <li> She also had a teenager who was delighted that a pair of her pants and favorite shirts were saved with this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does a nice job of removing the pills from sweaters.  </li>
            <li> but I honestly don&#x27;t know how you can make a hole with this machine, unless of course you are trying to shave stockings.</li>
            <li> Came in handy.</li>
            <li> Cleans up sweaters nicely.</li>
            <li> I made so many beloved sweaters wearable again.</li>
            <li> So this item kind of works.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to get pills of of a non-wool pea coat that I own.  </li>
            <li> Honest to goodness</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean, but it&#x27;d be perfect if it didn&#x27;t clog that often!</li>
            <li> Better then I excepted for the price Loved it.</li>
            <li> He really liked it.</li>
            <li> I can keep my clothes looking nice longer.</li>
            <li> Move it slower will move lint nicely.</li>
            <li> The kind of sweater have longer lint, it will not work well.</li>
            <li> It is nicely made and fits into the hand nicely.</li>
            <li> Seller did a perfect transaction with fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> My wife is thrilled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it one every kind of fabric</li>
            <li> THAT I SOMEHOW LOST &amp; WAS THRILLED TO SEE AMAZON HAD ONE.  </li>
            <li> There are just some projects that stay fuzzy because of the nature of the kind of fibers used.</li>
            <li> It removes &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; from any kind of fabric.</li>
            <li> I have used this to shave a couple of sweaters since I purchased it and have to say that it is a handy and functional item.</li>
            <li> Nice</li>
            <li> What a handy gadget.</li>
            <li> So happy to find something that works this well and at such a great price!</li>
            <li> Nice Fabric shaver.</li>
            <li> Nice blades.</li>
            <li> tightening the screen also provides a nice &amp;#34;closeness&amp;#34; adjustment.</li>
            <li> The material removed seems to kind of collect in there.  </li>
            <li> Great product and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This inexpensive sweater shaver works great and was well worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Perfect for keeping clothes looking new!</li>
            <li> It does a decent job but depending on the situation, it might not do a perfect job.</li>
            <li> I love having this fabric shaver, it works awesome and does exactly what I need it to.</li>
            <li> its not the best thing that will keep you happy for long</li>
            <li> This is a high quality and perfect shaver.</li>
            <li> Very surprising how much lint ends up in the reservoir!</li>
            <li> The best thing about it is that it requires normal AA batteries (which you can find at any home).</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with how it works and hope to get many years of use out of it.</li>
            <li> very pleased :)</li>
            <li> I am very happy, it saved me from buying a new coat.</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly without damaging the fabric, and now my sport coat has a new life.</li>
            <li> so I needed a new one- its great!</li>
            <li> The shaver worked perfectly and it looks like a new coat.  </li>
            <li> wonderful, brought my wooly outdoor research hybrid coat to a brand new standstill.</li>
            <li> But, happy day - this one is great so far.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job of de-fuzzing, shaving the top of the fabric, and pulling pills, and stray threads free.</li>
            <li> Better yet, donate it to a good charity :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good machine and easy to use it now continuously..</li>
            <li> One good thing is that all the lint and beads are captured in the tray which makes for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> From the tiniest to the biggest threads, this shaver would gulp anything that comes its way.&lt;br /&gt;The style is good in that I could easily see the lint.</li>
            <li> Works great, removes pills quickly, doesn&#x27;t damage sweater.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and did a good job.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, its self explanatory.   </li>
            <li> Very easy to use</li>
            <li> Very strong and compact</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of it, it was very easy to use</li>
            <li> Fabric Shaver is hand size and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> lint cover falls off very easily.</li>
            <li> Not so very easy to use, however; and</li>
            <li> Was very easy and got rid of all the lint balls that covered my hoodie!&lt;br /&gt;DEFFFFF</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and plan to buy another one for my sister as a gift.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and a laundry necessity.</li>
            <li> Good product, works just fine.</li>
            <li> Works great, it does exactly what it says it does!</li>
            <li> The suction wasn&#x27;t very good to begin with, so the fabric pills didn&#x27;t come off very well.  </li>
            <li> Even though that sweet sweater, awesome pair of herringbone slacks or those high end yoga pants look good from a distance.</li>
            <li> but I find it more effective removing from the bottom of the device.  </li>
            <li> So far I am impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> Also, the lint gets stuck alot, so i kind of have to disassemble the product many times because the lint gets stuck.</li>
            <li> be sure to take that off lmao</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product so far.  </li>
            <li> and I will be using it to tidy up many of my sweaters after the wear-and-tear of this winter.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> BY FAR this product works the best!</li>
            <li> Honestly I bought one of these for $1 at Target a couple of years ago and it worked better than this.</li>
            <li> Probably the most effective pill remover</li>
            <li> LOVE IT COME IN HANDY</li>
            <li> but so far it works great!!!</li>
            <li> It works nicely and it helps make my sweaters look better.</li>
            <li> I work with vintage clothing and of course have my own favorite clothes that I wear time and time again.</li>
            <li> She did one of her coats, first thing, and said it came out beautifully.  </li>
            <li> But this fabric shaver is more cost effective.</li>
            <li> It works great, and it is super cheap, so if it breaks then no biggie!  </li>
            <li> So easy to use and does the job!  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and very safe too.</li>
            <li> Very glad I purchased this, it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s going strong!</li>
            <li> Like this product, very handy and delivers the job quickly and safely.</li>
            <li> Great product, worked perfectly to remove little fuzz balls from the couch fabric.</li>
            <li> This little thing removes lint balls excellently and for a great price.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, made my girlfriend super happy, which makes me happy...</li>
            <li> I used this today for the first time and it worked great on 2 sweaters...until the blade somehow got caught on the guard and broke it.</li>
            <li> but I am still pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> Works the best after  so many several kind tried.</li>
            <li> This is the first sweater shaver I&#x27;ve bought and am happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> first lol.</li>
            <li> Worked great when it was functioning ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to use, and best of all, it makes my fuzzy sweaters look like new.</li>
            <li> This little shaver is great , Very handy, Though it takes couple of your minutes but does it job quite fairly.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li> This is very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make it a year with very light use.  </li>
            <li> Great small size allows me to travel with it and batter life is excellent.</li>
            <li> Fits nicely in my hand and was easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy and effective.  </li>
            <li> Gets rid of all the fuzzies easily and effectively.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li> The rotating area is a good size and works quick.</li>
            <li> Received quick and in good condition.</li>
            <li> It saved many of my favorite coats and I can wear them again now cuz I can easily shave off those fabric balls!</li>
            <li> Good product, works well, easy to use and to hold, requires batteries, not too large, good price, recommend to anyone for lint removal</li>
            <li> Most of the time I would just consider them as work shirts or rags, but this this removed the pilling very quickly and made the shirts look good again and made them comfortable to wear again.</li>
            <li> Worked wonders on an old and very loved hand knitted blanket.</li>
            <li> Very good to get rid of fuzz on your sweaters or old clothes.</li>
            <li> It matches the description and is very good to remove the threads poking out of old clothes.</li>
            <li> Still, the device  took about 3 cubic inches of fuzz, including many of the smallest size pills, off of one large sweater and the appearance was greatly improved.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it would, and some reviews said it cut into their clothing (read those, because I haven&#x27;t had this problem and don&#x27;t know if there are certain types of materials or ways of using this that result in that), but it has been great for me.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for and older model that stopped working,  It was easy to find online and was a very good price.</li>
            <li> I bought this little gadget on the many good reviews and it worked magnificently.</li>
            <li> This t-shirt is 60% cotton and 40% polyester like most of my shirts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better out there, but for the price, it does what is needed.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s able to shave off most pills on things that i&#x27;ve used it for.</li>
            <li> The top screws off</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t submit any more knit tops to this brutality.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this and now all the fuzz is gone and my comforter is back to perfect again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SHAVER, LIKE</li>
            <li> I always try not to buy the cheapest items, but most of us know that Remington has been around for years</li>
            <li> I mostly use it on my wool coat.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it does not drain batteries and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> My sweaters have never looked better.</li>
            <li> Does an okay job</li>
            <li> I love the fact that its battery operated, used to have one that was corded</li>
            <li> and that was a pain, having a portable one is much much better.    </li>
            <li> Sometimes cheap costs a lot!  </li>
            <li> More plastic junk into the landfill...</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This works just okay</li>
            <li> , it takes quite a while to get many sweater burrs.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s worked for many people out there</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Have used it on many sweaters, gloves and socks.  </li>
            <li> Love the Sweater Shaver.  </li>
            <li> I wish the it would hold more lint.</li>
            <li> I can wear my favorite sweaters again  </li>
            <li> I was in need of a way to get rid of the many lint balls that covered some of my our clothing.</li>
            <li> However, it does have a tendency to catch on the thread and has ripped a hole in many of my shirts.</li>
            <li> I plan on purchasing one more for my school costume closet.</li>
            <li> MAKE SURE</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I enjoy taking nice care of my clothes, so I tried this.</li>
            <li> Would recommend for sure.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask of a 6 dollar product?   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already used it on my 2 favorite sweaters.  </li>
            <li> Have been looking for something to save my favorite sweaters.  </li>
            <li> Surprising powerful for its size.</li>
            <li> I will say that sometimes the fuzz gets stuck in the top chamber</li>
            <li> My boyfriend wears sweaters all winter &amp; they become the most heinous fuzzy beast-like things.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad that I purchased it.</li>
            <li> and they love it.</li>
            <li> and my skirt looks so much better.</li>
            <li> i had the most stubborn fuzz on my fabric mattress cover.</li>
            <li> Love this lint remover.</li>
            <li> De-pilling is also strangely satisfying.</li>
            <li> I had bought a sofa and it had many pills of fabric</li>
            <li> I love my shaver, Ive restored alot of shirts that had lint all over.</li>
            <li> You will absolutely love the product.</li>
            <li> and you need to make sure there is no material stuck in the shaving part of this item as it will catch onto the material and create a hole.</li>
            <li> then that, i love this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> need I say more.</li>
            <li> My mom, and her kind heart, bought me a huge bulky shaver that needed 2 D batteries thinking it would save time.</li>
            <li> ( Also, remember to take the plastic guard off the top of the blade.  </li>
            <li> It works much better that way :) )</li>
            <li> Most of the time, the shavings do not fall out when opening to toss out.</li>
            <li> I have many jackets and coats that got fuzzy on the exterior and interior...</li>
            <li> Since then I seldom wore those jackets and coats again, but I love them</li>
            <li> My favorite sweater felt almost like sandpaper</li>
            <li> Batteries not included so be sure to have some around.</li>
            <li> This shaver works brilliantly on my son&#x27;s pilly wool diaper covers, and natural fiber inserts.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m searching for more clothes and fabrics to shave....</li>
            <li> But it sure does remove pills.</li>
            <li> This product is okay</li>
            <li> I was nervous about trying it out again after that, but I have not had any more problems since I have been using it correctly.</li>
            <li> I love that this guy fits in my purse....</li>
            <li> because most often, I want to use it while</li>
            <li> Love having this tool in my sewing kit.</li>
            <li> Considering how much most people need a gadget like this, this cannot be beaten for price or ease of use.</li>
            <li> We are really pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Just put the sweater on top of my dresser and glided the fabric shaver along, not putting pressure on it as per the instructions.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> so it seems to set the sweater up for even more pills.  </li>
            <li> lol For the money, you really wont find a better product.</li>
            <li> Works OK.</li>
            <li> It works ok.  </li>
            <li> I used to have a hand shaver that worked better.</li>
            <li> It would catch most of the snags, but eventually the blades would get clogged up.</li>
            <li> i *love*</li>
            <li> This has really been great.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of most of the visible pills.</li>
            <li> This product was okay to remove some of the fabric fuzzes...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually better than the one I used as a kid.</li>
            <li> I have many \\&quot;DeFuzzers\\</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have so many clothes that has lint on them which makes them look worn out...especially sweater material.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> ( We do we need to add more words on Amazon?</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to many people.  </li>
            <li> This 5 stars is an appropriate rating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say my sweaters are 70% better looking than they were before use.  </li>
            <li> This fabric shaver is the only one I&#x27;ve ever used, but I was very impressed with how well it trimmed my cashmere sweaters that had started to pill.    </li>
            <li> the regular squarish one, it work the best of them all.</li>
            <li> Now I can wear many of my sweaters that I kept in the closet for the longest time.</li>
            <li> and they love it too.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> My sweater looked 10 times better after shaving</li>
            <li> --- use the fabric shaver and add years to your favorite sweater.  </li>
            <li> I love this item and have used one for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li> So pleased with this.</li>
            <li> I even was able to use it on a couple of ties as the stitching on the pattern began to come loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does an OK job.  </li>
            <li> I wish there was something that worked better.</li>
            <li> Better then doing it by hand.</li>
            <li> Love this thing.</li>
            <li> Love this lint shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of cheap.</li>
            <li> BUT IT WORKS BETTER</li>
            <li> This works better than most I have tried.</li>
            <li> Works as it said it would, satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> A sweater stone worked better.</li>
            <li> glad i purchased it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> MY wife has a wool pea coat that needed some love as well</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It was just ok.  </li>
            <li> It works ok.  </li>
            <li> However I am extremely glad I did.</li>
            <li> I am extremely glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> I had to buy more for the family after I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li> will recommend it for sure.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to be able to still find these shavers.</li>
            <li> Looked all over and glad I found this item for me.</li>
            <li> But I thought this product would be more versatile.</li>
            <li> It functions ok.  </li>
            <li> I ruined one of my favorite blankets with it.</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery would buy again</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a great job at removing pills from my sweaters and it is very time consuming to use.  </li>
            <li> i have this lovely angora sweater that had these pills covering it.</li>
            <li> but it had so many balls of fabric all over it she thought and hideous and didn&#x27;t want him wearing it anymore</li>
            <li> Added more words to finish review.</li>
            <li> Functions perfectly and is addictive to use.  </li>
            <li> I machine wash most of my sweaters</li>
            <li> My kids love shaving their clothes also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try and return it and invest in something better.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I was that amazed with this shaver, but I haven&#x27;t found a better one either.  </li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Works OK</li>
            <li> I got this to fix a couple of my favorite cardigans that had a lot of fuzzballs on them.</li>
            <li> Purchase satisfied.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> I had a favorite that was covered with them.  </li>
            <li> I never had one before to compare it, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I love my Remington Clothes shaver.  </li>
            <li> This inexpensive item works as well or better than the others.</li>
            <li> I have even used it on rayon, and it has worked stunningly well.</li>
            <li> Makes my clothes look so much better</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t wear it any more becuase of all the lint on it.</li>
            <li> Well, mostly.  </li>
            <li> The device also makes a satisfying noise as you run it over your garment.</li>
            <li> It works better on socks and wool.</li>
            <li> There were so many that from a distance the slacks looked like they were polka dotted -</li>
            <li> It is definitely cheap, however does the job!  </li>
            <li> and that works much better.</li>
            <li> I can safely say is collects 99% of lint on my clothes.</li>
            <li> and i LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I am considering purchasing one more to keep it in stock.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m better off using my DeFuzzIt</li>
            <li> Just like one I had many years ago.</li>
            <li> Over the holidays my husband and I hosted a Christmas party where many sweaters were worn.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t agree more.</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;ve used it more I will try to comment again.</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting a better quality product.</li>
            <li> If it stops working remove the top cover and take the fuzz out of the end where the fan blade is and you are set to go.</li>
            <li> It seems we are importing more and more merchandise from China, and all the while Americans are losing their jobs because of it.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with purchase.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I haven&#x27;t used it more than 2 times since the many months</li>
            <li> I love this purchase and recommend it to anyone--we&#x27;ve all got fuzzies that need to be gone somewhere.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a ton of power, and I&#x27;m glad it doesn&#x27;t since it would probably tear up my clothes if it did.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing.  </li>
            <li> IT SAVED MANY CLOTHES</li>
            <li> I love my crate and barrel couch but the fabric after a couple months started pilling up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It happened to be a featured &amp;#34;Add-On&amp;#34; so I bought 2 more as gifts.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this fabric shaver.</li>
            <li> It has resurrected many of my sweaters, gloves, and wool coats from the closet.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of pairs of pants that I love but they pill up in the wash.</li>
            <li> But still I love it.</li>
            <li> Use with care and think twice if it&#x27;s something you love or want to ever wear again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to try and remove pilling from a favorite jacket.</li>
            <li> The metal top just chipped away.  </li>
            <li> and it should still grip the pilled knots without sucking in the healthy fabric.</li>
            <li> People who wear a lot more wool than me?</li>
            <li> I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER.</li>
            <li> I got a better on at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Thsi one works ok, thoukgh</li>
            <li> we love it use it alot</li>
            <li> Maybe someone more diligent with more patience will have more luck.</li>
            <li> Nice light weight and tucks away in your suitcase.</li>
            <li> However, I do find that I have go go over some areas more than once.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Just got this package 2 minutes ago, pulled out my favorite sweater</li>
            <li> ; is more a case of &amp;#34;Buyer</li>
            <li> ; is more a case of &amp;#34;Buyer</li>
            <li> happy with the whole purchase..</li>
            <li> I use it on my sweaters for the most part...</li>
            <li> However it is not the most sturdy thing either...  </li>
            <li> Once I got this, I realized the durability seemed much better than what I had.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get one sweater done and part of another one.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to bring pilled clothes back to life and was more than impressed with the results.  </li>
            <li> The size is smaller than I thought but works great!</li>
            <li> I could not be more impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing really sexy about it.  </li>
            <li> love it.  </li>
            <li> Works better than what I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Seller/Shipper could also do a better job with packaging.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, I thought that this shaver would have operated better.</li>
            <li> I was able to revive alot of my Hoodies  </li>
            <li> Overall very happy with the purchase, though.</li>
            <li> and the thing ripped a hole in my favorite bra (seems like it was doomed to begin with).  </li>
            <li> So if you are patient or just really nee the fuzzies off its great.</li>
            <li> This is something that I searched for and others had it for much more.</li>
            <li> Over all I love this product.</li>
            <li> the job done :)</li>
            <li> I would recomend this to my friends. :)</li>
            <li> I love this depiller.  </li>
            <li> Awesome product, especially for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep at it, but don&#x27;t expect your clothes to look \\&quot;like new\\&quot; again or to be able to keep your clothes that you love forever because of this miracle shaver.  </li>
            <li> It has made my peacoat look better.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did since it is much better than the one I was borrowing</li>
            <li> i love these for my leggings</li>
            <li> This works ok...</li>
            <li> Just okay.</li>
            <li> I love sweater dresses but my dryer leaves them covered in lint.</li>
            <li> It sure beats having to wear a bad-looking garment or having to eliminate it from the wardrobe.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased this.  </li>
            <li> I reviewed this type item for a while and was reluctant to purchase on line, but am so glad I did take the chance with this one.  </li>
            <li> It saved me money by saving some of my favorite clothes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Look for something more durable and save your money.</li>
            <li> Have not been more satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I really love this gadget.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> This one was the top one that met my needs.  </li>
            <li> i should not have she has been able to remove the fuzzys off those sweaters and</li>
            <li> I love this peorduct</li>
            <li> Then I look at it after 10 minutes and see how much more I have to go.</li>
            <li> And cheap!</li>
            <li> The sweaters look much better after shaving them.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt if it touches your skin, so you&#x27;re safe there.</li>
            <li> But I feel like some of the thinner sweaters and many shirts may get eaten through.</li>
            <li> Its also very miniature, which is great for things like travel.</li>
            <li> I found this one at Walgreens and paid a lot more then I could get it here...</li>
            <li> so I make sure its turned off....</li>
            <li> it sure is easier then using the rollers...</li>
            <li> and it does a better job</li>
            <li> Its more like a hair cut.  </li>
            <li> The thinner the cotton, the better it works.  </li>
            <li> and I bought this to freshen up the items that were looking more worn.</li>
            <li> This does take off most fabric nubs.  </li>
            <li> Takes off most of the unwanted fabric parts sticking out.</li>
            <li> This thing works like magic.</li>
            <li> and it dropped it and broke it, but this one was cheaper and works better</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> Ok so I know this is just a fuzz shaver</li>
            <li> and I love removing the pills from pajama pants, tights, workout pants and even some tops that have pilled.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping for better results on my sweaters.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I should have read better.  </li>
            <li> It does the job well for the most part.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> and I was sure it broke.</li>
            <li> It does remove that stubborn lint that forms after many washes.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This in one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made on Amazon- a total \\&quot;must have\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is a better product than the shaver that you can plug into the wall.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better fabric shavers.  </li>
            <li> This one is okay.  </li>
            <li> , most of us should already have those on hand.</li>
            <li> bought this because my favorite sweater looked</li>
            <li> and I am most pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Its helped me keep some of my favorite knitwear.  </li>
            <li> I love that&#x27;s gotten out of control.</li>
            <li> but sure enough, this works perfectly!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the tradeoff you make for something that&#x27;s going to clear pills from your fabric at an incredible pace</li>
            <li> I have now used this shaver many times on a variety of materials.</li>
            <li> I love these machines.  </li>
            <li> I am glad to have it.</li>
            <li> and I am highly pleased of my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> and it was entertaining to use this thing while watching TV.  </li>
            <li> A rewarding feeling.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised, gets most of the lint out of clothing g r e a t g r e a t</li>
            <li> I have been using it for more than a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many shavers over the years.  </li>
            <li> I even bought a plug in one, thinking it might work better.</li>
            <li> 9/30/2013- Still love it.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend uses it on her cotton/vinyl tank top without issues.</li>
            <li> and it worked its magic on it all.</li>
            <li> and my sweaters look better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> But i guess I won&#x27;t be able to use it on my cashmere sweaters if it was stronger.</li>
            <li> Love using this product.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to use it, because everytime</li>
            <li> This has saved my wool knit coat soooo many times.  </li>
            <li> I am highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> This shaver does work and it works ok</li>
            <li> The more robust material does not cut well.</li>
            <li> I filled the storage compartment with pills!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The product is okay .</li>
            <li> Tape works better</li>
            <li> It works ok -</li>
            <li> The product is ok but sweaters that pill are almost hopeless.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to stay away from any sweaters containing acrylic.  </li>
            <li> I found that varying the direction made it more thorough.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m glad it works and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> The sweaters look so much better.</li>
            <li> It has saved so many of my shirts and sweaters.</li>
            <li> I love vintage clothing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve removed lint, nubbies, fuzz off a shawl I had, pills on cushions where legs rub the fabric...and they&#x27;ll be more.  </li>
            <li> Ok, Ease of use and quality of performance: A+.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy another one as soon as I get my refund and give it one more try.  </li>
            <li> Barely touching the fabric</li>
            <li> I take the top off and blow off the blade after every use.</li>
            <li> I adjusted the batteries got it to work for 30 more seconds</li>
            <li> I have revived sweaters, mattresses, socks, blankets, pillows and more.</li>
            <li> Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> the blades get stuck every so often and you have to take the top and hte blades out and dig put</li>
            <li> Does an okay job.</li>
            <li> I really, really love this shaver.</li>
            <li> This takes most of the pills on our sweaters without snagging the fabric.</li>
            <li> It mainly use it for neck ties and its been perfect so far just not the best for a whole sweater.</li>
            <li> Cleaned up my new ottoman beautifully.</li>
            <li> Very handy though I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver makes great work of fleece clothing in particular, and I was pleased to have some of my clothing renewed.  </li>
            <li> Nice strong spinning blade that doesn&#x27;t snag too easily.  </li>
            <li> So far so good, works a miracle!</li>
            <li> The results were great and my sweater looks brand new!</li>
            <li> Mine has worked great, my shirts look bran new!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying a new one because it still so great love</li>
            <li> Have used it for several hours and still going strong - very impressed for an $8 product!</li>
            <li> this removed all of them very cleanly.  </li>
            <li> Light weight and suitable for travel.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty good for what it is designed to do.  </li>
            <li> I gotta say this is a pretty good product for the money.</li>
            <li> I primarily use it to remove pills from bedding/sheets and it works excellently if you use it as directed----just make sure you keep the discharge vessel cleaned out thoroughly and remove the cover to remove any shorn fabric that will likely start to tangle the spindle.  </li>
            <li> Loved it so much I bought a spare!</li>
            <li> First, the good news:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> My son in college loved it so much I bought one for him too!</li>
            <li> It works pretty good.  </li>
            <li> The shaver works pretty good</li>
            <li> It also had pretty good battery life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, feels good in your hand, and zips right along.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> Well worth it!!</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s a great tool for keeping your sweaters looking brand new.  </li>
            <li> Works great as my sweater looks like new.  </li>
            <li> This shaver worked great on removing the lint and making my sweaters look like new.  </li>
            <li> It works great to remove the lint balls that form on the elastic on bras, making them look new.</li>
            <li> Works great, makes clothes look like new again.  </li>
            <li> I was shaving the balls off cashmere sweaters and it did a great job and the sweaters look like new again.</li>
            <li> I can understand why some people may have experienced rips on more sensitive clothing types.</li>
            <li> The razor is super nice</li>
            <li> ; Easy to use, does what is advertised, what more do you want?</li>
            <li> Just be sure that the fabric has no lumps or wrinkles or you will easily make a hole in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;waste&amp;#34; is sometimes easily opened while gripping the device.</li>
            <li> This thing is fantastic for such a great price too!</li>
            <li> However, the effect is better than the old one, so I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Thought I would get a good product with all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> This product is light weight, inexpensive, and has made my beautiful couch and chairs look  like new again.  </li>
            <li> I got this one pretty quickly and it worked great.</li>
            <li> But I have used it mostly on sweaters, not any fine fabric like silk.</li>
            <li> Works fine on most fabrics.  </li>
            <li> The sweater now looks fine and a wardrobe favorite is saved.</li>
            <li> looks almost as good as new!!</li>
            <li> Overall, this is very good.</li>
            <li> you can clean it very easily  and easy to use also...</li>
            <li> but I find it more effective removing from the bottom of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is pretty lightweight and operates on two AA batteries which are not included.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how great this works.</li>
            <li> I did nick one sweater slightly (fortunately it was in an inconspicuous spot, and I was able to darn the hole).</li>
            <li> The best six bucks I ever spent.</li>
            <li> Get yourself a pack of cheap bic razors at the dollar store for better performance and value.</li>
            <li> This is the first sweater shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, and so far it has done a perfect job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on my cheap t-shirts, my sweaters, my favorite tank tops.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for over a year and it is working great so far.</li>
            <li> But you just have to make sure you shave lightly.</li>
            <li> For the price, it does a great job, and with the clear container</li>
            <li> this thing is great, far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer cut too many corners making this cheap shaver.  </li>
            <li> This is another item that I ordered mostly because it was cheap, I needed it, and I did not want to go to the store.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it on a fleece and a wool sweater and it has worked great.  </li>
            <li> (sound like a Goldilocks story? :-)</li>
            <li> Good and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It does a good fast job.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I bought it for all my sisters-in-law</li>
            <li> It is actually kind of fun to use.</li>
            <li> These Fabric Shavers really work and this one is as good as the others.  </li>
            <li> So, it may get stuck depending on what you&#x27;re going over, though that may be a good reason if it stops it from taking off too much.  </li>
            <li> I read a review of this before I bought it and laughed about how the purchaser had gone around their whole house shaving everything and taking pictures of it.</li>
            <li> It works plenty fast and does a good job.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s kind of fun to use.  </li>
            <li> It is not as powerful as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> It was actually quick and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The fabric shaver removes fuzz balls very easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li> and it still works great - makes my sweaters look clean and new!</li>
            <li> but I was able to get all the fuzz balls off the pants and they look as good as new.  </li>
            <li> My nursing tank top and baby wearing shirt are almost as good as new.</li>
            <li> I just wish the lint collector tray was a bit more secure and did not slide off so easily...</li>
            <li> Cheap and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Super light, super good...</li>
            <li> Super quick, powerful, easy, and a great price.</li>
            <li> Cool!</li>
            <li> other than that, great item!</li>
            <li> My husbands sweat pants were full of lint balls!</li>
            <li> Other than that, it does its intended purpose, and has made me one happy purchaser!</li>
            <li> However, this one works much better than the original one I had.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the other fabric shavers I have used this is the best one yet.</li>
            <li> With the first use, this product put holes in my husband&#x27;s favorite shirt!</li>
            <li> Fell in love with my first one 6mths ago.. works great, very durable...</li>
            <li> So full of pills!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest to whether or not it works well on other fabrics, but it worked perfectly for what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> This shaver is best for jackets and other heavier materials.</li>
            <li> The other one was a charcoal block from the Vermont Country Store that someone said did the best job.  </li>
            <li> Excellent for sweaters and any other fuzz ball making clothing.</li>
            <li> Good little shaver that does a great job.</li>
            <li> But other than that, no complaints - works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This shaver is extremely compact, well designed and works perfectly.</li>

            <li> the batter cover come out too easily as you are shaving.</li>
            <li> The shaver will easily catch the pilling and pull the knit fabric into the blade area and damage the knit to create holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just wish the cover for batteries and the catch for the lint didn&#x27;t slide off so easy when using this.</li>
            <li> &quot; and this is the absolute best so far.  </li>

            <li> I would recommend to buy this shaver for everyone who wants to prolong the life of their beloved clothes and enjoy using them for a longer period.</li>
            <li> Batteries were still strong when I was done.  </li>

            <li> It was a good price for a decent product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for over a year now, and going strong.  </li>
            <li> but the motor is not that strong</li>
            <li> Still going strong after a year of moderte use</li>
            <li> nice fabric shaver, at very reasonable price</li>
            <li> can buy &amp;#34;lesser brands&amp;#34; in some cases at retail stores, and this shaver keeps the clothing looking as good as the high end name brands.</li>
            <li> These are so handy for sweaters, blankets, etc., and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I used to have one with more surface area, and i think it was more powerful than this one, but this serves my needs just fine.</li>
            <li> I was so very excited about using this, and it worked great for about an hour, but then I noticed it started to snag on my clothes and that the metal screen had actually started to crack.</li>
            <li> They seemed to be very pleased with the results and thought that it worked very well to remove the &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Easy and quick to use-love it!</li>
            <li> It was my own fault for playing with it, but I haven&#x27;t experienced that with other models.</li>
            <li> but it has done a yeoman&#x27;s job so far -- had a lot of catching up to do!  </li>
            <li> one was my last try to get a good one, and finally I this one does work perfectly.</li>
            <li> This cuts down the time drastically and does a perfect job.</li>
            <li> Best $9 I ever spent!!</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver on alot of things and it is as good as new.  </li>
            <li> Makes clothes look as good as new.</li>
            <li> I have always had a Remington Battery Operated Fabric Shaver and this new one is just as good.  </li>
            <li> For being less than 10 dollars it works wonderful.  </li>
            <li> but that was fine because it was doing its job.  </li>
            <li> But with patience, this one is fine.</li>
            <li> then you should be fine.</li>
            <li> Everything was going fine.</li>
            <li> If you need a cheap, easy to use solution, this one does the trick.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> I was initially impressed with this, but after shaving a couple sweaters and half of my winter coat, it just quit working.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it works fine on sweaters, but I&#x27;m not going to risk it.</li>
            <li> Takes the pills off fabrics fine.</li>
            <li> The shaver works fine</li>
            <li> This worked fine, but the part that collected the lint kept sliding off.  </li>
            <li> and youll be fine.</li>
            <li> It works fine and there is no science to it).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy because they no longer make that style with the satin backing, so it&#x27;s pretty much irreplaceable.</li>
            <li> Gets the pills off furniture just fine</li>
            <li> I  have shirts that are perfectly fine except for the pills,  Now they can be removed and still wearable.</li>
            <li> This product works fine and does the job required.  </li>
            <li> Without the cover on, the blade spins just fine.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be just fine.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend&lt;br /&gt;for fine fabrics.</li>
            <li> This sweater shaver works fine removing the pills from wool sweaters.</li>
            <li> Works fine for the price and it won&#x27;t cut holes in your sweaters unless you are mashing it into the fibers, I have not had an issues.</li>
            <li> Just read the instructions before you use it, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Altogether a great product that does exactly what it should, and does it very well.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  </li>
            <li> I got thru one sweater fine (and cleaned the shavings out of the bin)</li>
            <li> Fortunately, even the head can be removed and replaced easily, so cleaning it out wasn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after buying some fleece sweater jackets and an acrylic sweater (fine knit) from Blair.</li>
            <li> This worked fine for a while, but after using it off and on for about a month, the metal screen on the shaver began cracking and made the product unusable.</li>
            <li> It was fine on the clothes, never caught or pulled threads, and got EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> it worked fine for a day or two then broke.  </li>
            <li> Will probably not buy again but fine in the meantime.</li>
            <li> Shape makes it easy and comfortable to use and hold.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine for the price.</li>
            <li> Well it worked perfectly fine until the End mettle piece broke its not mettle just crappy plasticky stuff</li>
            <li> Works great, pretty much what you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> and you are fine.</li>
            <li> : Takes all the pills off of any fabric you could think of, and quickly too!</li>
            <li> your clothes is super satisfying.</li>
            <li> No problems with snags, it didn&#x27;t eat the batteries too quickly like some do, and the pills and puffs were gone!</li>
            <li> do wish it operated a bit more quickly, though.</li>
            <li> Worked super on both!</li>
            <li> My pill shaver arrived quickly with appropriate packaging.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t use it that much, but when we need, we are glad to have it around!</li>
            <li> It effectively removes pills and fuzz from sweaters, socks, rugs, upholstry, etc, making them look much more like new.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean, easy to change batteries.</li>
            <li> It was smooth and precise on the fabric and its shape and size make it easy to hold.</li>
            <li> This works great and is easy to open to dispense lint shavings.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable, very handy for shaving cotton balls, exactly what I had been looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first shaver - and so far so good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and does exactly what it promises to do.  </li>
            <li> Awesome little product.  </li>
            <li> This little shaver is the best!!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> This little device really impressed me.</li>
            <li> This little gadget did an awesome job.  </li>
            <li> Perfect little handheld de-fuzzer.  </li>
            <li> Very happy itch this little shaver.</li>
            <li> Overall, I very satisfied with it!</li>
            <li> I have a North Face Denali WindPro and this little shaver did an excellent job.  </li>
            <li> This little fabric shaver is the best one I&#x27;ve purchased to date.</li>
            <li> This little shaver works great!</li>
            <li> This little shaver is awesome!</li>
            <li> This little guy is great!</li>
            <li> An excellent little clothes shaver you can take anywhere.</li>
            <li> This little machine works great!</li>
            <li> Still not as good as my old one, but works fine for the price.</li>
            <li> Using it was quite straightforward,  easy to insert batteries</li>
            <li> A good little motor with good cutters.</li>
            <li> This cheap little thing works awesome</li>
            <li> If you look at the two pictures of the before and after on the bedsheet, you will notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li> CHEAP, cheap, cheap.</li>
            <li> While I do not see a huge difference in my sweaters, this shaver must be working because I see remnants inside.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to clean, which is important.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, so</li>
            <li> It is so light weight and the grip is comforting.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean out and the lint shaving go neatly in it compartment.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic in fact</li>
            <li> then i was back to removing lint from my sweaters, still a great product.</li>
            <li> Go lightly.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This was a great lint shaver the only problem once the cover for the blades crakes the shaver stops working</li>
            <li> Great low</li>
            <li> This model fits well in the hand and is light weight.</li>
            <li> The shavings catch compartment is easy to remove and clean.</li>
            <li> so maybe that&#x27;s why price is so cheap.  </li>
            <li> Amazon sent me a replacement free of charge.</li>
            <li> Works great and immediately cleaned up several of my shirts and sweaters.</li>
            <li> The shaver worked great and all the white fuzz balls are gone and the load of socks usable again!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this would work since it was so cheap, but I thought I&#x27;d try.</li>
            <li> I tried this fabric shaver 3 times using light to no pressure...</li>
            <li> It was great for the cuffs on my chunkier sweaters, but when it came to my yoga pullover, it didn&#x27;t shave quite close enough to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Feels cheap.  </li>
            <li> Just brush lightly.</li>
            <li> Well worth the longer use you can get out of your favorite clothes.</li>
            <li> is that it is so cheap.</li>
            <li> have all been there and pulled at something we shouldn&#x27;t have (usually light knits, woven linens)</li>
            <li> Works great is is relatively quiet.</li>
            <li> Used it once for a light weight sweater.</li>
            <li> All it needs is a light touch or you could rip your pants</li>
            <li> and I decided to give this a try as it was cheap (5.99$) with free shipping.</li>
            <li> For smaller jobs I think it would be great.</li>
            <li> This thing is cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Another thing that makes this shaver easy to clean is that the cap screws off.</li>
            <li> Looks cheap, works well.</li>
            <li> If it doesnt seem to be picking up lint as it should, you probably just need a fresh pair of batteries :)  </li>
            <li> This seemed to fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> When I got the product it was a downer to see what cheap \\&quot;Made in China\\</li>
            <li> All the pilling is removed and the unit is easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> it worked great - until the grill broke recently.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it seemed to work great but a piece of the head broke off on the 3rd use and it does not work at all.  </li>
            <li> Though the plastics parts feel cheap, but the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> now with this item i can enjoy it once again.</li>
            <li> Works great, just wish I would of brought a bigger size,</li>
            <li> It works FABULOUSLY</li>
            <li> And, at the job&#x27;s White Elephant party, it was a sought after item, lol.</li>
            <li> and it took me forever to get a pair of my son&#x27;s wool longies looking fuzz free.  </li>
            <li> had gone from smooth to fuzzy knot&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thrift store shopping: I can buy items that have fabric pills on them (that no one else would buy, and that have made it to clearance) and make them look fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still as smooth as glass.</li>
            <li> You can tell this is a cheap product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean out, and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and broke after 2 days of use.</li>
            <li> But, it looks too cheaply made...</li>
            <li> But this is quieter, smaller, good design - and most importantly - it gets rid of pilling.</li>
            <li> At only $5.99, this was a great buy.</li>
            <li> THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT COVER DOESN&#x27;T FIT WHEN IT&#x27;S GOT BATTERIES</li>
            <li> works fantastic.</li>
            <li> The trick I found is to NOT to apply pressure and just lightly skim the surface of the fabric.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I would say is that it works great.</li>
            <li> Put a piece of bright tape on the clear cap so you&#x27;ll know to take it off and where you&#x27;ve put it.</li>
            <li> This unit is cheap and should be sold at the dollar store.</li>
            <li> I bought this thing a about a year ago and still fabulous</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s definitely worth buying because it will preserve your clothes a lot better</li>
            <li> Is it cheap?</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with my purchse.</li>
            <li> This shaver worked great on my sweaters that had become a big shabby because of pilling and wear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and it does a nice job on my sweaters.  </li>
            <li> but this was so cheap &amp; got the job done.</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver works great for removing stubbly fuzzies that are stuck to the outside of sweaters and hoodies.</li>
            <li> This one is just cheap.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the product works nicely.</li>
            <li> It works well for my light weight sweaters.  </li>
            <li> I had a cheap pillow case that pilled a lot.</li>
            <li> :  Cheap</li>
            <li> just wished it was much more powerful however.</li>
            <li> Felt cheap</li>
            <li> I use it for shaving the stuff on cheap bed sheets that build up around our house.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important that you recognize that before deciding to purchase this.  </li>
            <li> For what does it profit a man to gain a whole quarter and lose his own shaver?</li>
            <li> This does  a fantastic job of depilling sweaters and coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use it and ended up getting a different one at the drugstore for $4 that works great.</li>
            <li> For a cheap \\&quot;gadget\\&quot;, it works quite well.</li>
            <li> It works very well, and it&#x27;s kind of relaxing to use.</li>
            <li> It could literally fit in the palm of our hand.</li>
            <li> For looking and feeling cheap it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to clean out; just snap it off and dump the shaved fabric then snap it on again.</li>
            <li> Haved used it on several items and it works great.</li>
            <li> Dose his job perfectly, comfortable to handle</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and performs sub-par</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> cheap.  </li>
            <li> In any event I heard a crunch sound.  </li>
            <li> Cheap.  </li>
            <li> Cheap an well built.</li>
            <li> This shaver removes them and returns them to the smooth texture they should be.</li>
            <li> If you need to go over an area just keep going over lightly.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I purchased two more for my sisters.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it was so cheap because I feel like I almost got my money&#x27;s worth out of it regardless, but I&#x27;ll be replacing it with something else.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good...</li>
            <li> I love it so much, I bought three more for gifts.</li>
            <li> I had a beloved 20+ year old knitted hat that now looks close to the day I received it.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> In the old days, the screen was made from a fairly sturdy piece of metal.  </li>
            <li> While using this product, the resevoir should be emptied frequently for optimum performance.</li>
            <li> A must own if you own different items of fleece.</li>
            <li> This is a great thing to have, has extended the life of many otherwise perfect clothes except those annoying fluff balls that appear on wool and linens, perfect!</li>
            <li> Nice and small, making it easily portable, but it does a great job getting all the fuzz off.</li>
            <li> TIP: make sure to hold the clothing taught while shaving (everyone is right about this aspect as well).</li>
            <li> Extremely noticable because it&#x27;s a very bright neon pink-orangey color.</li>
            <li> Very powerful.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, it is very powerful, don&#x27;t use on lighter fabrics.</li>
            <li> This iten works prety well, very powerful for its size, but the battery cap keeps getting unattached while using it.</li>
            <li> This shaver does a very nice job in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Anyway it is very powerful and had no problems.</li>
            <li> It is very useful for cotten ball things in shoes.</li>
            <li> Seems very powerful for its size.  </li>
            <li> Very useful device</li>
            <li> VERY POWERFUL.</li>
            <li> It was my own fault that I put a hole in a favorite sweater the first time I used this tool, because I didn&#x27;t read the directions or the reviews about using it GENTLY.</li>
            <li> Not as loud as most and works pretty good.</li>
            <li> It just makes everything look so nice and new all over again!</li>
            <li> While I wouldn&#x27;t say this sweater shaver was amazing, it&#x27;s decent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pleased, as these pants were the primary reason I bought this</li>
            <li> Super easy to use.</li>
            <li> The collector catches all the shaved lent, super easy to empy.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use and helpful when you need it.</li>
            <li> But the battery lid fell off easily and I quickly lost it.</li>
            <li> It works very well, is easy to empty, and the best value you can find in these things.</li>
            <li> BUT - the cover to the compartment that collects the debris comes off super easily</li>
            <li> my favorite sweater looks brand new!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best little gadget I&#x27;ve bought in YEARS!</li>
            <li> Best little shaver I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Awesome little gadget to have!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest: I wasn&#x27;t sure how effective a cheap little fabric shaver would be.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite household tool/appliance!  </li>
            <li> ,i don&#x27;t know if it produces more heat than they can stand or what ,i tried this with many batteries,sometimes they leaked or the new ones</li>
            <li> A good thing to have to keep clothes looking fresh and new.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives new life to my oldest and most favorite sweaters, some of which I was embarrassed to wear because they were so ratty looking.</li>
            <li> It is super easy to clean out and to use.</li>
            <li> Efficient, super easy to clean, straightforward design...</li>
            <li> PURCHASED THIS REMINGTON BATTERY OPERATED FABRIC SHAVER HERE ON AMAZON AFTER MY VERY OLD ONE BROKE AFTER MANY, MANY YEARS OF USAGE.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tiny and works amazingly well!</li>
            <li> i was really excited to use this shaver.</li>
            <li> Really powerful!</li>
            <li> This is my first fuzz buster - I love it.  </li>
            <li> At first I could not get the head cleared of lint and then realized the top just unscrews.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it lasts but it did a great job on a lace blouse</li>
            <li> Most others are non-battery powered combs and I thought that would be pretty nifty to keep around until I saw this one.  </li>
            <li> The fabric shaver was exactly what i needed and was cheap!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, used it on several of my wife&#x27;s delicate sweaters...and it did awesome!</li>
            <li> Worth the six bucks!</li>
            <li> too small, need a shaver for the wonderful pills that pop up on some of our clothing, this is not the one that will remove them</li>
            <li> User friendly and shows results immediately.</li>
            <li> First, I must say I have been nothing but pleased with my Amazon purchases.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already burnt out the batteries, but it has been worth it!  </li>
            <li> It is soooo useful!</li>
            <li> I had so much fun! ..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s does the job and its pretty ok price.  </li>
            <li> This is great for getting minor pilling off clothing or furniture.</li>
            <li> Worth every stinking penny!</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> One thing I did notice is that more pills are removed with more force on the item because I kept on going over the same sections with no avail and realized I had to be more aggressive with it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny in my book!</li>
            <li> first used it on my favorite Nike sport polyester coat that has been fuzzing up because I where it so often</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> fun shaving!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fast and very effective, though you do have to be careful on fabrics with looser weaves or &#x27;stringier&#x27; knits where fibers are more easily pulled in and cut.  </li>
            <li> This little guy sure does a great job.</li>
            <li> Works good , has gotten a little warm , but have been using it for doing a cloak .</li>
            <li> took my time and used this handy dandy pill eater and my socks are like brand new.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d loving  my brand new  </li>
            <li> After reading all of the positive reviews, I decided on this shaver against all the other shavers because it was purported to be the best for its money.  </li>
            <li> Its tiny but offers great value!</li>
            <li> just remember to clean out the lint after you go over a sweater before you start another one.  </li>
            <li> If the blades stop rotating, screw off the cover and use a pair of tweezers to clean out the inside.  </li>
            <li> , just clean it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had an old Remington lint shaver that lasted for about 20 years and worked flawlessly until it finally died.  </li>
            <li> But, the main thing I love about it is that it&#x27;s so easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This shaver works great on regular to heavyweight material, but is way TOO POWERFUL on lightweight stuff.  </li>
            <li> you clean off the heads; after each job.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> It quickly and smoothly takes the pilling off without snagging or damaging the knit.  </li>
            <li> The head also unscrews, the blade comes out, and you can clean the build-up on the inside of the head.</li>
            <li> My 7 y.o. kid used it to clean up some of our sweaters.  </li>
            <li> This was a GREAT purchase, well worth the money, I would have paid double.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the best that I have used so far.  </li>
            <li> I needed to clean up some sweaters</li>
            <li> super cheap.</li>
            <li> Every house needs to clean the bumps on items that get those beads..</li>
            <li> Shaved them quickly and smoothly .</li>
            <li> I bought this to clean up the edges of sweater sleeves, waistbands and any area that is fuzzy or pilling.  </li>
            <li> We bought this to clean up burrs on our La-Z-Boy pillows.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because of the many positive reviews, and of course because of the price.  </li>
            <li> it made my old pilled sweater look much better!</li>
            <li> Powerful really does the job used on linen bar chairs that had pills all over really cleaned up nicely!  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and easy to clean and very affordable.</li>
            <li> I had my shirt full of pills and now its totally clean.</li>
            <li> They come out pretty easily and the first time I just unscrewed the top and shook it in the trash can.  </li>
            <li> It stops working every time it encounters a large pill, pulls fabric, and requires many passes to show any improvement.</li>
            <li> It works ok on certain fabrics but not all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as large as it looks in the picture which I was glad about.  </li>
            <li> I will certainly use it, but wish it were a bit more efficient.</li>
            <li> As other-nothing special, peeling sweater took me .I</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> The Remington got everything off right away, with no issues!</li>
            <li> all right off!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to be right!</li>
            <li> I think the size of the holes in this shaver are just right!  </li>
            <li> It does a nice job, just use it carefully -- very light pressure and don&#x27;t stay too long in one spot.</li>
            <li> My husband finally has a crisp and clean looking coat because of this great tool.  </li>
            <li> I like being able to spruce up older sweaters and sweat shirts!</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little more powerful but for price it works great.</li>
            <li> It really made a huge difference on the pillow I wanted to shave!</li>
            <li> this item is great, I love that its small and can travel with it, but it is noisy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing compared to the old shavers.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as expected, but it helps so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> but when we do, especially on bigger jobs like bedsheets, it can be used for a good 15-20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when we do, especially on bigger jobs like bedsheets, it can be used for a good 15-20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> My leggings feel as good as they did when I initially bought them.</li>
            <li> The seats and the arm rests were full of them.  </li>
            <li> In the end it removed absolutely nothing and probably did more damage to my items.</li>
            <li> and they were full of lint balls from waist to pants leg.</li>
            <li> used it on some sweaters that were full of those ball thingies.</li>
            <li> Later the superior blades broke while i was using it&amp;it never worked the same again,so it&#x27;s good to buy a spare part  </li>
            <li> But, overall, it does a good job.</li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced and works way better than a comb that I had bought before.</li>
            <li> one\\&quot; and that works really well, better than anything I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> my husband did laundry in which one of his favorite fleece coats endend up being washed with something that made it come out looking very fuzzy.</li>
            <li> you should also keep emptying the lint as you go, I think that&#x27;s a good idea to help it last longer.  </li>
            <li> overall its a good product that work.</li>
            <li> &amp; I did return it &amp; got my full refund.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, a terrific product that&#x27;s surprisingly durable and dependable.</li>
            <li> So overall a good buy for the price and does the job.</li>
            <li> Shaving quality is good and one pair of Duracell Alkaline batteries last for four months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased to say that this producye worked very well.  </li>
            <li> I love this item, works very well on all my sweats, shorts and shirts.</li>
            <li> I wanted the full size version.</li>
            <li> I guess just keep your expectations reasonable, it will HELP, not SAVE, your clothes :)</li>
            <li> So, you would know if it is already full.</li>
            <li> Would be sweet if it would come with batteries.</li>
            <li> Otherwise this tool is so cool.</li>
            <li> but I also make sure to hold the areas very taut while working so as to avoid making holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works really well except the lint keeps getting stuck in the top portion because there appears to be a sort of bottleneck going into the lint resovoir.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used others that work a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> This is so cool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true...</li>
            <li> being said, it worked great on a set of linen that was starting to &#x27;pimple&#x27;, and an old favorite skirt i pulled out of storage.</li>
            <li> Kinda shoddy construction, but functions perfectly for now.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a good value overall.</li>
            <li> I like that you can see when the unit is getting full.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already used it on sweaters that were so full of &#x27;pills&#x27; that I couldn&#x27;t wear them anymore.</li>
            <li> Handy portable device for small jobs....especially good for travel.  </li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s not bad...</li>
            <li> I first tried it on an old sweater that I loved, but was too embarrassed to wear.</li>
            <li> But it was very easy to use and made my sweater look like new again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s essential if you love sweaters - easily take those pills off!</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, but using it on my sofa, it didn&#x27;t really shave off most of the pilling, so I&#x27;ll have to find something stronger?</li>
            <li> This was an impulse buy--I was searching for ways to de-pill clothing and found this link and bought it right away because of the cheap price.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The canister part that is on the shaver does crack pretty easily though</li>
            <li> The item is so easy to use and did exactly what it said.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do and very quickly.</li>
            <li> seemed too large to fit in the foil&#x27;s holes, and I think the blades struggled to cut through the heftier fibres, plus it occassionally got clogged on the wool - so I am still not sure on the best thing for wool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Two things you should be aware of - it eats batteries quickly, and the collector cup sometimes comes off too easily (like while you&#x27;re using it).  </li>
            <li> I think it would work great on smaller pieces of clothing, but we bought this for our comforter which was WAY too large for this thing.  </li>
            <li> Great tool for removing &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; on sweaters and other knit and/or wool clothing.  </li>
            <li> I primarily decided on the Remington because of price and the overall pretty good reviews.  </li>
            <li> Works great, but due to the design of it, the pills that it has shaved off get stuck under the rotating blade instead of dropping into the pill catcher.</li>
            <li> In my experience it works great for removing pills/balls from sweaters, hats, gloves, &amp; other knits.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work that great on any other sweaters or tops</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase and cannot wait to use it to make my other clothes look like new.</li>
            <li> My favorite sweater feels brand new!  </li>
            <li> Gets all the fuzzies off and makes my clothes look new again! :)</li>
            <li> I love that my sweaters and hats look like new!</li>
            <li> THEY BECAME LIKE NEW! :)</li>
            <li> Yay for not having to buy too many new maternity clothes!</li>
            <li> I love my new fabric shaver!</li>
            <li> One downside to my love of vintage sweaters is pilling, but this fabric shaver makes them look new again!  </li>
            <li> But sure enough, with this shaver and about 5-10 minutes on each sweater, they&#x27;re almost as good as new.</li>
            <li> It does take time to clean up garments, but it is well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> They work fine and really spiffy-ed up my wardrobe and some of my furniture also!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Just wish the head was a bit bigger so you could cover more clothing in less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: Superb.</li>
            <li> I was happy to try it out and was hoping that it would match a previous experience with an earlier version of this model which I loved.</li>
            <li> Since the top was trashed at this point, I continued so as to get practice for the next top.</li>
            <li> Overall a wonderful product would consider buying again if necessary .</li>
            <li> Luckily I stumbled across this</li>
            <li> It works well, but breaks rather quickly.</li>
            <li> purchase if you feel lucky - to be the one who gets the unit that is manufactured</li>
            <li> Love it and apparently it&#x27;s fun to use because my daughter wants to do everything.</li>
            <li> Just wish it had a cord since it goes through batteries quickly.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t damage the material at all and worked quickly.</li>
            <li> And with having kids fleece blankets always just getting thrown in a load of laundry quick</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and returns your clothes back to their former glory.</li>
            <li> The only device which I have that does better costs about 10 times more, and is not portable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and thorough.    </li>
            <li> throw it in your night stand and it will always be there for a quick cleanup before you put that sweater on</li>
            <li> Received quickly.</li>
            <li> The lint accumulates quickly and needs to be emptied often so as not to get clogged up.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and efficient.  </li>
            <li> KILL THE BATTERIES TOO QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> WILL TRY TO SUPER GLUE</li>
            <li> Seems to go through batteries quickly though.</li>
            <li> Super easy to clean, but don&#x27;t shake it about too much as the fuzz/debris that collects in the collection compartment does &amp;#34;dust out&amp;#34; a bit.</li>
            <li> Quick shipper.  </li>
            <li> It works great and fast, but watch out not too shave too close or you&#x27;ll make tiny holes in your clothes.</li>
            <li> I try it turns off just as quick as it turned on.  </li>
            <li> If I buy another one, I will likely try a more robust model with heftier blades that are able to cut through the thicker fabrics.</li>
            <li> but I did not expect for it to die so quickly.</li>
            <li> I honestly had low expectations since it was so cheap, but when it came in the mail</li>
            <li> It moves easily around the fabric and does a great job clearing those little fuzz balls!</li>
            <li> This little device is powerful - easy to use and very effective.  </li>
            <li> I needed a sweater shaver and read all the reviews on Amazon for the most highly rated products.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to someone or my friends if they have favorite coats that suffer from these fabric balls after wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all, I love this fabric shaver, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> My old bed was full of pills and though it did take some time to clean it out, the result was fabulous!</li>
            <li> This Remington does pick up pills, gets a very smooth shave, &amp; makes items look new.</li>
            <li> I have a little plastic defuzzer that I got free from the Gap that is most effective.</li>
            <li> By far the best 8 bucks I have spent!.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have had is cleaning out the fuzz in the very top of the shaver, it doesn&#x27;t just come out when you shake it.</li>
            <li> and I just would like to say I am VERY pleased with this product especially for its price.</li>
            <li> but it was pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad that I bought it and think I&#x27;ll just avoid fleece clothing in the future.</li>
            <li> This product broke the very first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Make sure your item is laid out on a flat surface, otherwise you will surely create a hole somewhere.</li>
            <li> It did a fantastic job without taking too much time!</li>
            <li> I have read a few reviews with similar issues, but seeing the great amount of good reviews you could think they were just one of those unlucky purchases.</li>
            <li> This did the exact job I bought it for, regardless of the fact that it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li> Much beloved sweaters that had long ago been banished to the wear-at-home-only category because of</li>
            <li> The unit keeps battery power well and is a good solution for minor pilling on knitwear.  </li>
            <li> I have looked for a long time for a good one.</li>
            <li> However, with this shaver, it was extremely easy to clean them up and make them look brand new!</li>
            <li> It works quickly and safely to restore things to their new condition.</li>
            <li> In a matter of minutes you can easily remove the &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; from you garment and have it looking like new!!</li>
            <li> For my purposes, I would like the shaver a little bigger and more powerful, but it does the job and is perfect for clothing.</li>
            <li> More significantly, this product has literally made many of my old jumpers and sweaters that I was about to throw away look almost brand new.</li>
            <li> It is quite fast and it was super easy to operate.</li>
            <li> but I find the cover where the lint stores comes off too easily and doesn&#x27;t do quite as good a job as the previous one I had</li>
            <li> This is a great size, comfortable to hold, large holding area for those little fuzz balls we all love so much.  </li>
            <li> I decided to limit my losses... why not try the cheap one with reviews as good or better as the more expensive models?  </li>
            <li> I love everything about this new one, including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it, it makes my clothes look new.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite new household gadget.</li>
            <li> The sweater is by no means brand new looking but better than it was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have been happier paying twice the price for a quality product than have to live with this cheap junk!</li>
            <li> , this will make it look new again :)</li>
            <li> My new FAVORITE tool to help me with my ebay sales.</li>
            <li> I bought new batteries just to make sure.</li>
            <li> I am glad to have this on hand for when I need it but it will not restore something to brand new.</li>
            <li> Surprising for the cheap price, it just zipped all those little fuzz balls right off!</li>
            <li> This shaver does a good job in most cases when it&#x27;s a small job.</li>
            <li> It is fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I know about this awesome small device thanks to my co worker.</li>
            <li> AND for the price, if this ones lasts a fourth as long, it is a great purchase!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s extremely easy to operate; you just gently rub it over your fabrics.</li>
            <li> Works well and is very compact for easy storage.  </li>
            <li> I did not know such things exist and was very happy to stumble upon this solution.</li>
            <li> with modern clothing and sweaters pilling more often than higher quality clothing from days of yore...</li>
            <li> This product is reasonably priced and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> My first impression was the power of this little toy, after I placed two AA 1900mAh freshly charged ENELOOP batteries the shaver showed incredible performance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Gave me a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; sweater on its first use!</li>
            <li> My favorite sweater defuzzer by far !</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I needed to remove pilling from sweaters!  </li>
            <li> This product worked so well for exactly what it is supposed to do!</li>
            <li> It really works!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I have been successful using it with other items after the incident.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Has lots of power and took away all of the balls that appeared on my sweater after I washed it the first time!  </li>
            <li> So when wanted to buy another one for a gift this was the logical buy!.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever done a product review!  </li>
            <li> This has been such a help to me, I love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The clothes don&#x27;t look brand new, but they do look a heck of a lot better, which makes this fabric shaver worth it.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well but doesn&#x27;t take off a lot of pills that aren&#x27;t the right size/height/shape to fit through its grill.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect this machine to be so easy and useful.</li>
            <li> This liitle machine works great for med-large cable knit sweaters to tight weave items like sweats and turtlenecks.</li>
            <li> It does rip some lighter fabrics if you don&#x27;t pull it as tight as you can, but it was also great at removing pilling.</li>
            <li> Certainly takes some of the age off some older garments!!!!</li>
            <li> The Remington Battery Operated Fabric Shaver performs adequately on most appropriate fabrics, but doesn&#x27;t clean the surface lint as closely or as quickly as other shavers I have used.  </li>
            <li> But so far it has been working fine!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very simple design and you can take it apart to clean very easily</li>
            <li> I used my new fabric shaver on few sweaters and the coat - works great, no holes :-)</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone who hates fuzzballs and wants to remove them easily and effectively.  </li>
            <li> Fine knit sweaters, it doesn&#x27;t really work at all.</li>
            <li> simple, easy to use, easy to clean out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the little thing in life that make you happy.</li>
            <li> Great little machine.</li>
            <li> This little thing is great.  </li>
            <li> I did accidentally put a hole in one of my shirts though, (going a little o.c.d with the thing) lol.</li>
            <li> Great little product.  </li>
            <li> Great little shaver.</li>
            <li> Great product, as advertised, used it for little fabric balls on cloth chairs.</li>
            <li> This little shaver works great to remove fuzz and pills.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little fabric shaver, I&#x27;ve had mine now for over a year</li>
            <li> Great little Christmas stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> I bought this to shave the little fuzzy pills off my sweaters, and it works great without any damage to the sweaters.  </li>
            <li> the little bugger does what it was intended to, no complaints and for a great price.</li>
            <li> This little gadget has been a great help with my wardrobe.</li>
            <li> Otherwise a great little fabric shaver.</li>
            <li> It is a great little shaver.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it as a good buy, but probably not for large jobs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful little detail that can help prevent many times when you&#x27;d have to bend down to clean up</li>
            <li> I had some nice sweaters and even a Patagonia &#x27;better sweater&#x27; that were saved by this little fabric shaver.</li>
            <li> It I faster and more effective to pick off each little pill off your sweater one by one.</li>
            <li> I received this handy little device for Christmas this year, and what a fantastic tool!  </li>
            <li> cheap little shaver works good.</li>
            <li> So yeah, it&#x27;s a little cheap, but it works really good for the price.  </li>
            <li> Nice little compact and easy to clean design.</li>
            <li> Because it was so cheap, I&#x27;m not terribly upset, but I would expect a little more than about a month of use.</li>
            <li> This is just nice to have, easy to empty and use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i ordered this product worth saving all your old sweaters that need a little tlc with this great product.</li>
            <li> It works great and has restored a few sweaters and towels in my home.</li>
            <li> Downside is I have to keep emptying it every few minutes since it works so great.</li>
            <li> This did great with my heavy wool coat.  </li>
            <li> Given the price, this is fantastic and works very well.</li>
            <li> I have a great pair of skinny dress pants I&#x27;ve had for quite a few years and just can&#x27;t part with them.</li>
            <li> I wear gloves everyday and this is great for getting rid of fuzzies that accumulate on them.</li>
            <li> delicates, far definitely better than the manual lint remover I have.  </li>
            <li> Very solid build, nice design</li>
            <li> I have these microfiber leggings I adore and wear constantly throughout the winter to stay warm.</li>
            <li> This shaver was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Glad I can ship this back for free though.</li>
            <li> Fun.  </li>
            <li> This is one of product worth your money.</li>
            <li> was definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this item is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> so it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> Certainly worth the money.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth having as part of your acceessories to keep your clothes looking well maintained.</li>
            <li> I got two and my 92 yr old neighbor and I both love it.</li>
            <li> Pretty good but hope the batteries can work for a long time.</li>
            <li> As you can get most of these items on eBay free shipping with the same price and you don&#x27;t need to me</li>
            <li> This thing isn&#x27;t powerful at all - it works for about two seconds and then dies.</li>
            <li> but it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Powerful</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money buy it........</li>
            <li> After a weeks worth of uses it broke on me, not the shaver itself but the cap.</li>
            <li> Works well enough we bought another for a friend who liked ours.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> Def worth the money.</li>
            <li> Who knew a grown man could have so much fun shaving off the lint balls off of sweaters.  </li>
            <li> How ever the price is really worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> My stepmother had one when I was a kid, and I always thought it was a lot of fun to shave my clothes... or the sheets... or even pillows.</li>
            <li> and I finally have my own fabric shaver.</li>
            <li> Only used it once so far, but worked great.</li>
            <li> Quieter, faster and more complete.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work as good as I expected it to</li>
            <li> I used it on my son&#x27;s Mickey blanket (the kind with the plush Mickey Mouse and satin back) and</li>
            <li> Still, i got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> For the price, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I deducted 2 stars for the tearing and noise, but gave it 3 out of the fact it can still be useful and is easier cleanup than a roller.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It also gives life to that old favorite sweater.</li>
            <li> I tried every scenario to achieve success.  </li>
            <li> Def well worth the price for this product</li>
            <li> Powerful and portable.</li>
            <li> For example an old sweater that&#x27;s seen better days.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> But then my favorite shirt is quite old, so it was probably quite worn out already.</li>
            <li> I paid about $8 for it and that&#x27;s about what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Useful product,</li>
            <li> Reasonably powerful</li>
            <li> It was better overall fit than this one.</li>
            <li> you know, like the kind I mentioned above that no one else would buy.</li>
            <li> It takes quite some time to completely shave a top.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, though, this is hardly worth complaining about.  </li>
            <li> Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I was more than surprised by the quality of this item.</li>
            <li> it was worth the price just to save that one sweater</li>
            <li> It works well and was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Changed batteries, and product was no longer useful.</li>
            <li> I remember when they were popular YEARS ago and a couch I recently purchased started getting the fuzz balls on it.  </li>
            <li> For the money it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> it might be useful but not for what i bought it for.</li>
            <li> Does the job that it was made for so the purchase was worth it.</li>
            <li> I like how it comes with a cover for the top of the shaver and how the area where the lint collects is clear.</li>
            <li> the money you save by getting this one will not be worth it with the amount of clothes you will ruin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shopping on Amazon (a lot) since the early  90s and this may be my favorite purchase.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Nice if it were bigger.</li>
            <li> If you have the patience and rechargeable batteries defiantly worth it.</li>
            <li> Powerful and compact.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It shouldn&#x27;t be used on thin fabrics, or it will be sucked up, but I am so impressed with how well this works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite fun also.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It works only on curtain kind of sweater.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> product was definitely worth the money (and then some).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit noisy like an electric razor but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Its worth what you pay for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the 9 bucks I paid for it</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful lil&#x27; gadget and works as described.  </li>
            <li> but I really liked the pillow case so this was my last resort.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> This just requires cleaning out more frequently than I would like, which leads me to #2...</li>
            <li> Be sure not to press it directly into the fabric.</li>
            <li> My old one (which was more of a square shape) never had this problem.</li>
            <li> should&#x27;ve spent a lil more to buy a better shaver ..</li>
            <li> Easy to clean by opening the clear holding bin on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Need to use it on my work shorts but also comes in handy after washing hoodies and such.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> so you have to work at it, but worth the price.</li>
            <li> Works better than my old one did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it with much success on my son&#x27;s fleeces.</li>
            <li> Success again.</li>
            <li> For the price, it was worth it to me to save a king-sized quilt from the garbage.</li>
            <li> Clear case shows how full it is, and is easily removed and replaced to empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use and small container holds a fair amount.</li>
            <li> Some user tips I&#x27;d offer: frequent cleanings are necessary to keep it running efficiently, be sure to unscrew the screen and clean blades (don&#x27;t cut yourself), don&#x27;t press the shaver to the garment-hover over it, and enjoy!</li>
            <li> I bought this after trying many other cheap ones, and for the  price, it works great and much better than my other old ones.</li>
            <li> but i use them to keep my black hoodies looking amazing!</li>
            <li> Other than that, I absolutely love it and am so glad I decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I.ve used other brands and they worked much better, guess i have keep looking for a better one</li>
            <li> I have used fabric shavers for a number of years now and find them indispensable for knitwear, especially wool sweaters that tend to pill easily and quickly.</li>
            <li> Uses up batteries pretty quick.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a powerful and effective tool to get rid of pilling, but that also means that if the fabric is not on a flat surface, or if it is crumpled, it can make a hole in your shirt.</li>
            <li> This shaver arrived quickly and worked very well!</li>
            <li> It works quickly with out clogging and makes the surfaces look smooth and new again.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you clean it out regularly.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the other fabric shaver I had.  </li>
            <li> I saw the other good reviews for this product</li>
            <li> Not as good a deviceas the other gadget I have used.  </li>
            <li> will other lint remover there is a good chance I will need them.  </li>
            <li> Other than that its a good shaver.</li>
            <li> JUST RIGHT</li>
            <li> she was right</li>
            <li> I just received this and started using it right away.</li>
            <li> I tested it on a rag before I used it on my blanket and it tore right through the material.</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> It works, cleans the pills right up.</li>
            <li> Others who purchased this item got it right.</li>
            <li> This takes them right off.</li>
            <li> but I had worn it out right through the metal screen.</li>
            <li> Sucked the material right into it and made a hole</li>
            <li> The power on this shaver is just right.</li>
            <li> I was right.</li>
            <li> the price is right and it works well for what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li> those pills right off.</li>
            <li> and yeah it cleared the lint right up</li>
            <li> So...what size hole in front of the blade is &#x27;just right&#x27;?  </li>
            <li> Dirt cheap, works like a charm, keeps clothes and furniture looking brand new!</li>
            <li> When I used the Remington Fabric Shaver on the fabric pills, they fell off easily into the shaver and my sofa looked new, again.  </li>
            <li> It easily removed every pill and my jacket looks like new again.</li>
            <li> But overall this is an amazing instrument, and I still can&#x27;t believe how reasonably it&#x27;s priced!  </li>
            <li> First, make sure you take off the clear cap on the shaver before using.</li>
            <li> Best $4.99 I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t damage the clothing and really does clean up all of the &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> pretty good quality not much of noise..</li>
            <li> What a great little shaver this is!</li>
            <li> This is a great little fabric shaver!</li>
            <li> This is a great little shaver!</li>
            <li> Totally does the job, very easily getting rid of &amp;#34;pilling.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> This little gadget is amazing!  </li>
            <li> This little shaver has successfully shaved my sweaters, shirts, sweats, even my bras without damaging them.  </li>
            <li> Old sweaters become new again with this handy product.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do so well on very large woven knit sweaters aand it picked a lot on those.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a very powerful shaver with a decent amount of suction.</li>
            <li> it fits comfortably in your  hand  easy to move around....and does make a big difference in the look of your garments.</li>
            <li> The shaver is simple and easy to use, is light, and works well.</li>
            <li> Depending on the type of fabric you are de-fuzzing, it can back up quickly and clog the blades at the top.</li>
            <li> It clogs up with wool fibers quickly though, but you can unscrew the top (the blue ring) and remove the perforated metal shield, and pick the wool balls with tweezers.</li>
            <li> I feel like an accomplished housekeeper maintaining my possessions with this easy to use and very portable product.</li>
            <li> Luckily it was at the bottom of a summer dress I mostly wear outside.  </li>
            <li> Put in brand new batteries &amp; it was working fine.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I cannot imagine how any of the more expensive ones could be any better.</li>
            <li> This product worked exactly as advertised and was worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> It looks dinky, but it is powerful and performs exactly the way it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> It completely reconditioned my favorite Columbia Sportswear &amp; Adidas fleece jackets and looking forward to wearing them again more regularly.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll be great for small projects tho.</li>
            <li> It works great on lighter materials like sweaters, but do not buy if you are hoping to remove fuzz, etc from a heavy coat!</li>
            <li> Small but works great.</li>
            <li> The motor has a soft buzzing sound, not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I figured I got a nice long life out of it before it needed replacing, so I went ahead and got another.</li>
            <li> Again, two minor things that haven&#x27;t stopped me from loving this thing.</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver does an adequate job and is certainly easier than picking fuzz by hand.  </li>
            <li> I have searched a long time, tried MANY products and lost many sweaters and other items because of the lintball al over..&lt;br /&gt;  This little unit works GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> It works good, just to small and have to continuously clean.</li>
            <li> Very impressed at how well this little device removed pills from several of my wool sweaters.  </li>
            <li> really sure why, as i made certain to clean it out well before next project.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good power and very good at removing those annoying balls of lint from my daughter&#x27;s dance tights.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers commented on the catch tray and battery covers coming off more easily than desirable</li>
            <li> The Amazon reviews were a huge help in choosing a new one.</li>
            <li> If you can get this Free shipping with the new \\&quot;Add-on items\\&quot; without PRIME, why would you still subscribe on PRIME.</li>
            <li> is smooth and looks almost brand new now.  </li>
            <li> When I pulled out my shaver on the pants, I cleaned them up in no time, they were as smooth as a silk, and they looked just as new as the name brand hoodie.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic and makes sweaters look like new.  </li>
            <li> I took about a half dozen sweaters that I loved, but were filled with pills and returned them to new.  </li>
            <li> It works great on both my light, thin cotton sweaters as well as the chunky knit wool sweaters.</li>
            <li> But for those few minutes it was actually working, it worked great!    </li>
            <li> However, in these,the \\&quot;motor\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t seen to be as strong as my old one, but it still works well</li>
            <li> Just wish it were bigger and a bit more powerful.</li>
            <li> It works great  when i first got it  seem so small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, this is a perfectly good product that will bring your old clothes back to life.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect this shaver to last more than the season, but it will have proved its worth well.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the same one I used to own, at a Reasonable price, so I got this one.</li>
            <li> The clear lint trap where the shavings go comes off so easily.</li>
            <li> the bally stuff from the material accumulates quickly inside the chambers ,so you can see its shaving very well...</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, item is described accurately, and it is very efficient and durable.</li>
            <li> I previously had a cheaper product that I loved but it began to rust</li>
            <li> I had so many old sweaters that I just wasn&#x27;t ready to give up yet</li>
            <li> It works great but one of the blades popped off while I was clearing the fuzz out and would not go back in properly.</li>
            <li> The shaver is very gentle on my most delicate fabrics while being incredibly effective at removing lint and pills.  </li>
            <li> I love this item and is small and easy to use!</li>
            <li> $6 is very worth the new life you will give your clothes.  </li>
            <li> You can certainly get bigger and better fabric shavers but for light duty and inexpensive this really gets it done.</li>
            <li> I expected it to work more than 2 times!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that the tiny inexpensive motor like the one in this model has limitations, and it&#x27;s wise to only use it for say, 20 min at a time.  </li>
            <li> The price was right and it&#x27;s a MUST have to get extra years off of your favorite pieces.</li>
            <li> Nice, small, easy to use.</li>
            <li> ;)&lt;br /&gt;It collects everything inside the clear chamber and is easy to dump into the trash.</li>
            <li> The reservoir fills relatively quickly and has to be emptied regularly, pretty much once</li>
            <li> It works very, very well.</li>
            <li> YOU ARE VERY GENTLE AND DONT PUT ALOT OF PRESSURE ON THE SHAVER.</li>
            <li> We would have been more happy with a larger more expensive version of this.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much, what a sweater saver.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle to the fabric as well.</li>
            <li> I found this on Amazon and it was very reasonably priced</li>
            <li> so it probably isn&#x27;t getting the kind of use that would wear the head down quickly.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended and the price is RIGHT, Bob!</li>
            <li> This shaver does a pretty good job but the part that holds the shavings tends to slip out of place and make a mess.</li>
            <li> This equipment becomes magical when I used the first time did not believe the results, made a short 5 years of use in looking for a new, fantastic.</li>
            <li> They will build up with fuzzballs over time and we have used this shaver on multiple occasions to do a perfect job of removing every single fuzzball so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made so many of my old clothes look new again!</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about how the shaver would work on synthetic fabric, but my jacket looks good as new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a good little machine.</li>
            <li> It does a good job at getting rid of the little fabric balls or pills or lint....</li>
            <li> Good little product.</li>
            <li> I really loved this little guy while it was still working, but I&#x27;ve had it three months</li>
            <li> OMG This little item works so good.  </li>
            <li> I was very happy to buy this item as it turned my old sweaters into new ones but soon after a week or so wool got clogged in the blades after very small amount of wool,however,u can clean it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and easy to empty.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to empty.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of pills so it did require multiple cleaning of the device as it got full, but that&#x27;s just fine.  </li>
            <li> Take the shaver for a quick spin over the clothing (like the pants mentioned above) and they can easily be sold on ebay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes gathers balls of wool in the blade chamber but the blades are easy to remove so this is only a mild nuisance.</li>
            <li> My only problem with the product is that the cap covering the shreddings slips off very easily and doesn&#x27;t hold much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy about this product, don&#x27;t press to hard</li>
            <li> it works great some hardly any difference.</li>
            <li> I have been impressed by how much stuff this little shaver can actually pick up.  </li>
            <li> Really works great, brings new life to things that looked worn out due to pilling.</li>
            <li> After I was done, my sweater looked new and clean.</li>
            <li> This product is so simple but makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li> The shaver is pretty lightweight and operates on two AA batteries which are not included.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friends &amp; it was exactly what she wanted &amp; needed.  </li>
            <li> Gets rid of those rough places in fabric and makes the item look really nice.</li>
            <li> It was delivered exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> and I hope it will last for many years.</li>
            <li> I received this item today and i must say it works exactly how it is supposed to work.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this item, it worked well until the guard broke into pieces.</li>
            <li> our local paper did an article on caring for cashmere sweaters and this product was mentioned as her favorite.  </li>
            <li> I actually purchased it to remove the piling on my sectional, and it works fantastic!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I hoped it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Runs on regular AA batteries - the size most of us have around the house.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> saved my favorite hoodie from looking all pilly and gross  </li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s not exactly a complicated device</li>
            <li> if it starts getting stuck, be sure to replace the batteries, as theyre probably running low on juice.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as described on jackets, coats, pants, and shirts</li>
            <li> Another draw back is the use of batteries,it would be a lot better if it were with an electric supply</li>
            <li> this motorized lint remover does the job exactly- restored a cotton shirt that looked shabby because of lint pills and made it look crisp again.</li>
            <li> I had a pair of fleece gloves that fuzzed all over and was ready to toss them out, but I came across this product, and it did wonders!  </li>
            <li> It does work and shaves lint off clothing, but in the future I would buy something better constructed.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, it destroyed one of my shirts.</li>
            <li> Pretty bummed out as I used it almost exclusively for a consignment sale</li>
            <li> Great for slacks and thick material shirts</li>
            <li> The shaver worked ok for the first two projects (both sweaters) - removed obviously visible pills and smoothed some (but not all) fuzz.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even test how well it would shave fuzz balls because it won&#x27;t work for more than one second.    </li>
            <li> It put 2 holes in the first t-shirt</li>
            <li> I used the fabric shaver for first time on the top and it did one terrific job!  </li>
            <li> This product works and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Once I finished, you couldn&#x27;t tell there was any fuzz there in the first place.   </li>
            <li> As my daughters calls it, this &amp;#34;defuzzerator&amp;#34; really works!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really think these sweater shavers work, but they do!</li>
            <li> I can just send it back and get my refund because Amazon&#x27;s customer service just outstanding.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s old satiny smooth condition.</li>
            <li> Exactly how you would imagine this to work.</li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> Used it from the first day I got it and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to take.</li>
            <li> small fabric shaver does an awesome job on big wool pillows to get the fabric balls off of them.  </li>
            <li> I either use with item on or pulled over my thigh to have fabric smooth, nearly taught, then shave with circular motion, checking blades occaionally for any lint to be removed.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> first I</li>
            <li> After years of kids and dogs, it was looking pretty dingy and \\&quot;hairy\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I opened this up and spent an hour going to town on everything I own from, sheets, to leggings, to the sweatpants on my body.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Made me very upset and weary of using it again!</li>
            <li> but the metal guard broke during the first use.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about the shaver at all, and if I ever needed another one would most likely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I thought at first that the product wasn&#x27;t working</li>
            <li> It is exactly as advertised and for the price I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> and I make sure to remove lint BEFORE it builds back up to the blades so the cleanup is easier.</li>
            <li> I found one finally :-)</li>
            <li> I have had many different sweater shavers through the years</li>
            <li> This thing works exactly as it should.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!</li>
            <li> I get scared it will overheat with how long I use it per session, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I have heard that Brookstone produced a similar product that holds up much better, but I don&#x27;t know if they are still making it.  </li>
            <li> For ages, I had relegated two of my favorite thumbhole hoodies to \\&quot;only wear in house\\&quot; status.</li>
            <li> She was pretty aggressive and holed a sweater.  </li>
            <li> It was not functioning with first use.  </li>
            <li> Is it possible to love a sweater shaver?</li>
            <li> I only was able to use once before it broke-</li>
            <li> As a last stitched effort, I ordered the shaver and am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only a bit more than the cost of dry-cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> This was many years ago when I was only a child and didn&#x27;t know how to respect dogs.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Funny side effect is making the dogs freak out.</li>
            <li> The last one I had was a gift from my mother, probably twenty or more years ago.</li>
            <li> I see fuzzballs on my clothes to make them instantly look better.</li>
            <li> and it really works!</li>
            <li> It works and does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li> My first fabric shaver</li>
            <li> After I took the recovery lid off the first time it had a problem attaching after that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on many different types of sweaters and shirts.</li>
            <li> have no idea ...... forever ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v had pretty much waaay too much fun &#x27;shaving&#x27;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on a variety of knits/fabrics, and while a bit more care is needed when using this shaver on raised details (such as cabling), or thinner fabrics</li>
            <li> , yeah, it does exactly what it advertises.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to rehash all the great reviews out there by trying to give the same information.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s higher quality, though, it hasn&#x27;t pilled yet.</li>
            <li> so I could be sure I had installed them properly.</li>
            <li> Shaves pretty well for it&#x27;s size (although the larger ones I&#x27;ve owned shave better).</li>
            <li> You do have to empty the fuzz catching compartment after 1-3 sweaters, depending on the condition of the sweater &amp; the type of fabric</li>
            <li> -- it was my first try using it.</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver does a fairly good job but isn&#x27;t really powerful enough to get off the big pills on a sweater.  </li>
            <li> does exactly what I thought it would do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I finally bought it.</li>
            <li> Be careful when using on cashmere items as it may snag and you will have a nice hole.</li>
            <li> and it pretty much saved it!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put too much pressure on the sweater, or it will eat it!</li>
            <li> It revived the garments I tried first</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it well.</li>
            <li> Terrible...didn&#x27;t work even first day</li>
            <li> Very convenient!</li>
            <li> Remington does not fail to meet my expectation for this item.</li>
            <li> Makes life much easier and some clothes can be kept longer!</li>
            <li> , I would absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> It was my fault, but it should be made aware that this can make holes in your shirts.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure over time it makes a big difference if each time I use it I help my clothes out a bit, so</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re patient, slow and read the instructions - this works great.  </li>
            <li> Only used it once but completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> (1-3x if I am doing a sweater for the first time).</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> For larger areas you&#x27;ll have to sweat more though.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> The shaving action is smooth and efficient.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need and expect.</li>
            <li> it was exactly what I needed to remove lint from my clothes without any harm to my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> it works great on thick sweaters .....</li>
            <li> Works enough to make a sweater or socks not visibly nubby from afar :)</li>
            <li> This was the first one I&#x27;ve ever purchased</li>
            <li> Fell apart the first time I tried to use it.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m one hundred percent pleased with this.</li>
            <li> This unit does exactly what it should</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver is okay, but I thought I ordered the bigger one....</li>
            <li> but it works okay for smaller things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing one now because this product actually, honestly, really works!  </li>
            <li> so I tried it on a pair of thin-ish athletic socks first</li>
            <li> After I turn it on and try it on the first sock it kept getting caught</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much I have used this since buying it!  </li>
            <li> Works much better than similar gadgets I&#x27;ve purchased in mass retail stores.</li>
            <li> This is my second sweater shaver, and I&#x27;m glad to have it.  </li>
            <li> needless to say she was very very impressed with its price and performance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on many different fabrics, including delicates, and have not encountered any problems with shaving the fabrics.  </li>
            <li> this is an absolute must-have device!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I use rechargeable batteries and am able to buzz several sweaters per charging session.</li>
            <li> Thinking of order more for holiday gifts later on.</li>
            <li> There were so many mixed reviews on this</li>
            <li> I have used it several times and also love it.</li>
            <li> , I was pretty underwhelmed when we opened it.</li>
            <li> Maybe would be better on different material</li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> This broke before I even finished my first sweater.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like it even better if it were a bit bigger and shaved faster.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I call it the fuzz eater - because it works very efficiently and is almost fun to use.</li>
            <li> It does exactly that.  </li>
            <li> First went over a pair of socks that always seem to come out of the dryer with nubbies all over them.  </li>
            <li> and i used it for the first time</li>
            <li> This shaver really works!</li>
            <li> Only praise. : )</li>
            <li> Using this method (which really should be used no matter WHAT type of fabric!)</li>
            <li> I bought my sofa 6 month ago and the balls comes in from the cloth in a few month, I buy this for my sofa, it works really good</li>
            <li> Tried it on a few pieces of non-delicate clothing and it did a good job there as well.  </li>
            <li> It does a fairly good job on heavy items eg: a coat....</li>
            <li> A few of my bed sheets needed a good shave</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver based on the reviews of others and WOW it sure made it look like new again.</li>
            <li> This thing makes my favorite old sweaters new again.</li>
            <li> Maybe I will have to go with the old known, better than the new to be known.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, trims effectively, easy to empty.</li>
            <li> Does a great job on the small fuzzies, though!</li>
            <li> It was unable to shave off some particularly mutant fuzzies, but for the most part did a great job.</li>
            <li> This one is just a lot more powerful, and the face holes are a bunch bigger, when I compared it with my older shavers.    </li>
            <li> It might be tedious on a really large job but is perfect for sweaters or armchairs.</li>
            <li> This is a very small shaver but has great strength.</li>
            <li> love this little thing, might order another one, wish there was free shipping though&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure the intended area is flat, so that no drapes get stuck in the blade.</li>
            <li> Make sure everything is flat, or else you might accidentally hit a crease and cut a hole in your fabric.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have the garment on a flat surface</li>
            <li> The blades are nice and sharp; I had no troubles.</li>
            <li> - Be sure to lay your clothes out on a flat surface when you use this.</li>
            <li> Make sure you lay the item of clothing on a flat surface before you begin because if there are any bumps, it could create a hole.</li>
            <li> Remington brand make good quality ones, I was just in a rush to get one, but usually go with ones that have the shaving holes bigger because it will pick up more fuzz.</li>
            <li> I make sure to lay my garment on a flat surface</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t make your clothes look brand new but certainly helps it from looking raggedy!!  </li>
            <li> I have successfully &amp;#34;restored&amp;#34; many of my sweaters to a like-new condition due to this little guy.</li>
            <li> The batteries, which were brand new Energizer brand, gave out in about 5 minutes and didn&#x27;t do a very thorough or clean job of clearing all the fuzz from my fabric.</li>
            <li> The shaver is easy to take apart to empty it or clean the fuzz out from around the blade.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it works great so far.</li>
            <li> More powerful than expected.  </li>
            <li> The battery compartment opened and closed easily, the diagram for the 2 AA batteries was readable and the lint compartment open and shut effectively.</li>
            <li> I ordered the remington fabric shaver to clean up some old sweaters.  </li>
            <li> The fuzz often gets caught in the blades and I have to clean it rather frequently</li>
            <li> Best small appliance I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely too powerful for light fabric</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a cheap and powerful lint remover.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure of its durability over time, but so far it has worked beautifully on some shirts and pj&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The compartment is very easy to detach and empty.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s awesome to see all the little balls of fabric that get collected after you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> This little dude is actually a lot more handy than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that the reserve pops off pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Even though you have to go over some areas several times, this is pretty easy to use and it will eventually work.</li>
            <li> I find it works best if you put the sweater on a hard flat surface.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, event with this, my overlall evaluation is positive.</li>
            <li> I am very cautious when I use this, but it has worked really well!</li>
            <li> it seems to suck through the battery pretty fast...</li>
            <li> My last fabric shaver was a LOT better but broke after several years and is no longer available.</li>
            <li> It works very well and not expensive.  </li>
            <li> Takes a long time, but its better than this junk.</li>
            <li> will see how long it lasts after doing some more items.</li>
            <li> For a  cheap thing that you don&#x27;t need to use often, it serves the purpose, but barely.</li>
            <li> But it is pretty intense.  </li>
            <li> It works very well, and it is exactly what we needed to save some of our clothes.</li>
            <li> but it can pretty much work on everything.</li>
            <li> RUNNING IS MORE THAN THE COST OF THE SHAVER IN THE LONG RUN.</li>
            <li> have a lot more material to shave, and I&#x27;ll see how it does in the long run.</li>
            <li> Be aware that these type shavers are really designed for heavier type fabrics (think of sweaters, comforters, socks...)</li>
            <li> Always a good idea to have one on hand these days since we are so lazy and just through everything in the wash/dryer.</li>
            <li> Works really well, just make sure you use it on a flat surface.</li>
            <li> i had a knitted sweater that i loved but never wore because of all the small lint balls on it.</li>
            <li> Would be good to travel with if needed because of the small size.</li>
            <li> only thing I&#x27;d change on this unit is making the battery compartment cover click closed better &amp; the lint trap can come off easily, but those are little things considering how good this thing works.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use, and all my sweaters that were looking vaguely old now look new again.  </li>
            <li> I was having pretty good luck with this on two or three hoodies until this morning, when it cut a nice sized hole right in the middle front of my expensive cashmere sweater.  </li>
            <li> It works really however if you have a lot of lint on your sweater you will need to clean it out frequently.  </li>
            <li> It did an amazing job with NO pulls and I pressed very hard because some of these were older sweaters with many &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and so far no problems, highly reccomd for a cheap one you cant beat it</li>
            <li> This little shaver has made it look so much better!  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is the cover for the battery compartment slides off really easily when you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> The back that hold the batteries in comes off easily...</li>
            <li> The only issue is the lint catcher and battery cover come off way too easily when you don&#x27;t want them to.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what i expected it to do plus more.</li>
            <li> Plus it was easy to use and uses regular batteries.</li>
            <li> The pill catcher tends to slip off easily, but not enough of a problem that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the covers for the batteries and the lint trap slide off a bit too easily while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> Works with 2 batteries, fits easily into your hand and is very simple to use!</li>
            <li> Simple, easy to use and intuitive.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised, and thought maybe it just uses batteries up quickly.</li>
            <li> Takes fabric ends off quite easily and occasionally needs to be emptied.</li>
            <li> It has been used often and on some rough materials and other than needing to be cleaned out fairly often hasn&#x27;t given me any issues!</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for the battery cover and blue compartment coming off so easily during use, I would have rated this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, easy to use, total no brainer of a purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the item, very comfy design but delivery seemed to take a long time though.</li>
            <li> I figured if it ruined them (as some feed back indicated the suction was too strong)</li>
            <li> The batteries lasted for clearing the entire bed and still going strong.</li>
            <li> how long this will last, but it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> large enough holes without pulling in the fabric, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> 10-12 pair of extremely pilled athletic socks now look &#x27;like new&#x27; thanks to this great little product - and the first pair of AA batteries are still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I can adequately express in words my love for this humming little wizard.</li>
            <li> I used this right away on a nice shirt of mine and did not lay the shirt out flat enough</li>
            <li> Batteries ran down kind of fast.  </li>
            <li> Still better than having to vacuum or otherwise clean up all the shavings from a regular sweater stone.</li>
            <li> I have and electric blanket that got these burgundy balls in quite a large section from a comforter that shed.</li>
            <li> Gonna order the large size too</li>
            <li> Takes a while for large garments, but it gets it done.</li>
            <li> ON CERTAIN MATERIALS</li>
            <li> anyways it works and used on certain cloth</li>
            <li> sometimes it stops if the fuzz ball is too large to shave.....</li>
            <li> Also this takes 2 AA BATTERIES, so make certain to order some, too.</li>
            <li> As others have said, the holes are on the large side, so use with care.</li>
            <li> My mom had a large Remington brand fabric shaver for years and years</li>
            <li> Certainly hasn&#x27;t been my experience.</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it overall and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> You can tell by the sound that in comparison to other shavers, this one is superior to any other.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re using it on heavy knits you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a satisfying feeling to de-pill my fleece sweaters and make them look like new again.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was going to have to buy a new duvet cover until this fabric shaver was able to remove all the big lint ball tufts and return my duvet to</li>
            <li> My seat were starting to show wear after years of use and this unit was able to remove all the unsightly pills and bring the suede leather insert looking new again.</li>
            <li> That means that you are going to be able to get rid of the fuzz that forms on a new sweater, but you will still be picking any big, unsightly pills off with your fingers.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s back to new love it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve already read the reviews about how this shaver extends the life of clothing by making it look new again, thereby allowing you to get more years out of your current clothing and thus saving money.</li>
            <li> Always surprised how light weight the new products have become and feel flimsy.  </li>
            <li> This piece of small device is quite handy to remove fuss and threads in sweaters, woolen hand gloves and other fabric in a smooth and easy manner.</li>
            <li> I even decided to run it over the lower back of some of my polos (a typical place for pills to accumulate) and it worked great.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone who hates fuzzballs and wants to remove them easily and effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We had some old shavers that were a hassle, they were easily over 10 years old.</li>
            <li> as effective is a gentle wire bristled clothing brush (have had one for ions) moved gently up and down the sweater.</li>
            <li> Well I cant afford new furniture right now</li>
            <li> I started using this shaver right after taking it out of the box with new batteries.</li>
            <li> Completely restored three $200+ sweaters to like new upon my first use!!</li>
            <li> However, the metal used to make the shaver head is extremely fine, and a section of mine broke off with the pressure of using the device, within a very short time.  </li>
            <li> perfect little tool to shave away those little lints that form on clothes.</li>
            <li> I have some clothes (blouses, especially) that I&#x27;ve owned for 5+ years and look fine aside from the pilling that comes with age.</li>
            <li> I found this works better for smoother knit wool fabric with finer fibers and less texture and the stone works better for larger sweaters with coarser fibers.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent fabric shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought it for two particular shirts, and I was nervous to use it and ruin my shirts based on some reviews - but the shirts looked pretty rotten as they were,</li>
            <li> and they often had a very high pitched whine to the motor.</li>
            <li> For some reason it really frightens my relatively large (90lbs) dog.</li>
            <li> The holes are large and the blades are very close to the screen.</li>
            <li> IT worked amazing, and I can wear my jacket now because it took all the little balls off it.</li>
            <li> This little shaver is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing little tool.</li>
            <li> I had those little fuzz balls all over my couch and this amazing product took them all off.</li>
            <li> This little gadget does what I needed it to do, and that was to de-pill and de-fuzz two, long-styled sweaters that I own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little tool.</li>
            <li> I purchased this fabric shaver after some of my dress shirts (The kind of work, weddings, etc) started to develop a ton of little lint balls on them.  </li>
            <li> Has a nice little cover for the shaver head.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lightweight, inexpensive, handy little fabric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I tried it more delicate clothing, and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> Pretty basic, takes a while to really clean a sweater that has a lot of pilling off.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone interested in buying a product of this nature.</li>
            <li> this item is a very good item dont get me wrong.    </li>
            <li> sweater shaver is a simple little thing, lightweight, for a great price.</li>
            <li> Thought it could have been a little more powerful.</li>
            <li> I love this little machine - it is compact but powerful.</li>
            <li> When the shaver starts to sound &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; as if the battery was running down, that&#x27;s the time to clean it out.  </li>
            <li> It does not actually take most of the little pills off of a sweater, but I suppose better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much since I paid so little for it, I just needed something easy to clean up my husbands coat.</li>
            <li> Obviously not going to be as powerful as a larger device, but great for travel and small clean ups.</li>
            <li> Really, how hard would it be to make that part more secure?</li>
            <li> but did clean them up to nearly looking like new.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad noisy and the container gets filled too fast in my opinion but those are the only drawbacks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably great for cotton stuff, but if you&#x27;re looking to doctor up big fluffy sweaters this did not work for me.</li>
            <li> So far it is delicate on clothes and does its job great.</li>
            <li> I got this for my babies woolie covers, but I ended up spending the entire day defuzzing this huge sweater</li>
            <li> /&gt;- light enough to carry in your travel bag to use when needed&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> the sweater I am &amp;#34;defuzzing&amp;#34; has so much to defuzz that it will take some time</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t need to stretch the fabric much with the shaver, so it seemed much kinder on the garments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S SHAVES EXTREMLY FAST</li>
            <li> Until a family relative told us that there in Europe she uses a fabric shaver, we decided to buy a cheap one to test it.</li>
            <li> really fast-</li>
            <li> and my wife really likes it.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I immediately went through all my sweaters &amp; got straight to work .</li>
            <li> I could have paid $25 or more for a shaver that might not work as well as expected.  </li>
            <li> It has made my wool coat of 6 years look much newer.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY</li>
            <li> just gently glide it over your clothes or else</li>
            <li> It really took off all of the lint balls.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping  </li>
            <li> ;works very well..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done 2 whole sweat suits and havnt changed battery&#x27;s yet.</li>
            <li> It put holes in every test fabric/clothing of different weights, no matter how light a hand I used.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item if you have knits you want to revive!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try it on anything light, just for winter fabrics, but I could tell it would definitely do some damage on thinner material.</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> Even though the metal cover seems to be for protection purpose, however, be very cautious when using it.</li>
            <li> Dont let the size fool you, it has a lot of power and works really well.</li>
            <li> , it did make a whole</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This shaver is very convenient....</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Everything was fast.  </li>
            <li> It works well and looks very sleek.  </li>
            <li> I really like how the receptacle works and how it is see-through.  </li>
            <li> I did the whole couch</li>
            <li> but it really works well.</li>
            <li> My coats look SO MUCH nicer without those fabric balls.</li>
            <li> Time consuming to do a whole sweater.</li>
            <li> Product is great, I&#x27;ve used on several different things / different materials and no problems.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely blown away.  </li>
            <li> Very affordable.  </li>
            <li> You just graze the fabric gently and let the shaver do the work.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this!  </li>
            <li> You have to focus too much on trying to hold it without knocking the covers off.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Is this really what it is?</li>
            <li> Really rejuvenated my clothes.</li>
            <li> Batteries not included and the fuzz catcher is very convenient....</li>
            <li> I was stunned at how much lint was caught in the collector on the front.</li>
            <li> It can be time consuming depending on how much balls are on the sweater</li>
            <li> Removes lint and fabric balls really well cleaned the neck around my hoodies.</li>
            <li> I bought this to see if it could really remove pills like everyone was saying.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s about how much pressure you put.</li>
            <li> I had never even heard of this devise and researched the comments and then really just took a chance.</li>
            <li> it lasted a whole 30 min before biting the dust.  </li>
            <li> Does the job much better than expected</li>
            <li> It takes a light touch to use any shaver properly.</li>
            <li> Works very well on a variety of fabrics.</li>
            <li> but once I received it and began using it I came to find that a wire that plugged into the wall would have gotten in the way-- much like the wire from an iron.  </li>
            <li> This thing really works.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t remove much of the fuzz, believe me.&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really wanting to buy this product, but when I reach the checkout page, it displays a photo for the RTFS-100.  </li>
            <li> Put it through the paces upon receipt and performed very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this one really does shave off the pills!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This thing works very well.</li>
            <li> This is inexpensive and a really neat tool to have.</li>
            <li> Using this and seeing how much comes off</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I was especially surprised as I didn&#x27;t have much expectation given such an cheap price.</li>
            <li> This does absolutely nothing to remove fuzz from any piece of clothing or textile.  </li>
            <li> Anyway why i have to say so much to grade this shaver...</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t cover as much area as the jumbo one did.</li>
            <li> The shield prevents snagging on most fabrics if you are careful.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This razor did not help much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> This fuzz buster really works.</li>
            <li> They remove fuzz and lint balls very well.  </li>
            <li> it worked very well and didn&#x27;t cut into the fabric.</li>
            <li> My whole family is hooked on this thing.  </li>
            <li> and I was about ready to throw them out.</li>
            <li> Only takes primary (non-rechargeable) AA batteries.  </li>
            <li> really wanted it for my wool sweaters and coats</li>
            <li> and that seemed to solve the problem of it nipping too much fabric.</li>
            <li> Cost was reasonable also.</li>
            <li> I bought it to shave the pills off of our courdaroy-style fabric couch, but it really doesn&#x27;t put a dent in them.</li>
            <li> I no longer have all the much polyester, but my synthetic socks do get pills.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li> The batteries go fast.</li>
            <li> This device the whole family enjoys.</li>
            <li> Works very well and can get very close to fabric without putting a hole in your clothes.</li>
            <li> It works really well and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> The battery is consumed fast</li>
            <li> This product really accomplishes the purpose of removing the fuzz and pills.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;twork very well</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so satisfying to see all the &amp;#34;pilling&amp;#34; come off into the compartment that catches the fluff.</li>
            <li> all my sweaters (I really like sweaters).  </li>
            <li> Gently pass it across.</li>
            <li> I felt very cheated.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from a $6 lint remover</li>
            <li> The quality is very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is just another item of cheap Chinese junk.</li>
            <li> Very compact and efficient.</li>
            <li> I really wish I&#x27;d kept the packaging to return this junk.</li>
            <li> but it is very convient for travel.</li>
            <li> Operated better than expected.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended !</li>
            <li> I figured if it was a dud, it wasn&#x27;t much money lost.</li>
            <li> do have to be careful to make sure there isn&#x27;t a thread sticking out of your item</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li> We have used it on furniture and sweaters and it really has improved their appearances</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and product was as described.</li>
            <li> This product works very well and seems to be made durable.  </li>
            <li> Product does not work very well.</li>
            <li> I used it on a really fuzzy baby blanket.  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really do the trick.  </li>
            <li> It really does renew my sweaters.</li>
            <li> About a year ago I bought a similar thing for a cheap price, after a week</li>
            <li> It gets rid of the fuzzies and has not broken.</li>
            <li> i think it holds up real well</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it much yet</li>
            <li> I have to say I did not expect much when I bought this unit</li>
            <li> Gently press on and just swirl it around</li>
            <li> This battery-operated lint remover works very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> After cleaning 3-4 sweaters, intensely.</li>
            <li> really need to spend some time shaving sections in order to see them &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;,</li>
            <li> This is a very efficient tool for depilling knitted goods to keep them new-looking.</li>
            <li> I had 5 or 6 sweaters that I was ready to basically give to Goodwill</li>
            <li> I have been looking for one of these for awhile, does its job very well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Worked a lot better than expected.</li>
            <li> Removes pills from sweaters very well ?</li>
            <li> It took a while to shave the whole shirt</li>
            <li> I have saved sooo much money in sweaters since buying this.  </li>
            <li> works very well</li>
            <li> , empty it often or the fuzz won&#x27;t be able to fall and will not allow it to work as efficiently.</li>
            <li> This worked very well in removing them.</li>
            <li> Really dissapointed with this product.</li>
            <li> The batterie power is just enough to do light pill take away.</li>
            <li> They seem to be making clothes out of cheaper and cheaper fabrics (but the prices keep going up) and everything seems to pill no matter how much you pay for it.  </li>
            <li> It works really well, and has already paid for itself by saving my dress.</li>
            <li> It was also very well priced.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I need to go over an extra linty area 10 times for it to be lint free.  </li>
            <li> it works really well</li>
            <li> Thanks again</li>
            <li> It works much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I keep replacing them every couple of months though, because they have a real problem with pilling.</li>
            <li> really like these.</li>
            <li> Sure, there was absolutely no reason to do that</li>
            <li> this goes through them fast.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see myself getting much use of this on items like shirts or blouses.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Considered this is very affordable and inexpensive</li>
            <li> With the elongated handle I didn&#x27;t feel I had as much control.</li>
            <li> But it can be very time consuming to do.  </li>
            <li> It also seems gentle on clothes.</li>
            <li> this thing didn&#x27;t really work...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to all sweater lovers!</li>
            <li> But it should be noted; no one wants the fuzz going everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You should only lightly hover over the fabric.</li>
            <li> Much gentler on delicate knits, but still powerful and effective on dense wools and cashmere.</li>
            <li> REASONABLE AND RELIABLE.</li>
            <li> tried picking at them, but how in the world are you ever gonna get the whole sweat shirt done,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It really has helped remove all the lint balls from my slacks and workout clothes.  </li>
            <li> Fast service and neat packaging</li>
            <li> Works really well on pilling pants, sweaters, etc.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> It operates very well</li>
            <li> cheap , last and does the job.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It works fast and hasn&#x27;t cut anything yet.</li>
            <li> This Remington fabric shaver worked very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily to bring life back into wool sweaters.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Absolutely.</li>
            <li> Cleans up the wool covers really well.</li>
            <li> Had i spent more time i probably wouldve gotten them all.</li>
            <li> The replacements either didn&#x27;t work straight out of the package or fell apart after one use.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend for every home!</li>
            <li> Really couldn&#x27;t be easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the stone and the comb, but this really does the job.</li>
            <li> Very time consuming process..</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> Works really well to take off the pulls and</li>
            <li> the (what look like) dust bunnies but are just fabric that got rubbed too much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Like damn a shaved my whole comforter with this s</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the reviews on this product I got it</li>
            <li> It was better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> The battery cover doesn&#x27;t stay on very well.  </li>
            <li> Batteries ran out fast</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve practiced putting ten holes in my top.</li>
            <li> It was somewhat heavy not too much where my hand was aching but a nice feel to it.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t last forever, but try to take good care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be careful with clothing.</li>
            <li> The lint chamber is small and needs to be emptied frequently--instructions say it should not ever be more than 3/4 full.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if it came with an extra blade or options to purchase extra blades.</li>
            <li> So far so good, after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> All in all a great little gadget especially for the price, which is less than most fast food meals!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to everyone that likes looking fresh and new with no lint or fuzziness to their garments.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would be as powerful as it is due to its size, but its just fine for my sweaters.</li>
            <li> The clear part that holds the shavings is easy to remove, but one tip: empty it before it gets full.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the fact that this little magic shaver has larger holes in the head as I think another reviewer mentioned and that allows it to gather more of the fuzzy stuff and pills.  </li>
            <li> The container does fill up pretty quickly and I have on occasion pushed it open by accident and spilled the fuzz.</li>
            <li> This little wonder has done an amazing job on all of my sweaters and fleece items, they look brand new!</li>
            <li> It just tore a hole in a new sweater the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I wanted this to cut off the balls that roll up on my sweater that is pretty new.  </li>
            <li> I took my black light and shone it on my sofa after all the lights were turned out, and wow - what a lot of little pills &amp; fuzzies that showed up glowing bright white under the ultra-violet light!  </li>
            <li> The clear compartment where the shaved fuzzies go is less than secure though and it comes detached easily, but I just wrapped a hair band around it to solve that issue.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and the blades stay sharp longer than most that I have used.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my sister who asked for one for her birthday, so there isn&#x27;t much I can say about it since I left it in it&#x27;s original packaging so that I can wrap it.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the other reviews that it is only good on heavier materials.</li>
            <li> No its not fancy, and yes takes all of about 25 min to do a large heavily pilled hoodie, but i actually found it kinda relaxing and mostly amusing!</li>
            <li> this product is perfect, mine was not package properly so it came with a little crack which was minor.</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver saved a couple of my favorite sweaters that were in the giveaway pile...and it was kind of fun to watch this thing quickly transform them from aged looking, pill covered sweaters well past their prime back to almost new looking ones.  </li>
            <li> This shaver works very well, but you have to clean it constantly (3 or 4 times per sweater) and it devours batteries.</li>
            <li> Little doors for the batteries and where the shavings go fall off very easily while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other hand held pill removers that have worked much better.</li>
            <li> Better than any other I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li> On most other things, this works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about how this product was going to turn out, due to some of the \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; being \\&quot;1 or 2 star\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Fuzz catches underneath blades too often due to buildup of pieces that aren&#x27;t able to go into storage compartment.   </li>
            <li> I originally purchased it to shave the occasional fuzz ball off of my sofa, but it couldn&#x27;t take out any of them.</li>
            <li> product made the sweater looks almost brand-new as well as many other children&#x27;s close that were going to be thrown out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used in on many other cloths,  </li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I looked at many other shavers before selecting this one.  </li>
            <li> sure enough I added this to my cart because of the recognizable name and low price combination.</li>
            <li> I am planing to return it, but I don&#x27;t know how it will work with all this policy of unopened or in the original package, since this one you have to actually break (the package) in order to get out the product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this model based on other reviews and was really pleased with it&#x27;s efficacy.</li>
            <li> It did a very good cropping on the acrylic sweater and fairly good (left a few little pills that are not very visible) on the fleece sweater jackets.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This worked GREAT the first two times we used it but with the THIRD use it started making an odd squealing noise and now it&#x27;s barely working.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pressing pretty hard against a book and it did catch one of my nice sweaters and created a hole.  </li>
            <li> I just tested this item on very nubby cotton/spandex gloves that I wear often and now they look brand new!  </li>
            <li> People are right if you push too hard you can damage fragile or thin fabrics but for the most part its really just awesome.</li>
            <li> Simple to use and clean out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to take out and the price was great.</li>
            <li> particular brand has worked really well for me for over 10 years-- and this purchase was a gift</li>
            <li> Great product and packs a punch for such a small device.</li>
            <li> It can be open all the part to clean.</li>
            <li> Who knew such a small, inexpensive item could make someone that happy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, light, and fits comfortably in my hand.  </li>
            <li> But my old one worked better, the holes in the metal top were a little bigger, so the fabric balls could get inside and be cut off.  </li>
            <li> Would subtract 1/2 star because in downward position, working item on flat surface, gravity causes contents of storage compartment to compact near blades...and compartment seems apt to detach during use (will just secure with tape as I had to do with previous model).</li>
            <li> The only down side is it takes a while to do a good job.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I had accumulated many, many clothing items that looked completely worn out after only a few wears.  </li>
            <li> You do have to be careful as it&#x27;s very powerful, but it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes of this handy gadget, my sport coat and sweaters looked like new.  </li>
            <li> Best on less delicate items.</li>
            <li> I use this not only on sweaters but on an old couch that tends to pill easily.  </li>
            <li> The fuzz container also comes open quite easily and frequently during use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> One down fall is that the lint lint collecting bin thing does come off pretty easy while using it</li>
            <li> Not sure what other folks are doing, but this has worked brilliantly on everything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really a lazy housekeeper and about as far as obsessively tidy as you can get, but I now understand why people would be interested in depilling all of their cloth, household items.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the money I spent on it, but it only does an OK job removing pills and fuzz from fabric.</li>
            <li> It fits really nicely in your hand and just requires 2 AA batteries which are easier to replace (since i usually have them lying around) than the C batteries that some shavers require.</li>
            <li> Love simple and cheap solutions to everyday problems...</li>
            <li> I am sure that there are other more expensive products out there that would work better for the price and what I needed it for, it does the job.</li>
            <li> It did such a good job that it has made the color come back when I thought the fabric was actually faded.</li>
            <li> Makes your cloths look new, like new!!.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a small head, so it takes a little more time than some of the bigger more expensive models, but it&#x27;s perfect for a quick once over.</li>
            <li> It removed most of them down to the original, flat surface level.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that this fabric shaver is very cheap, it took me several weeks of consideration before I finally decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I have ever loved a cheap little product this much.</li>
            <li> This may go down as one of the most &amp;#34;is this real?&amp;#34; inventions i have ever</li>
            <li> I love this little sweater (and many other items) shaver</li>
            <li> This is good for traveling but for everyday home use this may be too small and can fall apart (lint bin) easily.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it gets full in the top section too quick and stops working</li>
            <li> This does a good job of removing the fuzzies, but it also munched a little hole in the middle of my sweater.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems a little delicate, but is working perfectly</li>
            <li> It now looks and feels like new!</li>
            <li> but if you take your time, the sweater comes out looking new!  </li>
            <li> If you do buy it don&#x27;t use it on anything you can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li> Keeps sweaters looking new!</li>

            <li> Now the sheets feel like new!</li>

            <li> My sweaters/sweatshirts look like new again!</li>

            <li> I used it on some of my sons clothes &amp; they almost feel like new again!  </li>
            <li> Managed to make a year-old lambswool sweater look practically new!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made them look like new again!</li>
            <li> Sofa looks like new!</li>

            <li> This removed the pills &amp; pulls and made his shirts look like new!</li>
            <li> My sister in law borrowed it to remove excess fuzz and lint from a hat, it looks brand new!</li>
            <li> New life has been added to my closet!</li>
            <li> My pea coat and a bunch of my sweaters look brand new again!</li>
            <li> It makes my clothes look like new!</li>
            <li> SWEATER LOOK BRAND NEW!  </li>
            <li> Made it all look like new!</li>
            <li> My coat looks brand new now!  </li>
            <li> Clothes look new again!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to and quickly shaves the little fabric bumps right off the clothes.</li>
            <li> Wish it was able to filter the lint/shaved pieces down a bit better to last a bit longer before emptying/cleaning would be necessary.</li>
            <li> Have the same one I bought years ago, blades stay sharp, easy to remove cover to clean.  </li>
            <li> Works very well and now my sweaters look new again.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to use and makes sweaters and woolen products look like new.</li>
            <li> I got a lot of my clothes to look brand new again especially my old fleeces.  </li>
            <li> Before buying it I was ready to get rid of some clothes but after using this fabric shaver it&#x27;s like a new life was brought to those pieces.  </li>
            <li> (no tearing of the sweater, which really did look like new afterwards).</li>
            <li> Keep this in your laundry room, and you will see how much you need this, I used my for kids cloth and keep it like new.</li>
            <li> It sucks up all the pills and fuzz; my old sweaters look good as new!</li>
            <li> The only downside to this amazing fabric shaver is that you have to empty the chamber quite often.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold and with the see through lint compartment, you know when to empty.  </li>
            <li> My favorite black sweater...</li>
            <li> Easy to use and empty out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and empty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to empty.</li>
            <li> It is easy to remove and empty the fuzzy catcher.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The residue falls into the collector on the shaver and easy to detach to empty.  </li>
            <li> The lint compartment falls off easy, however and you have to empty often.</li>
            <li> I previously had a $4 fabric shaver that worked much better</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it often, but it always works well, and it&#x27;s easy to empty.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to tell when it&#x27;s time to empty.</li>
            <li> It is easy to empty and even easier to use.  </li>
            <li> but after multiple uses and on bigger fabrics with more fuzzballs, I was amazed</li>
            <li> My main concern is the container is made of plastic</li>
            <li> This one just arrived and I tried it on three items:  a fraying silk tie, fraying shirt collars, and the pills on a fleece jacket (the main reason I bought it).  </li>
            <li> If I later find problems with it, I&#x27;ll be sure to come back and revise this review.</li>
            <li> So far works really well on my sweaters without shaving off too much or getting stuck on the fabric.</li>
            <li> Straight out of the package with a fresh pair of batteries installed, the thing worked for one second.  </li>
            <li> I actually placed an order for a larger one that is not battery operated, but use this one much more often.  </li>
            <li> Did a decent job when it was working.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t particularly like the shape.</li>
            <li> I shave off some particularly gnarly lint balls off of a thermal sock.</li>
            <li> No seriously.</li>
            <li> Also, if I was lucky enough to have it pick one up, the shaver would clog and stop.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you actually take off the cap before you actually use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my older Remington fabric shaver gave out.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t hold as much as my older one.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my particular piece?</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase this and would make the jump to something more expensive and hopefully more efficient.</li>
            <li> read all of the reviews here and got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on an older zip-up sweat shirt</li>
            <li> Otherwise, decent product.</li>
            <li> super product...gives 2nd life to pilled sweaters!  </li>
            <li> and it quickly put a big hole in it to the point that I had to throw the sweater out.</li>
            <li> I looked around in my local stores for a while before finally buying online, and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to use this particular one myself.  </li>
            <li> I was considering buying a much more expensive electric shaver, but I&#x27;m glad I followed the reviews and didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> My refund should be quick once they get it back.  </li>
            <li> This little baby makes them very smooth and presentable again.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few years ago and it worked pretty great until it suddenly stopped working for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very loud though, but gets the job done!</li>
            <li> great for shaving all those little balls off your sweater and other clothing.  </li>
            <li> Worked fairly well... until it made a whole in my favorite shirt.. :(</li>
            <li> I left them in the boxes until I got the shaver, then washed them all and shaved them one right after the other, molding the sweaters to my knees first and using a light touch.</li>
            <li> The battery cover does not snap on tightly and comes off very easily and frequently during use.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Would highly recomend this one.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>

            <li> The device consists of 3 high speed spinning blades...if you dont use it with care then yes, your garment will see the effects.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I tried light pressure, moved it left to right, and as long as it does not TOUCH the sweater</li>
            <li> Works as long as you keep it clean and don&#x27;t overload it.</li>
            <li> Be sure to lay your item as flat as possible.</li>
            <li> Definitely make sure to use this on a flat surface.</li>
            <li> One note of caution, be careful on fine fabrics and it will pull the material.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this little \\&quot;magic shaver.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon...I was surprised when I searched your site and found them as I&#x27;ve been hunting for a couple of years for a new one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this little shaver for about 9 months now, and have used it on all sorts of fabrics -- not just sweaters but t-shirts, socks, sheets, and more.</li>
            <li> The little &amp;#34;vacuum&amp;#34; really makes the little pills and snags stand up, and the clippers work great.  </li>
            <li> Sure saves a lot of time and makes items I hadn&#x27;t worn for a while wearable since all the little nubs are removed.</li>
            <li> I have been meaning to buy a fabric shaver for a while, and with some of my favorite clothes getting a little worn-looking, it was time.</li>
            <li> life savor little gadget :-)</li>
            <li> Love this little shaver.</li>
            <li> and I love my little fabric shaver...</li>
            <li> While it looked a little better, I still couldn&#x27;t remove all the pilling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am never throwing away old clothes again!!</li>
            <li> I used this first on a coat that had major pilling.  </li>
            <li> Just wish the lint catcher held a little more....</li>
            <li> This little gadget is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Love this little thing.</li>
            <li> My neighbor lent me her inferior shaver and after an hour of little result I decided to purchase a better one myself.</li>
            <li> My couch looks so much better thanks to this little shaver!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite small, so if covering large areas it can take some time for sure.</li>
            <li> The shaver is a good idea, but this in particular is not powerful, and is not working like I expected</li>
            <li> The motor is strong and the blades are sharp.</li>
            <li> The couch now looks almost new and has at least 10 more years ahead!</li>
            <li> Now instead of buying new pants, they look like new!</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited about this device for a while until I decided to use it on my $200 black peacoat.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I paid less than ten bucks for this thing - I absolutely LOVE what it does!  </li>
            <li> Replacement for my super old Remington fabric shaver that died not long ago, may it rest in peace.  </li>
            <li> I shaved all of my older sweaters and they look new now.  </li>
            <li> Watch out when you clean the top out that you dont loose the little blades.  </li>
            <li> I recommend that you practice on an old sweater before you really go to town with it.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be surprised how much lint accumulates in the storage</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on a wool sweater, and so far this fabric shaver has been working very well</li>
            <li> works very well to refresh a wool coat and sweaters that had developed pills.  </li>
            <li> I am in the process of getting my daughter&#x27;s old baby clothes ready for a consignment sale</li>
            <li> I was surprised with how fast it was delivered and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a corner of the bedsheet and it took just a few minutes to remove basically most of the fuzzballs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> TINY BUT POWERFUL.</li>
            <li> I do not know for how long blades last, but I am going to buy one more shaver for someone else as a practical gift.</li>
            <li> However, within 5 minutes (5 minutes!!!) of normal usage, the \\&quot;metal\\&quot; grate on the cover snapped and broke and as a result</li>
            <li> OK FOR THE PRICE BUT NEED TO READJUST THE BLADES MANUALLY AFTER HEAVY USE CAUSE THEY GET STUCK ON THE SHAVER HEAD</li>
            <li> This product works better on heavy knit and cable knit sweater.</li>
            <li> Even if this only goes through one winter its still worth getting one per year, no doubt.</li>
            <li> but I am sure it will do the trick on a few of my sweaters.  </li>
            <li> This worked okay for a fuzzy cardigan, but broke after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I suppose it depends on the fabric, but if using it on a more delicate fabric, just pull it taut first.</li>
            <li> under ten bucks to restore quite a few sweaters to much better condition is well worth it -</li>
            <li> bit of care and babying can prevent all these downsides, so overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth your while.</li>
            <li> It takes some time to actually get the pills off the sweater, but is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Two of the slacks had a few fuzz balls but one pair had so many</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think this would happen with normal use.</li>
            <li> What I got doesn&#x27;t look like the product shown, regardless i wasted more money on figuring out what the lint remover i have uses as a battery source.</li>
            <li> ; because if you don&#x27;t mind the extra fuss, the results are worth the trouble.disassembled out of necessity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> maybe the holes on this one are too big, or it is too powerful?</li>
            <li> I have a few pairs of Ponte Knit leggings from Old Navy, and they are absolute favorite pants.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried others, more expensive, but not as effective as the low cost Remington Fabric Shaver.</li>
            <li> When I cleared the blades out, the shaver worked as normal again.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and buy a better fabric shaver, this one is a real lemon and complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> The battery compartment is poorly made and this does not do a good job for pilling.</li>
            <li> Its kind of slow work</li>
            <li> Omg this is awesome, I think I have shaved almost every outfit I own and this little fabric shaver does wonders on you clothing, I am absolutely addicted to this shaver, it may be small but contains plenty of power, my clothes look new again</li>
            <li> I purchased this little guy and was able to restore the coat to brand new condition in about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> i got this little baby to make my sweaters look more new.</li>
            <li> I typically consider myself to be an intelligent person, until this little fabric shaver arrived.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this unit if you have a fabric or material that has unsightly pills and want it to look new again.</li>
            <li> about every 1-2 minutes, so I had to unscrew the top of it and blow to get the fuzzies to get down into the clear part of the shaver.  </li>
            <li> it get the extra fabric on the clothes  out fast and everything looking pretty new.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;[t work on the thing I wanted it to but other things fine</li>
            <li> I am sure this thing could be used for so many other fabric shaving options, I will keep it handy for my next puff cutting projects.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, the functionality of the product is fine.</li>
            <li> Not like new,  but at least I can still wear it and look nice.  </li>
            <li> Great little item.... really powerful and will get all those pesky little bits of fabric off in seconds (especially from fleece and sweaters).</li>
            <li> That is a job better left for the dry cleaner or a sweater</li>
            <li> It is easy enough to put back together...</li>
            <li> Many of them have poor reviews, stating the units broke quickly or they ate holes through people&#x27;s sweaters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does what it says  Extremely affordable   Easy to empty out and clean  Cons:  </li>
            <li> I nearly threw out a great sweater jacket due to heavy pilling.  </li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t use too much pressure and hold the shirt firmly you should be ok!</li>
            <li> When cleaning fabric, I always hold the fabric in my left hand, with my hand beneath the area I&#x27;m cleaning, and then use my right hand to do the fuzzbusting.</li>
            <li> The one on the right is next.</li>
            <li> The $5.99 price is definitely right: It would have cost me close to $200.00 to replace the three sweaters with similar merchandise.</li>
            <li> You have to over and over the same area for it to work right.</li>
            <li> This little shaver works great to remove small to large fuzzballs from clothes and makes them look almost new.  </li>
            <li> What were once pilly and rough, are now smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li> and I still have the original batteries in it even though I&#x27;ve been using it consistently (once or twice a week for about 10 minutes at a stretch) for a few months.</li>
            <li> I used it to remove little &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; on bedsheets which it did with ease restoring them to their original 600 thread count feel!</li>
            <li> The device quickly clipped the fuzz balls and it left behind a clean, smooth surface.  </li>
            <li> It also picks up lint and some hairs at the same time as an extra bonus to the fine job it does on sweaters.</li>
            <li> Since it is so tiny, it takes much longer to shave something with a large surface area, like a jacket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works very well although I must say that if you need to do a large area you may want to consider a larger unit.</li>
            <li> This is a great little shaver but watch out it&#x27;s put a few holes in my sweaters.  </li>
            <li> Great product the only issue I have is the lint holder is too small, needs to remove shaved lint constantly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing to me that something I had bought almost forty years ago lasted so long and this shaver only lasted through several uses (or should I say \\&quot;abuses\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> It was so incredibly cheap, yet it works extremely well.</li>
            <li> If one way missed any, the other way would smooth them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little gadget, however, it worked for about ten seconds before it quit ... never to work again.  </li>
            <li> I was quite surprised with this little battery powered item and am glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the fuzzys from my old couch will get stuck in the blades and it will stop working, but if I just unscrew the cap a little to put more space between the blades and the cover, it will start working again.  </li>
            <li> It was majorly pilled, and this shaver took off several compartments full.  </li>
            <li> It functions pretty well, but I really wanted it to shave the smaller pills that creep up on new really soft jersey knits.</li>
            <li> I really love this little shaver--it&#x27;s given my old sweaters a new life.</li>
            <li> One issue I have is I have to stop and shake it because it seems to loose ability to cut not because its full.</li>
            <li> They look brand new.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t see it bringing up a wool garment &#x27;as new&#x27;</li>
            <li> My furniture looks new again.</li>
            <li> Made my scarf and look like new.</li>

            <li> 2 minutes with this shaver and the cushions look almost new.</li>
            <li> so I replaced them with new ones:</li>
            <li> It does not make the article of clothing look new....</li>
            <li> Makes them look new.</li>
            <li> This thing makes everything I use it on look brand new.</li>

            <li> Makes them look like new again.</li>
            <li> I put in new batteries and still doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> But will this make your sweaters look brand new?  </li>
            <li> So before deciding to just sell it and buy a new couch, we tried this thing.  </li>
            <li> Everything is now brand new.</li>
            <li> but it did not look brand new.</li>
            <li> but this fabric shave just made all of them look brand new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve saved close to $1000 because I didn&#x27;t have to go out and buy new wool sweaters.</li>

            <li> I was amazed at how new my sweaters look again.  </li>
            <li> I opened the head of the unit and pulled all the junk out of the mechanics and it worked like new again.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a new fabric shaver now.</li>

            <li> And while this is a very effective fuzzbuster (blew my drugstore one out of the water), it has some major flaws that have sent me looking for a replacement, namely:  - The holes in the cap are too big, making this a danger to delicate (and even not-so-delicate) fabrics.</li>
            <li> It took a little while to get it clean, but the difference was night and day!  </li>
            <li> My sweater jacket is completely de-pilled and looks new again!</li>
            <li> It made my old sweaters look like new!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that has old clothes that you want to make look brand new!</li>
            <li> Makes old sweaters like new!</li>
            <li> I then tried it on some old t-shirts and again, they looked like new!</li>
            <li> makes a old fuzzy looking shirt looks new again!</li>
            <li> This made my old hoodies that got fuzz balls on it look like new!</li>
            <li> It made old items look new again!</li>
            <li> Turns my old clothes new again!</li>
            <li> I used this on my old cable knit Ugg boots that had gotten fuzzy and they look brand new!</li>
            <li> You can hear the unit pick up all the annoying pills, what a great sound.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really bummed, the coat isn&#x27;t totally ruined but I feel like it won&#x27;t get as much use</li>
            <li> I have an older suit that had developed some fuzz in some areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragile, sensitive, but powerful.</li>
            <li> The only ones available at local retailers are about twice the price.  </li>
            <li> I will say that cable knits &amp; chunkier/open-weave designs are trickier because it&#x27;s more likely that you&#x27;ll accidentally shave off a piece of yarn instead of a pill.</li>
            <li> I had no similar experiences, and I believe if you take care to exercise common sense when using this (ie., pulling cloth taut, type of material upon which you choose to use it, not treating it like a hedge trimmer and hacking at the garment) you, too, will not suffer any damage from using this on your good</li>
            <li> For delicate fabrics you have to be more gentle.</li>
            <li> The flaw I find in this is that I find my self spending forever, working on one top, stopping several times to empty it.</li>
            <li> i have used it a few times and it is powerful and useful.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing!</li>
            <li> I love this little thing!</li>
            <li> Love this little thing!</li>
            <li> I love this little thing!  </li>
            <li> I really love this little fabric shaver!  </li>
            <li> Love it a little!</li>
            <li> Also, see the other reviews about it catching on a loose thread or bunched up fabric and tearing holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the look of the RTFS-2 more than the RTFS-100, and I believe it&#x27;ll be more efficient for use in my car as it doesn&#x27;t have a handle that will make tight spots hard to reach.  </li>
            <li> once tried to vacuum the fluff out from the top since it gets stuck in there... sucked that blade right out and into the vacuum hose!!!  </li>
            <li> I did try it on an inconspicuous spot first, and it seemed fine, but it unfortunately made a hole right at the front of my sweater!</li>
            <li> Unless those bed fabrics are torn or very old, there should no need to throw them away.</li>
            <li> They were very surprised.</li>
            <li> but while using it the first time the cheaply made guard on the top broke and now the entire product is useless.</li>
            <li> Also a good amount of power.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  If you use the unit face down (blade down), the balls that get shaved (gigidy) get caught/clogged in the &amp;#34;trap&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It does the job decently, just be sure to empty it frequently to not clog up the blades.</li>
            <li> Same exact operation with a sleek new body.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, even though it&#x27;s a small device with relatively little power</li>
            <li> this might tear my clothes or not do the job, however i have had this for a few weeks now, and from the moment i slapped in the batteries i am beyond pleased with this mighty little shaver.</li>
            <li> Had a top that was washed in other material such as new towels</li>
            <li> It works very well, and small that easy to carry for traveling.</li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;m usually a woman of many words, but I don&#x27;t have much to say about this fabulous little fabric shaver.  </li>
            <li> It works well, hasn&#x27;t destroyed any clothing, and has brought several sweaters back into rotation since they look so much better after a quick shave (a few pairs of socks, too!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> This product really restored my older sweaters back to new again.  </li>
            <li> That can make a pretty big difference.   </li>
            <li> Anyhow, what used to be a painful chore that I only did for my most beloved items of clothing has now become a piece of cake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been working on, but it has managed to remove a small portion of the top layer of skin on a finger.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this thing out, it ripped a tiny hole in my sweater.</li>
            <li> As far as shaving A+!</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I was excited to try this product to see what it could do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving this 3 stars because it stopped so many times due to the blades getting stuck every time</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> My sweaters look exactly the same as they did before I tried this razor.</li>
            <li> I use this very often to keep my pants, sweaters, jackets, and other clothes looking fresh.  </li>
            <li> Pretty basic fabric shaver, does what you need it to do.</li>
            <li> Only did one knit blazer so fat and it seems to work pretty well...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for small jobs.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses it on many different tops &amp; other clothing that get fuzzes.</li>
            <li> This worked okay, but it seems like it needed to be a little bigger and needed a little more power.  </li>
            <li> I first tried using this item on a wool cardigan that had a moderate amout of pilling.  </li>
            <li> Used it on a light tee and sure enough I got a small hole it the shirt where it wasn&#x27;t laying flat.</li>
            <li> chose to buy this, even after reading some of the more negative reviews, because I figured its low price tag was worth the risk.</li>
            <li> Over time something starts to look old and pill-y, I just run this over it and viola!  </li>
            <li> Now two of my favorite tops have a small hole..</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It may be early, but I am hooked!</li>
            <li> there are no problems so far!</li>
            <li> For the money, wow!</li>
            <li> ok for small jobs.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if available now!</li>
            <li> one of the blades came off after first use, didn&#x27;t work properly</li>
            <li> THAN THAT ITS CUTE, SMALL AND WORKS!!!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago and is still works the same as the first day I got it in the mail.</li>
            <li> This device has a couple small flaws, but once you get used to them you seem to be able to deal with them</li>
            <li> Used it on a old winter jacket and what a difference!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be able to get stuff off your clothes every other shaver you&#x27;ve had left on.  </li>
            <li> very nice, a little smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> It easily &#x27;shaves&#x27; away little &#x27;balls&#x27; that form on sweaters, shirts and pants.</li>
            <li> Does not pull or snag just goes easily over fabric and takes all the unwanted material and puts in a little holder</li>
            <li> it will only renew your stuff to a certain extent and its made out of cheap plastic like all the other under $10 tools you can buy.</li>
            <li> I wish it was just a bit bigger (especially the container) and easier to clean.</li>
            <li> simple to use and simple to clean out.</li>
            <li> I mean, for the amount of lint I had to remove, I would say I needed one that was bigger and more powerful.  </li>
            <li> Only tip, if fabric super fluffy (like a plush sweater), make sure to use on a flat surface and keep fabric taunt while using.</li>
            <li> I searched online till I found the exact Remington shaver I lost, and it was well worth paying a little shipping to get it here.  </li>
            <li> but the little holder fills up really fast and needs to be emptied when it&#x27;s about 3/4 full.  </li>
            <li> I have looked long and hard to find a good one.</li>
            <li> Made a couple of my old and well used pants look brand new again.</li>
            <li> It made all of my old clothes look brand new .</li>
            <li> This product does wonders in the way that it makes an old sweater look new.</li>
            <li> Also my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s blanket looks new again.</li>
            <li> Used this to remove thousands of pills on a relatively new soft shell (like neoprene) workout jacket.  </li>
            <li> This Remington Fabric Shaver won&#x27;t remove the lint as well on an old sweater as it would on a brand new pair of jeans.  </li>
            <li> It saved me lots of $ buying new sweaters and allowed me keep my old favorites.</li>
            <li> I am busy shaving the fuzz balls off my sweater and fleece, now they look like new.</li>
            <li> My couches were not even a year old and now they look new again.</li>
            <li> It takes old, fuzzy material and makes it look brand new again.  </li>
            <li> The end result, though, was an old pilly sweater looking like it was almost new.  </li>
            <li> Turned an old zip up jacket into feeling like brand new.</li>
            <li> Makes old clothes brand new again.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a shaver that I had bought back in the early eighties that still worked beautifully but needed new blades which I was unable to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this was a product that I was not sure of, but it was great,  Saved quite a few sweater, not to mention leggings.  </li>
            <li> Pills are trapped in the removable compartment and easily disposed.</li>
            <li> This item clogs easily a ended up breaking (the blades bent) just after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> most of the lint you gather doesn&#x27;t go fully into its small storage container though, it gets lodged near the blade section i used a toothpick to remove it</li>
            <li> and it did it quickly with minimal passes.</li>
            <li> this just takes too much time, you have to be careful what fabric you use it on, and it doesn&#x27;t remove that much!</li>
            <li> just wish i knew it was small when i ordered it - i&#x27;d of liked a bit bigger size.  </li>
            <li> I have \\&quot;shaved\\&quot; my favorite dark red sweater</li>
            <li> It works very well and removes pills, lint, and those tiny bits of leaves or whatever that children get embedded in their sweaters that refuse to come out during the normal wash cycle.</li>
            <li> but since it covers a small surface, it takes more time to complete the task.</li>
            <li> It does look nice and seems to have enough power, but the holes in the screen are too small to allow in all of the sweater pills</li>
            <li> (2) if you aren&#x27;t careful, this will quickly rip a hole in your cashmere sweater.  </li>
            <li> but I strongly recommend practicing on an item that you won&#x27;t be upset if you chop a few holes in it.  </li>
            <li> This little machine tends to get clogged up with sweater fuzz rather quickly and doesn&#x27;t seem to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; the nubbins off very well.</li>
            <li> Against my worry, this little thing works just fine.  </li>
            <li> THEN it worked fine, although my ego was a little sore...</li>
            <li> I tried shaking the shaver every so often, to try to get the lint to fall into the reservoir, with limited success.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid that the razors might cut holes in my favorite sweaters - if you&#x27;re scared at first, I&#x27;d recommend that you try it on an older sweater or a pair of socks/gloves first.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well, but needed emptying a little sooner than I&#x27;d have liked (could only do one sweater before having to empty it).</li>
            <li> In the past ive purchased these (fabric shavers) for much cheaper &amp; they actually worked alot better.</li>
            <li> I used it to smooth out some \\&quot;pills\\&quot; on a few collared shirts&#x27; collar areas, and it made the shirts look like new again.</li>
            <li> It is noisier than one I&#x27;ve tried from another brand which is why I only gave it four stars, but it is efficient at removing lint and it&#x27;s easy to empty the reserve.</li>
            <li> Make sure you test it on a less noticeable part of your sweater/shirt before you go ahead and shave the entire piece of clothing.</li>
            <li> The chamber that catches the pills fills up quickly, it is easy enough to empty.</li>
            <li> Does not work so well on the large fuzz balls on hand knitted items that are done with large yarn.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little while to go over large areas, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> For less than ten bucks I just revitalized all my favorite sweaters and even some old jackets.</li>
            <li> thing to note is that it will not pick up any hair or loose particles unless it&#x27;s stuck to the fabric and is small/rounded enough to fit into the shaving head area.</li>
            <li> the only problem is that if you gonna use it on something large  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy that actually bought this for all my dozen plus pairs of smart wool socks that are all pilled up.  </li>
            <li> The On/Off switch moves from On to Off, but this seems to be purely for my entertainment because it never actually shuts the motor.</li>
            <li> If you are looking into shaving large fuzzies, then you might need to look/consider a larger shaver since this one is a compact/travel size.</li>
            <li> This little guy is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I did break one because a piece of thread got into it and tangled inside the blades, breaking the smooth metal surface with the little holes, so it wouldn&#x27;t slide on the fabric because the metal bent and would get caught on the fabric.</li>
            <li> Bought this to remove little \\&quot;fuzzballs\\&quot; that built up on the fabric of my couch, and it does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> This little gadget is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It was fine, but more awkward to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with this little shaver, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Bigger and better in getting rid of the pills that form on some clothes than the little ones  that seem to appear on store shelves just before Christmas.</li>
            <li> THIS SIMPLE LITTLE TOOL CAN MAKE THE MOST PILLED UP</li>
            <li> Love it, this little power machine does wonders only all fabrics.</li>
            <li> and I guess I went over this one spot too hard or too many times.</li>
            <li> Seems like a good little clothes shaver, although I did try it on a few of my thinner shirts and ended up getting holes in them.</li>
            <li> I actually like the way the shaver works in that the blades seem sharp and the motor is strong.  </li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t careful or push too hard, there&#x27;s a good chance you&#x27;re going to cut the fabric itself.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed bringin the \\&quot;new look\\&quot; back to some well-loved sweaters with this little tool which (when used with care!)effectively removes all pill and fuzz!</li>
            <li> does an almost perfect job in every case with only one exception for me when one of my shirts was badly scuffed by a zipline harness I was wearing&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its not that good, its not that bad, its really for very superficial parts.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced it cutting holes in my clothes as others did.  </li>
            <li> the clear container falls off a lot while using it.  </li>
            <li> So the fuzz ends up getting stuck in the blade area, and you have to remove the cap, remove the blades, and clear it out.</li>
            <li> so it requires cleaning before the (clear) body of the shaver even has anything.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ve made it clear</li>
            <li> The blade moves a lot quicker than I expected and it has more power than I expected.</li>
            <li> The clear lint &#x60;reservoir can slip off when your moving around</li>
            <li> You can see clearly in the picture the before and after of the ottoman.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only experienced one hole and that&#x27;s because I was using it carelessly, holding the shirt in my hand.</li>
            <li> fuzz tends to clog up between rotary blades and clear container - have to stop frequently to clear out the blockage</li>
            <li> Being from an old Italian family, the lint balls (or pellini) as we call they really bug us.</li>
            <li> It seems to get fuzz clogged in the area under the blades, preventing some of the fuzz from getting into the clear &amp;#34;waste&amp;#34; container.</li>
            <li> i realised that the head and a clear plastic cap on it&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> TAKE THE CLEAR CAP OF first\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to clear this area with a bent paper clip a couple of times.  </li>
            <li> The clear cover on this is where the shaved fabric ends up</li>
            <li> The clear part fell off immediately and chipped one end before I even got to turn it on.</li>
            <li> I have a whole list of sweaters and things lined up for shaving but with this tiny thing, it will take me eons to complete them all.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t use this frequently</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t use this frequently</li>
            <li> holes, no dead batteries, no hassle cleaning.</li>
            <li> I like , like, like this product so much that I would give it ten stars.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t gotten clogged or had any issues.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed with this product and will be looking for a different model.</li>
            <li> My 11 yr old insists on being the one to use it for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 10 month old&#x27;s pants...</li>
            <li> I now have at least one more season&#x27;s wear out of all three sweaters.</li>
            <li> I told them it was 8 or 9 years old.</li>
            <li> on my delicate sweaters it snags the fabric just by touching it to the sweater.  </li>
            <li> At this price I could buy four of these at the cost I paid for the old one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This item has to be emptied out quite frequently</li>
            <li> The link does sometimes get stuck near the blade.  </li>
            <li> All fixed and shaving away now.</li>
            <li> It will make your old clothes look a bit newer.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an old one and went with the reviews on here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too loud and works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> The real problems with it are that it pulverizes what it removes and then you&#x27;re left with removing that from whatever your fabric has been resting on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on two cotton tees, two North Face hoodies and my North Face Denali jacket so far.  </li>
            <li> It did take the pills off my old cardigan.</li>
            <li> They had developed a mass of fuzz and bobbles thru washing.</li>
            <li> If you want to get lint or hair off of your clothes I&#x27;d advice going with the old fashioned lint brush....</li>
            <li> Most of the lint does not fall into the reservoir, but gets trapped under the blades, so then I have to open the cover, remove the blades and manually clear out the lint.  </li>
            <li> You really have to go over spots several times to get all the fuzzies off.</li>
            <li> I went over to my brother&#x27;s house to raid his closet for old sweaters and shirts.</li>
            <li> The reservoir doesn&#x27;t really work as intended and the cover constantly slides off no matter how I hold the device.</li>
            <li> It shaves a lot faster, and closer, than the old one did.</li>
            <li> So far, all three of us have no complaints.  </li>
            <li> This Remington Battery Operated Fabric Shaver really works well especially on cashmere.  </li>
            <li> Took care of some old sheets that were pilling up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Gentle even on my most delicate sweaters.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> product does what it says and this really should be an essential tool in everyone&#x27;s closet.</li>
            <li> I bought this to rescue an old tee shirt dress that was covered in fuzz and pills...</li>
            <li> AS FAR AS REMOVING THE FUZZIES,I HAVE TO GO OVER THE AREA</li>
            <li> and it fixed them.  </li>
            <li> transformed my old sweaters</li>
            <li> It took the pills off in one swipe and did not destroy or even at all do any damage to the pants themself.</li>
            <li> It definitely didn&#x27;t return sweaters to like-new condition, but it really did improve the appearance with a bit of babying it around.  </li>
            <li> Works very well on fleece, doesn&#x27;t work at all on heavier fabrics like wool with larger pils.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used it on a handful of more delicate fabrics as well and never had any issues at all.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that the lint it collects doesn&#x27;t really go into the collector</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d wait until she was asleep on her dog bed and turn it on near her legs.  </li>
            <li> I fished out old sweaters and pajama pants just to use this on them.  </li>
            <li> The plastic cover that holds the lint in falls off frequently.  </li>
            <li> I def felt like an old man purchasing one of these</li>
            <li> &amp; you got a piece of clothing that looks old because of fuzzes</li>
            <li> So far, it has not made a hole and the batteries have lasted.</li>
            <li> Used it on both light and heavy material.</li>
            <li> My old roomate kept playng with it with the cage off and eventually broke it</li>
            <li> My old one wore out</li>
            <li> things which are pretty minor considering the price.</li>
            <li> It broke the day I got it after 2 minutes of use and is now completely unuseable.</li>
            <li> keep that in mind if you will be using this for adult clothing.</li>
            <li> (it filled up after 1 heavy wool sweater with lots of pilling, and again after 2 fine-gauge cashmere sweaters).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it out on old pants, even a pair of underwear that had pilled in the dryer.</li>
            <li> It also has a separate compartment to collect and dispose of the lint unlike the old ones which you just opened up and it fell out.  </li>
            <li> You might be surprised at the things you&#x27;ll use this on.</li>
            <li> At least I remember these working much better.</li>
            <li> The fabric shaver was affordable and spruced up his old sweaters.</li>
            <li> but they just don&#x27;t work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> However, be warned that it will frequently and unexpectedly put holes in your clothes.</li>
            <li> and I feel that it was in much the same condition after the batteries died than it was before I</li>
            <li> The key is to use it when your clothes are hanging and not to stretch the fabric too much while using it.</li>
            <li> It does not do nearly as well by comparison.  </li>
            <li> This one works just as well as the old</li>
            <li> Thanks, totally recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised it took off all the &amp;#34;fabric balls&amp;#34</li>
            <li> In many of the reviews I read complained of holes being made in the garments, that was not the case for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I expected but very usable as is -- you should just empty the fuzz collector more often.  </li>
            <li> So far i used it on a sweatshirt and a pair of leggings that i was embarassed to wear because of all the pills on them.</li>
            <li> Best use for medium to small size lint (small as in a pencil dot and big as in a big size ant.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have problem following the directions, and haven&#x27;t run into much issues.</li>
            <li> and it died completely.  </li>
            <li> but it seems to be doing the trick thus far</li>
            <li> Now I regret tossing my old sweaters.</li>
            <li> but after just a few uses I lost one of the shaving blades and found out on the remington website that this item is discontinued and spare parts are no  longer available.</li>
            <li> I used to have a much larger type of fabric shaver that worked very well.</li>
            <li> I had a larger version of this shaver, but it did not work very well.</li>
            <li> So far I have done two of his jackets, three of mine and my sons jacket.</li>
            <li> The shaving head developed a hole and the device would not work.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any issues with shaving too far and damaging my sweaters.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it on more delicate pieces tho.</li>
            <li> Product works well, however, the cover both where the fabric being pilled comes into the machine and the battery door slides off quite frequently while in use.</li>
            <li> So just be cautious if you choose to use it on more delicate fabrics.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought a couple nice sweaters that were part polyester, and after a few washes starting pilling!</li>
            <li> Too cheap to return, so a complete waste of money/effort.</li>
            <li> I tried putting a fresh pair of batteries in several times and I kept getting the same result.</li>
            <li> kind of small so for an average sized person it takes a long time to work on a full sweater or shirt or pair of pants.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it has enough power, but this only 10 bucks so worth it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quite powerful, stronger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Of course doing a whole couch will require quite a few batteries, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Have been able to get a few sweaters back in to shape using this.</li>
            <li> I have had a few different shavers over the years, but this one works better than all the others.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit of a pain to clear the fluff out but not so much it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> If you use this on fairly thick clothing it works ok.</li>
            <li> then but I would try again more slowly and it would get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this because most people loved it and some people hated it because it ruined clothing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the fastest process, but it is not terrible slow either (and again - I had a lot of pills).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Great compact fabric shaver, but as another user pointed out, this unit is WAY TOO POWERFUL for light and thin fabric</li>
            <li> It does its job slowly but surely.</li>
            <li> Helps to keep clothes looking new and while cheap should last long enough to pay for itself.</li>
            <li> Small and light weight, fits easily in the hand, have used it so far on a few articles of clothing, works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have to clean up a mess of lint after using it.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I ended up in the emergency room where a nice doctor lady attempted to detach the (now ruined) shaver from my crotch while a half dozen nurses stood around laughing at me.  </li>
            <li> Your sweaters may still be a little pilly but the pills will be more flat.</li>
            <li> - light enough to carry in your travel bag to use when needed - does an almost perfect job in every case with only one exception for me when one of my shirts was badly scuffed by a zipline harness I was wearing - cleaning out the shaved fabrics is pretty straight forward and not too messy if you&#x27;re careful  </li>
            <li> This item would be 5/5 stars if the air was strong enough to circulate and \\&quot;force\\&quot; the fuzzies down into the clear pocket.</li>
            <li> and I even had a little fun going over the fabric and getting rid of those pills!  </li>
            <li> I love having this thing around, no more ruined clothes!</li>
            <li> Its small and compact and easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li> Small form makes it easy to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li> I have small hand and this is easy to hold on to.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this useful little tool.</li>
            <li> I did have to empty the catcher a lot and clean out the internal blades periodically</li>
            <li> Does a decent job, not great but can&#x27;t find one better  for sofa pill balls</li>
            <li> I guess she is aware of what this little thing is capable of.</li>
            <li> The shaver is pretty gentle, a little noisy.</li>
            <li> But it was so inexpensive as long as it lasts a little while I will be OK.</li>
            <li> has a tendency to get caught up in the material if your moving too fast or your clothing isnt totally flat while using it.</li>
            <li> save your clothes and make them look sharp again for a $6 investment... totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> My 7 year old also has a high end, name brand hoodie made out of the same fabric.</li>
            <li> awesome little lint shaver that quick shaves all those annoying lent on your socks.</li>
            <li> after two years and countless washes, it looks like new!</li>
            <li> It left my clothes looking new and my sneakers as if I hadnt worn them!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and does the job, but as with all shavers, you have to be very careful with the pressure</li>
            <li> i own several other types of fabric shavers, this one is just not special at all, to be used on very fine (small) piles only.</li>
            <li> It was both ridiculous and entertaining.</li>
            <li> Does require unscrewing the head ever few minutes to clean out under the blades</li>
            <li> Is small, but that worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> I use the fabric shaver to &amp;#34;depill&amp;#34; the occasional sweater, but mainly on socks.</li>
            <li> Works well and does a decent job of removing piling from sweaters and such.</li>
            <li> I wish Remington would go back to the older L shape design.</li>
            <li> it on a couple of older sweaters with same success.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I travel for work and I love that it&#x27;s small enough to take with me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still on my original set of batteries and have done probably 20 or so sweaters, along with various other items.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent enough that I wrote a review about it.</li>
            <li> The only concern I have is that the shaver drained the batteries so fast that at the end of the sweater the blade was barely spinning.</li>
            <li> Second, the lint catcher/holder comes off a little too easily when being handled.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this, because I remembered a generic version of one of these I bought years ago, and it was a hunk of junk.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This little guy is light, easy to hold, about half the cost of the last clothes shaver I bought, and actually does what it&#x27;s advertised!  </li>
            <li> I have new sweaters, which I&#x27;ve only worn a couple of times, that have developed fuzz balls and I wouldn&#x27;t wear them because of it.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the few minutes it takes to make your sweater look new again.</li>
            <li> It takes off little strings that are hanging loose on clothing and even the pulls my cat made from &amp;#34;marching&amp;#34; on my favorite teddy bear.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it for very long, but so far it has really cleaned up my sweaters</li>
            <li> only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that fuzz builds up rather quickly around the blades, so you have to keep an eye on that and empty it out.</li>
            <li> Just be careful on a thin shirt with piling- tore a whole right in a light T-shirt.</li>
            <li> works very well and does the job, however, I waited a long time  for it tob e delivered</li>
            <li> The blades act as a fan and fans the lint balls into the collection chamber but if there is too much in the collection chamber or a long thread is tangled in the blades, they will stop rotating.  </li>
            <li> All the piling on each sweater usually on the sleeves and collar are now smooth.</li>
            <li> Although you have to be careful with light fabrics because it can open big holes</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t take long to do a shirt though.</li>
            <li> This shaver is small, cheap, and does the job.  </li>
            <li> It is small but mighty.</li>
            <li> No good for sweaters that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> also i think it&#x27;s kinda convenient since it&#x27;s small and could fit it into my hand or bag to take anywhere and</li>
            <li> Small and mighty shaver.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty powerful for such a small machine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had sweater shavers in the past that have worked fabulously.</li>
            <li> This worked perfectly on my long fiber, fuzzy sweaters--not so much on the shorter fiber ones (sulphur stone for those).</li>
            <li> So cheap, afraid to use it on expensive clothes, worked perfect.</li>
            <li> I used it on all kind of clothes and fabrics, even on my hosiery, just be careful with thin and gentle things.  </li>
            <li> It just seems that it was made to fit to show all pretty in the package, but once it&#x27;s been jimmied open, it&#x27;s just misshapen enough to not fit back where it should</li>
            <li> It was not expensive and worked as expected.</li>
            <li> It works like a charm and in my opinion, pays for itself after you empty the pill-filled reservoir for the first time.</li>
            <li> The Remington Fabric Shaver was exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> This really works on our soft fabric removing all the loose fibers and pills from wear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Considering it&#x27;s mainly the more delicate clothing that I have that pills, this will get limited use.</li>
            <li> The other concern is that the fuzz seems to gather around the top and not &#x27;go down&#x27; into the collector.</li>
            <li> This little tool quickly removes anything on the surface of any fabric without damaging the fabric in any way.</li>
            <li> The shaver did a super job removing the little knots and fuzzies from my sweaters.  </li>
            <li> Small but very powerful, does exactly what&#x27;s expected</li>
            <li> The only inconvenience is the the little plastic cover tends to pop off on its own, but it&#x27;s only a minor issue.</li>
            <li> What did result though was an extremely smooth and soft fabric (and I mean baby soft).</li>
            <li> Works just as expected (and maybe even a little better, considering the price).  </li>
            <li> I never figured this cheap little lint shaver would last</li>
            <li> The debris chamber and blades get jammed by lint a little more often than I&#x27;d like, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> and I feel I&#x27;ve already made my &#x27;money back&#x27; by virtue of all the bobbly (now almost brand new looking) woolen jumpers I was about to throw away.    </li>
            <li> The outside looks like new again and the inside is no longer scratchy.  </li>
            <li> Used twice, new batteries, tried to use 2 weeks later and wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> Your sweaters will look ALMOST like new, but not quiet.</li>
            <li> I bought it to remove lint off some hoodies and sweatpants and it brought my clothes back to life and made them look practically new.</li>
            <li> Be sure to be very careful or you&#x27;ll break the clear waste fabric holding compartment.</li>
            <li> All of the reviewers who complained of how easy the battery cover and shaving collector fall off were 100% correct.</li>
            <li> I had a different but very similar product which didn&#x27;t really get the job done.</li>
            <li> (For those you really do need a larger sized machine with larger holes.)</li>
            <li> I purchased this fabric shaver a month or so ago, and am only surprised it hasn&#x27;t yet run out of batteries, we use it so frequently.  </li>
            <li> This is a really neat and portable tool, but sometimes (especially on socks)it catches a semi-loose thread and creates an even bigger hole.</li>
            <li> it is rude,not sophisticated, outside look like rude.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super powerful.  </li>
            <li> Takes 2 AA batteries which last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a breeze to empty the lint cup or take the cap off the blades and take the blades out once in a while to really get all the lint completely out.  </li>
            <li> This thing is cool fixes my nasty pilled sweater and made it beautiful again</li>
            <li> The first time I used this little power house, my hat looked brand new, like I have brought it from a store or something.</li>
            <li> This little guy does the trick to clear that right up.</li>
            <li> I recommend a larger version of this product if you plan to use it frequently, but otherwise I would buy again even if the one I have breaks!</li>
            <li> I have gifted this for little &amp;#34;happies&amp;#34; to other family member or as stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> I had some cashmere sleep socks that had gotten some major fuzz on them after a year of use.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop bringing back to life old sweaters!</li>
            <li> No other product will make your old clothes look new, but this little fabric shaver can make it look so much nicer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, powerful, and now the sweaters look almost new.</li>
            <li> I have used the same method (flat surface like thr top of the dryer and stretched the fabric a litte) on other clothes.</li>
            <li> This thing is not for all types of material, but will do many if not most common materials with the right touch.</li>
            <li> It took a while, because I needed the warnings about going too fast and cutting fabric, but the coat, which is a combination of black wool body with knitted sleeves, looks great.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product but after only a month and a half it kept getting jammed then</li>
            <li> Granted, something big and bulky like these long sweaters takes a considerable amount of time to completely go over, but it was either that or buy something new.</li>
            <li> Just make certain, while using it to continually empty out the fuzz that collects.  </li>
            <li> , it is relative quiet and very efficient, a small size that you can throw into a suitcase and quickly use anywhere.  </li>
            <li> Needed a new one and this absolutely works just as well as my previous one.  </li>
            <li> Shaves the little white balls right off!</li>
            <li> What a powerful, little fabric shaver and</li>
            <li> At my first use, it slowed down after few minutes and my first though was:the batteries are new,</li>
            <li> It is a very slow and challenging process removing pills from sweaters with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cover on the compartment that collects the lint is hard to fit</li>
            <li> Too light and dull.</li>
            <li> ; usually doesnt make it into the special compartment its supposed to.  </li>
            <li> Even large &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; and threads are left after going over the same area multiple times.</li>
            <li> saved so many outfits now with this little machine, batteries seems to last a long time (using regular coppertop).  </li>
            <li> I love this little gadget, it got all those little fuzz balls off and left my clothes looking new,</li>
            <li> The shaver runs on AA batteries and the shaved pilling ends up in the clear blue compartment.  </li>
            <li> Not a good product the bigger one is better.</li>
            <li> However, the small size is very convenient for traveling and I do think it works very well for its purpose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was skeptical at first but after multiple uses and on bigger fabrics with more fuzzballs, I was amazed</li>
            <li> So I took a gamble and ordered the Remington one from the American Amazon site, resulting in having to pay as much for the delivery as for the product (i.e. double the quoted price in total).    </li>
            <li> My old reliable one was the same shape as the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> So, after purchasing two (one for a back up), they work as well as I remember my old one working.  </li>
            <li> and I can see in the near future</li>
            <li> It stopped working for a second, but I promptly turned it off and fixed the problem.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;P.S. Be careful how much pressure you apply to your clothing/fabric.</li>
            <li> They are more tedious to use than this product but at least you can be sure it won&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> and it only survived through one complete sale.</li>
            <li> It barely does anything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nearly invisible and has made me think on several occasions that it isn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> For example, I bought my 7 year old several pairs of store brand athletic pants made of 100% polyester.</li>
            <li> I was careful to not apply too much pressure.  </li>
            <li> I have a larger clothes shaver that does not work nearly so well as this item.</li>
            <li> It will make holes in your knits if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m using it, I just barely let it touch the surface of the fabric.</li>
            <li> Only used it once so far</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace an old sweater shaver I had that finally just gave out.</li>
            <li> Apparently the spinning blades cut a piece of the metal grill, which distorted the grill and the blades couldn&#x27;t spin anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old one that had died after several years.</li>
            <li> The battery door and lint trap door barely stays clipped on however.</li>
            <li> Barely took any fuzz off items.</li>
            <li> Barely worked from the start, then stopped barely working after about 10 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> After using the shaver on several items without incident, I decided to grab an old sock and see if I could make this unit eat a hole through the material (as some reviews state).</li>
            <li> Handle carefully so as not to break it.</li>
            <li> Barely works at removing lint, the motor keeps turning off when its trying to remove lint.</li>
            <li> We had an earlier model that my wife used for years, then an old battery leaked and destroyed it.</li>
            <li> Beware though, if you&#x27;re not careful you can shave holes into some of your thinner shirts.</li>
            <li> - you barely need to touch it</li>
            <li> I did let the collection bin get too full and got a small fuzzball stuck in the blades.  </li>
            <li> but I advise not to try on thin fabrics - unless you like Wear clothes with holes,,,, :)</li>
            <li> I was able to shave one sweater with it, but using it became so frustrating, I eventually just gave up and threw it away.</li>
            <li> Top was broken when I received.  </li>
            <li> Go slow and it will nab any fuzzballs that fit in the screen holes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my super expensive Victoria&#x27;s Secret bras that always seem to snag or collect little fuzzballs on the material.</li>
            <li> Had those fuzzies on some pants/bed spread, used this on it and the little things came right off.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to push down too much on light fabrics though.</li>
            <li> You need to be a little careful when using it, making sure whatever you are using it on it perfectly flat</li>
            <li> It is very powerful for such a small device.</li>
            <li> Had a new, yellow fleece shirt that was accidentally washed with a towel and literally spotted all over with red fuzz.</li>
            <li> The shaver face is large so that is helpful and the blades seem sharp.</li>
            <li> Some previous reviewers noted that it ripped a hole in their clothes - I think that if you follow the directions (do not push down but rather just stroke the device back and forth, and make sure to not use on pulls in the fabric), there shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I was wary of using this product, but given Amazon&#x27;s great return policy &amp; the low price, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> although it took a long time, it is like a brand new couch.  </li>
            <li> and it was a new hoodie; I&#x27;m not surprised.  </li>
            <li> Quickly removes small nubs from fleece.  </li>
            <li> As a result some get overly aggressive shave, some are lucky to get it just right, and others fail to see any results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found it worked really well on an old sweater that needed the little balls of fuzz removed.  </li>
            <li> In my extreme case, the harness I was wearing for my zipline adventure just caused way too much damage.</li>
            <li> Also, if the fabric is really lightweight be careful!</li>
            <li> It saved a sweater for me that I was ready to get rid of due to severe pilling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very small, so fit in my suitcase or purse</li>
            <li> cleaning out the shaved fabrics is pretty straight forward and not too messy if you&#x27;re careful</li>
            <li> This fun little gadget is definitely not meant for thinner materials.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m driving my roommates mad bragging about how good it is and using it on every fabric I can find.</li>
            <li> Also I did notice that it is much less prone to accidental garment nicks than the other brand which is definitely a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> It dramatically improves the looks of most any fabric but just be careful not to press too hard.  </li>
            <li> I know it wasn&#x27;t because of too much pressure on my part because I&#x27;m very careful with it.  </li>
            <li> And if I now take them to the dry cleaners, they will look like new.</li>
            <li> Have not tried it on delicates so might be extra gentle on them.only one problem is that you have to empty it out often.....</li>
            <li> Actually my wife bought it for her dress and wool sweater that are old enough for need one like this.</li>
            <li> while others noted that it barely makes a dent in the fuzz (mine apparently is in the second category), I imagine that all units of this product vary in blade placement which lacks precision.</li>
            <li> Works really well for it&#x27;s size, though you have to be careful not to get fabric caught in it because it&#x27;ll make tiny pin holes in everything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to look for a different product in the near future.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm -- de-pilled a nice expensive wool sweater with ease and for a very low cost.</li>
            <li> ; because if you don&#x27;t mind the extra fuss, the results are worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> I did have to work at it slowly and patiently and made sure to empty any fuzz build up in the shaver.</li>
            <li> This is one seriously powerful little fabric shaver!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The process is naturally time consuming as the foil is only about an inch wide, but it worked a treat with only a few swipes back and forth over each area on cotton garments and even successfully on a Metalicus wrap (made out of pantyhose-like material) - even on this delicate material I didn&#x27;t have issues with the fabric being snagged or damaged.  </li>
            <li> I bought this little shaver and it did exactly what I wanted it too.</li>
            <li> This little device does exactly what it should, and quite effectively.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only have 2 major complaints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also a little piece of the plastic on the lint holder broke off the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Firstly, both the battery compartment lid and the little lint storage compartment keep sliding off the body of the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Keep your delicate fine weave sweaters flat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come back to re-write my review because although my first experience with this product was very disappointing, I have since been very satisfied.</li>
            <li> batteries last a long time - and this little shave does a good job despite its small size!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small on the go device that really shaves your clothes and makes it look brand new.</li>
            <li> It works,  but not super powerful,  takes a really long time to achieve desired effect.</li>
            <li> As long as your not dumb and dont try and use it on expensive delicate fabric its great</li>
            <li> It will get a little bogged down/clogged up, but all you have to do is clean it out, and it&#x27;s back to normal.</li>
            <li> It stopped functioning properly not long after I got it.</li>
            <li> I blamed it on myself at first for not being careful enough or not laying the clothes flat enough.</li>
            <li> When especially I was barely tapping it against fabric it grabbed n tore them ..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s well worth it at a small price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to address concerns about the suction being too powerful and pulling fabric in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, compact, and powerful.  </li>
            <li> Based on those reviews, I used it timidly at first, but eventually realized that i can press firmly on the sweater and not do any damage at all.  </li>
            <li> I would test this on something heavy duty like a coat first before moving on to the delicates.</li>
            <li> It works ok on some materials, but it is a slow and time consuming process and doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all on other materials.</li>
            <li> The collection thing doesn&#x27;t hold as tight as it did when I first got it, but it does decently enough.</li>
            <li> First, I trialed this product on a long-sleeved cotton shirt that was starting to pill a little at the end of the sleeves.</li>
            <li> I used it mainly for the pilling on my couch due to my cats&#x27; secretive clawing.</li>
            <li> Being military we had to shave our berets whenever we got a new one to prepare it before wearing.</li>
            <li> I used brand new alkaline batteries to no avail (proof: the storage compartment was empty).</li>
            <li> I used it (carefully) on a sweater, and it smoothed the surface to look like new.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a decent device that was discounted nicely, so 3 stars isn&#x27;t too bad considering its just for occasional use.</li>
            <li> Like a previous reviewer stated, I didn&#x27;t expect much from a 6 dollar pill shaver - however -</li>
            <li> Less embarrassing too when I wore them out since my coats look much nicer without the balls.</li>
            <li> I previously owned an Emerson which worked very well until my 18 months child decided to crash it against the floor.</li>
            <li> It then plugs it up in the small area near the head and as a result it stops working evectivly and needs to be emptied very often.  </li>
            <li> But when you first use it you have to wipe the metal part with a dry paper towel until you see no more grey on the paper towel, it left a grey circle on a light pink shirt</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not common if you&#x27;re careful, but use it properly!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, battery powered so it loses power quickly.  </li>
            <li> I had a larger, corded version of this in the past, but this one is just as powerful.</li>
            <li> I tried the shaver the moment I received it and it completely removed all the little fuzz balls with ease, leaving the cushions looking brand new.</li>
            <li> It made my old hoodies and sweaters look new again by taking off the little fuzzies that have began to pull out over time.  </li>
            <li> After about 5 minutes of this, the unit simply shut down, and I needed to gently tap it to get it started again.  </li>
            <li> Have two other&#x27;s and in fact had just used the older shavers on the same pants.</li>
            <li> But it certainly does the job and gets rid of all those little fuzzies on your clothes.</li>
            <li> Well this little device is your new hero!!</li>
            <li> For small amounts of pilling on fabric it is perfect, for larger, tougher amounts is not so bad.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well, is sharp and so far, very durable.  </li>
            <li> but while shaving my sweater, my sweater was not perfectly flat and it knicked my sweater and now it has a hole in it....</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m wondering how long it will last with taking it off and putting it back on so frequently.</li>
            <li> your clothing item is not completely flat the shaver WILL cut the fabric at the hems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus, it eats batteries and the clear plastic portion that holds the fuzz is too loose and comes off in my hand all the time.</li>
            <li> I guess the few downsides would be that you have to continuously empty it since it fills up really quickly.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is very cheap made product.  </li>
            <li> This shaver MIGHT work for very, very light sweater, but for anything else, it is completely useless.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that it is small and gets filled up fast</li>
            <li> this was waay too small for such a big project, but it actually did a great job, tho tedious.</li>
            <li> those tiny little fabrics balls are very hard to pull them one by one off the coats (even after I pulled those fabric balls off, the coat didn&#x27;t look nice neither).</li>
            <li> Be smart people and don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that when using the shaver on a large sweater with heavy pilling, the plastic catchment area can fill up and needs to be emptied halfway through the job.</li>
            <li> so this is a real help with keeping those darn little pills off.</li>
            <li> This little gem has worked very well.</li>
            <li> Yes, this little shaver is a cheapie, but it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> I must say it works really well at getting all the little fuzzies off.</li>
            <li> THE SHAVER IS A LITTLE SMALLL, THE CUP FILLS UP FAST</li>
            <li> It is a little time consuming and does go through batteries fast</li>
            <li> Got it about 3 weeks ago and have used it 3-4 times and it really does shave the little balls off of my clothing.  </li>
            <li> This product lets me shave pills off of my stocking caps and other pilly things to make them look and feel new again...</li>
            <li> this thing is quite powerful and if you press too hard it will put a hole in your sweater</li>
            <li> Since the product is new, the blades are sharp and I only needed to pass over the sweaters once.</li>
            <li> They were starting to get so bad my options were to try a fabric shaver or just donate the shirts to good will.  </li>
            <li> and I generally use it while wearing the gloves so they&#x27;re stretched out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blame the device, it&#x27;s really powerful, and my sweater is REALLY thin, so I&#x27;m just surprised.</li>
            <li> Down side is you&#x27;ll have to empty the cup more often because it IS small.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that the manufacturer did not put to much thought into the housing of this unit, meaning that the small blue door which houses the lint falls off relatively easy, making it somewhat frustrating to hold the shaver and the door at the same time so that the door doesn&#x27;t land on the floor!</li>
            <li> (Or, \\&quot;up\\&quot;, I should say, since when the shaver is used, the blade is normally faced down on the article of clothing, and the pocket is up.)</li>
            <li> To empty it out, shake it front to back to get the lint in the compartment to clump up, then open and dump it out with no mess.</li>
            <li> and oh, my gosh what a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I don&#x27;t know if it had to do with the other having dull blade or not.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp, but with lots of use, they obviously dull and can lightly pull on the material.  </li>
            <li> This brought them back to normal in less than 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I can’t imagine it will last very long, the blade must get dull quickly</li>
            <li> Totally gets the job done quick and easy and it revived some sweaters and hoodies that really looked terrible.  </li>
            <li> I spent about 2 hrs running the shaver over my blue couch that was covered with white pill-like balls that refused to come loose with the vacuum, and now the couch looks new again.  </li>
            <li> She thought I was murdering it with a vacuum</li>
            <li> I would not use it on fine or thin fabrics, but this does exactly what I want on my thick stuff.  </li>
            <li> and this little inexpensive device helped my sweaters look like new again!</li>
            <li> Expensive, but apparently the only way to get a shaver that actually functions well without important drawbacks.</li>
            <li> My wife used this to clean up the couch a few times and then thought it was dead.</li>
            <li> Just had to empty the little reservoir pretty often.</li>
            <li> It fits very well in those of us with small hands, even though you need to empty it frequently</li>
            <li> I use rechargeable batteries in mine because the regular batteries only last so long.</li>
            <li> Uesed it on a sweeter and some other clothes with heavy lint from napkins and it chews right throught it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this little guy is that the lint trap comes off easily when you are using it, which is why I took off one star.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this little guy.</li>
            <li> Clothes that looked poorly previously now look new again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m required to wear a black Polo shirt for work and this made it look brand new again.</li>
            <li> This works better than the other items I got for de-pilling my sweaters but the holes are a little small</li>
            <li> Works very well and small enough to travel</li>
            <li> /&gt;regarding price---I have had mine for over 10 years; and the young lady who helps me was telling me how shattered husband was To throw out an old sports hoodie because it have a lot of sentimental value</li>
            <li> I would suggest starting off with a small area and seeing how much it picks</li>
            <li> I think on more delicate materials you would want to apply very little pressure and lay the area you&#x27;re shaving flat.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I found a small piece of metal on my floor that I didn&#x27;t recognize until I picked up my shaver to try to use it again and saw a large hole in the screen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and compact, yet works well for even large scale depilling from clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only snagged once when I didn&#x27;t have the clothing item laying real flat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit of a slow process but all the pills were removed with this little handy tool.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who owns sweaters, corduroy pants, blankets, or anything that gets pilly after a few washes.</li>
            <li> This is a small shaver and it doesn&#x27;t feel very high quality, but it works well.</li>
            <li> It did leave all fabrics looking brand new in just a few short minutes.  </li>
            <li> Unlike old fabric shavers, it only shaves off the little fuzz balls and doesn&#x27;t damage the actual fabric at all.</li>
            <li> Over the course of a half hour, I treated the entire jacket with this shaver and it performed far beyond my expectations, removing every trace of lint and pills on it.  </li>
            <li> Much easier to hold that ones we&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small but really removes the pills and stuff.</li>
            <li> The Fabric Shaver is small and fills up fast.  </li>
            <li> Very functional&lt;br /&gt;- relatively small compartment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of how much battery life the shaver eats up</li>
            <li> but if it&#x27;s a long or big job, there tends to be some additional fabric stuck where the blade is.</li>
            <li> I expect to have it as long as I had my last fabric</li>
            <li> Works while item is on the hanger, lying flat or while you are wearing it.</li>
            <li> Did make a hole in 2 pairs of cotton pants but blame myself for holding it in the same spot for too long.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to press the device into your fabric; just glide along a flat surface and let its weight do the work.  </li>
            <li> : Battery doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> that one hope it last as long.</li>
            <li> I hope it does last as long as it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I did eventually shave a hole in one of my sweaters, but that was my fault for not shaving on a flat surface.</li>
            <li> Just remember not to feed it any corners or collar points, and keep the fabric flat while shaving.  </li>
            <li> so I wonder how long that will last</li>
            <li> Anyway, don&#x27;t store the batteries in it, and I think it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I recommend laying/stretching your shirts flat and never let it ripple when you&#x27;re going over it and that&#x27;ll reduce any chances of causing holes.</li>
            <li> The body is plastic - I hope the blades in the shaver last long.</li>
            <li> I loved this sweater and was so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The reasons I hold back from a 5-star rating are that the fuzz-collection compartment is liable to come loose while the shaver is in use; it&#x27;s sometimes necessary to use fine-tipped tweezers to extract fuzz from the blades; and there is a generally dinky feeling to the product.</li>
            <li> this little, cheapo, battery powered bobble remover made those crib sheets feel like new.</li>
            <li> I keep getting new life out of my sweaters every season with just a little help from this gadget.</li>
            <li> The charcoal made a bit of a mess at first; then it settled down.  </li>
            <li> Starts off strong for 20 seconds then gets very weak.</li>
            <li> You just have to be extremely careful when doing thin fabrics and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> Then, those same batteries that were just working fine in another item were useless.</li>
            <li> but so far it hasn&#x27;t slowed down with use at all.</li>
            <li> Also it is very easy to empty the fabrics from the compartment that holds them, though the compartment is very small (make sense cuz the product is small)</li>
            <li> This little shaver saved several old robes and jackets.  </li>
            <li> This little thing has totally restored my old pairs that I had stopped wearing.</li>
            <li> This little shaver brings those old favorites back to life.</li>
            <li> We discovered after the first use that we have to take the head off and brush all down into the little needles after each use or they get stopped up and it just isn&#x27;t going to work then.  </li>
            <li> Oh my gosh this thing is addictive and I can&#x27;t believe I have gone so long without it!  </li>
            <li> I could not be happier, the blades are razor sharp and it powers through the lint like no other.</li>
            <li> I had a few jackets with a ton of lint balls/pills, and this thing made them look brand new.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt last very long on the batteries.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t expect it to last very long.</li>
            <li> this was a piece of junk would not waste my money buying this lasted less than  a month then went to the trash</li>
            <li> many of the lint shavers are big  &amp; awkward</li>
            <li> The plastic lint trap does seem to come off too easily sometimes - a wrong touch, and it pops off.  </li>
            <li> It is small but works fast and efficiently so that it doesn&#x27;t take long to cover the territory.  </li>
            <li> the lint trapis smallso you haveto empty it often, but that issue isn&#x27;t big enough to take off even 1 star because itdoes it&#x27;s job so well.</li>
            <li> With any fabric shaver, there is a potential for holes and damage, especially if not handled carefully.</li>
            <li> I had one of these when I was younger and recently had a couple of sweaters that were in rough shape.</li>
            <li> I would actually purchase it again and be extra careful cleaning it out.</li>
            <li> This one cut a few of them, but leaves most behind.</li>
            <li> have shaved several thick sweaters and they look so much better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hate having a million gadgets cluttering up the place, so really resisted getting this while looking for a way to save my favorite sweater coat from extinction.  </li>
            <li> Not such a bad deal though because this shaver is very easy to open.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest extreme caution when using this on a light knit or thin material as I did put two small holes on one shirt luckily the holes were in hidden areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a major problem as long as you keep the fabric relatively flat and unbunched.</li>
            <li> This remington unit requires multiple passes to remove lint from a single area of a garment.</li>
            <li> You have the hold the fabric flat and stretched.</li>
            <li> favorite wool jacket was beginning to wear down, and this thing gave it at least another few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The directions say not to push down, and to simply allow the pressure to come from the weight of the device (to prevent damage), and I wasn&#x27;t doing that.. again, it all comes back to following the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i wear a lot of old hoodies that pill up and the pills are tight to the fabric.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t push the item down to hard and keep the item moving (don&#x27;t let it stay on one spot for more than a few seconds), you should not be creating any holes in your fabric.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to empty and the blades pop out easily enough for you to remove any lint that gets twisted around the spindle.</li>
            <li> I have not tried other brands of shavers to know how it compares to its competitors, but when this one dies I might try a larger sized unit like the Bobble Off as it seems to review similarly and perhaps this would save some time (presuming it works as well as this one of course!)</li>
            <li> Have had other clothes shaver that were much  more expensive.</li>
            <li> I have bought other more expensive ones</li>
            <li> I looked at several fabric shavers and actually owned two other kinds before trying this one.  </li>
            <li> even after such a big project the blades r still sharp.</li>
            <li> If the garment it extremely pilled or you need to do a large item this is not a good solution in that it would take far too long to do.  </li>
            <li> I was however concerned with how it would handle certain fabrics considering some of the negative experiences some users had, but I went with it anyway and to my surprise it worked like a charm.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im going to switzerland for a year and my chef coats tend to get little fabric balls on the sides and it works so well to make them look professional again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little loud and makes my ears ring after I turn it off.</li>
            <li> but is a little loud.</li>
            <li> Works wonders for old clothes with those pesky little balls of lint.</li>
            <li> This little guy transforms all those old sweaters of yours into practically-new sweaters.</li>
            <li> The one complaint I&#x27;ve got about this thing (and it could be entirely related to the fact that it came flying out of the package when I first opened it and hit the floor) -- the cover doesn&#x27;t stay on tight enough.</li>
            <li> did have a little trouble at first in opening and closing the battery&lt;</li>
            <li> This little shaver probably works best for coats and jackets and not for very thin shirts though as other reviews said it may cut a hole in thin fabrics if you are not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> more she loves it only complaint is holes are a little small and lint trap needs emptied often</li>
            <li> Although, I was very careful, it made a hole in my new thin sweater - very noticeable..</li>
            <li> One major issue that unsettled me was it ripped one of my t-shirts several times in less than 1/2 a minute!</li>
            <li> I would have had to reupholster my new couch if it wasn&#x27;t for this little gadget!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bound to happen every so often, and you can use the shaver to go over the spot and take down any new loose threads you&#x27;ve created, but if you aren&#x27;t careful this will happen a lot</li>
            <li> It does fill up with lint quite fast, at least on the sweaters I was &#x27;shaving.&#x27;</li>
            <li> After that I returned it, because even though it worked for a bit, I was afraid of the risk of ruining more tops.</li>
            <li> works like a charm and the battery operates long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it running for roughly 2 hrs now on the same set of batteries.</li>
            <li> It is tiny, so I had to empty the shaving a lot</li>
            <li> We bought one of these a long time ago but it was lost somehow</li>
            <li> I actually shaved a hole in my thin, cashmere sweater, so I recommend not using it on more delicate fabrics.</li>
            <li> A word of caution, though---it WILL snag and cause holes if you aren&#x27;t careful or try to go too quickly (especially over curves, say if you&#x27;re wearing the sweater at the time).</li>
            <li> I like this product and it is working as expected, Very simple to use</li>
            <li> so the wait wasn&#x27;t long at all.</li>
            <li> After a few decades, my old fabric shaver died.</li>
            <li> I have tried razors (works but takes so long), lint brushes, and tapes and none did the job.</li>
            <li> be careful when using it , if your material is clumped it will put a tiny hole in it...</li>
            <li> Strange that I&#x27;d never heard of this item before...</li>
            <li> The only let downs are: it runs on batteries and if you&#x27;re using it on stretchy clothing, you have to be careful or it&#x27;ll cut a hole in your fabric.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, the blades maintain their sharpness in the long run.</li>
            <li> It also stops working completely after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t take long at all.</li>
            <li> , it just takes a really really long time</li>
            <li> Just pop off the back, and empty it.</li>
            <li> Minus 1star only because the battery cover</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is ONE big issue that you must know about, because if you are careful it won&#x27;t be a problem at all.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it, just remember to be careful and you&#x27;ll be all set.</li>
            <li> Broke not too long after I bought it.</li>
            <li> I had expected it to be bigger.  </li>
            <li> and I have been looking for a replacement for a long time.</li>
            <li> Wish I had discovered this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Battery life is long and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Minor point,</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at its power and ability to avoid \\&quot;stalls\\&quot; on heavy fuzz.  </li>
            <li> It works but it takes a long time.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it definitely removes those pesky lint balls, but be careful...</li>
            <li> Complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li> While shaving, keep your material stretched.</li>
            <li> The battery compartment, once you open it, does not want to stay closed.</li>
            <li> Have not had this for long</li>
            <li> Works but takes a long time.</li>
            <li> you want to use it long time, you may select another item</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver does in fact shave off some of the excess fabric on my clothes, but I don&#x27;t see it \\&quot;saving\\&quot; any of my clothes in the long run.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had this product a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I got really curious and rubbed it while it was running on my fingers and the back of my hand.</li>
            <li> and then I waited to long to return it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you should hold it in one spot and let it stay too long.</li>
            <li> , effective&lt;br /&gt;Cons: minor lint build-up under rotating blades, which should be cleaned periodically.  </li>
            <li> This is a replacement for a similar one (unknown brand) which lasted 20+ years.  </li>
            <li> This is a heavy duty unit as far as fabric shavers go.  </li>
            <li> It takes several passes to get the fluff to get sucked into the unit.</li>
            <li> but I have to be extra careful that the blade doesn&#x27;t disappear.</li>
            <li> Should have bought a larger size cause have to empty the holder where the fuzz goes too often.</li>
            <li> This one shaves very well, I use it on thick sweaters and piling.  </li>
            <li> I also used it on a few of my sweaters that I was going to give away due to pilling and it made them look close to brand new!</li>
            <li> But to actually be effective, you need to hold it 90 degrees down from what the picture shows, meaning either the pointed end is in the palm of your hand or your wrist is awkwardly at 90 degrees.</li>
            <li> may try some thinner sweaters... seems like you would have to be shaving a super thin sweater or push down pretty hard to make holes.&lt;br /&gt;Stock up on AA batteries...</li>
            <li> Works well however it is impossible to keep the battery backing on the device and the lint builds up in the top instead of filtering down into the clear compartment</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a small step in order to get a new looking sweater though.  </li>
            <li> This small gadget makes the garmet look new after using it.  </li>
            <li> Be cautious with thin fabric, though, as it ripped right through a sundress I was using this on.</li>
            <li> wanted to buy a lot of stuffs lately but due to amazon&#x27;s new \\&quot;Add-on items\\&quot; which sucks, you need to have $25 worth to buy this stuffs even you are PRIME member.  </li>
            <li> My only question is how long the blades will stay sharp  </li>
            <li> Of course you should be extra careful in areas with loose fibers.  </li>
            <li> Only a little bit made it down into the clear pocket.</li>
            <li> that this actually worked compared to other shavers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> that this actually worked compared to other shavers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The only drawback we&#x27;ve found is that the fuzz container opens just a little too easily, especially when you&#x27;re pushing the on/off switch.  </li>
            <li> It solves the problem that I have been struggling for a long time!</li>
            <li> I would like to warn other users that this unit can ruin the fabric and make holes, especially on the softer and thinner fabrics.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to other people.</li>
            <li> My only complain is that it doesn&#x27;t remove all of your pills; don&#x27;t expect to get all those tiny little pills off.</li>
            <li> A few spots you can still tell where the fabric looks a little off, but it looks much nicer than before with the pilling.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a clothes shaver for a long time!</li>
            <li> I bought a little more expensive one</li>
            <li> Up to now I&#x27;ve been using an old disposable razor to take off those little pills on sweatshirts etc., but always seemed to get a cut in the fabric if I wasn&#x27;t too careful.</li>
            <li> The pilling is gone and some of the extra fuzz that collected from other fabrics has disappeared as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had more expensive ones that didn&#x27;t even come close!</li>
            <li> If I had it to do over, I would spring for a little more expensive one.</li>
            <li> How have I lived so long without one of these!?</li>
            <li> I had this model, lost it in a move, and then tried to replace it with other brands I found locally.  </li>
            <li> It made such a difference, I&#x27;m looking around for other things to use it on.  </li>
            <li> Half way down the FIRST sock it got caught on its final fuzzy because no love tap could get the thing running again.</li>
            <li> The part that touches the fabric is extremely fragile and will break if you put very minimal pressure on it.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well if you lay the fabric down on a hard surface to use it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this gadget for my wife who used it to clean up pearling on an expensive (?) sweater.  </li>
            <li> i wouldnt use this on thin fabric because obviously, there isnt much fabric to spare with those types of clothes.</li>
            <li> This thing is going back even though it will cost me at least half as much as the refund I will get.  </li>
            <li> The only snag I ran into is that with one of my thinner sweaters, when removing pilling it actually caused a few holes in the material.</li>
            <li> My only desire would to have a larger lint catcher as this one is narrow.  </li>
            <li> This has only happened a few times to me, and I think I&#x27;ve trained myself to hold it differently.</li>
            <li> I never new they existed growing up, but then again, I was a kid, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never damaged a single item, is super-easy to use, and almost idiot-proof.</li>
            <li> just is limited.</li>
            <li> it removes every single fuzz</li>
            <li> , it wasnt shaving a single bit of lint.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I have several very heavy, nice smart wool sweaters that I wore all last winter and they ended up looking awful by the end of the season.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of sweater shaving, so I have to take out the blades to clear the space out quite often, but this is a small price to pay.  </li>
            <li> The fuzz holder is a bit small, but I don&#x27;t mind emptying it frequently.</li>
            <li> I bought this to get the white lint off of a load of dark socks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve replaced the batteries and it doesn&#x27;t make a difference - not powerful enough to use on anything!</li>
            <li> I had tried several methods of removing them with no success.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other fabric shavers before and expected the same so-so quality I&#x27;d seen.</li>
            <li> We can retire the old one now that we have had for the past 15 yrs.</li>
            <li> I knew it was travel sized, but I was still surprised at how small it was.  </li>
            <li> Well I used it today on a rayon sweater that is pretty thin, and didn&#x27;t experience the hole-making problem that others had.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time, and can shred the material if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> We bought an expensive sofa with custom upholstery, and within a year it was full of the beady pulls.  </li>
            <li> I could only see a very small difference in the amount of pills and lint on clothes and if you&#x27;re not careful with the edges of the clothing, or if you do not lay it flat, it can cut a hole through it!</li>
            <li> The battery compartment door is loose and keeps falling off.  </li>
            <li> but the battery cover and the lint storage cover come loose with just a touch.</li>
            <li> I have read some reviews that warn that the shaver will \\&quot;suck\\&quot; loose fibers into it, and tear a hole in some sweaters.  </li>
            <li> On delicate fabrics, I&#x27;d recommend the obvious: try an inconspicuous area first, and stretch the fabric very firmly while you shave it so it can&#x27;t be pulled inside the device.  </li>
            <li> and it just kept shaving down the extra fabric that was sticking out</li>
            <li> (not enough to bring it down to 4 stars)</li>
            <li> Be careful with thin clothing make sure it is completely flat and do not press down too hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a high quality piece of equipment.  </li>
            <li> I would order again but be very cautious on how hard I am pressing down on my garments.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what the negative reviews are talking about: it says right in the directions to test it on an inconspicuous part of the garment, and to lay the garment flat and don&#x27;t press hard.</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this shaver strongly enough for big or small jobs.  </li>
            <li> but I wish it&#x27;s larger for less work.</li>
            <li> I had a black skirt that was covered in tiny lint pills that I just could not get rid of.</li>
            <li> and we have to wear black pants, I only have 5 pairs and 2 of them were covered in lint or whatever it is.</li>
            <li> I accidentally threw my black sweater in the wash with my baby&#x27;s fuzzy blanket and it got white fuzz all over it.  </li>
            <li> The jumbo one I purchased at a local big box craft store stopped working after using it on no more than 10 wool sweaters.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product to remove those small lint dots that accumulate on clothes, especially cardigans, after multiple washings.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was pretty skeptical about ordering this, but don&#x27;t let the low price fool you.</li>
            <li> Rescued my fleece pants and various other fleece items which I stopped wearing due to pill buildup.</li>
            <li> It seems to work will with fabrics that are less durable such as cotton.</li>
            <li> It can remove only small pills and does not work for larger pills of a sweater.</li>
            <li> I was constantly having to empty the little lint catch and the batteries lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Realized its impossible to pick every one of em by hand i ordered this handy little tool</li>
            <li> this remington battery operated works very well even when the batteries are getting weak this fabric shaver still shaving</li>
            <li> I layed it on a flat surface, stretched it a little and started away.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t make your old jacket/coats look like new, it would be a false hope!</li>
            <li> I mean, my husbands pants looked brand new</li>
            <li> I expected it to last longer - I used the shaver less than 3-4 times on sweaters.</li>
            <li> 1 be easy with very thin fabrics because it will eat holes in your clothing if you press too hard or your item is not flat .</li>
            <li> I found that it was much easier to use on sweaters than on thin, loose fabrics.  </li>
            <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; it removes a little fuzz here and there, but I find myself working too hard for sub-par results...</li>
            <li> This little shaver removed those fuzz balls like a big industrial machine.  </li>
            <li> This little shaver was literally my last hope to save an $80 fleece jacket.    </li>
            <li> I wish it was on there a little tighter or in a different spot.</li>
            <li> Mabe on thenext model, they will make it a little larger.</li>
            <li> I wish that the fuzz compartment was a little bigger cause</li>
            <li> I do wish the head was a little bigger though.</li>
            <li> These little gems can bring back to life that one sweater or bedspread that just looks &amp;#34;dingy&amp;#34; (sp?)</li>
            <li> I do wish it was a little bigger just so it would go faster</li>
            <li> Again, a little caution and patience is key.</li>
            <li> It just trims the little pill balls and doesn&#x27;t cut into the actual fabric.</li>
            <li> IF you have materials that get those little white balls on them</li>
            <li> It was a little different to get used to the style.</li>
            <li> the only con is that the transparent cover which holds the lint is a little bit flimsy...</li>
            <li> It is not a big deal but is a little time consuming.  </li>
            <li> We christened it our little POS and debated whether to even try it, but all doubts left when we did.</li>
            <li> This product was not available on the UK version of amazon (or any other website at the time of writing this review) and having read many reviews on amazon.co.uk of all the other fabric shavers, they all seemed to be described as being of very poor quality and build.     </li>
            <li> I wish the pill catcher had a bigger opening because after a little bit the lint gets caucht in the head &amp; i have to stop and take the machine apart to empty everything because it becomes slower .</li>
            <li> You must be very careful to hold it straight up and down and go slowly while using it</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is that the mesh material is very flimsy, a little stronger than heavy duty aluminum foil.</li>
            <li> T-shirt thin fabric is likely to get sucked in a little and make a hole, although it can be done if you are SUPER careful and pull the fabric very tight.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that this would be cheaply made and inefficient; but it is NOT.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the plastic cover over the lint trap was constantly falling off!</li>
            <li> Its not made with heavy duty razor blades, so you do have to be gentle, and really...who wouldnt expect it to cut delicate fabric?</li>
            <li> I have used it on at least 7 sweaters so far</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem that sturdy so not sure how long it will last.  </li>
            <li> This shaves off pills, but it&#x27;s really flimsy and the battery cover and pill holder cover pop off constantly, making it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Just be careful while using it.</li>
            <li> It does the job just not really an &amp;#34;industrial&amp;#34; strength item that I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Do I have any regrets?</li>
            <li> Absolutely not.</li>
            <li> The shaver lasted only a few months before it stopped working</li>
            <li> However, you have to be extremely careful when using it..</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s such a round \\&quot;bullet\\&quot; design, the collecting chamber has a tendency to pop off.</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
            <li> It works, but be careful.</li>
            <li> When I attempted to use this device for some below-the-belt manscaping, the results were not promising.</li>
            <li> Additionally, put two holes in my burnout t-shirts because I wasn&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS WASTE OF MONEY, EXTRA GARBAGE IN A HOUSE.</li>
            <li> But do be careful with finer fabrics.</li>
            <li> so I need to empty it twice when I shaved a knee-long coat.</li>
            <li> the emptying container keeps slipping off while using it.. and the tap that holds it on broke within 5 mins of use</li>
            <li> so be careful</li>
            <li> We need minus star options for reviews.  </li>
            <li> This would be a minus five star.</li>
            <li> No matter how carefully I hold it, the blades catch on fabric and make holes.</li>
            <li> while shaving a sweater I had to empty it about 5 times.</li>
            <li> Easy-to-see receptical tells you when to empty the fuzz.</li>
            <li> (Just, be careful of the blades.</li>
            <li> Then I found out that there were some fuzz that it gethered stuck under the blades and made it harder to turn.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for shaving several sweaters and this trouble never happened again.  </li>
            <li> You do need to empty the tray before it fills.</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver shaves well, although sometimes snags the clothes if not done carefully.</li>
            <li> However, the user should be careful to pay attention.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t being careful</li>
            <li> Not what i expected.</li>
            <li> Have only used it a few times, but no complaints.  </li>
            <li> , be careful I don&#x27;t recommend it, please try with another.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I was using it any harder than anyone else would.  </li>
            <li> Gave me a few of my favorites back!</li>
            <li> so you have to empty it often</li>
            <li> The shaver got jammed.</li>
            <li> However, with the cover, it is jammed and will not work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful.  </li>
            <li> I had a few sweaters with lots of &amp;#34;pilling&amp;#34; on the back.</li>
            <li> I ended up returning this item because it was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> ; so I expected it to be..</li>
            <li> It has bitten a couple of holes in my clothes unfortunately, so be careful using it.</li>
            <li> Of course be careful with it because there are blades inside, but I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t had any clothing casualties yet.</li>
            <li> did have an incident when I nicked one of the yarn threads on a knit sweater, and had to patch/reinforce that spot to prevent unraveling, just using a bit of hand threading.  </li>
            <li> It works as expected.</li>
            <li> There is also an additional area made for the fuzz to go ino that you will have to empty.</li>
            <li> I took it to my den and read the instructions carefully.</li>
            <li> Just be careful.</li>
            <li> Remington (located in Canada) was not much help.</li>
            <li> It works as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few fabric shavers from different companies.</li>
            <li> Shaver is not fast, probably 15 to 20</li>
            <li> Is working like a charm as I expected it to so wouldn&#x27;t hesitate ordering another one.</li>
            <li> It worked as expected.</li>
            <li> have defuzzed a few items, and the only issue I have had is a snag here and there.  </li>
            <li> Remington cuts harder.</li>
            <li> Just pull off carefully.  </li>
            <li> Careful of blades they will fall off when cleaning.</li>
            <li> Be careful before ordering.</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> Arrived quicker than expected</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times and the battery compartment is corrupted and no longer works.</li>
            <li> It not only doesn&#x27;t work, it ruined a few sets of batteries.</li>
            <li> No matter how careful you are, it tend to spill all over the floor upon emptying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times over the last few months.</li>
            <li> It does remove the pilling, just be careful not to over-do it.</li>
            <li> so you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> Be careful, it may rip clothing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;just have to be careful not to eject the the shavings storage</li>
            <li> However, there is really no pressure required if you glide the shaver</li>
            <li> I rehabbed a $400 sweater in about 30 minutes of careful shaving.</li>
            <li> I just got this fabric shaver last night and was looking forward to use on a few things I have put aside.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a fabric shaver for a few weeks and stumbled upon this one locally.  </li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t crappy, it would have been money well spent.</li>
            <li> but it did what I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Carefully place it perpendicular to the fabric would help.</li>
            <li> AND AS EXPECTED BY AMAZON.</li>
            <li> Be careful, does the job but will make holes if in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and hope it will last.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> If you are doing a lot, you will need to empty it often as sometimes</li>
            <li> It does remove lint if you do it carefully.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And as with all of these fuzz shavers, be careful not to put holes in your clothes.</li>
            <li> The case for the battery does not stay closed.  </li>
            <li> My last fuzz buster died a few months ago so had some \\&quot;busting\\&quot; to do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved heavy fabrics and sheer fabrics, and not had any problems!  </li>
            <li> It saved my favorite cardigan that I was almost ready to throw out because it looked so horrible with all the pilling.</li>
            <li> If the fluff went in the compartment that it should you could do a few sweaters before needing to dump but as it is its only a couple of minuets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My sweater got caught several times but it is thick enough to have no damage.</li>
            <li> I had a few shirts and stretchy pants that after a few washes developed balls.  </li>
            <li> So I put new batteries in, and cleaned out the small amount of shavings from the bin again, and the little thing wouldn&#x27;t turn on again.</li>
            <li> For less than $10, I now have a little tool to aid me in the war against unwanted fluff balls on my clothing, a tool that should hopefully last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Both were flat knits and I was hold them tight, so I don&#x27;t understand how the blade managed to do what it did through the guard, but it created holes in both garments.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as frustrating as an old vacuum cleaner.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my heavy pea coat and it simply was not strong enough to handle the &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34; balls on that.</li>
            <li> It seems to have a smaller capacity than other small fuzzbusters I&#x27;ve used, and because of the so-called ergonomic design of the whole device, the hole from the blade area into the receptacle is small and narrow.</li>
            <li> I am assuming it was user error; I probably pressed too hard or didn&#x27;t lay them flat enough</li>
            <li> :  Blades were sharp (not sure how long this will last though).</li>
            <li> so de-pilling takes a long time plus it isn&#x27;t very sharp</li>
            <li> then half way thru the next sweater it slowed down and stopped.</li>
            <li> All of the shirts were fine and thin material though, so as long as you don&#x27;t use it on thin fabric</li>
            <li> I considered throwing away quite a few items of clothing due to pills and such.</li>
            <li> My only negative is the place that holds the cut pieces is so small that you have to stop and empty it a few times as you are working as it doesn&#x27;t hold much.  </li>
            <li> I also tested it on a cotton dress that was rubbed raw from the rough texture of my purse and the wear and tear is definitely undetectable.  </li>
            <li> The directions are clear, however the print is very small.</li>
            <li> It still works, but I have to be extremely careful not to snag clothing on the sharp edge where the metal broke.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say other than it works.</li>
            <li> but it takes a long time to de-pill an entire sweater, or even worse, something larger.</li>
            <li> Nothing to extra special, but it isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> You need to be a little patient to get the big fuzzes off the material, pressing down does NOT increase results.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the poor reviews, but I thought I&#x27;d give it a try based off of the decent reviews.</li>
            <li> That one barely worked, and this one took off what the other left behind.  </li>
            <li> I bought this fabric shaver and it did not work for very long, I tried to shave some fuzz off of my clothing and it hardly did the job then a short time after purchase it stopped working</li>
            <li> i have a new favorite wrap sweater from Banana Republic that pills something awful, so whenever i put the sweater on, i break out the sweater shaver</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, doesn&#x27;t seem to eat batteries badly at all, easy to empty and use again.</li>
            <li> But it is so sharp sometimes.</li>
            <li> have since used this shaver on other fabrics like bed sheets, pillow cases and blankets.</li>
            <li> I actually have a small tear on the sheet and rolled over it with the shaver to see if it will snip it off.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> Believe the other reviews that say it cut holes in their garments.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough that you can throw it in your suitcase and take it anywhere!</li>
            <li> I have used other clothes shavers before, but found them to be unweldy</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works well.</li>
            <li> I would tend to agree with other reviewers, however, that this item seems to be made for denser, heavier fabrics, like sweaters, gloves, and socks, for instance.</li>
            <li> small enough to store away in a drawer....</li>
            <li> the other side of it holds the battery I believe.</li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, within the first 3 minutes of using the Shaver, I had put 2 holes in the fabric.  </li>
            <li> This shaver has an aggregate score of 4 1/2 stars while other combs had maximum 4.  </li>
            <li> Other than that its convenient.</li>
            <li> The only drawback for me is that it is small</li>
            <li> I often get pills on my cardigans due to carrying a purse that has fabric that rubs - this is genius.</li>
            <li> a small piece of lint ball was too big to move underneath them and into the storage compartment.   </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s small enough you could travel with it.  </li>
            <li> Pretty useless.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t like the fact that I had to purchase other items just to get this.</li>
            <li> The head of it is so small that it takes along time and lots of effort to go over an entire sweater, i.e.</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> Also, unlike other reviewers I did not have problems with thinner sweaters.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Should be use with care as every other shaver like this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had any of the problems other people seemed to have with the shaver &amp;#34;eating&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> of what I dislike about this shaver is due to my lack of paying attention to the description.</li>
            <li> Other items</li>
            <li> I recommend other products with a handle</li>
            <li> I use it on everything-clothes and other fabrics.</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews about it before I bought it, and some customers were complaining that this fabric shaver can make holes -</li>
            <li> The holes are too small to catch big lint pieces on sweaters</li>
            <li> Then I read a column about cleaning tips, and the writer recommended a shaver over any other type of device people use for getting pills off of sweaters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only works on small areas and takes forever on a sweater.</li>
            <li> Have uses Lava rocks or other pumice stones</li>
            <li> but I still expected it to work longer than that!</li>
            <li> so well I literally  started  hunting for  other clothing items to &amp;#34;de-pill&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Then it gets all over you and the other clothing you are wearing.</li>
            <li> The blade is no longer sharp.....</li>
            <li> The plastic part that catches the shavings falls off a lot, but other than that it works well and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed that removing all of the pilling was going to take quite some time, as it took several passes on each small section of fabric before the pills were removed.  </li>
            <li> Does the job at a fraction of the cost of other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I checked out the grill material and it is extremely flimsy...</li>
            <li> So be careful!</li>
            <li> I have seen a one star review of this product suggesting that it ruins delicate fabric but, in all fairness, the instructions do warn not to use on delicate fabrics because the fabric may be ruined, so, I think one can say that the gadget works as one would expect it to if you&#x27;ve read the instructions ;)</li>
            <li> other than that is a must have in every house...</li>
            <li> have not tried using this on sweaters or any other clothing</li>
            <li> The motor is disappointingly weak and it occasionally jams and has to be turned off and back on again.</li>
            <li> It is small enough to pack in my suitcase!</li>
            <li> It did suck up part or my shirt though and left a small hole</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t realize it was going to be such a small device</li>
            <li> The surface area on the head is small, but I have tried larger surface area shavers and they dont have the power this thing does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I was worried they would be damaged</li>
            <li> (big fabric &#x27;pills&#x27; could not fit into the holes to be snipped off!).</li>
            <li> Other than that it does the job is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> Only minor issue is that when used vertically with the shaver head down (as when clothes lie flat on a table), lint will back up in the head and is a little hard to get out, but not that hard if you take the head off.  </li>
            <li> Batteries a little hard to snap in, but wow takes any age off clothes.  </li>
            <li> Worked semi-well on tightly knit sweaters, but with sweaters that are loosely knit and have pilling and fuzz balls I would not recommend using the fabric shaver on.</li>
            <li> I find it indispensable after washing and drying certain garments whose fabrics look awful once cleaned at home.</li>
            <li> Great little device to remove those annoying &#x27;pills&#x27; on sweaters!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I have to push a little on the sweater and go over the same spot a few times, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> But when my mom, who is very careful with these things, also put a hole in my shirt with it, I knew it was the fault of the product.</li>
            <li> People who have cut cloth with it must not have been very careful.</li>
            <li> Just move it slowly and gently, without pressing too hard, and you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But you must be careful when cleaning , very sharp blades may cut you . .</li>
            <li> My heart was broken because the sweatshirt was brand new and looked like I got it from a thrift store.</li>
            <li> Absolute cheap crap!</li>
            <li> Sad to say this completely didn&#x27;t work -- the power stops the second it makes contact with the pill.</li>
            <li> The first item I tried the Fabric Shaver on was a very thin, loose-cut shirt.  </li>
            <li> the metal plate seems sturdy which is important because I&#x27;ve broken them in the past pushing too hard, but seems durable...</li>
            <li> They pill over time and because the pills are very small, they can barely be seen.</li>
            <li> Anyways, the problem I have is that when I remove the container the other piece comes off as well because both are designed to slide down to detach.</li>
            <li> The lid for the reservoir that collects the lint can be a little tricky to get back on after emptying but with a little practice it&#x27;s not a problem!</li>
            <li> The only thing I noticed negative (hence the 4/5 stars) is that when I used it on the sweater, because there was a lot of fuzz, the fuzzies all attracted each other and clumped around the blades.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s flawed, maybe it&#x27;s pandemic; but certainly, it&#x27;s a pain.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> However, it was just a little clogged up with fluff.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this particular one has the container to empty it on one side and</li>
            <li> Other shirts that have less fuzzballs are removed without any issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t press too hard or it will bite a tiny hole in your clothing.</li>
            <li> If you do press hard it actually seems to not work as well.</li>
            <li> Did swiping motions, didnt leave on same spot and didnt press hard.</li>
            <li> Had one a while ago and the blades finally dulled, had a hard time finding this</li>
            <li> Until a month or two later when the blades got so dull, its not even useable anymore.  </li>
            <li> Only thing is I have no idea how to replace the blades once they become dull.  </li>
            <li> The sweater must be held taut, which is hard unless you have an extra pair of hands.  </li>
            <li> You MUST be careful, however, for thin materials and delicate sweaters, etc., as the holes are large and can suck in the material.  </li>
            <li> but the fluff doesn&#x27;t move down into the little compartment so well</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t press down too hard, or you may do the same.</li>
            <li> up&amp;#34; pretty badly despite following the washing instructions.  </li>
            <li> We bought this initially to remove the all too common fuzzball from our clothes.</li>
            <li> - My final complaint is the fuzz holder.</li>
            <li> And with the way things have been lately, I don&#x27;t have the funding (nor the closet space in our smaller dwelling).</li>
            <li> and though its silly, they look (and feel) much nicer now.</li>
            <li> At first when sifting through the reviews I discovered a few that had me skeptical about ordering this product.</li>
            <li> , that is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth spending another 16 bucks just because the cap broke.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> My mom bought me the common brand of sweater shaver you can find at your local drugstore or Target-</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> only complaint</li>
            <li> Several users complained about damaging fabric.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to think this would really to the job with fuzz on sweaters, but it does.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the size...</li>
            <li> At that rate, it would take weeks to shave my sofa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not wanting to completely give up on it, I tried it on a wool sweater and a wool jacket (thinking maybe the sofa fabric was just too heavy for the small shaver), but alas, it had the same problems on the sweater and the jacket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s restored a couple pairs of shorts that started to pill, a number of shirts, and even my Egyptian Cotton bedsheets that had minor pilling in one small section.  </li>
            <li> reviewers complained of fabric shredding pulling issues and such.</li>
            <li> and it ruins their clothes.</li>
            <li> I use this product constantly, and have never had a problem with snags, even with delicate material-items like bras.</li>
            <li> for the purpose of this device, I&#x27;ll says it provides an average perform.</li>
            <li> Not worth money</li>
            <li> I do not use it very much as it ruins my sweaters.</li>
            <li> AS IT&#x27;S NOT WORTH</li>
            <li> Not worth postage to return, I threw it away.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth my money and at this point, not worth my time to return it to the company.  </li>
            <li> or I was an idiot) and being more cautious</li>
            <li> Some people said you have to be real careful or it might cut a hole in what your defuzzing</li>
            <li> but you just have to be patient and go over your clothing several times (slowly) before seeing results</li>
            <li> Not very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I made the mistake of fuzzbusting a delicately knit sweater and it chopped several holes in it (and I am very careful!).</li>
            <li> I got it yesterday and did not want to put it down.  </li>
            <li> if parts of it are so worn down.</li>
            <li> I wish I found one that the shaver wasn&#x27;t held upside down.</li>
            <li> i just hope it doesnt break down and stop working on me.</li>
            <li> but you have to press down on the fabric.  </li>
            <li> It broke down and</li>
            <li> Let the blades do the work without pressing down on it too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to bear down with it in order for it to do the job.</li>
            <li> ONE OF THE THREE HAD A CRACK DOWN</li>
            <li> I ordered this for the office to shave down some of the wool.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, the battery cover sometimes slips off during use, but I am amazed at the results this little gadget provides.  </li>
            <li> If you have a problem spot just pull it apart a little with your other hand.</li>
            <li> It gets the little fuzzy balls off your close due to friction.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I stopped wearing them due to a little pilling.</li>
            <li> Dont spend alot on those other models, this one does the trick!</li>
            <li> i only used it a few times, and this time it cut a hole in my cloth!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp little buggers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The baldes are sharp!  </li>
            <li> I use it to trim those little pill balls from my bras, synthetic shirts, and other stuff.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well!</li>
            <li> I had another brand of this item and it never really worked properly, so I was a bit skeptical when I saw this one, but the old one had broken a long time ago and</li>
            <li> If I had one nitpicky complaint, it would be that if you grip the shaver too tightly, you may accidentally slide open the battery or lint compartments.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would say is not to press too hard on the fabric, as it might create a hole in your article of clothing (I made a little hole in my gloves that I had to re-stitch).  </li>
            <li> I have used it a few times on other items and it hasn&#x27;t let me down.  </li>
            <li> I literally pulled three perfectly good but dreadfully pilled sweaters out of the trash in order to test this little guy.</li>
            <li> It definitely took the pills off my sweaters and socks, it&#x27;s just a little slow going.</li>
            <li> The shavings are trapped inside a little compartment and you pull that off to empty it.  </li>
            <li> This shaver has saved my sweat pants and a few pair of other pants.</li>
            <li> It has a hard time for big pieces of lint so don&#x27;t get for heavy lint material.</li>
            <li> I thought it was broke after a short time or the batteries went bad fast, but the fuzz in there is the problem.</li>
            <li> Much less labour intensive than the manual scraper-style lint remover I have,</li>
            <li> Is slightly time consuming but it gets the job done</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to remove the lint and pills on a black North Face fleece that resulted from jacket being accidentally washed with a load of towels.  </li>
            <li> and you could see black threads instead of wool felt).</li>
            <li> After reading previous buyer reviews, I decided to purchase this fabric shaver.</li>
            <li> As you all know, when you get lint on black clothing, there is no way of hiding it.  </li>
            <li> This thing does NOT work well and leaves black greasy marks on fabrics.</li>
            <li> This item worked well for half a sweater.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It removes &gt;5% of the fuzz under the head at any given time, and about half the time, it gets clogged, regardless of fabric weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For lighter material you need to exert less pressure on the machine.</li>
            <li> The power switch also feels odd when turning on as well.</li>
            <li> I turned it on, and it operated for less than 5 seconds.</li>
            <li> But, I ventured ahead using it on my Ralph Lauren Black Label Angora Sweater anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keep it one half inch or so away</li>
            <li> i use it to remove lint from my toddlers knit black tights all the time.. &amp;</li>
            <li> It works overall, but you have to be really careful on thin sweaters.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had shavers before and they didn&#x27;t do half the job this one does.  </li>
            <li> it works well, just be careful on the seams, if the material is thin enough it will make a hole.</li>
            <li> The thing is, when a shirt piles, it typically does so all over.</li>
            <li> and it helped me lot in removing the lints from one of my black shirts that came from the inside of a jacket.</li>
            <li> Got this included in another purchase for less than 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t take any before and after photos because they would have looked just like the ones sent in by previous owners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an issue with my black clothes pilling and that showing up as I wear them to work.</li>
            <li> Now, the screen is slightly thicker than a piece of aluminum foil like Alcoa Wrap.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work as well as the pricier ones, for much less.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll spend less time picking the lint balls by hand then trying to get this device to work.  </li>
            <li> (I would have given this 5 stars if it was priced slightly lower)</li>
            <li> Also no very ergonomic in the hand, tends to slip out of my small hands and the battery compartment is not very secure.</li>
            <li> A little hard to remove flat fuzzy pieces on sweater.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t get chewed up, but I&#x27;m a little careless with it and have only gotten a hole in one garment and have used it countless times.</li>
            <li> People PLEASE DON&#x27;T BELIEVE IN ALL THAT 5 STARS RATING, ITS NOT TRUE.</li>
            <li> I was pretty desperate to get rid of the pilling and looked on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I had to empty it a couple times because the lint trap is kinda small.  </li>
            <li> Not cool.  </li>
            <li> Not true with this.  </li>
            <li> It kept getting clogged and stopped working even though it was not full.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not worth going through the trouble to return this item.</li>
            <li> Barely worked one time and was designed poorly.</li>
            <li> The little holder for shavings works well too and keeps a mess from forming.</li>
            <li> Could not clean my coat, had to throw it away</li>
            <li> , the shirt&#x27;s fabric look a little washed out.</li>
            <li> The couch is microfiber suede, and I thought if I bought one of these deals it could make it look a little nicer.</li>
            <li> I have a Microfiber comforter that when I washed it it got a ton of little fuzz balls all over it.</li>
            <li> It removes the little balled up areas without hurting the fabric, and stores everything neatly in the plastic compartment.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this little shaver.  </li>
            <li> This little shaver exceeded my expectations in all fields.</li>
            <li> I used them on my sneakers too to get rid of the little balls of fabric that rub off from my socks</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get the fabric shaver because my couch was driving me crazy!</li>
            <li> folks should keep in mind that that stuff you shave off is coming from and attached to the item youre shaving, so when it gets tugged on, it will pull a little fabric with it.</li>
            <li> You have to pay attention to getting the pills through the little holes on the guard.</li>
            <li> They are a tricky little device that works well.  </li>
            <li> I was so amazed with this little shaver.  </li>
            <li> something does what it is suppose to do!&amp;#34;  My couch cushions had little &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; all over them.  </li>
            <li> After having this item for a little over a month, I came up with a conclusion for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nifty little instrument.  </li>
            <li> Gets the little pills and fuzz with little effort.</li>
            <li> I emptied out the little container about 20 times.  </li>
            <li> Also it leaves my sweaters a little fuzzier than Id like</li>
            <li> This little thing packs a lot of punch.</li>
            <li> So, if you notice that there&#x27;s a ball of fuzz stuck by the little blades, you can pop off the cap and pull it out.</li>
            <li> Dont go around with all those little pills on your sweater</li>
            <li> Removed the little fuzzy pills without ruining the garment.</li>
            <li> This little worker bee chews up lint balls like nobody&#x27;s business.  </li>
            <li> This little thing is a beast.</li>
            <li> This little guy is the smallest workhorse around town.</li>
            <li> There is always some little fuzz ball build up on my pillow case&lt;</li>
            <li> I used it for my little girl&#x27;s fleece outfits.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen anything this little machine couldn&#x27;t fix within its intended use</li>
            <li> This little device gets the job done and gets all the little fuzzies I don&#x27;t want on my sweaters.  </li>
            <li> It took all the little balls of fabric and lint off my dresses (and even my bra straps), and didn&#x27;t tear up the fabric at all.</li>
            <li> Unless they knew about this little</li>
            <li> This little shaver does the trick.</li>
            <li> My headboard on my bed is fabric and had accumulated little fabric balls with this thing they were gone with no problem</li>
            <li> This little guy keeps going and going.</li>
            <li> for the pennies I paid  for this little guy  </li>
            <li> so I got this little gadget and it ate all of those little cotton balls up...</li>
            <li> It can get a little clogged</li>
            <li> It got a little lint, but I have a sweater dress that has lint all over it and this product made no difference on it.</li>
            <li> I was a little leary about buying this as I had one years ago that was junk.  </li>
            <li> Works well cleaning up the little pills on sweaters.</li>
            <li> 15 minutes with this little gizmo</li>
            <li> I got a little overzealous with one of my sweaters and put a hole in it.  </li>
            <li> This little guy has a lot of power.</li>
            <li> Shaves the little nubbles off my clothes just they way I need it to.</li>
            <li> This works on all my clothing with those little beads of cloth on them after a lot of washing or chaffing.</li>
            <li> This little machine gets the job done.</li>
            <li> for the heck of it, I shaved a little hair on my leg</li>
            <li> Purchased it for my couch, which was covered in little fabric balls.</li>
            <li> would be.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, for the little amount of time I use it, it is ok&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it has removed the bulk of the little fuzz balls on my comforter.</li>
            <li> A starving student, I decided to but this little shaver</li>
            <li> This little product has been a life saver.</li>
            <li> This shaver did take some of the little balls off of my sweater, but not all of them.</li>
            <li> so it takes a little longer..</li>
            <li> Maybe there was a little crack in mine...</li>
            <li> Got all of the little fuzzy things out of my sheets and some pillows.</li>
            <li> This little bugger works wonders.  </li>
            <li> This device is meant for shaving off all those little fuzz balls that build up on some materials and can make a sweater, for example, look too well-worn.  </li>
            <li> It does however get the job done, you may have to apply a little force or go over an are though</li>
            <li> Another issue is, lint gets stuck behind the blade, and when you see how it is set up it is nearly impossible to safely remove sometimes.</li>
            <li> After a few years of use, my couch cushions had little fuzz balls covering the fabric.</li>
            <li> This little guy broke after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> If we can fix it, I will post an update but as for now - thumbs down on this item.&lt;br /&gt;God bless!</li>
            <li> Two down, about 50 to go!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not refined engineering here, and I do allow that maybe a bad one slips by, but this little $10 purchase was way worth it.  </li>
            <li> just be careful to not push too hard.</li>
            <li> As advertised, but, do be careful and don&#x27;t press too hard.</li>
            <li> My friend had given me a sweater that I knew she didn&#x27;t want because it was looking a little ratty... less than five minutes with the Fabric Shaver and the sweater looks brand new--my friend&#x27;s loss!</li>
            <li> Difficult to get the clear lint cap to stay in place.  </li>
            <li> I remember when these devices were first introduced, and the manufacturers were so afraid of clothing damage that the holes were too small</li>
            <li> Just takes a few seconds to rub it across.</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t waste money if it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> but you have to go over the area quite a few times.</li>
            <li> (places where it was uneven</li>
            <li> and it has renewed a few of my wool hats and sweaters already.</li>
            <li> It tackled a few duty uniforms with strings and fuzz all over it</li>
            <li> If you want to spend hours toying with it to get the job done it might then accomplish something, perhaps; but my experience with this product was a waste of time and purchasing it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I received this item a few days ago.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on it.</li>
            <li> at first i thought it didn&#x27;t, and i was very sad, but then i realized it was just the safety cap.</li>
            <li> I have arthritic hands and the that shaver is too heavy, is not a brand name and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have a few shirts and sweaters that always need to be de-pilled after I was them and</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t press it against the fabric like it&#x27;s roll-on deodorant, and you won&#x27;t destroy your lighter knits.</li>
            <li> This thing just quit working one day a few months ago.</li>
            <li> the few articles of clothing I&#x27;ve used this on, it&#x27;s already paid for itself.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Also, lint comes out the front, since it&#x27;s trapped.  </li>
            <li> I used it on a few sweat shirts</li>
            <li> i had that were so heavily pilled that i didnt even want to wear them out</li>
            <li> I tried it out on a heavy sweater and a lightweight poly/rayon shirt.</li>
            <li> I used this on my cashmere blend sweater which is balling terribly - and it cleaned it up so nicely.</li>
            <li> My mistake for not ordering a heavy duty fabric.</li>
            <li> Within seconds it too was sucked in and another hole was left behind.      </li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00475A4KK Sunbeam S15 Lint Shaver, Medium]]Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li> I used it on a few things when I got it</li>
            <li> Used firm pressure on heavily textured items (like homemade, cabled knits) but lighter sweeping motion on firmer finish (yoga pants).</li>
            <li> Not PERFECTLY smooth but just about there.</li>
            <li> I have used it on a few items and the battery hasn&#x27;t run out yet even though it&#x27;s on for quite a bit each time.</li>
            <li> and the message is don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Just throw a few batteries in it, turn it on, and those lint balls on your sweatshirts, etc.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a miracle worker, but if you are patient and diligent you can definitely improve a tired looking sweater.</li>
            <li> I ordered this sweater shaver after years of not getting one for fear of it destroying clothing.</li>
            <li> I have a couch and chair that \\&quot;pill\\&quot; every few months</li>
            <li> You just run it over the fabric a few times and it shaves off the threads that have balled up.  </li>
            <li> I think this was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> , I had a few &amp;#34;test worthy&amp;#34; pieces of clothing, and it blew threw them.</li>
            <li> Started to hate sitting on my couch because the pilling would rub on my skin, but now it&#x27;s as smooth as ever.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and time with this one.  </li>
            <li> It does not remove the fuzz from my sweaters, It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and it got all the fuzzballs without destroying the lining.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a lot and it has put a few holes in some of my sweaters.</li>
            <li> I have restored quite a few sweaters using this thing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The few times it&#x27;s worked, it&#x27;s worked well.</li>
            <li> I have used this just a few times and this past time, the screen completely tore and now the device is inoperable (because the small blades now get stuck on the broken screen part).  </li>
            <li> ; in a few swipes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say you&#x27;d have to be careful with thinner garments and delicate material.</li>
            <li> Shaved a few sweaters with it</li>
            <li> and I kept having to hit it a few times for it to go.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Yeah, same problem as others stated, it can cut you underwear, socks or really thin T shirts.</li>
            <li> hoodie my mother bought me as a souvenir that balled up after wearing it a few times.</li>
            <li> As a fabric shave it leaves a lot left behind and doesn&#x27;t get a close shave.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of sweaters and a few polyester workout pants.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> An image should be posted depicting the missing blade.</li>
            <li> I had to go over the sweater a few times to remove all the pills, but it worked.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try this on anything I consider delicate, but for cotton and cotton blend items it worked just as expected.</li>
            <li> This is a pain in the neck because it&#x27;s messy, and twice already I&#x27;ve lost the cover because it lands under the couch or somewhere else.  </li>
            <li> I had some doubts after purchasing it, but when I actually used it on my coat, it really cleaned it all up and shaved all that crap</li>
            <li> the fuzz doesn&#x27;t move down into the holding caddy so well, but it usually does and you can tell when it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> And I mean when it&#x27;s empty of batteries because...</li>
            <li> I read other reviews about it leaving holes, and I can see how that might happen if you pressed too hard as the metal shield is flexible.</li>
            <li> In other words, like you wouldn&#x27;t throw a wool sweater into the washing machine, you still need to use your common sense when using this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shirt was extremely thin cotton, and since it wasn&#x27;t flat it snagged and the shaver sliced a hole in the shirt.</li>
            <li> A flat surface helps or put your hand behind the fabric you are working with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small and the fabric gets packed pretty tightly around the cutting head meaning you have to stop and dig the fabric out away from the head.</li>
            <li> This little shaver cost a mere fraction of those trousers, and it cleaned up the entire mess.  </li>
            <li> Note, though, that if your material is VERY thin (such as lingerie) it will work but you must be VERY careful to hold the fabric taut, or it will get sucked up resulting in a smal snag or hole.  </li>
            <li> THERE&#x27;S JUST ONE THING WHERE THE LINT HOLDER IS A LITTLE  SMALL.</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit off, but clothing is not much better than where you started.</li>
            <li> Other than these somewhat annoying problems, the device works well and is probably worth its small cost.</li>
            <li> One thing to keel in mind that if you press the head down too hard, it might snag your sweater.</li>
            <li> but you have to press down really hard to get rid of the pilling</li>
            <li> I did have to push down kinda hard for it to get it all, but considering the fabric</li>
            <li> a \\&quot;PRIME\\&quot; member, this new policy sucks!!!</li>
            <li> It pills up pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> not sure what i should do, what a waste.</li>
            <li> I make small round circles when using this on clothing and keep it moving (like an iron).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the negative reviews get you down....</li>
            <li> Not very effective at removing pill-y sweaters.  </li>
            <li> Some negative reviews said it tore fabrics, but you obviously dont want to use it on anything thin.  </li>
            <li> Some of the negative reviews said it was too rough on delicate fabrics</li>
            <li> And the worst part is that it is more trouble than it cost to return it.</li>
            <li> I was extra careful using the shaver for fear of cutting a hole in the fabric.  </li>
            <li> A blade was missing, the package was difficult to open, and the blade is nowhere to be found inside the package or in the product&#x27;s interior.</li>
            <li> Those little pills on clothes annoy the crap out of me and this shaved them right off.</li>
            <li> I cannot stand when there are little balls all over my clothes, and this takes all of them away without ruining my pants and shirts!</li>
            <li> This little guy does what it says!</li>
            <li> I picked up this little gem for some sheets that had grown quite a bit &amp;#34;pilly&amp;#34; and it works like a charm!  </li>
            <li> , this is your solution (when my husband does the laundry this happens often, I&#x27;m thankful for his help but this little machine is a must!)</li>
            <li> It took all the little pills off of my sheets and sweaters!</li>
            <li> This little fabric shaver has saved my wardrobe!</li>
            <li> I have always had one of these little things at home and this one is turning out to work just as well as all the others!</li>
            <li> and to go slowly with an up and down motion and small areas at a time.</li>
            <li> I have black crop cardigan sweater that I like to wear when it is a little chilly outside</li>
            <li> have had it for over three years and the blades are just now getting a little dull.  </li>
            <li> I also find it hard to turn the little button on and off.</li>
            <li> I pressed fairly hard on the sock but aside from trimming off all of the little \\&quot;nubbies,\\</li>
            <li> : Be VERY light (especially on thin fabrics!!!)  </li>
            <li> The fabric I&#x27;m using it on is heavy though, and I saw some other reviews that said it&#x27;s not great with lighter weight fabric.</li>
            <li> This little shaver, although delicate, once all the seems are aligned it will not fall apart.</li>
            <li> This does work, but is a little bit delicate.</li>
            <li> It does work a little slow though, so patience is needed.</li>
            <li> Now it won&#x27;t work (the blades stop when they hit the broken fragments of the guard) and even if it WOULD work, I&#x27;m afraid to use it for fear the now too large guard holes would allow the blades to put holes in my sweaters!  </li>
            <li> Took off a star because I accidentally pressed down a bit too hard on one of my thin cotton shirts and it created a small hole, so definitely be careful!</li>
            <li> On these fabrics, hold them taut, go slow and don&#x27;t press down hard - it will work.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After you&#x27;re done using the fabric shaver, I recommend just emptying the small container with all the shaved fabric.</li>
            <li> I have a Lazy Boy sofa and chair that I wanted to throw away because of all the fuzz balls.  </li>
            <li> My advice: proceed with caution, especially if you are using it on expensive clothes.</li>
            <li> The holes on the shaver are too small so it does not cut the fuzz off the sweater.  </li>
            <li> The lint collector is also small.</li>
            <li> its not magic.</li>
            <li> I had many t-shirts and sweatshirts that got nasty pilling on them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I would risk it on a lightweight blouse or pair of pants.</li>
            <li> Lint compartment is small but still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Besides that, the container is so small that you&#x27;re always thinking about emptying it.</li>
            <li> In short, the shaver failed to produce any visible results whatsoever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my case, this product was rendered completely useless after only two jobs.</li>
            <li> I am so tired of companies not having the minimal integrity it takes to produce something that doesn&#x27;t rip off the customer and the environment.    </li>
            <li> Small space for lint, fuzz, etc.</li>
            <li> I put some holes in my clothing, usually because I wasn&#x27;t paying attention.</li>
            <li> but it is past the return date.  </li>
            <li> The blades are covered with a metal mesh cover so there is no way the shaver can go overboard and create a hole.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what others were doing with this, but I could not get it to remove pills from sweaters.</li>
            <li> Does not happen all that often, so not sure what causes it?</li>
            <li> The one downside to these is that as small as they are, it can take an eternity to cleanup just one article of clothing.  </li>
            <li> I also had another small shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t put any holes in it which others have in the past.</li>
            <li> I had one in the past, can&#x27;t remember if it was this brand or not.  </li>
            <li> I read to be careful with thin fabrics though.</li>
            <li> I believe this is one necessity that people should buy but don&#x27;t usually think of.</li>
            <li> no more sweat shirt balls.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not totally sure why some reviewers are having issues with damaging their clothing.  </li>
            <li> It small.</li>
            <li> I run a small resale eBay business, and my biggest sellers are cashmere sweaters.</li>
            <li> I was lazy and tried to shave a spot on a shirt that I was wearing.</li>
            <li> No more pills on my knits.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really small</li>
            <li> Small but works well.</li>
            <li> It works for small items and for clothes that don&#x27;t have a lot of pilling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure who would take this on a plane.</li>
            <li> just careful using it on thin fabric.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, but it does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether i can change the blade or not</li>
            <li> I tried just a small area</li>
            <li> Not sure there is a painless way to do this  </li>
            <li> ... the shaving blade gets stuck or clogs a few times when your working on fabric that&#x27;s really thick material.</li>
            <li> I like it for small areas.  </li>
            <li> This is a small fabric shaver</li>
            <li> It does the job, but has a small head.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about this product?</li>
            <li> ....just be careful with thin material because it could get damaged ....</li>
            <li> I had many pairs of Lululemon workout pants and they pill terribly around the thighs.</li>
            <li> I was being lazy and didnt want to go to the store</li>
            <li> so I checked amazon  as usual and</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter as a small advent gift.  </li>
            <li> no more fuzzies on sleeves.</li>
            <li> and my wife gives everyday use!</li>
            <li> I got a small hole in the arm of one sweater because I tilted the shaver, but it&#x27;s nothing a stitch can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but pilling on some favorite sweaters made me desperate.  </li>
            <li> but it does the job, just past it over twice on the fabric.</li>
            <li> I know from past experience</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but it actually does the job.  </li>
            <li> I even use it for lint when I get lazy sometimes</li>
            <li> And it is small and compact</li>
            <li> I would be extremely careful with thin materials though...</li>
            <li> The metal pieces on the inside broke off during the first use :(</li>
            <li> the fabric shaver looked small; this is because the shaver is travel size.  </li>
            <li> but I was so anxious to begin.  </li>
            <li> I did not think this would be as small as it was.</li>
            <li> Small enought to store anywhere.</li>
            <li> not sure how it would do on thinner fabrics.</li>
            <li> small circular motions against the fabric.</li>
            <li> This is a small machine so be prepared for that.  </li>
            <li> not sure.  </li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ve got a small jagged hole in the blade cover.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to get anything too expensive or big.</li>
            <li> I have had a fabric shaver before, I  just need to replace it, this is small but it works well.</li>
            <li> And secondly, if you hold the shaver face down, the lint will build up in the cutting area and may ball up inside.  </li>
            <li> It does what it says it&#x27;s going to do, no better or worse than other ones that I have owned.</li>
            <li> It is also very messy.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal, certainly doesn&#x27;t affect performance - just slightly annoying in use.</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;d done about a foot of fabric I looked at it and noticed the metal part that touches the fabric was broken, and the sharp parts kept getting caught on the fabric.  </li>
            <li> I usually use a small set of tweezers and slowly pull them out from the bottom.</li>
            <li> I usually use a small set of tweezers and slowly pull them out from the bottom.</li>
            <li> If you have a thin and delicate sweater, be careful.</li>
            <li> and/or the lint holder seems to slide off during use.. not always but pretty annoying when it does happen :/</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it will fall apart if you look at it wrong.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews here, I was a little wary that using this fabric shaver would leave a hole in my garment.</li>
            <li> Not sure what will happen to extremely delicate materials, though.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I waited to long</li>
            <li> I did not realize this fabric shaver was so small and a bit slow.</li>
            <li> in all, I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to get rid of those annoying little pills that like to appear on sweaters, jeans, sheets... or anything else you might need it for.</li>
            <li> The blade seems a little weak</li>
            <li> They would look really bad but this makes them look brand new.</li>
            <li> I kept inserting new batteries, trying to determine if it was my batteries that were bad, or the product.</li>
            <li> but heck I would way rather spend money on batteries than have to buy couch covers, buy new couches, or have to sit and look at those ugly fuzz balls.</li>
            <li> Saved me money from not having to go to a dry cleaner of sorts to get all the weird fuzzies removed from my clothes.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of it operating on 2 AA batteries as I generally find battery operated devices to be poor quality.</li>
            <li> Somehow the subject of how frustrating balls on your sweater can be came up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slow but all these things are slow because they are so small.</li>
            <li> every fabric shaver I&#x27;ve seen in stores requires some weird fancy batteries, and I hate to go out and buy special batteries just for a fabric shaver which I might use twice a year!</li>
            <li> After a few months of infrequent use, the face of it broke making it useless (and sharp!</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job and just like every else says there are some small, very small concerns.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the cheap plastic construction of this unit.</li>
            <li> I had broken my cheaper version of this and desperately needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> Tough little shaver.</li>
            <li> Tip: Don&#x27;t push too hard with any pill shaver.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE REALLY HARD TO FIND IN THE MARKETPLACE THESE DAYS.  </li>
            <li> There is no need to press hard, it will still remove it.</li>
            <li> Note to people who describe having problems: DON&#x27;T PRESS HARD AGAINST THE FABRIC.</li>
            <li> They must be pressing really hard.</li>
            <li> Just dont press it too hard against the fabric.</li>
            <li> Even if I press hard, nothing happens.  </li>
            <li> I placed the jacket on a hard surface and followed the instructions.  </li>
            <li> and I hardly put any pressure on it at all.</li>
            <li> I figured I pushed too hard and tried on another, thicker cotton shirt.</li>
            <li> press on the fabric too hard though</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t push too hard, you will probably damage the fabric.</li>
            <li> I think I pressed to hard</li>
            <li> I used it on a fuzzy sweater (don&#x27;t press too hard) and on a pair of stretchy workout pants.  </li>
            <li> Maybe others were pressing too hard???</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t press to hard</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m addicted to this little tool now</li>
            <li> I wish I had listened to the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> On complaint is it&#x27;s size and  </li>
            <li> I wouldnt recommend anyone using it on delicate material but works like a charm on sweaters or any thicker material.</li>
            <li> I would not advise using it on delicate items but it works miracles on heavier fabrics.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t late though</li>
            <li> (at least the batteries worked)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just common sense.  </li>
            <li> Again, that&#x27;s just common sense.  </li>
            <li> it does get rid of the random fabric stubble, but be careful...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t ruin the fabric at all like some users complained.</li>
            <li> If you have an expensive garment, be careful.  </li>
            <li> I have had several sweater shavers and this was by far the worst.</li>
            <li> do not recommend using it on delicate items - the snagging may be disasterous.</li>
            <li> I receieved this item really late</li>
            <li> least I haven&#x27;t approached strangers ... yet ...</li>
            <li> Not made to use on delicate things...used in a bra that somehow ended up in the wash with towels and needed to get the towel fuzz off...</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver doesn&#x27;t quite get all of the lint off, but at least it makes them wearable.</li>
            <li> I use to get the fuzz off my delicate VS bras</li>
            <li> Any reviews that have negative comments on this product are probably a result of someone using this on a garment that it wasnt meant to be used on, or perhaps user error.</li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s the case for me.  </li>
            <li> If I could give this product negative 5 stars I would.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slow process</li>
            <li> attached photo is of two thick dish rags.</li>
            <li> I tried it again on a thick pair of gloves that were pilling.</li>
            <li> Absolute crap.  </li>
            <li> I bought this just a month ago and now it slow</li>
            <li> and you must shave slowly.</li>
            <li> I was about ready to buy another couch because I couldn&#x27;t stand sitting on all those annoying fuzzy pill things</li>
            <li> It is also slow going.  </li>
            <li> used this on a thick sweater</li>
            <li> ...but rather slowly.</li>
            <li> also, thick sweaters clog it up and it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically for my fleeces sweaters, thick winter socks, and flannel sheets.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to put a thick rubber-band to keep the cover on.  </li>
            <li> be careful not to press on the clothes, it will tear them and make holes on them!!!!!</li>
            <li> I thought the batteries were bad or not tight.  </li>
            <li> Small inconveniences!</li>
            <li> so I am not sure how or why it broke!</li>
            <li> Does the job quite well for a small machine!</li>
            <li> I mean, isnt that why you are purchasing it?</li>
            <li> I knew these things existed (sweater shavers I mean), but continued to handpick off sweater pills..</li>
            <li> I mean how often do you need to shave lint?  </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no much more to expect from a fabric shaver than to shave fabric!</li>
            <li> The name Remington doesn&#x27;t mean anything.</li>
            <li> Small, easy-to-use, and efficient!</li>
            <li> No More Fuzz Balls!</li>
            <li> very efficient for cutting small thread for clothes, and socks..you can use for bedsheets also however the cutting surface area is very small</li>
            <li> One caveat is that their use on thin or shear knit garments should be undertaken with a delicate touch or you could end up with small holes.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed, however I am not sure that a pill remover exists that will truly take off all of the pilled fabric without damaging the item.</li>
            <li> This is very poor quality compared to other fabric shaver&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Also it make some small holes on my thin cotton wraps.  </li>
            <li> I have seen similar ones which are very expensive</li>
            <li> This works well but is very small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on thin, cotton shirts to heavy wool jackets - it works on anything I try!</li>
            <li> It ripped a small hole in my thin wrap.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about the product, just be careful while using on thin fabrics or sweaters because if you push down too hard, it can cut the fabric, but this can happen with ANY fabric shaver.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna try it again, but this was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Was a little nervous about purchasing due to bad reviews, but I needed one, and went ahead and purchased it.</li>
            <li> this shaver took it all off and it wasn&#x27;t difficult at all just a little time consuming.</li>
            <li> I am probably a little obsessed with using it though, whenever I see \\&quot;fuzzies\\&quot; as my nephew calls them I have to use this.  </li>
            <li> I will admit, I was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> Getting the lumps and bumps off of my expensive sweaters makes me feel this little device paid for itself after one use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little wary of buying another.</li>
            <li> It will also wear through the thin metal covering if you press too hard.    </li>
            <li> The blade is not removable and you cannot remove the fuzz behind it easily or hardly at all without a toothpick and a lot of effort.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> It was so bad that I couldn&#x27;t wear it in public anymore.</li>
            <li> Had several merino wool sweaters that looked to bad to wear.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s inconvenient to empty it.  </li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t terribly powerful--because you wouldn&#x27;t want it too powerful.  </li>
            <li> The suction power and cutting is minimal.</li>
            <li> This is not a good product because of the way it is made!!!!!!!!!!!1111</li>
            <li> This product failed within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> have a couple cotton throw pillows I got from my mom a few years ago that were pilling like crazy, but I didn&#x27;t want to get rid of because they had sentimental value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on both thick and thin wool sweaters, as well as a cotton pillow.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s broken</li>
            <li> packaging was a little tough to get off, but with a pair of scissors it wasn&#x27;t terribly difficult.</li>
            <li> Very small and not great at picking up the fuzzies from clothes, blankets, towels.  </li>
            <li> Dumb product.</li>
            <li> but it left me disappointed.</li>
            <li> It feels really weak.</li>
            <li> you are frustrated with some minor imperfections in your sweater type garment</li>
            <li> The shaver works well with two downsides:  (1) the battery cover and fuzz holder pop off constantly while shaving.  </li>
            <li> You dont need to press very hard to get it to work.  </li>
            <li> , you have to press very hard to get the fuzz balls off</li>
            <li> It spews it about during use and it is impossible to empty the reservoir after using it without a</li>
            <li> It pulled on the threads instead of cutting and it made a mess of a bunch of shirts.</li>
            <li> works well, BUT, stay away from silk or other very thin material, WILL CHEW IT UP!</li>
            <li> and it was tough cord type fabric</li>
            <li> Sometimes, it can be tough to get a lot of pills at once</li>
            <li> Do not use on very delicate fabrics.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it for very thick woven sweaters, either.  </li>
            <li> The fabric we had was very thick houndstooth,</li>
            <li> I suggest going over the pill-y spots very slowly and in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> Wish I could show before and after pics, so you could SEE what I mean!</li>
            <li> My husband left a &amp;#34;kleenex&amp;#34; in the  pocket of his washable wool/poly blend trousers, and it created a horrible pilled mess all over the pants from waist to hem when they were washed.  </li>
            <li> Depending upon how bad your garment is, you might want to have a trash can nearby to empty the lint trap often.  </li>
            <li> had some projects that were tedious but the Oreck turned out to be useless &amp; a waste of time &amp; money because it just didn&#x27;t pick up any of the pills (on any fabric) like it should</li>
            <li> I am shocked that some of the reviews here talk about possibly damaging fabric by using this in the wrong direction - I rubbed it all over my jacket in circles and it made no difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li> i was so annoyed when i took my bed sheets out of the dryer and there was all this pilling on it.</li>
            <li> I might be behind the times, I didn&#x27;t know they had electronic pill shavers.</li>
            <li> it is a thin shirt</li>
            <li> I agree with the poster about the poor quality.</li>
            <li> The shaver head is so thin, the blades tore it apart even before I got to use it.</li>
            <li> and then it got broken, nothing else you can do.</li>
            <li> Unclogging the point between the shaver and the \\&quot;bin\\&quot; is also frustrating.</li>
            <li> it just made it worse...</li>
            <li> Poor consistency.</li>
            <li> Poor product.</li>
            <li> Poor value.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> I purchased this 2 months ago and it&#x27;s already broken.  </li>
            <li> is it broken already?</li>
            <li> Broken.</li>
            <li> This product will take care of those irritating pills, or fuzzies, that cover the socks.</li>
            <li> I also used it on a thin, cotton shirt</li>
            <li> I am addicted.</li>
            <li> Has saved a ton of my sweaters from looking tired and worn out.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with the quality.</li>
            <li> I tried it on a thin rug that had all kinds of lint and pills.</li>
            <li> I had a ton of sweaters with fuzzy, irritating lint balls</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very poor design.</li>
            <li> It is tolerable but not great.</li>
            <li> I have become somewhat addicted to this though, always trying to find something to shave.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it on anything thin and valuable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requires 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li> Also the battery compartment is poorly designed.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I was totally confused.  </li>
            <li> I use it approximately once a week.</li>
            <li> The guard is made of thin aluminum and it appears that the blades got caught in the guard somehow and punctured holes in it.</li>
            <li> But this didn&#x27;t make it any worse to use except aesthetically.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But when I DO assemble it and use it, THE PERFORMANCE ON THIS POORLY MADE UNIT IS UNEQUALED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;But when I DO assemble it and use it, THE PERFORMANCE ON THIS POORLY MADE UNIT IS UNEQUALED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not use this on thin fabrics.</li>
            <li> Purrs and looks like a vibrator sex toy, but don&#x27;t be confused</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the replacement at all.</li>
            <li> The Fabric Shaver works well but the fuz often gets stuck behind the blades and does not go through to the receptacle.  </li>
            <li> I ordered two of them and one of them was damaged - one of the side hooks to hold the transparent cover to the lint repository on was broken.  </li>
            <li> Total crap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not experienced any damage or difficulty using.</li>
            <li> Of course, I did not buy this for thin material, but given the &amp;#34;suck&amp;#34; it has on the fleeces etc.</li>
            <li> I received broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on sweaters, hoodies, a blanket and a thin t-shirt</li>
            <li> Only thing that has worked to get those annoying sweater balls off</li>
            <li> This is not a great shaver.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the performance of this as it had decent reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little bit obsessed now with \\&quot;shaving\\&quot; all of our clothing!</li>
            <li> I washed some of my delicate fabrics with other clothes and got these annoying balls of lints of them.</li>
            <li> but I will be cautious based on the other reviewers who had bad experiences.  </li>
            <li> I used it on two pairs of my dress pants that look like some Velcro pulled up the fabric into a balled up and unpleasant mess.</li>
            <li> The first problem I encountered was the amount of noise it emits, its very annoying and irritating!</li>
            <li> This shaver does not really get all of the fuzzies off of my fleece jacket, really disappointed by it by it</li>
            <li> Put a small hole in the fabric, a real thin cotton.  </li>
            <li> I received this in the mail a few weeks ago and this was the worst 10 bucks I ever spent.</li>
            <li> I hate to do that because the grill is the only thing wrong with it &amp; with the grill</li>
            <li> I then panicked because i went through and actually read some of the reviews after i bought it, and a lot of them were really bad!</li>
            <li> Gets rid of all those annoying pills and any loose threads.</li>
            <li> waste your hard earned money on this, seriously :( !</li>
            <li> I have a thin cashmere sweater that it made a hole in, sadly.</li>
            <li> but I would not use it on thin cotton or silk or any expensive fabric</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not ideal, but</li>
            <li> This has ripped holes n 2 pair of expensive Victoria Secret Sweat Pants ..</li>
            <li> so was a little disappointed by this $10 shaver.</li>
            <li> Very weak.</li>
            <li> Some items get those annoying little lint balls all over them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since some of the bad reviews mentioned shaver rips delicate fabric,</li>
            <li> I bought it to try on an expensive pregnancy pillow</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, within 30 seconds, I managed to put a hole in the fabric.</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical about these fabric shavers before, but decided to try one.</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical when I purchased it but the anti-pill device worked beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> it was so uncomfortable to sleep on.</li>
            <li> It is now useless.</li>
            <li> otherwise it&#x27;s just too expensive to operate.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing</li>
            <li> it is going to break and this device will be rendered useless.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try my expensive energizer lithium batteries in this thing and it still didn&#x27;t work correctly.</li>
            <li> Finding two AA batteries isn&#x27;t that difficult.</li>
            <li> You honestly can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> And the container for collecting pills is difficult for the pills to enter.</li>
            <li> Sweater #3 was where everything went wrong.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s useless without the protective screen.  </li>
            <li> but the style makes it difficult to keep the battery door on in your hand.</li>
            <li> Without the cap it&#x27;s completely useless.</li>
            <li> Now the thing is useless.</li>
            <li> I bought mine sold by Amazon.com and was thinking if something went wrong</li>
            <li> I recommend this to all - Especially those frustrated like I was!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see anything wrong with this</li>
            <li> The item is simply a useless gadget.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s completely useless for that.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> That was wrong, I know.  </li>
            <li> Bought a sorry one from Windemere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
            <li> it work for someone who is bored...</li>
            <li> This one works as described but it feels weird in your hand.</li>
            <li> lint and pill remover is wrong</li>
            <li> Without the cover, the shaver is useless because the blades alone will not help.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this since it just works.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately they started getting fuzzies in the legs and it wasn&#x27;t until my mom suggested this item that I had some hope of saving them since the brand no longer makes them.</li>
            <li> but it seems that something is wrong with it.,..</li>
            <li> It must have been doing whatever the equivalent of short-circuiting them is to batteries, making them useless.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t stay on, even with brand-new batteries, and it seems to shave away the &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; at random, taking some and leaving others, regardless of the number of times I go over the fabric.  </li>
            <li> I dont use this a ton but at the price you cant go wrong</li>
            <li> If not then the results are sad, which maybe a hole in your favorit cardigan sweater.</li>
            <li> ...and people with OCD should be wary.  </li>
            <li> Not happy!</li>
            <li> I was a bit wary because I thought if I pushed it too forcefully on the fabric, it might cut the fabric</li>
            <li> its difficult to find these...</li>
            <li> Not happy!!</li>
            <li> My wife had an expensive coat with &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; all over the arms after one year of use.  </li>
            <li> recieved broken so never even got a chance to use!</li>
            <li> but ill take that over a linty sweat shirt any day</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a tedious process</li>
            <li> instructions for polarity were vague but neither way worked.  </li>
            <li> Flimsy and difficult to control because of this.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t expensive</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t being rough with it, I&#x27;m so disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very poorly designed, the plastic cover that collects lint keeps falling off.</li>
            <li> The surface is very thin and chap made, almost like aluminium foil.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet encountered the problem of it pulling in very thin fabrics</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update December 12th:  There is a cap over the blades that is made of a very thin laced metal.  </li>
            <li> It was previously COVERED with pills and looked really bad and felt bumpy!</li>
            <li> I learned this the hard way :(  </li>
            <li> but the horrible part is that the receptacle falls off every time I pick it up as well as the battery cover being loose.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed to report that this is not a good quality product.</li>
            <li> It just went by it without the blades cutting it.</li>
            <li> I got this because I have a few sweaters that look terrible with all of the pilling of the fabric.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need to worry about accidentally cutting fingers or hurt yourself.</li>
            <li> And at times, it seems to loosen from the shaver, which is disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going sweater crazy using this one every cashmere/wool sweater i have.</li>
            <li> The couch&#x27;s cloth is sturdy so no problem with cutting through the fabric.  </li>
            <li> I was bracing myself for disappointment, wondering if the thing would even work.  </li>
            <li> That was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Been reading reviews and was afraid that I could ruin my clothes.</li>
            <li> Beats having to snip the pills off with scissors and risk cutting holes into your sweaters.</li>
            <li> With this screen on the head, no problem, &amp; it makes a cutting noise over the hum</li>
            <li> it cleans almost my all dirty clothes.</li>
            <li> and they just make me look dirty.</li>
            <li> My couch just pills like crazy after I wash the covers.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t end up cutting holes in your stuff</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s useless!  </li>
            <li> Sorry to say that i was bitterly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I admit, I have now become completely obsessed with using this thing!</li>
            <li> To the point that my fiance looked at them and got mad</li>
            <li> No need to buy an expensive one!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was sooo wrong!  </li>
            <li> which the sellers here are making a mad profit off of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In a desperate move to save it, I purchased the Remington Fabric Shaver and was shocked to see how well it worked.  </li>
            <li> I posted the pictures because it&#x27;s impossible to describe how fantastically this product worked.</li>
            <li> The blades hit the cover and broke a spot in it making it impossible to shave without tearing the fabric.</li>
            <li> and it came out covered in impossible to remove lint</li>
            <li> The fuzz clogs the head and is impossible to get out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is surprisingly awful, don&#x27;t waste $5!!!  </li>
            <li> But it will do for sweaters that aren&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad one or what, but this did not work.</li>
            <li> The sheets were so bad that they felt like sand paper.  </li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> it was so bad.  </li>
            <li> I used the fabric shaver the day I got it in the mail and on 4 badly fuzz covered sweaters caused by purse straps.</li>
            <li> I like to read the bad reviews to see what people don&#x27;t like about products.</li>
            <li> I feel bad-</li>
            <li> and I broke out this bad boy.</li>
            <li> It works if your sweater isn&#x27;t in really bad shape yet.</li>
            <li> Its not too bad.</li>
            <li> Extremely bad quality..</li>
            <li> V v bad quality.</li>
            <li> Depending on how badly pilled, it may take a while to shave a sweater.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Too bad.  </li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> It took off all the bad textures immediately.</li>
            <li> This saved my living room chairs which were pilling really badly.  </li>
            <li> Painful but works.</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work at all:( Did not remove lint!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>

            <li> I used it on the sleeve of my coat, it didn&#x27;t even make it around the sleeve :(  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> That means that batteries have to be changed often, almost every use:(</li>

            <li> This fabric shaver took care of those stupid pills in a matter of seconds.</li>

            <li> I had lint pills on my pants and blankets and the scratchy texture was slowly annoying me out of my mind.</li>

            <li> I like this fabric shaver because it takes off those annoying pills.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely brutal on knit fabrics, even something as sturdy as athletic socks.</li>
            <li> I had a very badly pilled cashmere sweater I was about to toss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just disappointed that I didn&#x27;t buy this sooner!  </li>

            <li> However, to the touch, the hundreds of pills make the leggings just feel terrible.</li>
            <li> horrible product and deceptive reviews</li>
            <li> I immediately tried it on my worst pilly sweater.  </li>
            <li> and they looked terrible.</li>
            <li> They have been looking dreadful for ages, and I was agonizing over trying to de-pill them by hand.</li>
            <li> I have a pair of pants that had some awful pilling.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!!!!!</li>
            <li> GOT BROKEN IN 30 SECONDS OF USING IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Keep it in my bathroom to touch up those nasty lint balls after a wash.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver specifically for my fabric couch that was pilling terribly.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to use on a pair of my boyfriends polyester/nylon workout pants, because after one wash they were terribly pilled!</li>
            <li> Just awful!</li>
            <li> This product was the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever bought on Amazon.</li>

            <li> I had some that I wasn&#x27;t wearing because they looked terrible with the pills all over them.  </li>
            <li> I bought this thing because I have a terrible fuzz problem with all of my tights/leggings and a couple dresses.</li>

            <li> Not as good as the other fabric shaver I had.  But it will do for sweaters that aren&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> As described. Works great!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. I use it to shave my sweaters and coats. But it is so sharp sometimes. I had made a hole on one of my sweaters. Just be careful while using it.</li>
            <li> We bought this initially to remove the all too common fuzzball from our clothes. It does a decent job but depending on the situation, it might not do a perfect job. I had one shirt that was basically all scuffed up on the back from a zipline harness. I don&#x27;t have a picture before using this fabric shaver but here&#x27;s took a picture of what it looks like afterwards. This t-shirt is 60% cotton and 40% polyester like most of my shirts. I did the best I could with removing the fuzzballs and in the end, the shirt&#x27;s fabric look a little washed out. There were still some fuzziness but the shaver couldn&#x27;t remove those anymore. This shaver does a good job in most cases when it&#x27;s a small job. In my extreme case, the harness I was wearing for my zipline adventure just caused way too much damage. Other shirts that have less fuzzballs are removed without any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have since used this shaver on other fabrics like bed sheets, pillow cases and blankets. Unless those bed fabrics are torn or very old, there should no need to throw them away. They will build up with fuzzballs over time and we have used this shaver on multiple occasions to do a perfect job of removing every single fuzzball so far. If you look at the two pictures of the before and after on the bedsheet, you will notice a huge difference. It&#x27;s just a corner of the bedsheet and it took just a few minutes to remove basically most of the fuzzballs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is that it will not pick up any hair or loose particles unless it&#x27;s stuck to the fabric and is small/rounded enough to fit into the shaving head area. I actually have a small tear on the sheet and rolled over it with the shaver to see if it will snip it off. It just went by it without the blades cutting it. This is probably for the best since the purpose of this shaver it to remove fuzzballs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you&#x27;re done using the fabric shaver, I recommend just emptying the small container with all the shaved fabric. It&#x27;s usually a simple cleaning but if it&#x27;s a long or big job, there tends to be some additional fabric stuck where the blade is. I usually use a small set of tweezers and slowly pull them out from the bottom. You can also remove the face plate and try removing it there but I find it more effective removing from the bottom of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is pretty lightweight and operates on two AA batteries which are not included. I had this unit for over a year now and still haven&#x27;t changed the battery yet. We don&#x27;t use this frequently but when we do, especially on bigger jobs like bedsheets, it can be used for a good 15-20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- light enough to carry in your travel bag to use when needed&lt;br /&gt;- does an almost perfect job in every case with only one exception for me when one of my shirts was badly scuffed by a zipline harness I was wearing&lt;br /&gt;- cleaning out the shaved fabrics is pretty straight forward and not too messy if you&#x27;re careful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- fabrics tend to get stuck hear the spinning blade area when it&#x27;s used for long/big jobs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first but after multiple uses and on bigger fabrics with more fuzzballs, I was amazed that this actually worked compared to other shavers I&#x27;ve used. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who hates fuzzballs and wants to remove them easily and effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find my review helpful, please click on the Yes button.g or big job, there tends to be some additional fabric stuck where the blade is.

            <li> So glad I bought this!  As other reviewers have said, the battery cover sometimes slips off during use, but I am amazed at the results this little gadget provides.  I bought it to try on an expensive pregnancy pillow that&#x27;s fabric had pilled all over.  It now looks and feels like new!</li>
            <li> Awesome little product.  I&#x27;m sure there are better out there, but for the price, it does what is needed.  I have had no issues with damage to clothes or anything of the such.  It does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friends &amp; it was exactly what she wanted &amp; needed.  A+ service.</li>
            <li> this shaver works good. it&#x27;s able to shave off most pills on things that i&#x27;ve used it for.</li>
            <li> Works very well and small enough to travel</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having problems with it, try changing the batteries. That can make a pretty big difference.   EDIT: It stopped functioning properly not long after I got it.</li>
            <li> Works great! Gets rid of those rough places in fabric and makes the item look really nice. Just takes a few seconds to rub it across.</li>
            <li> I have and electric blanket that got these burgundy balls in quite a large section from a comforter that shed. this shaver took it all off and it wasn&#x27;t difficult at all just a little time consuming. Would highly recomend this one.</li>
            <li> This is good for traveling but for everyday home use this may be too small and can fall apart (lint bin) easily.  It does the job just not really an &amp;#34;industrial&amp;#34; strength item that I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I bought this to touch up a sweatshirt and within 30 minutes I was shaving everything from some of my wifes clothing to my daughters baby doll.  She thought I was murdering it with a vacuum but that baby looks so good now.  Up next, my taint!</li>
            <li> It was delivered exactly as stated. It is so easy to use. the sweater I am &amp;#34;defuzzing&amp;#34; has so much to defuzz that it will take some time but already I am seeing some good results.</li>
            <li> works well without harming clothes</li>
            <li> this was a product that I was not sure of, but it was great,  Saved quite a few sweater, not to mention leggings.  They look brand new.  Also works great on my husbands sweats</li>
            <li> this product is perfect, mine was not package properly so it came with a little crack which was minor. works like a charm and the battery operates long.</li>
            <li> This thing is great! I&#x27;ve had it running for roughly 2 hrs now on the same set of batteries. So that&#x27;s awesome. It&#x27;s really easy to clean. Just pop it open and dump it out. The top screws off and you can tap out the fuzz that gets trapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on my hand-me-down couch. It has cat scratching damage on EVERY corner. The couch is microfiber suede, and I thought if I bought one of these deals it could make it look a little nicer. I&#x27;ve been really impressed with how it&#x27;s been cleaning up the material. I posted the pictures because it&#x27;s impossible to describe how fantastically this product worked. It took several passovers and some patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it on a sweater and it worked amazingly there as well. It&#x27;s not a new-looking sweater, but this took the wear off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No holes, no dead batteries, no hassle cleaning. Very nice product.</li>
            <li> Have the same one I bought years ago, blades stay sharp, easy to remove cover to clean.  Works so well I have had my children request them for presents in Christmas stockings!</li>
            <li> Good product.  Much less labour intensive than the manual scraper-style lint remover I have, and I didn&#x27;t need to stretch the fabric much with the shaver, so it seemed much kinder on the garments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process is naturally time consuming as the foil is only about an inch wide, but it worked a treat with only a few swipes back and forth over each area on cotton garments and even successfully on a Metalicus wrap (made out of pantyhose-like material) - even on this delicate material I didn&#x27;t have issues with the fabric being snagged or damaged.  The shaver did struggle on wool and I can&#x27;t see it bringing up a wool garment &#x27;as new&#x27; like it could on cotton with some patience - some of the lint bobbles on the wool seemed too large to fit in the foil&#x27;s holes, and I think the blades struggled to cut through the heftier fibres, plus it occassionally got clogged on the wool - so I am still not sure on the best thing for wool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For delicates, far definitely better than the manual lint remover I have.  I have not tried other brands of shavers to know how it compares to its competitors, but when this one dies I might try a larger sized unit like the Bobble Off as it seems to review similarly and perhaps this would save some time (presuming it works as well as this one of course!)</li>
            <li> the clear container falls off a lot while using it.  Also it make some small holes on my thin cotton wraps.  It&#x27;s cheap, so I&#x27;ll just keep it for thicker sweaters only.</li>
            <li> I had a different but very similar product which didn&#x27;t really get the job done. This one works like a charm!</li>
            <li> I like , like, like this product so much that I would give it ten stars. I crochet, so after my items are done and washed, they accumulate lint balls. The first time I used this little power house, my hat looked brand new, like I have brought it from a store or something. It is so light weight and the grip is comforting. It is easy to clean out and the lint shaving go neatly in it compartment. Great product.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be sooooo great. Popped it out of the packaging, put the batteries in, and immediately got started removing pills from my polyester knit shirt. Cool! Unfortunately, within 30 seconds, I managed to put a hole in the fabric. Stopped, read the directions this time, flattened the fabric as directed, and promptly added hole number two. Since the top was trashed at this point, I continued so as to get practice for the next top. So far I&#x27;ve practiced putting ten holes in my top. Took me two minutes. Pill removal just fair. Won&#x27;t submit any more knit tops to this brutality. Might work on sweaters but not going to risk it! Dumb product. Returning.</li>
            <li> Good and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> love it. It&#x27;s the little thing in life that make you happy. This makes me happy.</li>
            <li> Not the best out there, but does the job.</li>
            <li> This product was not available on the UK version of amazon (or any other website at the time of writing this review) and having read many reviews on amazon.co.uk of all the other fabric shavers, they all seemed to be described as being of very poor quality and build.     So I took a gamble and ordered the Remington one from the American Amazon site, resulting in having to pay as much for the delivery as for the product (i.e. double the quoted price in total).    Do I have any regrets? Absolutely not. Delivery was within 3 DAYS. More significantly, this product has literally made many of my old jumpers and sweaters that I was about to throw away look almost brand new. I&#x27;ve only had it for about a month but so far so good. Absolutely fantastic in fact and I feel I&#x27;ve already made my &#x27;money back&#x27; by virtue of all the bobbly (now almost brand new looking) woolen jumpers I was about to throw away.    Very solid build, nice design and I hope it will last for many years. Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> I got this because I have a few sweaters that look terrible with all of the pilling of the fabric.  I thought I would try this one since it was inexpensive and I wouldn&#x27;t waste money if it didn&#x27;t work.  Too my surprise, it works great.  It&#x27;s a slow process but if you take your time, the sweater comes out looking new!  My only negative is the place that holds the cut pieces is so small that you have to stop and empty it a few times as you are working as it doesn&#x27;t hold much.  That&#x27;s a small step in order to get a new looking sweater though.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have a Microfiber comforter that when I washed it it got a ton of little fuzz balls all over it. I bought this and now all the fuzz is gone and my comforter is back to perfect again.</li>
            <li> i was really excited to use this shaver. but while shaving my sweater, my sweater was not perfectly flat and it knicked my sweater and now it has a hole in it....not sure what i should do, what a waste.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SHAVER, LIKE MY TITLE SAYS TINY BUT POWERFUL. IT&#x27;S SHAVES EXTREMLY FAST AND IT FITS JUST RIGHT IN THE HAND. THERE&#x27;S JUST ONE THING WHERE THE LINT HOLDER IS A LITTLE  SMALL. RATHER THAN THAT I WOULD SAY IT&#x27;S PERFECT.

            <li> I have these microfiber leggings I adore and wear constantly throughout the winter to stay warm. They pill over time and because the pills are very small, they can barely be seen. However, to the touch, the hundreds of pills make the leggings just feel terrible. I bought this little gadget on the many good reviews and it worked magnificently. My leggings feel as good as they did when I initially bought them. Do not hesitate to purchase!!!!</li>
            <li> We ordered this Sunday, and here on Thursday, it was left in our mailbox.   What we haven&#x27;t tried. Lint tape, lint paper, bounce bars, anything and everything! The most expensive brand-name sweaters, we wash, and they turn into sweaters from the dollar store.  Change detergents.  Change washing machine.  Until a family relative told us that there in Europe she uses a fabric shaver, we decided to buy a cheap one to test it. We were amazed! The lint came off so easily, we didn&#x27;t even have to put any force on the fabric shaver. We just steered it and it removed the lint. Best investment ever made!</li>
            <li> This little shaver is the best!!!!!!!!  I always try not to buy the cheapest items, but most of us know that Remington has been around for years and they have the best shavers.  For being less than 10 dollars it works wonderful.  I have a Lazy Boy sofa and chair that I wanted to throw away because of all the fuzz balls.  The seats and the arm rests were full of them.  Well I cant afford new furniture right now so I researched on the internet how to get rid of fuzz balls off of fabrics.  This item was the first to come up and everyone else gave it good reviews and it is true.  I got it yesterday and did not want to put it down.  This little shaver removed those fuzz balls like a big industrial machine.  I have no complaints.  It is tiny, so I had to empty the shaving a lot but that was fine because it was doing its job.  My furniture looks new again.</li>
            <li> Works as described. I mostly use it on my wool coat. Some negative reviews said it tore fabrics, but you obviously dont want to use it on anything thin.  Is slightly time consuming but it gets the job done</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to remove the lint and pills on a black North Face fleece that resulted from jacket being accidentally washed with a load of towels.  When the jacket came out of the wash, it was literally covered with lint from the towels that I could not remove with tape or by brushing.  This little shaver was literally my last hope to save an $80 fleece jacket.    Over the course of a half hour, I treated the entire jacket with this shaver and it performed far beyond my expectations, removing every trace of lint and pills on it.  I cannot recommend this shaver strongly enough for big or small jobs.  This shaver was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is amazing what this tool can do for the money!  I used it on all kind of clothes and fabrics, even on my hosiery, just be careful with thin and gentle things.  Surprisingly, it does not drain batteries and easy to clean.  I do not know for how long blades last, but I am going to buy one more shaver for someone else as a practical gift.</li>
            <li> Its tiny but offers great value! Made a couple of my old and well used pants look brand new again.</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical about these fabric shavers before, but decided to try one. It works great and collects lots of wool pills in a couple of minutes. Honestly, I cannot imagine how any of the more expensive ones could be any better.</li>
            <li> The Rmington Batter Operated Fabris Shaver does just what it was advertised to do.  It works wonderfully and I really like it.  My sweaters have never looked better.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this purchase. I&#x27;ve had this little shaver for about 9 months now, and have used it on all sorts of fabrics -- not just sweaters but t-shirts, socks, sheets, and more. It&#x27;s never damaged a single item, is super-easy to use, and almost idiot-proof. The only inconvenience is the the little plastic cover tends to pop off on its own, but it&#x27;s only a minor issue. I&#x27;m yet to replace the batteries in it, too, so it&#x27;s definitely not an energy hog.</li>
            <li> Wow. This little device really impressed me. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product works great on sweaters. So far it hasn&#x27;t gotten clogged or had any issues. Handy tool to keep around.</li>
            <li> Does an okay job but you have to go over the area quite a few times. I&#x27;ve used other hand held pill removers that have worked much better. But with patience, this one is fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little gadget, however, it worked for about ten seconds before it quit ... never to work again.  Tried several sets of batteries, just in case.  Nothing got it started.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this because the fuzzbuster of my youth was a Remington, and it was great and lasted forever. And while this is a very effective fuzzbuster (blew my drugstore one out of the water), it has some major flaws that have sent me looking for a replacement, namely:  - The holes in the cap are too big, making this a danger to delicate (and even not-so-delicate) fabrics. I made the mistake of fuzzbusting a delicately knit sweater and it chopped several holes in it (and I am very careful!). I also did a terrycloth jacket, and while it didn&#x27;t chop holes, it DID nick it in several places, pulling threads out of place.  - The supposedly ergonomic design is not so ergonomic. When cleaning fabric, I always hold the fabric in my left hand, with my hand beneath the area I&#x27;m cleaning, and then use my right hand to do the fuzzbusting. The only way this Remington would be ergonomic is if you held it in your hand at the angle shown in the picture. But to actually be effective, you need to hold it 90 degrees down from what the picture shows, meaning either the pointed end is in the palm of your hand or your wrist is awkwardly at 90 degrees. Not very comfortable.  - My final complaint is the fuzz holder. It seems to have a smaller capacity than other small fuzzbusters I&#x27;ve used, and because of the so-called ergonomic design of the whole device, the hole from the blade area into the receptacle is small and narrow. So the fuzz ends up getting stuck in the blade area, and you have to remove the cap, remove the blades, and clear it out. Also, the fuzz that does manage to get into the container gets stuck in the plastic seam, which isn&#x27;t sealed, but also isn&#x27;t removable. What a pain!  In short, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this. Find a traditionally-shaped fuzzbuster with smaller holes in the cap...that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of fabric pills on my sheets and never heard of a fabric shaver. After searching for something, I bought this and it works flawlessly. You can hear the unit pick up all the annoying pills, what a great sound. Now I can use my sheets without irritation.</li>
            <li> Works just as it claims. Perfect for that hoodie you love with the piling on it or a sweater you&#x27;ve worn many times. Just be careful on a thin shirt with piling- tore a whole right in a light T-shirt. That was a bummer. I recognize that could have been user error though so I still give the item 4 stars!</li>
            <li> This equipment becomes magical when I used the first time did not believe the results, made a short 5 years of use in looking for a new, fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love having this fabric shaver, it works awesome and does exactly what I need it to. I am probably a little obsessed with using it though, whenever I see \\&quot;fuzzies\\&quot; as my nephew calls them I have to use this.  I love the fact that its battery operated, used to have one that was corded and that was a pain, having a portable one is much much better.    Very easy to use, its self explanatory.   I have nothing bad to say about the product, just be careful while using on thin fabrics or sweaters because if you push down too hard, it can cut the fabric, but this can happen with ANY fabric shaver.    I highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited about this device for a while until I decided to use it on my $200 black peacoat. The coat collects a ton of lint so I thought this would be great for it. In the middle of shaving the coat I started to realize a bunch of \\&quot;cuts\\&quot; in the wool (places where it was uneven and you could see black threads instead of wool felt). I&#x27;m really bummed, the coat isn&#x27;t totally ruined but I feel like it won&#x27;t get as much use if parts of it are so worn down. My advice: proceed with caution, especially if you are using it on expensive clothes.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I&#x27;ve been using this guy for about 7 months and the battery is going strong. The container does fill up pretty quickly and I have on occasion pushed it open by accident and spilled the fuzz. Small inconveniences!</li>
            <li> horrible product and deceptive reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really a lazy housekeeper and about as far as obsessively tidy as you can get, but I now understand why people would be interested in depilling all of their cloth, household items.  This little guy is light, easy to hold, about half the cost of the last clothes shaver I bought, and actually does what it&#x27;s advertised!  It&#x27;s very fast and very effective, though you do have to be careful on fabrics with looser weaves or &#x27;stringier&#x27; knits where fibers are more easily pulled in and cut.  The fuzz holder is a bit small, but I don&#x27;t mind emptying it frequently.</li>
            <li> The holes on the shaver are too small so it does not cut the fuzz off the sweater.  Very dissapointed with this product and will be looking for a different model.</li>
            <li> I received this item today and i must say it works exactly how it is supposed to work. I have no issues what so ever and it has renewed a few of my wool hats and sweaters already. No complaints with this product at all, it is a great buy for its price.  most of the lint you gather doesn&#x27;t go fully into its small storage container though, it gets lodged near the blade section i used a toothpick to remove it then i was back to removing lint from my sweaters, still a great product.</li>
            <li> Believe the other reviews that say it cut holes in their garments.  I was having pretty good luck with this on two or three hoodies until this morning, when it cut a nice sized hole right in the middle front of my expensive cashmere sweater.  Sometimes cheap costs a lot!  If you do buy it don&#x27;t use it on anything you can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li> Had been searching for some time, for an upholstery shaver, that would make a difference.  This product is light weight, inexpensive, and has made my beautiful couch and chairs look  like new again.  A great find.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this item, it worked well until the guard broke into pieces. This renders the shaver un-usable. More plastic junk into the landfill...</li>
            <li> This liitle machine works great for med-large cable knit sweaters to tight weave items like sweats and turtlenecks. See the pictue of the Hubby&#x27;s red work sweater. It didn&#x27;t do so well on very large woven knit sweaters aand it picked a lot on those. (For those you really do need a larger sized machine with larger holes.) It did not pick on the smaller woven items at all. It works great for what it was made. Great deal for the price too. I have only had it a short time, so can&#x27;t comment on durability.  Tip: Don&#x27;t push too hard with any pill shaver. Go lightly. If you have a problem spot just pull it apart a little with your other hand.</li>
            <li> I wish I had listened to the negative reviews.  I used this today for the first time and it worked great on 2 sweaters...until the blade somehow got caught on the guard and broke it. Now it&#x27;s useless!  Anyone know if there is a way to buy replacement guards?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad one or what, but this did not work. It pulled on the threads instead of cutting and it made a mess of a bunch of shirts. I would take this back if I could.</li>
            <li> It actually works! Takes all the pilling off my sweaters. The lint container fills up rather rapidly and has to be emptied quite often. My main concern is the container is made of plastic and I&#x27;m wondering how long it will last with taking it off and putting it back on so frequently.</li>
            <li> I purchased this fabric shaver a month or so ago, and am only surprised it hasn&#x27;t yet run out of batteries, we use it so frequently.  It effectively removes pills and fuzz from sweaters, socks, rugs, upholstry, etc, making them look much more like new.  The only drawback we&#x27;ve found is that the fuzz container opens just a little too easily, especially when you&#x27;re pushing the on/off switch.  Best small appliance I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time.</li>
            <li> i have couple of winter clothes that had some fabric.&lt;br /&gt;it does the same as shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazing</li>
            <li> This is a great stocking stuffer or gift.  We use it all the time to remove pills and fuzzies from clothing, sweaters, blankets, etc.  It removes the little balled up areas without hurting the fabric, and stores everything neatly in the plastic compartment.  Great find.</li>
            <li> Not very effective at removing pill-y sweaters.  Wish i had bought a larger one.</li>
            <li> So far I am impressed with this product. It gets the little fuzzy balls off your close due to friction. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great little shaver but watch out it&#x27;s put a few holes in my sweaters.  You have the hold the fabric flat and stretched.</li>
            <li> Great little machine. Be careful with thin clothing make sure it is completely flat and do not press down too hard. I love this thing it works great!</li>
            <li> Love it. Made my scarf and look like new.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product but after only a month and a half it kept getting jammed then one of the blades broke off so I can&#x27;t give it a good review.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective fabric shaver.  My only complaint is that the plastic cover over the lint trap was constantly falling off! The shaver lasted only a few months before it stopped working but my son was using it when it stopped working so I am not sure how or why it broke!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, made my girlfriend super happy, which makes me happy...</li>
            <li> This works just okay, it takes quite a while to get many sweater burrs. And the battery cover and cover that holds the sweater burrs is constantly coming off as I use it.</li>
            <li> Great product! Lightweight and works really fast- I did several pairs of gloves within a minutes and they look brand new. Easy to clean. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this little shaver.  The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t come with batteries, and needs 2 aa batteries not 1 aaa.</li>
            <li> We bought one of these a long time ago but it was lost somehow so I ordered a new one and my wife really likes it. So now I may have get another one for me.</li>
            <li> I have been in need of a fabric shaver and this did not do what it was supposed to. Followed instructions and used it on a sweater and all it did was stop working after trying to remove anything. Tried it on multiple garments with the same thing. Every time it went over the fuzz it stop turning. In the end it removed absolutely nothing and probably did more damage to my items. While I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s worked for many people out there I can say that for me the one I received was a dud. Glad I can ship this back for free though.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, but using it on my sofa, it didn&#x27;t really shave off most of the pilling, so I&#x27;ll have to find something stronger?</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase. Have used on several sweaters and pair of pants. Clothes that looked poorly previously now look new again.</li>
            <li> our local paper did an article on caring for cashmere sweaters and this product was mentioned as her favorite.  she was right - it&#x27;s a great tool for keeping your sweaters looking brand new.  just remember to clean out the lint after you go over a sweater before you start another one.  this will keep the shaver from clogging.</li>
            <li> Really powerful! I actually shaved a hole in my thin, cashmere sweater, so I recommend not using it on more delicate fabrics. I actually purchased it to remove the piling on my sectional, and it works fantastic!</li>
            <li> This was a great lint shaver the only problem once the cover for the blades crakes the shaver stops working</li>
            <li> I love this thing. It does exactly what I hoped it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attached photo is of two thick dish rags. The one on the left has been defuzzed. The one on the right is next.</li>
            <li> This is my first fuzz buster - I love it.  I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and it&#x27;s worked great each time.  Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Works great. Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I loved this product when I got it I immediately went through all my sweaters &amp; got straight to work . It works wonders on pills &amp; lint . I would recomend this to every one . It made all of my old clothes look brand new . A must have in your clothing up keep drawer .    I only have two cons . 1 be easy with very thin fabrics because it will eat holes in your clothing if you press too hard or your item is not flat . that is user error tho . 2 I wish the pill catcher had a bigger opening because after a little bit the lint gets caucht in the head &amp; i have to stop and take the machine apart to empty everything because it becomes slower . kindof a pain but hey it was only $10 and it works . beggers cant be choosers .</li>
            <li> I needed a sweater shaver and read all the reviews on Amazon for the most highly rated products.  I could have paid $25 or more for a shaver that might not work as well as expected.  I decided to limit my losses... why not try the cheap one with reviews as good or better as the more expensive models?  This one just arrived and I tried it on three items:  a fraying silk tie, fraying shirt collars, and the pills on a fleece jacket (the main reason I bought it).  The shaver worked great on all of them. It is small but works fast and efficiently so that it doesn&#x27;t take long to cover the territory.  If I later find problems with it, I&#x27;ll be sure to come back and revise this review.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing! Have rescued several sweaters and knit socks that were otherwise heading to the thrift store. A word of caution, though---it WILL snag and cause holes if you aren&#x27;t careful or try to go too quickly (especially over curves, say if you&#x27;re wearing the sweater at the time).</li>
            <li> I like this product and it is working as expected, Very simple to use and It does the job.</li>
            <li> This little shaver saved several old robes and jackets.  I love it so much I purchased two more for my sisters.</li>
            <li> Best lint remover ever</li>
            <li> works very well and does the job, however, I waited a long time  for it tob e delivered</li>
            <li> Good, but I wish it&#x27;s larger for less work.</li>
            <li> I recieved this item within just a few days, shipping was extremely fast. This little shaver exceeded my expectations in all fields. It tackled a few duty uniforms with strings and fuzz all over it and it did it quickly with minimal passes. all in all a great product with great quality and construction and a great bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting something like this to work, but it does! gets rid of most of the pilling on my clothes, so, so far so good.  i wish the battery cover would stay on though</li>
            <li> Just got this today and I ordered it on the 5th so the wait wasn&#x27;t long at all. I used it immediately on a sweater that i&#x27;ve been wanting to wear to work, but couldn&#x27;t because it had a bunch of fuzzballs and lint on it. The results were great and my sweater looks brand new! I think that this is a good item that works for a very cheap price.</li>
            <li> This little thing is great.  Totally gets the job done quick and easy and it revived some sweaters and hoodies that really looked terrible.  I love it.</li>
            <li> works great! packaging was a little tough to get off, but with a pair of scissors it wasn&#x27;t terribly difficult.</li>
            <li> Have used it on many sweaters, gloves and socks.  Works well and faster than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Love the Sweater Shaver.  Keeps sweaters looking new!</li>
            <li> After a few decades, my old fabric shaver died. The Amazon reviews were a huge help in choosing a new one. I love everything about this new one, including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Functions perfectly. Does not overzealously eat holes in my garments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Feels great in the hand. My old reliable one was the same shape as the [[ASIN:B002MQ13XI Mini Clothes Lint Shaver]] . It was fine, but more awkward to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Clear case shows how full it is, and is easily removed and replaced to empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Fun.  My 11 yr old insists on being the one to use it for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  Attractive color and design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Reliable brand name. I expect to have it as long as I had my last fabric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Great low price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Runs on regular AA batteries - the size most of us have around the house.</li>
            <li> This is one of product worth your money. Bought another one for my Dad.</li>
            <li> I am very cautious when I use this, but it has worked really well! It has made my wool coat of 6 years look much newer.</li>
            <li> Best sweater shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. Gonna order the large size too</li>
            <li> This is an incredible device. I was so skeptical when I purchased it but the anti-pill device worked beyond my expectations. The garmet I recovered is like new. Would I purchase this product again?  ABSOLUTELY</li>
            <li> It did the job on my sweaters. It&#x27;s easy to hold and with the see through lint compartment, you know when to empty.  At first I could not get the head cleared of lint and then realized the top just unscrews.  I used to have one, but it seems to have been lost during the move, so was happy to find this on amazon for a nice price.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> this item is great, I love that its small and can travel with it, but it is noisy. I wish the it would hold more lint. Also, the lint gets stuck alot, so i kind of have to disassemble the product many times because the lint gets stuck. All in all i would recommend.</li>
            <li> this product is absolutely amazing. i was so annoyed when i took my bed sheets out of the dryer and there was all this pilling on it. it was so uncomfortable to sleep on. so i decided to try this out, and i do not regret it one bit! absolutely amazing. just be careful to not push too hard. just gently glide it over your clothes or else the blade might get caught and make a hole in your clothes. other than that, great item!</li>
            <li> saved my favorite hoodie from looking all pilly and gross  I can wear my favorite sweaters again  I used them on my sneakers too to get rid of the little balls of fabric that rub off from my socks</li>
            <li> I was in need of a way to get rid of the many lint balls that covered some of my our clothing. I have tried razors (works but takes so long), lint brushes, and tapes and none did the job. I was hesitant when purchasing this product because I thought \\&quot;$5.99 and its small\\&quot;..it will break once I use it on my husbands sweat pants. I WAS WRONG!!! My husbands sweat pants were full of lint balls! I was so embarrassed to say \\&quot;I did his laundry.\\&quot; As soon as I received my packaged I put it to use. It really took off all of the lint balls. I mean, my husbands pants looked brand new and they were full of lint balls from waist to pants leg. My 10 month old&#x27;s pants...NEW! My favorite black sweater...NEW! I can&#x27;t believe I wasted so much time trying to get rid of these things before. I will definitely buy this product over and over again.    Why I gave it 4 stars....the blade fan kept getting stuck. Product still worked great, but I shouldn&#x27;t have to shake it or tap it to start working again. The lint collector is also small.</li>
            <li> It works very, very well. It made clothes look newer and they felt softer as well.  The only drawback is the cover for the battery compartment slides off really easily when you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> It solves the problem that I have been struggling for a long time! Makes my clothes new again! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I was surprised how great this works. My kids sleepers are covered with fuzzies and it was driving me nuts. This thing is fantastic for such a great price too!</li>
            <li> I find it indispensable after washing and drying certain garments whose fabrics look awful once cleaned at home. Easy to use</li>
            <li> If you use this on fairly thick clothing it works ok. However, it does have a tendency to catch on the thread and has ripped a hole in many of my shirts. I wouldn&#x27;t recomend it....</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.  In fact I bought another one, my luck something that works this good will not be made in anther year. I plan on purchasing one more for my school costume closet. be careful when using it , if your material is clumped it will put a tiny hole in it...that&#x27;s how great it works....</li>
            <li> My suits that got snagged look like new again. My sweaters are &amp;#34;pill free&amp;#34;! This product is so simple but makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li> This product simply doesn&#x27;t work well. If you want to spend hours toying with it to get the job done it might then accomplish something, perhaps; but my experience with this product was a waste of time and purchasing it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This little wonder has done an amazing job on all of my sweaters and fleece items, they look brand new! It&#x27;s small enough that you can throw it in your suitcase and take it anywhere! All that and only $4.99!!!</li>
            <li> I will admit, I was a little skeptical. I have an older suit that had developed some fuzz in some areas. I figured heck I will give it a try since I dont wear it anymore because of it and was going to bring it in to Goodwill....after reading all the comments on here I gave it a shot... I used it on the Jacket and the Pants...the suit looks like new! Works great for 10 bucks shipped.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping  ;works very well.. Very powerful. Overall a wonderful product would consider buying again if necessary . was definitely worth the buy. Great for the money!!</li>
            <li> I have used other clothes shavers before, but found them to be unweldy and they often had a very high pitched whine to the motor. This model fits well in the hand and is light weight. Works while item is on the hanger, lying flat or while you are wearing it. The motor has a soft buzzing sound, not unpleasant. The shavings catch compartment is easy to remove and clean. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This works good. My only issue is that the reserve pops off pretty easily. Because of how I hold it while I&#x27;m using it, it tends to pop off in my hand. But I also had it fall on the floor once and spill lint everywhere. I wish it was on there a little tighter or in a different spot. But it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I had a couple sweaters and a comforter that were pilling and needed some clean-up.  This little gadget did an awesome job.  Everything looks like new.  Two things you should be aware of - it eats batteries quickly, and the collector cup sometimes comes off too easily (like while you&#x27;re using it).  Excellent price for what you get.</li>
            <li> This is the best little gadget I&#x27;ve bought in YEARS! I just got it, so I don&#x27;t know how long it lasts but it did a great job on a lace blouse I&#x27;ve been trying to save to no avail with a pill comb. I might be behind the times, I didn&#x27;t know they had electronic pill shavers. Anyhow, what used to be a painful chore that I only did for my most beloved items of clothing has now become a piece of cake. Just thinking of all the sweaters I can clean-up has me grinning from ear to ear.</li>
            <li> Nice little compact and easy to clean design. Always a good idea to have one on hand these days since we are so lazy and just through everything in the wash/dryer. We don&#x27;t use it that much, but when we need, we are glad to have it around!</li>
            <li> I received this handy little device for Christmas this year, and what a fantastic tool!  I immediately tried it on my worst pilly sweater.  It took a little while to get it clean, but the difference was night and day!  My sweater looks brand new!  I had to stop the shaver three separate times to remove all the lint it was collecting, but with the removable compartment and the screw-off head and removable blades, cleaning it is no problem.  The shaver is very gentle on my most delicate fabrics while being incredibly effective at removing lint and pills.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who owns sweaters, corduroy pants, blankets, or anything that gets pilly after a few washes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I&#x27;ve made so many of my old clothes look new again! However, you have to be extremely careful when using it..I&#x27;ve already put holes in 3 of my shirts. All of the shirts were fine and thin material though, so as long as you don&#x27;t use it on thin fabric then you should be fine.</li>
            <li> So far works really well on my sweaters without shaving off too much or getting stuck on the fabric. Very nice quality.</li>
            <li> Had never heard of a \\&quot;clothes shaver\\&quot; before a friend mentioned it to me.  Decided to get this one after reading reviews/checking prices.  It&#x27;s a great product!  I guess it&#x27;s not exactly a complicated device so maybe that&#x27;s why price is so cheap.  But whatever the case, this is a very effective product at a great price.  I \\&quot;shaved\\&quot; some of my wool scarves and hats and was amazed at the amount of \\&quot;wool whiskers\\&quot; that came off of them.  Also, the wool items looked way newer when I was done.  Strange that I&#x27;d never heard of this item before... and I&#x27;m 45 yo!  D&#x27;oh!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Starting using it in a pair of shorts. Everything was going fine. Then it stopped working. Part of the metal cap somehow broke and bent in causing the spinning blade to hit against it. It is now useless. But for those few minutes it was actually working, it worked great!    EDIT: Amazon sent me a replacement free of charge. This time it didn&#x27;t break within 5 min. The metal cover is very fragile. MAKE SURE YOU ARE VERY GENTLE AND DONT PUT ALOT OF PRESSURE ON THE SHAVER.</li>
            <li> Serviceable. Obviously not going to be as powerful as a larger device, but great for travel and small clean ups.</li>
            <li> Works great and immediately cleaned up several of my shirts and sweaters. I definitely would recommend this to another person.</li>
            <li> it does what it supposed to do. its not magic. it will only renew your stuff to a certain extent and its made out of cheap plastic like all the other under $10 tools you can buy. anyway. over all. im not complaining</li>
            <li> Being a guy I thought I would never purchase anything like this, but I&#x27;m very happy I did. I had many t-shirts and sweatshirts that got nasty pilling on them and they looked terrible. Most of the time I would just consider them as work shirts or rags, but this this removed the pilling very quickly and made the shirts look good again and made them comfortable to wear again. I even used it on my satin sheets and it worked great. I was quite surprised with this little battery powered item and am glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Really great product. Doesn&#x27;t cut clothing and get the job done. The razor is super nice it get the extra fabric on the clothes  out fast and everything looking pretty new. Must have if you want your clothes looking new again. For this price it is a steal.</li>
            <li> Good quality with good price!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get the fabric shaver because my couch was driving me crazy! However, within 5 minutes (5 minutes!!!) of normal usage, the \\&quot;metal\\&quot; grate on the cover snapped and broke and as a result, the shaver no longer works. I&#x27;m returning it immediately - and if I get a replacement and that lasts, I&#x27;ll amend my review.</li>
            <li> I saw the other good reviews for this product and I decided to try it out. I haven&#x27;t had it for very long, but so far it has really cleaned up my sweaters and they look as good as new!</li>
            <li> great product. I&#x27;ve done 2 whole sweat suits and havnt changed battery&#x27;s yet. Took off all pills, fuzz, etc..looks like new.greatestinvention since  sliced bread. On complaint is it&#x27;s size and  the lint trapis smallso you haveto empty it often, but that issue isn&#x27;t big enough to take off even 1 star because itdoes it&#x27;s job so well. Takes a while for large garments, but it gets it done. Mabe on thenext model, they will make it a little larger. GOOD JOB RMINGTON!</li>
            <li> Being military we had to shave our berets whenever we got a new one to prepare it before wearing. This cuts down the time drastically and does a perfect job. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems with the function of this fabric shaver, it removes lint well from wool sweaters. The problem is that one set of two AA batteries is only enough to shave the front OR back of one women&#x27;s medium sweater. I&#x27;ve stopped using it because I can&#x27;t justify buying four batteries every time I need to get the lint off just one sweater. I would only recommend it to someone who has rechargeable batteries at home otherwise it&#x27;s just too expensive to operate.</li>
            <li> I literally pulled three perfectly good but dreadfully pilled sweaters out of the trash in order to test this little guy. I now have at least one more season&#x27;s wear out of all three sweaters. Yay! To all you pilled-sweater fellas and gals out there: Please pay attention to the instructions not to apply any pressure while using the device, and let the motor and blades do the work. I did nick one sweater slightly (fortunately it was in an inconspicuous spot, and I was able to darn the hole). The $5.99 price is definitely right: It would have cost me close to $200.00 to replace the three sweaters with similar merchandise. The reasons I hold back from a 5-star rating are that the fuzz-collection compartment is liable to come loose while the shaver is in use; it&#x27;s sometimes necessary to use fine-tipped tweezers to extract fuzz from the blades; and there is a generally dinky feeling to the product. But even if the fabric shaver doesn&#x27;t last another week, I figure that at about two bucks a pop I have three sweaters back in play. Yay again!</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny. I recently bought a couple nice sweaters that were part polyester, and after a few washes starting pilling! This fabric shaver took care of those stupid pills in a matter of seconds. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I enjoy taking nice care of my clothes, so I tried this. It put holes in every test fabric/clothing of different weights, no matter how light a hand I used. Too cheap to return, so a complete waste of money/effort.</li>
            <li> This shaver gets the job done quite well. Better than any other I&#x27;ve had before. I would buy again. I gave one as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> This product did a great job removing the \\&quot;pill\\&quot; lint from my sweater. Great travel size. Would recommend for sure.</li>
            <li> By far the best 8 bucks I have spent!. Makes your cloths look new, like new!!. I have not tried on a lace or chiffon stuff. On most other things, this works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I bought this to get the white lint off of a load of dark socks. Somehow a hand towel managed to sneak into the load. The shaver worked great and all the white fuzz balls are gone and the load of socks usable again! What more could you ask of a 6 dollar product?   The battery compartment opened and closed easily, the diagram for the 2 AA batteries was readable and the lint compartment open and shut effectively. The shaver worked efficiently and did not damage the socks. The directions are clear, however the print is very small. All in all a great little gadget especially for the price, which is less than most fast food meals!</li>
            <li> I received this item a few days ago. It works great for removing pills on sweaters.  The one drawback is that the fuzz catcher doesn&#x27;t stay on well. I ended up putting a piece of Duct tape on it so it would stay on during the de-pilling process.  It makes it stay but it&#x27;s inconvenient to empty it.  Otherwise, this item is well worth the price.  I&#x27;ve already used it on my 2 favorite sweaters.  I thought that I was going to have to throw them away but now they look almost new so it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this would work since it was so cheap, but I thought I&#x27;d try. I&#x27;m glad I did!! This thing works wonders. It made my shirts with pills all over them look brand new! The only let downs are: it runs on batteries and if you&#x27;re using it on stretchy clothing, you have to be careful or it&#x27;ll cut a hole in your fabric. Other than that, it works well. After doing several garments, screw the head off and pull the blade part out. Fuzz will get stuck under there over time, hindering performance. This is definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail a few weeks ago and this was the worst 10 bucks I ever spent. When you press this item against clothing it stops working. I tried putting a fresh pair of batteries in several times and I kept getting the same result. Be smart people and don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> This little gadget does what I needed it to do, and that was to de-pill and de-fuzz two, long-styled sweaters that I own. They have been looking dreadful for ages, and I was agonizing over trying to de-pill them by hand. Instead, Amazon came to the rescue again with this inexpensive fix. Granted, something big and bulky like these long sweaters takes a considerable amount of time to completely go over, but it was either that or buy something new. And with the way things have been lately, I don&#x27;t have the funding (nor the closet space in our smaller dwelling). For less than $10, I now have a little tool to aid me in the war against unwanted fluff balls on my clothing, a tool that should hopefully last me a long time. I would tend to agree with other reviewers, however, that this item seems to be made for denser, heavier fabrics, like sweaters, gloves, and socks, for instance. I&#x27;m not sure that I would risk it on a lightweight blouse or pair of pants. Other than that, it does its intended purpose, and has made me one happy purchaser!</li>
            <li> Have been looking for something to save my favorite sweaters.  Found it on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!  Easy to use - does the job well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this by mistake because I had one I couldn&#x27;t find, then found it.  However, this one works much better than the original one I had.  Certainly worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great product, worked perfectly to remove little fuzz balls from the couch fabric. Surprising powerful for its size.</li>
            <li> I nearly threw out a great sweater jacket due to heavy pilling.  In a desperate move to save it, I purchased the Remington Fabric Shaver and was shocked to see how well it worked.  My sweater jacket is completely de-pilled and looks new again!</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver worked wonders on a fleece jacket I have. I also used it on a few of my sweaters that I was going to give away due to pilling and it made them look close to brand new! The only complaint is that it is small and gets filled up fast so you have to empty it out frequently. Other than that, I absolutely love it and am so glad I decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I love this thing! It is fast and easy to use. It saved my favorite cardigan that I was almost ready to throw out because it looked so horrible with all the pilling. I would highly recommend this item if you have knits you want to revive!</li>
            <li> Does the job. I will say that sometimes the fuzz gets stuck in the top chamber and I have to remove the collecting chamber to pick out the lint. Since it&#x27;s such a round \\&quot;bullet\\&quot; design, the collecting chamber has a tendency to pop off. Not a huge deal, certainly doesn&#x27;t affect performance - just slightly annoying in use.</li>
            <li> This product is a great buy. It helped to restore my wool coat that I&#x27;ve had for 8 or 9 years. Soon after I used it and wore my coat, I got several compliments and was asked where did I buy the coat. I told them it was 8 or 9 years old. They were very surprised. As others have mentioned, it is very powerful, don&#x27;t use on lighter fabrics. I didn&#x27;t try it on anything light, just for winter fabrics, but I could tell it would definitely do some damage on thinner material. I am very happy, it saved me from buying a new coat.</li>
            <li> Perfect Exactly - As I ordered</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money. It stops working every time it encounters a large pill, pulls fabric, and requires many passes to show any improvement. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> This little dude is actually a lot more handy than I was expecting. My boyfriend wears sweaters all winter &amp; they become the most heinous fuzzy beast-like things. As a last-ditch effort to save both the sweaters and my dignity while in public with him I ordered this shaver. It&#x27;s quite small, so if covering large areas it can take some time for sure. But it&#x27;s worth it. It does fill up with lint quite fast, at least on the sweaters I was &#x27;shaving.&#x27; It was unable to shave off some particularly mutant fuzzies, but for the most part did a great job. If you need a cheap, easy to use solution, this one does the trick.</li>
            <li> just use twice and then broken！</li>
            <li> Works very well and I&#x27;m glad that I purchased it. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the shaver damaging any fabric.</li>
            <li> I just \\&quot;de-pilled\\&quot; three sweaters. It&#x27;s small, powerful, and now the sweaters look almost new. Since the product is new, the blades are sharp and I only needed to pass over the sweaters once. Hopefully, the blades maintain their sharpness in the long run. Worth having as part of your acceessories to keep your clothes looking well maintained.</li>
            <li> Works great. Bought it as a gift and they love it. Uesed it on a sweeter and some other clothes with heavy lint from napkins and it chews right throught it.</li>
            <li> used it on some sweaters that were full of those ball thingies. if it starts getting stuck, be sure to replace the batteries, as theyre probably running low on juice. i wouldnt use this on thin fabric because obviously, there isnt much fabric to spare with those types of clothes. folks should keep in mind that that stuff you shave off is coming from and attached to the item youre shaving, so when it gets tugged on, it will pull a little fabric with it. not a problem if you know what to use it for.</li>
            <li> awesome!! works great.</li>
            <li> Works very well and now my sweaters look new again.</li>
            <li> My order Just arrived from the mail today. It actually works! Love it!</li>
            <li> After reading previous buyer reviews, I decided to purchase this fabric shaver. It works ok on certain fabrics but not all. I would like to warn other users that this unit can ruin the fabric and make holes, especially on the softer and thinner fabrics. I was upset that I created couple of holes on a shirt that has only been worn 5 times. Even though the metal cover seems to be for protection purpose, however, be very cautious when using it.</li>
            <li> it does do it&#x27;s job quite well. Don&#x27;t apply pressure when using it, it can catch the threads of the fabric itself. To empty it out, shake it front to back to get the lint in the compartment to clump up, then open and dump it out with no mess.</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected. Tried to use it on a sweater and it did not work at all.</li>
            <li> I tried this fabric shaver 3 times using light to no pressure... it ripped holes in all 3 shirts.  Amazon gave me a refund... but not for the 3 shirts that are ruined. Booooo, Remington.</li>
            <li> Works as described. Did make a hole in 2 pairs of cotton pants but blame myself for holding it in the same spot for too long.</li>
            <li> Really good at removing fabric pills. Won&#x27;t make your clothes look brand new but certainly helps it from looking raggedy!!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had a black skirt that was covered in tiny lint pills that I just could not get rid of. I had tried everything from re-washing to trying to cut each individual lint piece. Luckily I stumbled across this and I finally have my skirt back! It was somewhat heavy not too much where my hand was aching but a nice feel to it. Granted I&#x27;ve only used it once since I purchased it last week, but it did the job and my skirt looks so much better.</li>
            <li> OK FOR THE PRICE BUT NEED TO READJUST THE BLADES MANUALLY AFTER HEAVY USE CAUSE THEY GET STUCK ON THE SHAVER HEAD</li>
            <li> I love this thing! Its small and compact and easy to hold and maneuver. Dont let the size fool you, it has a lot of power and works really well. This should be a must in  every household!</li>
            <li> this thing doesn&#x27;t work! when I put it up to my sweaters to shave the lint, the thing stops.  on my delicate sweaters it snags the fabric just by touching it to the sweater.  I tried light pressure, moved it left to right, and as long as it does not TOUCH the sweater it&#x27;s fine.  As soon as you put it up to fabric it gets caught and stops.  Don&#x27;t waste your time on it.</li>
            <li> Item was as described and works great, but I noticed that if you order from some sellers, you&#x27;ll get another product. (It looks different from the picture that is on the product page.) I paid attention to this and ordered from a seller that was selling the same product as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the device. It works like a charm. The best thing about it is that it requires normal AA batteries (which you can find at any home). That&#x27;s the only reason I ordered online: every fabric shaver I&#x27;ve seen in stores requires some weird fancy batteries, and I hate to go out and buy special batteries just for a fabric shaver which I might use twice a year!</li>
            <li> It take a while to get the pills of sweaters with this. You have to pay attention to getting the pills through the little holes on the guard. This product works better on heavy knit and cable knit sweater. Fine knit sweaters, it doesn&#x27;t really work at all.</li>
            <li> this thing does not work</li>
            <li> i had the most stubborn fuzz on my fabric mattress cover. i tried scrubbing it off for collective hours before investing in one of these guys. thank god it works. at first i thought it didn&#x27;t, and i was very sad, but then i realized it was just the safety cap. be sure to take that off lmao</li>
            <li> This piece of small device is quite handy to remove fuss and threads in sweaters, woolen hand gloves and other fabric in a smooth and easy manner. Very convenient to use and makes sweaters and woolen products look like new.</li>
            <li> I had one of these (another brand) sweater fuzz ball shavers years ago and loved it.  I have new sweaters, which I&#x27;ve only worn a couple of times, that have developed fuzz balls and I wouldn&#x27;t wear them because of it.  So, after purchasing two (one for a back up), they work as well as I remember my old one working.  However, in these,the \\&quot;motor\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t seen to be as strong as my old one, but it still works well and I can wear my fuzz-ball-free sweaters again!  They are a tricky little device that works well.  Thanks, Amazon...I was surprised when I searched your site and found them as I&#x27;ve been hunting for a couple of years for a new one!</li>
            <li> I love it, it makes my clothes look new. But when you first use it you have to wipe the metal part with a dry paper towel until you see no more grey on the paper towel, it left a grey circle on a light pink shirt but it goes away. It did pull at two shirts because I did it over the seam and it was bumpy, it did make a whole but I don&#x27;t mind it&#x27;s an undershirt and its under the arm pit. The delivery was quick!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful, powerful, great price, it toke a while to get here but worth it .</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time so shipping was great. It works exactly as described on jackets, coats, pants, and shirts so that&#x27;s great. Haven&#x27;t tried it on any thinner materials yet but so far I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it overall and would recommend it. Certainly takes some of the age off some older garments!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase. I cannot stand when there are little balls all over my clothes, and this takes all of them away without ruining my pants and shirts!</li>
            <li> Very useful,I use it to shave heavy sweaters and wool hats.&lt;br /&gt; I wish it was just a bit bigger (especially the container) and easier to clean.</li>
            <li> Love this lint remover. Just wish it were bigger and a bit more powerful. But it certainly does the job and gets rid of all those little fuzzies on your clothes.</li>
            <li> This product really restored my older sweaters back to new again.  I wouldnt recommend anyone using it on delicate material but works like a charm on sweaters or any thicker material.</li>
            <li> Product works exactly as had hoped ... and for a great price! I highly recommend it! Sweaters and pants are like new again.</li>
            <li> I use this on all my beanies. They would look really bad but this makes them look brand new. Lint compartment is small but still gets the job done. I&#x27;ll be getting another one</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t press too hard or it will bite a tiny hole in your clothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product so far.  I had a sweater with LOTS of pilling and it looks almost new!</li>
            <li> This shaver is very convenient....it fits comfortably in your  hand  easy to move around....and does make a big difference in the look of your garments.Have not tried it on delicates so might be extra gentle on them.only one problem is that you have to empty it out often.....or the pillings get caught in the blades...all in all it does the job ....for the price u can&#x27;t beat it....small enough to store away in a drawer....even take it on vacation ....in your luggage.or keep it at work or car.....</li>
            <li> The best six bucks I ever spent. Could not be happier. Used it on a living room chair, looks like brand new again. Thanks.</li>
            <li> The screen broke when using it for only the second time and it does not work any longer. Very low quality product.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to defuzz a set of sheets.  The sheets were so bad that they felt like sand paper.  This shaver made short work of defussing them.  Now the sheets feel like new!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;[t work on the thing I wanted it to but other things fine</li>
            <li> It functions pretty well, but I really wanted it to shave the smaller pills that creep up on new really soft jersey knits. It was great for the cuffs on my chunkier sweaters, but when it came to my yoga pullover, it didn&#x27;t shave quite close enough to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Great shipping time! This saved my beautiful sweater that was never meant to be washed. It had fuzz balls all over and looked horrid. What a great little shaver this is! Surprising for the cheap price, it just zipped all those little fuzz balls right off! I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Much beloved sweaters that had long ago been banished to the wear-at-home-only category because of chronic pilling are like new! I don&#x27;t know if I can adequately express in words my love for this humming little wizard. Clothes that once looked ragged and embarrassing are beautiful again. I have resurrected cardigans, coats, ribbed knits, scarves, and even t-shirts that were headed for the trash. De-pilling is also strangely satisfying. Best eleven dollars (and 28 cents) I&#x27;ve ever spent. Batteries not included.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t push the item down to hard and keep the item moving (don&#x27;t let it stay on one spot for more than a few seconds), you should not be creating any holes in your fabric. Mine has worked great, my shirts look bran new! The only problem I have had is cleaning out the fuzz in the very top of the shaver, it doesn&#x27;t just come out when you shake it. The fuzz in the bottom part comes out easily however.</li>
            <li> Cannot believe how well this works on all material. I was skeptical about purchasing but now I&#x27;m wondering why I didn&#x27;t buy one years ago!</li>
            <li> Truly a must for us, I love the size and how well it works! Wonderful product!  I would order this again.</li>
            <li> Used it 7 or 8 times since I opened it. It works GREAT! Have two other&#x27;s and in fact had just used the older shavers on the same pants. Got this one, and ran it over the pants and oh, my gosh what a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I don&#x27;t know if it had to do with the other having dull blade or not. At this price I could buy four of these at the cost I paid for the old one&#x27;s I have. Even if this only goes through one winter its still worth getting one per year, no doubt.</li>
            <li> I had bought a sofa and it had many pills of fabric about 6 months after I purchased it.  When I used the Remington Fabric Shaver on the fabric pills, they fell off easily into the shaver and my sofa looked new, again.  This is a great tool for furniture and clothing.  Everything was fast.  I was very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I was initially impressed with this, but after shaving a couple sweaters and half of my winter coat, it just quit working.  I didn&#x27;t notice catching it on anything or anything like that, but when I took it apart, it appeared the shaft that the blades are connected to had somehow bent, so the blades couldn&#x27;t turn without hitting the mesh cover and stopping.  I didn&#x27;t see anything I could do to undo this problem.  I&#x27;m glad it was so cheap because I feel like I almost got my money&#x27;s worth out of it regardless, but I&#x27;ll be replacing it with something else.</li>
            <li> The Remington Fabric Shaver does exactley as advertised. Very easy to use and I would give it 5 stars except for the collection pod. It&#x27;s very small and the fabric gets packed pretty tightly around the cutting head meaning you have to stop and dig the fabric out away from the head.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job! I am so grateful that my boyfriend told me about this because his parents had one. I work at Macy&#x27;s and we have to wear black pants, I only have 5 pairs and 2 of them were covered in lint or whatever it is. I bought lint rollers, didn&#x27;t work. I did accidentally put a hole in one of my shirts though, (going a little o.c.d with the thing) lol. it is a thin shirt and I guess I went over this one spot too hard or too many times. lesson learned though. I am happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Actually my wife bought it for her dress and wool sweater that are old enough for need one like this. She said she likes it.</li>
            <li> Works as promised.  No problems.  Quickly removes small nubs from fleece.  Easy to use and small container holds a fair amount.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to buy this item as it turned my old sweaters into new ones but soon after a week or so wool got clogged in the blades after very small amount of wool,however,u can clean it.Later the superior blades broke while i was using it&amp;it never worked the same again,so it&#x27;s good to buy a spare part  in case this happens.Another draw back is the use of batteries,it would be a lot better if it were with an electric supply plus i don&#x27;t know what it does to the batteries,as soon as i put them i find them leaking oils out of them,i don&#x27;t know if it produces more heat than they can stand or what ,i tried this with many batteries,sometimes they leaked or the new ones just stopped.if u can get good batteries&amp;spare parts it will work well but take care..</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT 2 OF THESE. ONE I GAVE TO MY DAUGHTER AND I KEPT ONE.  THESE ARE REALLY HARD TO FIND IN THE MARKETPLACE THESE DAYS.  IT WORKS GREAT!</li>
            <li> like the look, handles well</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. This shaver works very well, but you have to clean it constantly (3 or 4 times per sweater) and it devours batteries. It also stops working completely after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> I like it and it works. I wish I found one that the shaver wasn&#x27;t held upside down. The lint falls into the chamber but stays in with the blades if you don&#x27;t knocm it back. But, overall, it does a good job.</li>
            <li> Very strong and compact</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh this thing is addictive and I can&#x27;t believe I have gone so long without it!  I&#x27;m a big fan of throwing everything in the washer and dryer regardless of the instructions on the tag.  Some items get those annoying little lint balls all over them.  This is the perfect tool for removing them and allowing me to abuse my clothing over and over again.  Makes my sweatshirts look brand new.  I would not advise using it on delicate items but it works miracles on heavier fabrics.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for one of these since I moved out of my parents. My mom had hers forever, never could find one in the store. Unfortunately this particular one has the container to empty it on one side and the other side of it holds the battery I believe. Anyways, the problem I have is that when I remove the container the other piece comes off as well because both are designed to slide down to detach. The angled design of this product means that both panels come off when you dont want them to.</li>
            <li> I got two and my 92 yr old neighbor and I both love it. Saves all types of clothes.</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver really works Great! Cheap and very easy to clean. I love my shaver, Ive restored alot of shirts that had lint all over. Will recommend.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this product!  It works well and looks very sleek.  I really like how the receptacle works and how it is see-through.  Definitely buy this product for your pilled-up clothing items!  You can&#x27;t beat this one for the price!</li>
            <li> So far so good, after a few months of use. Getting the lumps and bumps off of my expensive sweaters makes me feel this little device paid for itself after one use.</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver works great!  It&#x27;s such a satisfying feeling to de-pill my fleece sweaters and make them look like new again.  The shaver is easy to take apart to empty it or clean the fuzz out from around the blade.  I am totally happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Effective at removing lint. However, if you are aggresive it will make holes in your fabric. It will also wear through the thin metal covering if you press too hard.    It works, but be careful.</li>
            <li> Pretty good but hope the batteries can work for a long time.</li>
            <li> Old sweaters become new again with this handy product. For the cost of some of my sweaters I can&#x27;t believe I stopped wearing them due to a little pilling. Never again!</li>
            <li> This iten works prety well, very powerful for its size, but the battery cap keeps getting unattached while using it.</li>
            <li> yay! my favorite sweater looks brand new!!! i love it! best money spent! :D it didn&#x27;t take long at all. for best results, lay garment flat on a table, that way you don&#x27;t make a hole by accident. :D</li>
            <li> this motorized lint remover does the job exactly- restored a cotton shirt that looked shabby because of lint pills and made it look crisp again. Wonderful.</li>
            <li> This works great on wool, fleece, cotton and acrylic l sweaters.  I haven&#x27;t tried it on finer fabrics but I will be cautious based on the other reviewers who had bad experiences.  I even tidied up my socks, like someone else and though its silly, they look (and feel) much nicer now.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  $6 is very worth the new life you will give your clothes.  I had a pair of fleece gloves that fuzzed all over and was ready to toss them out, but I came across this product, and it did wonders!  The only thing I would say is not to press too hard on the fabric, as it might create a hole in your article of clothing (I made a little hole in my gloves that I had to re-stitch).  You will absolutely love the product.</li>
            <li> Never worked.....steups...wasted my $$$$.  Makes no sense to go through the hassle to return and then wait for a refund.</li>
            <li> Love the item, very comfy design but delivery seemed to take a long time though. it wasn&#x27;t late though</li>
            <li> This is great until it catches the fabric of your shirt and puts a hole in your clothing! This item has to be emptied out quite frequently and you need to make sure there is no material stuck in the shaving part of this item as it will catch onto the material and create a hole.</li>
            <li> I got a lot of my clothes to look brand new again especially my old fleeces.  I guess the few downsides would be that you have to continuously empty it since it fills up really quickly.  The link does sometimes get stuck near the blade.  Other then that, i love this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This item is crap.  You get what you pay for.  The battery compartment door is loose and keeps falling off.  The cover on the compartment that collects the lint is hard to fit and I can see in the near future it is going to break and this device will be rendered useless.  It does work and shaves lint off clothing, but in the future I would buy something better constructed.  It is made in China, need I say more.</li>
            <li> My mom, and her kind heart, bought me a huge bulky shaver that needed 2 D batteries thinking it would save time. I have arthritic hands and the that shaver is too heavy, is not a brand name and it doesn&#x27;t work. I bought this little shaver and it did exactly what I wanted it too. One issue I have is I have to stop and shake it because it seems to loose ability to cut not because its full. I don&#x27;t know why. The big one did too. This little shaver, although delicate, once all the seems are aligned it will not fall apart. Great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, it destroyed one of my shirts. Seven holes in two minutes. I had to throw the shirt away. Maybe it works fine on sweaters, but I&#x27;m not going to risk it. There is nothing on the packaging that warns you against using this shaver on thinner pilled fabrics like rayon.</li>
            <li> Machine has good power and really does get your clothes looking as good as new.  Does the job quite well for a small machine!</li>
            <li> This works great!  But ONLY as a sweater shaver.  When I attempted to use this device for some below-the-belt manscaping, the results were not promising. Long story short, I ended up in the emergency room where a nice doctor lady attempted to detach the (now ruined) shaver from my crotch while a half dozen nurses stood around laughing at me.  So, anyway... don&#x27;t use it for that.</li>
            <li> Perfect little handheld de-fuzzer.  I have a few shirts and sweaters that always need to be de-pilled after I was them and this works great.&lt;br /&gt;It has a small head, so it takes a little more time than some of the bigger more expensive models, but it&#x27;s perfect for a quick once over.</li>
            <li> I just received this and started using it right away. I have a pair of pants that had some awful pilling. Lint rollers weren&#x27;t doing the job and who has the time to pick these things off by hand? The Remington got everything off right away, with no issues! I&#x27;m pretty pleased, as these pants were the primary reason I bought this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully it will continue to be amazing!</li>
            <li> I used this on all my sweaters and it made them look almost new.  Was worried it would cut a hole in something but never did.  Then I used this on our couch.  I did the whole couch and it was tough cord type fabric and it did it. It would get stuck on a big one ever now and then but I would try again more slowly and it would get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels cheap.  I&#x27;m worried it will suddenly break.  But its not that exspensive to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; usually doesnt make it into the special compartment its supposed to.  It then plugs it up in the small area near the head and as a result it stops working evectivly and needs to be emptied very often.  If the fluff went in the compartment that it should you could do a few sweaters before needing to dump but as it is its only a couple of minuets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all a great buy for a great price.</li>
            <li> I agree with the poster about the poor quality. The shaver head is so thin, the blades tore it apart even before I got to use it. $6 is cheap, but I couldn&#x27;t see this working for more than a week at best!!</li>
            <li> I was so amazed with this little shaver.  I kept saying to myself &amp;#34;finally something does what it is suppose to do!&amp;#34;  My couch cushions had little &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; all over them.  I tried tape, picking, vacumming, and nothing worked. It was totally time consuming.  2 minutes with this shaver and the cushions look almost new. ( Also, remember to take the plastic guard off the top of the blade.  It works much better that way :) ) Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest: I wasn&#x27;t sure how effective a cheap little fabric shaver would be. I had a couple of sweaters with literally hundreds of pills. But sure enough, with this shaver and about 5-10 minutes on each sweater, they&#x27;re almost as good as new. You don&#x27;t have to press the device into your fabric; just glide along a flat surface and let its weight do the work.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about this. You sometimes have to go over the same spot twice, but it gets the job done so my clothes don&#x27;t look ratty or anything.</li>
            <li> Great for lulu products. The back that hold the batteries in comes off easily...</li>
            <li> I was replacing another one of these I had some time ago.  This one has about a 1 inch surface area on it.  It would take forever to do anything besides a sock.  Also the battery door and lint compartment are barley staying on.  I think I might have to wrap it in tape just to use it.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed to report that this is not a good quality product. Like a previous reviewer stated, I didn&#x27;t expect much from a 6 dollar pill shaver - however - I expected it to work more than 2 times! When I bought it, I used it and it seemed great. I stored it in a temperature controlled place and used it again almost 2 months later and it did not work! I thought it might have been the batteries so I replaced them with new ones: still didn&#x27;t work. I decided to try my expensive energizer lithium batteries in this thing and it still didn&#x27;t work correctly. It would intermittently turn on and then off again. Not reliable at all. Since it is 60 days, it is not eligible for returns through amazon. What a disappointment!!!!!</li>
            <li> After having this item for a little over a month, I came up with a conclusion for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Takes all the pills off of any fabric you could think of, and quickly too! You only have to go over it once, MAYBE twice to remove everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Battery doesn&#x27;t last that long. Additionally, put two holes in my burnout t-shirts because I wasn&#x27;t careful. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: Be VERY light (especially on thin fabrics!!!)  There is no need to press hard, it will still remove it. Use circular motions on area as well. I found that removing the pills from the compartment after doing a section (a sleeve, the back side of the shirt, the front side of the shirt) before you move onto a different section works well and keeps the machine functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite two holes being in my shirts, I would still recommend this product. You just have to be extremely careful when doing thin fabrics and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> The item was working for about 30 seconds and then it got broken, nothing else you can do. This stuff is surprisingly awful, don&#x27;t waste $5!!!  People PLEASE DON&#x27;T BELIEVE IN ALL THAT 5 STARS RATING, ITS NOT TRUE. THIS PRODUCT IS WASTE OF MONEY, EXTRA GARBAGE IN A HOUSE. GOT BROKEN IN 30 SECONDS OF USING IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> At first when sifting through the reviews I discovered a few that had me skeptical about ordering this product. About it not working when you attempt to turn it on after inserting batteries. About how it will put holes in your material. Well...none of that happened to me. :D It&#x27;s reliable and works like a charm. I love it! So handy.</li>
            <li> I know about this awesome small device thanks to my co worker. I was skeptical at first but it really works well. When I received it, I used it on one of my sweater which got fuzzy through all the washing. After I was done, my sweater looked new and clean. One thing to keel in mind that if you press the head down too hard, it might snag your sweater. My sweater got caught several times but it is thick enough to have no damage. If you have a thin and delicate sweater, be careful.</li>
            <li> This little gadget is amazing!  My husband and I had accumulated many, many clothing items that looked completely worn out after only a few wears.  The first item I tried the Fabric Shaver on was a very thin, loose-cut shirt.  Unfortunately, within the first 3 minutes of using the Shaver, I had put 2 holes in the fabric.  Once I got the hang of it, it was very easy to use but I strongly recommend practicing on an item that you won&#x27;t be upset if you chop a few holes in it.  I found that it was much easier to use on sweaters than on thin, loose fabrics.  It did leave all fabrics looking brand new in just a few short minutes.  I&#x27;m a little bit obsessed now with \\&quot;shaving\\&quot; all of our clothing!</li>
            <li> MAGIC! On some of the clothes with smaller pills it takes a while longer to remove them, but it still works. Took off a star because I accidentally pressed down a bit too hard on one of my thin cotton shirts and it created a small hole, so definitely be careful! Otherwise, it has totally saved my sweaters!</li>
            <li> This little guy does what it says! Its not made with heavy duty razor blades, so you do have to be gentle, and really...who wouldnt expect it to cut delicate fabric? I mean, isnt that why you are purchasing it? The fabric shaver shaves fabric.  I did let the collection bin get too full and got a small fuzzball stuck in the blades.  It stopped working for a second, but I promptly turned it off and fixed the problem.  No worries! All fixed and shaving away now.</li>
            <li> Did not solve the problem at all. I would not recommend this product. It does not deliver any result.</li>
            <li> The shaver is simple and easy to use, is light, and works well. But do be careful with finer fabrics. I have a thin cashmere sweater that it made a hole in, sadly. I did try it on an inconspicuous spot first, and it seemed fine, but it unfortunately made a hole right at the front of my sweater! Too bad. I also found that the shavings didn&#x27;t always make it into the container and instead needed to be emptied from around the shaver. But that&#x27;s pretty easy. You just unscrew the top and poke them out! Still better than having to vacuum or otherwise clean up all the shavings from a regular sweater stone. And note that you need your own AA batteries.</li>
            <li> This works so well!  I have de-fuzzed all my sweaters, my northface, even my winter hat! Easy and quick to use-love it!</li>
            <li> After some surfing on Amazon and reading some reviews, I bought this Remington fabric shaver. In summary, the Remington fabric shaver is inexpensive, does the job (but proceed with caution), and has a fairly sturdy build.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my experiences:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I really like how heavy it feels in my hand. It&#x27;s good to have a device that&#x27;s nice in the hand and wouldn&#x27;t slip out suddenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It looks great. The blue is a nice touch and the transparent fabric shavings holder helps to give me a good idea of when to toss out the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The transparent shavings holder has a section that collects all the shavings. Most of the time, the shavings do not fall out when opening to toss out. It&#x27;s a wonderful little detail that can help prevent many times when you&#x27;d have to bend down to clean up the mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The bigger holes in the steel shaving cover allows the lint, etc to collect better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- In terms of performance, my sweaters, socks, and lint on my clothes have virtually vanished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are more expensive, bigger and stronger fabric shavers, but this Remington fabric shaver is inexpensive and does the job. If well taken care of, this fabric shaver will last a while. If not and even over time, the fabric shaver will eventually be of no use. Still, given the price and performance, it&#x27;s a must buy for anyone that has lint and fabric problems. Buy with confidence!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Be careful how much pressure you apply to your clothing/fabric. Make sure the intended area is flat, so that no drapes get stuck in the blade. With any fabric shaver, there is a potential for holes and damage, especially if not handled carefully.</li>
            <li> It performs perfectly!!!!!</li>
            <li> This does a great job of shaving off those annoying pieces of fabric that stick out from clothes. It will make your old clothes look a bit newer.</li>
            <li> I have many jackets and coats that got fuzzy on the exterior and interior... those tiny little fabrics balls are very hard to pull them one by one off the coats (even after I pulled those fabric balls off, the coat didn&#x27;t look nice neither). Since then I seldom wore those jackets and coats again, but I love them so I didn&#x27;t throw them away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this Remington Fabric Shaver!! It saved many of my favorite coats and I can wear them again now cuz I can easily shave off those fabric balls! My coats look SO MUCH nicer without those fabric balls. Less embarrassing too when I wore them out since my coats look much nicer without the balls. It won&#x27;t make your old jacket/coats look like new, it would be a false hope! No other product will make your old clothes look new, but this little fabric shaver can make it look so much nicer. I highly recommend this product to someone or my friends if they have favorite coats that suffer from these fabric balls after wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Fabric Shaver is hand size and very easy to use. It has protective cover so you don&#x27;t need to worry about accidentally cutting fingers or hurt yourself. It requires two AA batteries to operate. Also it is very easy to empty the fabrics from the compartment that holds them, though the compartment is very small (make sense cuz the product is small) so I need to empty it twice when I shaved a knee-long coat. This little shaver probably works best for coats and jackets and not for very thin shirts though as other reviews said it may cut a hole in thin fabrics if you are not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love this fabric shaver, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It does what it should! Just brush lightly. Don&#x27;t press it against the fabric like it&#x27;s roll-on deodorant, and you won&#x27;t destroy your lighter knits. In other words, like you wouldn&#x27;t throw a wool sweater into the washing machine, you still need to use your common sense when using this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite wool jacket was beginning to wear down, and this thing gave it at least another few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sweater shaver is a simple little thing, lightweight, for a great price. And so intuitive! Well worth the longer use you can get out of your favorite clothes.</li>
            <li> this item is a very good item dont get me wrong.    but while using it the first time the cheaply made guard on the top broke and now the entire product is useless.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing! Works really well, just make sure you use it on a flat surface. The lid for the reservoir that collects the lint can be a little tricky to get back on after emptying but with a little practice it&#x27;s not a problem!</li>
            <li> This is a piece of junk. I tested it on a rag before I used it on my blanket and it tore right through the material.</li>
            <li> It works well, but breaks rather quickly. I&#x27;ve already been through two. I&#x27;m just going to use a [[ASIN:B000WUXOT2 Dritz Sweater Stone Clothing Care]] now. They are more tedious to use than this product but at least you can be sure it won&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> Works as long as you keep it clean and don&#x27;t overload it. Time consuming to do a whole sweater.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this is that the battery cover and lint catcher cover won&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li> I really am happy with this fabric shaver! It is noisier than one I&#x27;ve tried from another brand which is why I only gave it four stars, but it is efficient at removing lint and it&#x27;s easy to empty the reserve. Also I did notice that it is much less prone to accidental garment nicks than the other brand which is definitely a huge plus.  If it were a bit quieter, I would give it five stars. As is, I would say 4.5/5 and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a fabric shaver, either occasionally or for daily use.  UPDATE: This thing just quit working one day a few months ago. Pretty bummed out as I used it almost exclusively for a consignment sale and it only survived through one complete sale.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an old one and went with the reviews on here. Product is great, I&#x27;ve used on several different things / different materials and no problems.  Does the job and the price is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a lot of pilling on my fabrics over the last couple of months.  My favorite sweater felt almost like sandpaper it was so bad.  I was pretty desperate to get rid of the pilling and looked on Amazon.  Most others are non-battery powered combs and I thought that would be pretty nifty to keep around until I saw this one.  This shaver has an aggregate score of 4 1/2 stars while other combs had maximum 4.  I though, I may as well make the jump since it&#x27;s only $6.  I&#x27;m absolutely blown away.  My favorite sweater feels brand new!  It hasn&#x27;t felt like this in years.  It&#x27;s not too loud and works like a charm.  I highly recommend this to anyone with pilling on their clothes.    Batteries not included so be sure to have some around.</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with this little shaver, especially for the price. It works well and I will be using it to tidy up many of my sweaters after the wear-and-tear of this winter. For those who complain about the batteries, it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s something obscure. Finding two AA batteries isn&#x27;t that difficult.</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver works magic!  As you all know, when you get lint on black clothing, there is no way of hiding it.  This shaver does the trick like no others and the best thing is that it is so cheap. You honestly can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Works great as my sweater looks like new.  Lots cheaper than buying a new sweater!</li>
            <li> This shaver works brilliantly on my son&#x27;s pilly wool diaper covers, and natural fiber inserts. What were once pilly and rough, are now smooth and soft!  It is reasonably priced and works way better than a comb that I had bought before. So easy to use.     Now I&#x27;m searching for more clothes and fabrics to shave....</li>
            <li> Works just as expected (and maybe even a little better, considering the price).  As others may have mentioned, you can NOT use it on thin/sensitive materials because it WILL get a hole in it....I learned this the hard way :(  Great for slacks and thick material shirts</li>
            <li> Does a great job getting those pills off clothes.  Very affordable.  You dont need to press very hard to get it to work.  If you do press hard it actually seems to not work as well.</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver truly does remove pills. I haven&#x27;t had it remove part of fabric I&#x27;ve been working on, but it has managed to remove a small portion of the top layer of skin on a finger. It was my own fault for playing with it, but I haven&#x27;t experienced that with other models. It didn&#x27;t bleed, but did remove skin. The real problems with it are that it pulverizes what it removes and then you&#x27;re left with removing that from whatever your fabric has been resting on. And the container for collecting pills is difficult for the pills to enter. Besides that, the container is so small that you&#x27;re always thinking about emptying it. Unclogging the point between the shaver and the \\&quot;bin\\&quot; is also frustrating. And at times, it seems to loosen from the shaver, which is disappointing. But it sure does remove pills. So I graduated to a \\&quot;big one\\&quot; and that works really well, better than anything I&#x27;ve used. Expensive, but apparently the only way to get a shaver that actually functions well without important drawbacks.</li>
            <li> Takes the pills off fabrics fine. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this thing out, it ripped a tiny hole in my sweater. I don&#x27;t blame the device, it&#x27;s really powerful, and my sweater is REALLY thin, so I&#x27;m just surprised. I started using this on everything that had fuzz and I just would like to say I am VERY pleased with this product especially for its price. Note to people who describe having problems: DON&#x27;T PRESS HARD AGAINST THE FABRIC. You just graze the fabric gently and let the shaver do the work. It&#x27;s fragile, sensitive, but powerful. It&#x27;s also pretty lightweight and easy to use. Sooo convenient, I&#x27;m glad I found this!</li>
            <li> Everyones reviews are correct that are in favor of this product.  It works great and has restored a few sweaters and towels in my home.</li>
            <li> Had a similar one for 20 years that just broke. This one works very similar to that one hope it last as long. As far as shaving A+! works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Great product. Gets the job done. I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is a really neat and portable tool, but sometimes (especially on socks)it catches a semi-loose thread and creates an even bigger hole. Not too often, but still. Other than that its convenient.</li>
            <li> I got my Remington fabric shaver today and have kinda gone nuts with it.  I have done 6 sweaters, a jacket and even my couch!  I would highly recommend this!  I feel like I went shopping and got a bunch of new stuff!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this because most people loved it and some people hated it because it ruined clothing.  I didn&#x27;t want to take that chance but I&#x27;m glad I did!!!  I&#x27;ve used this on two cotton tees, two North Face hoodies and my North Face Denali jacket so far.  It does not make the article of clothing look new....used clothing is used clothing BUT it does get rid of the pesky lint balls and changes the appearance dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have all been there and pulled at something we shouldn&#x27;t have (usually light knits, woven linens) it just made it worse...DO NOT use this device for those types of clothing.  If you&#x27;re worried about clothing being ruined if you pull the knots/balls by hand, don&#x27;t use an electric device to do it for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device works just like men&#x27;s shaver: there are cycling blades inside that shave the material sticking up.  If the blades stop rotating, screw off the cover and use a pair of tweezers to clean out the inside.  The blades act as a fan and fans the lint balls into the collection chamber but if there is too much in the collection chamber or a long thread is tangled in the blades, they will stop rotating.  It doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s broken, just clean it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the few articles of clothing I&#x27;ve used this on, it&#x27;s already paid for itself.  I&#x27;m just disappointed that I didn&#x27;t buy this sooner!  Don&#x27;t let the negative reviews get you down....try it!</li>
            <li> In trying to be helpful my husband did laundry in which one of his favorite fleece coats endend up being washed with something that made it come out looking very fuzzy. I purchased this shaver based on the reviews of others and WOW it sure made it look like new again. Happy husband, happy checkbook, great purchase!</li>
            <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; it removes a little fuzz here and there, but I find myself working too hard for sub-par results...</li>
            <li> Works so well I use it on everything that gets fuzzy. Good price as well.</li>
            <li> The pills on my sweaters came off quite well with this shaver.</li>
            <li> The shaver works fine but the battery cover and the lint storage cover come loose with just a touch. You have to focus too much on trying to hold it without knocking the covers off.</li>
            <li> Having read all the reviews i was very excited to get a fabric shaver that is affordable and does the job! Sorry to say that i was bitterly disappointed. The shaver worked ok for the first two projects (both sweaters) - removed obviously visible pills and smoothed some (but not all) fuzz. I did have to work at it slowly and patiently and made sure to empty any fuzz build up in the shaver. Sweater #3 was where everything went wrong. In short, the shaver failed to produce any visible results whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Not really sure why, as i made certain to clean it out well before next project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since some of the bad reviews mentioned shaver rips delicate fabric, while others noted that it barely makes a dent in the fuzz (mine apparently is in the second category), I imagine that all units of this product vary in blade placement which lacks precision. As a result some get overly aggressive shave, some are lucky to get it just right, and others fail to see any results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my case, this product was rendered completely useless after only two jobs. Poor consistency. Poor product. Poor value.&lt;br /&gt;Only purchase if you feel lucky - to be the one who gets the unit that is manufactured just right.</li>
            <li> Works very well. I bought this because my north face jacket, gloves, and under armor hoodie  had all of those bumps on them.  this removed all of them very cleanly.  No problems at all. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> GOT FOR MY SON&#x27;S BIRTHDAY...HE LOVES IT AND SAID IT WORKS GREAT</li>
            <li> wanted to buy a lot of stuffs lately but due to amazon&#x27;s new \\&quot;Add-on items\\&quot; which sucks, you need to have $25 worth to buy this stuffs even you are PRIME member.  As you can get most of these items on eBay free shipping with the same price and you don&#x27;t need to me a \\&quot;PRIME\\&quot; member, this new policy sucks!!! If you can get this Free shipping with the new \\&quot;Add-on items\\&quot; without PRIME, why would you still subscribe on PRIME. Is this really what it is?</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase. It&#x27;s saved a lot of clothes from going in the donation bin! Unlike old fabric shavers, it only shaves off the little fuzz balls and doesn&#x27;t damage the actual fabric at all. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Great little product.  Haven&#x27;t used it yet - but I am sure it will do the trick on a few of my sweaters.  The sweaters have multiple pills on them and I hope this will work well.</li>
            <li> This product is okay, I had to returned because I found that it did not the job as I like it, so I order another one that was stronger.&lt;br /&gt;It was nice. Arrive on time</li>
            <li> Works great is is relatively quiet. Compared to the other fabric shavers I have used this is the best one yet. Not as loud as most and works pretty good. Fits nicely in my hand and was easy to use.</li>
            <li> Used it once for a light weight sweater. Shaver worked well ! Will bring it with me on my upcoming travel .</li>
            <li> Nifty little instrument.  Easy and effective.  Gave me a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; sweater on its first use!</li>
            <li> Does the job of getting rid of the fuzz</li>
            <li> This thing isn&#x27;t powerful at all - it works for about two seconds and then dies. I&#x27;ve replaced the batteries and it doesn&#x27;t make a difference - not powerful enough to use on anything! Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but the plastic is cheep and brittle.. the emptying container keeps slipping off while using it.. and the tap that holds it on broke within 5 mins of use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come back to re-write my review because although my first experience with this product was very disappointing, I have since been very satisfied. It was my own fault that I put a hole in a favorite sweater the first time I used this tool, because I didn&#x27;t read the directions or the reviews about using it GENTLY. I was nervous about trying it out again after that, but I have not had any more problems since I have been using it correctly. I&#x27;ve enjoyed bringin the \\&quot;new look\\&quot; back to some well-loved sweaters with this little tool which (when used with care!)effectively removes all pill and fuzz!</li>
            <li> Worked great for about 6 months until...the metal plate that rubs against the fabric started to get big holes in it and break and snagged fabics that could not be repaired.  So I am not ordering a completely different one, different brand, with a 5 star rating, fingers crossed on the next one.</li>
            <li> I like how it worked for me. It did take the pills off my old cardigan. The only drawback for me is that it is small and it takes quite a bit of time to get the job done but it does get it done.</li>
            <li> My favorite sweater defuzzer by far ! I highly recommend</li>
            <li> As described. Gets the little pills and fuzz with little effort. The only issue is the lint catcher and battery cover come off way too easily when you don&#x27;t want them to.</li>
            <li> This little machine tends to get clogged up with sweater fuzz rather quickly and doesn&#x27;t seem to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; the nubbins off very well. I&#x27;m now trying a sweater stone to remove the pills from my cashmere sweaters. I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Handy portable device for small jobs....especially good for travel.  Removes pilling and lint from clothing with ease.</li>
            <li> I have to sharpen the tiny blades with a sharpening steel any time i go to use it or it does nothing, but works well when I do so, it just takes a really really long time</li>
            <li> This product works pretty good for what it is designed to do.  The canister part that is on the shaver does crack pretty easily though, that is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Does its job. Breaks easily... Compartments &amp; batteries are always falling out, might ductape it (:</li>
            <li> . . . and save yourself some effort. Better yet, donate it to a good charity :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This worked GREAT the first two times we used it but with the THIRD use it started making an odd squealing noise and now it&#x27;s barely working.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to fiddle with it which is annoying, and I doubt I can repair it. If we can fix it, I will post an update but as for now - thumbs down on this item.&lt;br /&gt;God bless!</li>
            <li> Works great I&#x27;m glad i ordered this product worth saving all your old sweaters that need a little tlc with this great product.</li>
            <li> I love that this guy fits in my purse....because most often, I want to use it while out and about and I notice pills on my shirt or sweater. It gets the job done. I have cleaned up the underarm regions of my knits and cotton dresses and sweaters....as well as my running spandex where my legs rub together. Really rejuvenated my clothes. Love having this tool in my sewing kit. Batteries not included and the fuzz catcher is very convenient....like a pencil shaver with a shavings catch.</li>
            <li> Cute, Perfect size for traveling. Im going to switzerland for a year and my chef coats tend to get little fabric balls on the sides and it works so well to make them look professional again.</li>
            <li> One of my sport coats was looking a bit ragged, so I got this to trim up the fuzzy edges. It worked perfectly without damaging the fabric, and now my sport coat has a new life. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> We had one or two items of clothing that could benefit from \\&quot;bobble removal\\&quot;, but the reason we bought this was for the baby&#x27;s crib sheets. They had developed a mass of fuzz and bobbles thru washing. this little, cheapo, battery powered bobble remover made those crib sheets feel like new. I was stunned at how much lint was caught in the collector on the front. It&#x27;s easy to empty and the blades pop out easily enough for you to remove any lint that gets twisted around the spindle. Considering how much most people need a gadget like this, this cannot be beaten for price or ease of use. We are really pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I was excited to try this product to see what it could do. With the first use, this product put holes in my husband&#x27;s favorite shirt! I bought this to extend the life of our clothes, not ruin them. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Dont spend alot on those other models, this one does the trick! Ive used it on my slacks, shirts, and sweaters and it works like a charm! You will have a pilless wardrobe. I keep it by my washer and dryer and catch those pills when they come out of the dryer. All it needs is a light touch or you could rip your pants so be careful but this is the one that you need!</li>
            <li> A very simple product that I was looking for.</li>
            <li> So I purchased two different products in order to compare.    Straight out of the package with a fresh pair of batteries installed, the thing worked for one second.  I kid you not.  I thought the batteries were bad or not tight.  I readjusted them.  Once again, it worked for one second.     I can&#x27;t even test how well it would shave fuzz balls because it won&#x27;t work for more than one second.    In contrast, the [[ASIN:B000WUXOT2 Sweater Stone]] worked perfectly and is amazingly gentle.  It quite obviously did not harm the fibers but took off the pills.  You don&#x27;t need batteries and it won&#x27;t wear out.    This thing is going back even though it will cost me at least half as much as the refund I will get.  I am so tired of companies not having the minimal integrity it takes to produce something that doesn&#x27;t rip off the customer and the environment.    We need minus star options for reviews.  This would be a minus five star.</li>
            <li> Completely restored three $200+ sweaters to like new upon my first use!! I often get pills on my cardigans due to carrying a purse that has fabric that rubs - this is genius. Just put the sweater on top of my dresser and glided the fabric shaver along, not putting pressure on it as per the instructions. Works like a charm!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I paid less than ten bucks for this thing - I absolutely LOVE what it does!  What a great concept!  I took my black light and shone it on my sofa after all the lights were turned out, and wow - what a lot of little pills &amp; fuzzies that showed up glowing bright white under the ultra-violet light!  Then I took this Remington Fabric Shaver and shaved &#x27;em all right off!  Granted it took me about 10 minutes per cushion, and the blades did jam about every 1-2 minutes, so I had to unscrew the top of it and blow to get the fuzzies to get down into the clear part of the shaver.  But overall this is an amazing instrument, and I still can&#x27;t believe how reasonably it&#x27;s priced!  I&#x27;ve only had it a day, so I hope it does last as long as it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> This product does wonders in the way that it makes an old sweater look new. It can be time consuming depending on how much balls are on the sweater but it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> IT worked amazing, and I can wear my jacket now because it took all the little balls off it. The fabric shaver was exactly what i needed and was cheap!</li>
            <li> So so. Maybe I don&#x27;t have the hang of it</li>
            <li> Very pleased. It works, cleans the pills right up. Don&#x27;t know what the negative reviews are talking about: it says right in the directions to test it on an inconspicuous part of the garment, and to lay the garment flat and don&#x27;t press hard. Works like a charm -- de-pilled a nice expensive wool sweater with ease and for a very low cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going sweater crazy using this one every cashmere/wool sweater i have. All the piling on each sweater usually on the sleeves and collar are now smooth. Downside is I have to keep emptying it every few minutes since it works so great.</li>
            <li> Works great. Removes lint and fabric balls really well cleaned the neck around my hoodies. Makes them look new.</li>
            <li> If you want to get lint or hair off of your clothes I&#x27;d advice going with the old fashioned lint brush....this just takes too much time, you have to be careful what fabric you use it on, and it doesn&#x27;t remove that much!</li>
            <li> I am really happy to have this fabric shaver. It works well and does its job perfectly. I would recommend to buy this shaver for everyone who wants to prolong the life of their beloved clothes and enjoy using them for a longer period.</li>
            <li> I purchased this 2 months ago and it&#x27;s already broken.  The silver screen covering the blades just broke.  The suction wasn&#x27;t very good to begin with, so the fabric pills didn&#x27;t come off very well.  Now it&#x27;s useless without the protective screen.  Do not buy.  It&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I had an old Remington lint shaver that lasted for about 20 years and worked flawlessly until it finally died.  This replacement does shave lint.  But then the problems start.  Most of the lint does not fall into the reservoir, but gets trapped under the blades, so then I have to open the cover, remove the blades and manually clear out the lint.  Also, lint comes out the front, since it&#x27;s trapped.  I tried shaking the shaver every so often, to try to get the lint to fall into the reservoir, with limited success.  Do not be tempted by the \\&quot;ergonomic\\&quot; design.  Both the lint reservoir and the batter cover come out too easily as you are shaving.</li>
            <li> Worked great on son&#x27;s hoodie.</li>
            <li> This thing does NOT work well and leaves black greasy marks on fabrics.</li>
            <li> i only used it a few times, and this time it cut a hole in my cloth!! i will never get a fabric shaver from this brand again!!</li>
            <li> It did exactly what i expected it to do plus more. The price was also very good for its quality.</li>
            <li> Much easier to hold that ones we&#x27;ve had in the past.  Nice price too.  The only ones available at local retailers are about twice the price.  Happy with this one.</li>
            <li> This is the most awesome thing! I admit, I have now become completely obsessed with using this thing! My sweaters/sweatshirts look like new again! Even my worn out FAVORITE sweater has a refreshed look! Can&#x27;t beat the price either! BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item through Amazon Prime and got it the next day.  This fabric shaver saved a couple of my favorite sweaters that were in the giveaway pile...and it was kind of fun to watch this thing quickly transform them from aged looking, pill covered sweaters well past their prime back to almost new looking ones.  And if I now take them to the dry cleaners, they will look like new. Use a light touch and this thing works great. This is an excellent product and the price is even more excellent when compared to the cost of new sweaters.</li>
            <li> Powerful but the style makes it difficult to keep the battery door on in your hand. The lint trap and battery door do not stay on well.</li>
            <li> It put 2 holes in the first t-shirt I tried it with.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about how this product was going to turn out, due to some of the \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; being \\&quot;1 or 2 star\\&quot;. This is a great product, used it on several of my wife&#x27;s delicate sweaters...and it did awesome! It did NOT ruin any of her clothing, as some reviews stated. It is just like my mother&#x27;s de-fuzzer that I remember when I was a kid, buy it!</li>
            <li> Works really well for it&#x27;s size, though you have to be careful not to get fabric caught in it because it&#x27;ll make tiny pin holes in everything.</li>
            <li> this remington battery operated works very well even when the batteries are getting weak this fabric shaver still shaving i recommend this product it&#x27;s worth the money buy it........</li>
            <li> Worked very effectively and a nice proce</li>
            <li> This is just great . Had a top that was washed in other material such as new towels and it was covered with lint. I used the fabric shaver for first time on the top and it did one terrific job!  Very pleased with the shaver!!</li>
            <li> Durability may be on the short side but the product was inexpensive and works well.</li>
            <li> This thing makes everything I use it on look brand new. I have no idea why people are having issues with it eating holes in clothing. I have not had that problem at all. They must be pressing really hard. I make small round circles when using this on clothing and keep it moving (like an iron). No issues at all. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use! I have already made 2 pillows and 2 coats look brand new. I can&#x27;t imagine all of the things I could have salvaged rather than throw out if I had this tool sooner.</li>
            <li> This product works and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. Love it! I would definitely recommend this to other people.</li>
            <li> Works great and very effective fabric shaver. My sweaters, coats looks brand new now. I wish I had known about this product earlier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving this 3 stars because it stopped so many times due to the blades getting stuck every time a small piece of lint ball was too big to move underneath them and into the storage compartment.   Pros:   Lightweight even with 2 batteries  Does what it says  Extremely affordable   Easy to empty out and clean  Cons:  Small space for lint, fuzz, etc. to enter into storage compartment.  Fuzz catches underneath blades too often due to buildup of pieces that aren&#x27;t able to go into storage compartment.   If you have several big areas to run the fabric shaver through, you have to shave the area several times to remove almost all lint, fuzz, etc.  I used the fabric shaver the day I got it in the mail and on 4 badly fuzz covered sweaters caused by purse straps. Once I finished, you couldn&#x27;t tell there was any fuzz there in the first place.   So far so good.</li>
            <li> This worked fine, but the part that collected the lint kept sliding off.  It didn&#x27;t click on as it should,  so I had to send it back.  Will try another brand.</li>
            <li> Am relegating this to the trash bin. No matter how carefully I hold it, the blades catch on fabric and make holes.</li>
            <li> After a weeks worth of uses it broke on me, not the shaver itself but the cap. If pieces of the cap broke off it would end up messing with the rotation of the blades and get them stuck. I gave it 2 stars because you can&#x27;t buy replacement caps. Without the cap it&#x27;s completely useless. Not worth spending another 16 bucks just because the cap broke.</li>
            <li> Love it and apparently it&#x27;s fun to use because my daughter wants to do everything.</li>
            <li> Not worth it. Get yourself a pack of cheap bic razors at the dollar store for better performance and value. (at least the batteries worked)</li>
            <li> I removed a lot of pills from my couch of 15 years.  The couch&#x27;s cloth is sturdy so no problem with cutting through the fabric.  I emptied out the little container about 20 times.  Engine didn&#x27;t burn out.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, doesn&#x27;t seem to eat batteries badly at all, easy to empty and use again. Works well enough we bought another for a friend who liked ours.</li>
            <li> it is rude,not sophisticated, outside look like rude. but it is convenient to solve the problem.&lt;br /&gt;i agree it. my opinion</li>
            <li> Worked semi-well on tightly knit sweaters, but with sweaters that are loosely knit and have pilling and fuzz balls I would not recommend using the fabric shaver on. The shaver will easily catch the pilling and pull the knit fabric into the blade area and damage the knit to create holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I would say it works, but use at your own risk of damaging clothing.</li>
            <li> Bigger and better in getting rid of the pills that form on some clothes than the little ones  that seem to appear on store shelves just before Christmas. I have had mine almost a year. The more expensive, junky ones only last a short time. Works well. If you are looking for a durable fabric shaver, this is it!</li>
            <li> This works better than the other items I got for de-pilling my sweaters but the holes are a little small and so it takes a lot of back and forth motion to get the sweater pills off.  Also it leaves my sweaters a little fuzzier than Id like so it seems to set the sweater up for even more pills.  Overall it did what I wanted.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I almost decided to trash a sweater.. I just thought i&#x27;ll try this product on it once. It&#x27;s freaking awesome.. My sweater became brand new.   I have seen similar ones which are very expensive and I decided to give this a try as it was cheap (5.99$) with free shipping. I was definetly happy and will recommend it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item on a whim because of the great price and oevrall good reviews. I then panicked because i went through and actually read some of the reviews after i bought it, and a lot of them were really bad! However, i have been very satisfied with this product. It comes apart very easily for cleaning but stays together perfect for use. This little thing packs a lot of punch. As long as your not dumb and dont try and use it on expensive delicate fabric its great and youll be fine. I used it on a few sweat shirts i had that were so heavily pilled that i didnt even want to wear them out and they look brand new! To the point that my fiance looked at them and got mad he thought i went shopping! lol For the money, you really wont find a better product. No its not fancy, and yes takes all of about 25 min to do a large heavily pilled hoodie, but i actually found it kinda relaxing and mostly amusing! I have two jobs and go to school so if i can make this work for me anyone can.</li>
            <li> Works OK. Not as powerful as I was hoping. Clothes still had a lot of pilling once I was done using it.</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to use. I wish that the fuzz compartment was a little bigger cause while shaving a sweater I had to empty it about 5 times. It is quite fast and it was super easy to operate. I would recommend buying just be prepared to have to empty the fuzz compartment frequently. For smaller jobs I think it would be great. Also, works well on different fabrics. I tried it out on a heavy sweater and a lightweight poly/rayon shirt.</li>
            <li> I would have had to reupholster my new couch if it wasn&#x27;t for this little gadget!  I spent about 2 hrs running the shaver over my blue couch that was covered with white pill-like balls that refused to come loose with the vacuum, and now the couch looks new again.  For my purposes, I would like the shaver a little bigger and more powerful, but it does the job and is perfect for clothing.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money I spent on it, but it only does an OK job removing pills and fuzz from fabric.</li>
            <li> This product will blow your mind.  Never even knew a product like this existed until about a year ago...&amp;#34;where have you been all my life!&amp;#34; Works great on almost any fabric I have tried it on - cashmere, polyester, wool, etc.  A must have for every household...makes your pilling clothes look brand new again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a miracle tool to have in life!</li>
            <li> It works ok.  I used to have a hand shaver that worked better. Even though you have to go over some areas several times, this is pretty easy to use and it will eventually work.</li>
            <li> As my daughters calls it, this &amp;#34;defuzzerator&amp;#34; really works! It&#x27;s a little bit of a slow process but all the pills were removed with this little handy tool. Def worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super powerful.  You really have to go over spots several times to get all the fuzzies off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so amazed at how well this product works I can&#x27;t stop using it.  After I &#x27;shaved&#x27; all of my clothes I went over to my brother&#x27;s house to raid his closet for old sweaters and shirts.</li>
            <li> This worked okay for a fuzzy cardigan, but broke after a few uses. I used it mainly for the pilling on my couch due to my cats&#x27; secretive clawing. It would catch most of the snags, but eventually the blades would get clogged up. The reservoir doesn&#x27;t really work as intended and the cover constantly slides off no matter how I hold the device. Finally, the blade caught on the foil guard and broke through. Now the thing is useless. I&#x27;ve tried searching for replacement foil guards, but no dice. This thing is cheap and flimsy. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> i *love* this thing.  it&#x27;s easy to use, and all my sweaters that were looking vaguely old now look new again.  ditto for socks.</li>
            <li> This thing is Awesome.  Who knew a grown man could have so much fun shaving off the lint balls off of sweaters.  It works really however if you have a lot of lint on your sweater you will need to clean it out frequently.  One down fall is that the lint lint collecting bin thing does come off pretty easy while using it so keep that in mind.  How ever the price is really worth it.</li>
            <li> This has really been great. It made my old sweaters look like new!</li>
            <li> this was a piece of junk would not waste my money buying this lasted less than  a month then went to the trash</li>
            <li> This is a very small shaver but has great strength. It&#x27;s definitely a great buy for the price, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really think these sweater shavers work, but they do! I used this on my cashmere blend sweater which is balling terribly - and it cleaned it up so nicely. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great tool for removing &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; on sweaters and other knit and/or wool clothing.  Easy-to-see receptical tells you when to empty the fuzz.</li>
            <li> I bought this to see if it could really remove pills like everyone was saying. This thing is amazing! It gets rid of almost all of the pills off my clothing. I tried it more delicate clothing, and it worked fine. I think it&#x27;s about how much pressure you put. I used it on cashmere and rayon, and the clothing didn&#x27;t rip or anything. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase. My only complain is that it doesn&#x27;t remove all of your pills; don&#x27;t expect to get all those tiny little pills off. It gets rid of most of the visible pills. BUT, still, it&#x27;s a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I use this fabric shaver on my couches that tend to pill after a bit of wear. This shaver does a very nice job in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver saved my couch. After a few years of use, my couch cushions had little fuzz balls covering the fabric. I had tried several methods of removing them with no success. I tried the shaver the moment I received it and it completely removed all the little fuzz balls with ease, leaving the cushions looking brand new. Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Very impressed at how well this little device removed pills from several of my wool sweaters.  I had a lot of pills so it did require multiple cleaning of the device as it got full, but that&#x27;s just fine.  Easy to clean.  My sweaters look new.  No damage to the sweaters themselves.  It&#x27;s not the fastest process, but it is not terrible slow either (and again - I had a lot of pills).  Take your time, be methodical, and this device will do the trick.</li>
            <li> I had some doubts after purchasing it, but when I actually used it on my coat, it really cleaned it all up and shaved all that crap fabric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you !!</li>
            <li> This product was okay to remove some of the fabric fuzzes...it just is not as good as a manual fabric comb.  But it does do what was advertised...just is limited.</li>
            <li> Great little item.... really powerful and will get all those pesky little bits of fabric off in seconds (especially from fleece and sweaters).</li>
            <li> This is so wonderful, I just got it and I used it on my tights and sweaters and it worked perfectly. They look brand new! Highly recommend it. Worth the six bucks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve had access to one of these guys. My stepmother had one when I was a kid, and I always thought it was a lot of fun to shave my clothes... or the sheets... or even pillows. And, all I remember thinking was that I wanted one when I grew up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, now I&#x27;m all \\&quot;grown up\\&quot;.. and I finally have my own fabric shaver. This little guy is fantastic. It&#x27;s actually better than the one I used as a kid. It shaves a lot faster, and closer, than the old one did. But, the main thing I love about it is that it&#x27;s so easy to clean. Just pop off the back, and empty it. (It&#x27;s like one of those bagless vacuums.) Another thing that makes this shaver easy to clean is that the cap screws off. So, if you notice that there&#x27;s a ball of fuzz stuck by the little blades, you can pop off the cap and pull it out. (Just, be careful of the blades. They&#x27;re sharp little buggers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to get rid of those annoying little pills that like to appear on sweaters, jeans, sheets... or anything else you might need it for. Happy fabric shaving!</li>
            <li> Excellent tool that is irreplaceable! Helps all your clothes that you haven&#x27;t worn in a while and helps them look like new!</li>
            <li> Does a great job.  Works on the couch, sweatshirts, letter mans jacket, blankets and everything else we have tried it on.</li>
            <li> I bought mine sold by Amazon.com and was thinking if something went wrong I can just send it back and get my refund because Amazon&#x27;s customer service just outstanding.  Against my worry, this little thing works just fine.  At my first use, it slowed down after few minutes and my first though was:the batteries are new, is it broken already? (it&#x27;s made in China) Then I found out that there were some fuzz that it gethered stuck under the blades and made it harder to turn.  I unscrewed the blue cap, carefuly cleaned it up.  Back to work again.  I have been using it for shaving several sweaters and this trouble never happened again.  I paid $5.99 for mine, didn&#x27;t get the best deal($4.99) but I am still pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on a number of fabric shavers and was most impressed with the reviews this one got. Others who purchased this item got it right. This little guy sure does a great job. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this fabric shaver for my wife and she loves it!  It is easy to use and easy to clean and very affordable. My wife is happy so I am happy!</li>
            <li> Only used it once so far, but worked great.</li>
            <li> Like this fabric shaver, but the battery cover keeps falling off.</li>
            <li> Works great. Just wish the cover for batteries and the catch for the lint didn&#x27;t slide off so easy when using this.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the Collins brand fabric shaver.  I bought this product, the Collins fabric shaver and a &amp;#34;sweater brick&amp;#34;.  Although I felt the sweater brick worked well to at picking off the pillings on fleece and wool, it was bulky and couldn&#x27;t get into tighter areas like the Collins shaver did.</li>
            <li> A good thing to have to keep clothes looking fresh and new.</li>
            <li> Looks cheap, works well.</li>
            <li> I had never even heard of this devise and researched the comments and then really just took a chance. The Remington Fabric Shaver came to me through Amazon in 2 days and I tried it immediately on 3 sweaters. It did an amazing job with NO pulls and I pressed very hard because some of these were older sweaters with many &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34;. I am very pleased with how it works and hope to get many years of use out of it. You do need to empty the tray before it fills.</li>
            <li> I have many \\&quot;DeFuzzers\\&quot; and this is the absolute best so far.  It works so good you don&#x27;t run out of batteries trying to do one sweater.  I recommend this to all - Especially those frustrated like I was!!</li>
            <li> Awesome price and works exactly as described. I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for an electric lint shaver.</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver shaves well, although sometimes snags the clothes if not done carefully. Unfortunately it gets full in the top section too quick and stops working so it requires cleaning before the (clear) body of the shaver even has anything. Wish it was able to filter the lint/shaved pieces down a bit better to last a bit longer before emptying/cleaning would be necessary.</li>
            <li> Got it for Christmas so I could &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; my best sweater. My brother warned me this would take for ever. It was actually quick and very easy to use. Maybe it&#x27;s the type of sweater, but mine now looks great. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to have to buy a new duvet cover until this fabric shaver was able to remove all the big lint ball tufts and return my duvet to it&#x27;s old satiny smooth condition.</li>
            <li> Bought this to remove the pell from some of my toddler sons outfits.  It worked perfectly and didn&#x27;t ruin or snag any of the fabric.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with my first one 6mths ago.. works great, very durable... Bought another for myself and one for my mom since then. If it doesnt seem to be picking up lint as it should, you probably just need a fresh pair of batteries :)  Minus 1star only because the battery cover and/or the lint holder seems to slide off during use.. not always but pretty annoying when it does happen :/</li>
            <li> My mom bought me the common brand of sweater shaver you can find at your local drugstore or Target-it lasted a whole 30 min before biting the dust.  I always do research when I buy something online, even if it&#x27;s inexpensive.  This seemed to fit the bill.  It&#x27;s true that the tiny inexpensive motor like the one in this model has limitations, and it&#x27;s wise to only use it for say, 20 min at a time.  That&#x27;s just common sense.  I read you should also keep emptying the lint as you go, I think that&#x27;s a good idea to help it last longer.  I bought 3, one to replace the one that croaked, and 2 for friends who asked \\&quot;help me maintain my sweaters, yours always look good year after year\\&quot;  So far, all three of us have no complaints.  I have read some reviews that warn that the shaver will \\&quot;suck\\&quot; loose fibers into it, and tear a hole in some sweaters.  Again, that&#x27;s just common sense.  Of course you should be extra careful in areas with loose fibers.  maybe you should darn/sew those areas back together before trying to shave the surface.  I have already done approx. 4 sweaters, 1 scarf, 2 gloves, and 1 wool coat this month.  Everything looks like new, like when I saw it on the hanger in the shop.  I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I accidentally threw my black sweater in the wash with my baby&#x27;s fuzzy blanket and it got white fuzz all over it.  I loved this sweater and was so disappointed.  This shaver saved my sweater!!</li>
            <li> my wife needed this so i got it for her.  it does get rid of the random fabric stubble, but be careful...this thing is quite powerful and if you press too hard it will put a hole in your sweater</li>
            <li> This product worked exactly as advertised and was worth every penny.  I bought it to remove pills on a Nike DriFit jacket.  I was a little nervous about how the shaver would work on synthetic fabric, but my jacket looks good as new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t tend to write reviews, but I felt like I owed one since good reviews guided me to this purchase.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. Exactly how you would imagine this to work. Very happy with my purchase. I would recommend this to anyone that has old clothes that you want to make look brand new!</li>
            <li> Great price and works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little tool. The price is reasonable, very handy for shaving cotton balls, exactly what I had been looking for.</li>
            <li> Like this product, very handy and delivers the job quickly and safely.</li>
            <li> this was ok&lt;br /&gt;far the size</li>
            <li> Did the job! I used this on a re-upholstered ottoman which I was about to ditch. My mistake for not ordering a heavy duty fabric. This product worked great for me!</li>
            <li> Love it. We had some old shavers that were a hassle, they were easily over 10 years old. This Remington was inexpensive and I decided to try it. It&#x27;s amazing compared to the old shavers. Quieter, faster and more complete. What used to take me an hour for a pair of pants, now takes about 10 mins. I don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same spot as often. Great little shaver.</li>
            <li> Keep your delicate fine weave sweaters flat.  It will eat it.  Otherwise, totally does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I have so many clothes that has lint on them which makes them look worn out...especially sweater material.  This shaver worked great on removing the lint and making my sweaters look like new.  What is even better is the price I paid!</li>
            <li> Does not work so well on the large fuzz balls on hand knitted items that are done with large yarn.  Does a great job on the small fuzzies, though!</li>
            <li> Worked great on my cotton and jersey sheets and pillow cases! Like magic!</li>
            <li> Works really well! Little doors for the batteries and where the shavings go fall off very easily while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> It works great  when i first got it  seem so small. Made my son  hoodie  brand new  it works great the only problem is that if you gonna use it on something large  it will take some time. overall its a good product that work.</li>
            <li> I use this on my sweat pants and sweat shirts to get rid of pills. It does a good fast job. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Seems to work great! Just wish it had a cord since it goes through batteries quickly. Very handy though I would highly recommend it! I used it on some of my sons clothes &amp; they almost feel like new again!  He actually wears them now!</li>
            <li> I actually placed an order for a larger one that is not battery operated, but use this one much more often.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Remington Battery Operated Fabric Shaver  Works perfectly! ( We do we need to add more words on Amazon? It works fine and there is no science to it).</li>
            <li> When I got the product it was a downer to see what cheap \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; plastic it was made of.  Very cheaply made!  I was bracing myself for disappointment, wondering if the thing would even work.  I was pleasantly surprised!  I needed to shave pills off a chair and it did it perfectly! I don&#x27;t expect it to last forever because the plastic is so inferior but the product does the job and does it well!</li>
            <li> My sister told me about this fabric shaver and it became my best friend. It makes aging clothes look brand new. Super easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite new household gadget. Dirt cheap, works like a charm, keeps clothes and furniture looking brand new!</li>
            <li> This Remington Battery Operated Fabric Shaver really works well especially on cashmere.  All the pilling is removed and the unit is easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> Used it from the first day I got it and it worked great - until the grill broke recently. Trying to find a replacement grill but I guess at $5-$6 each, they&#x27;re just made to throw away &amp; be replaced by another one. I hate to do that because the grill is the only thing wrong with it &amp; with the grill this flimsy I could be spending $6 every month or so!     I&#x27;d bought an Oreck because it had a bigger head than this Remington &amp; I had some projects that were tedious but the Oreck turned out to be useless &amp; a waste of time &amp; money because it just didn&#x27;t pick up any of the pills (on any fabric) like it should &amp; I did return it &amp; got my full refund. I had to go back over the fabrics with the Remington anyway &amp; got the result I wanted.     This Remington does pick up pills, gets a very smooth shave, &amp; makes items look new. However, the user should be careful to pay attention. I put some holes in my clothing, usually because I wasn&#x27;t paying attention. Sometimes, even when I was paying attention, I got holes. All things considered, that&#x27;s a risk I&#x27;m willing to take. The collection thing doesn&#x27;t hold as tight as it did when I first got it, but it does decently enough.</li>
            <li> This shaver works great on regular to heavyweight material, but is way TOO POWERFUL on lightweight stuff.  It sucked my summer knit tunic in and created a hole before I could react.  Thinking this was a fluke (or I was an idiot) and being more cautious, I wrapped my next lightweight shirt snugly around my ironing board and carefully started near the hem.  Within seconds it too was sucked in and another hole was left behind.      I&#x27;ve used these types of shavers for years, so I&#x27;m not a newbie to how they work.  This one is just a lot more powerful, and the face holes are a bunch bigger, when I compared it with my older shavers.    Since the face unscrews to allow for better clean-out, it would be great if Remington offered a smaller-holed replaceable face for lightweight material.</li>
            <li> Does the job much better than expected</li>
            <li> small fabric shaver does an awesome job on big wool pillows to get the fabric balls off of them.  just wish i knew it was small when i ordered it - i&#x27;d of liked a bit bigger size.  batteries last a long time - and this little shave does a good job despite its small size!</li>
            <li> Great fabric shaver.  I do wish the head was a little bigger though.</li>
            <li> I got this item sealed in a box but didn&#x27;t work, I shipped it to a friend in the US to bring it to me in Egypt and I can&#x27;t even return it , really very disappointed</li>
            <li> I liked the way it worked to remove the pills; however, the battery compartment lid and the lint collector kept falling off while I was using it.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> So far so good...the metal plate seems sturdy which is important because I&#x27;ve broken them in the past pushing too hard, but seems durable...only complaint it seems to suck through the battery pretty fast...does its job though..</li>
            <li> We use this on fabric with dust bunnies and it shaves it well. My husband also uses it for his Army berret. It works great.</li>
            <li> Practice makes perfect. Several users complained about damaging fabric. It takes a light touch to use any shaver properly. I&#x27;ve had others; this one is really good. I either use with item on or pulled over my thigh to have fabric smooth, nearly taught, then shave with circular motion, checking blades occaionally for any lint to be removed. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It only got clogged up once, works as advertised. The only snag I ran into is that with one of my thinner sweaters, when removing pilling it actually caused a few holes in the material. That was disappointing.</li>
            <li> This Fabric shaver works amazing. I purchased this unit actually to remove pills from my vehicle&#x27;s suede inserts on the seats. My seat were starting to show wear after years of use and this unit was able to remove all the unsightly pills and bring the suede leather insert looking new again. I was super impressed with it. It didn&#x27;t damage the material at all and worked quickly. Plus it was easy to use and uses regular batteries. I highly recommend this unit if you have a fabric or material that has unsightly pills and want it to look new again.</li>
            <li> Very small and not great at picking up the fuzzies from clothes, blankets, towels.  My last fabric shaver was a LOT better but broke after several years and is no longer available.</li>
            <li> Works very well on a variety of fabrics.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few years ago and it worked pretty great until it suddenly stopped working for no apparent reason. I figured I got a nice long life out of it before it needed replacing, so I went ahead and got another. It won&#x27;t last forever, but try to take good care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be careful with clothing. Make sure everything is flat, or else you might accidentally hit a crease and cut a hole in your fabric. It&#x27;s not common if you&#x27;re careful, but use it properly! I find that for pants, it&#x27;s best to use it WHILE you&#x27;re wearing the garment.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do. It&#x27;s slow but all these things are slow because they are so small. This one is actually slightly bigger than the others I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> Removed pilling from my sweater, socks, and bedsheets in a snap. I love this thing. Simple to use and clean out. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Would not turn on. Broken. No instructions either. Had to go to bed bath and beyond to get a new one</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to many people.  I use it all the time for my fleece legging or blankets.  Makes them look like new again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like an electric razor for your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;It basically transforms your sweaters from Duck Dynasty to Don Draper, if you smell what I&#x27;m cookin&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, so you can stop looking homeless, you dope.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it seemed to work great but a piece of the head broke off on the 3rd use and it does not work at all.  I put in new batteries and still doesn&#x27;t work.  I went to return it but it is past the return date.  I would appreciate it if the Seller would replace or return it.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work as good as I expected it to</li>
            <li> This is a very handy item. Before buying it I was ready to get rid of some clothes but after using this fabric shaver it&#x27;s like a new life was brought to those pieces.  It is very comfortable on my hand and does a great job at removing pills, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I though that not having this be a plug in device was a downside but once I received it and began using it I came to find that a wire that plugged into the wall would have gotten in the way-- much like the wire from an iron.  This 5 stars is an appropriate rating.</li>
            <li> This a great purchase. It&#x27;s inexpensive and does what it says.</li>
            <li> While I wouldn&#x27;t say this sweater shaver was amazing, it&#x27;s decent.  Does it work?  Yes.  I&#x27;d say my sweaters are 70% better looking than they were before use.  But will this make your sweaters look brand new?  Not in my case.</li>
            <li> Had those fuzzies on some pants/bed spread, used this on it and the little things came right off.  So easy to use and works great.  The blades havet a nice cover to protect it, it&#x27;s small enough you could travel with it.  Works just like it should.</li>
            <li> I have several very heavy, nice smart wool sweaters that I wore all last winter and they ended up looking awful by the end of the season. So full of pills! This is the first sweater shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, and so far it has done a perfect job. My sweaters look great.</li>
            <li> This thing really works. I had some fuzzy pajamas in the wash with my sweat pants, and the pants were covered with fuzz balls. Very quickly removed them all with this shaver. Easy to use, and easy to empty.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00475A4KK Sunbeam S15 Lint Shaver, Medium]]Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  I used it one time, the blades stopped working because of the lint building up in the casing.  I cleaned the blades and the casing and it never worked again.</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver is the only one I&#x27;ve ever used, but I was very impressed with how well it trimmed my cashmere sweaters that had started to pill.    The blades are covered with a metal mesh cover so there is no way the shaver can go overboard and create a hole.  The shaver runs on AA batteries and the shaved pilling ends up in the clear blue compartment.  The compartment is very easy to detach and empty.  The blade and blade cover detach for cleaning as well.  This product exceeded my expectations in a fabric shaver for this price range.</li>
            <li> What a piece of junk.. It won&#x27;t remove much of the fuzz, believe me.&lt;br /&gt;Buy the regular squarish one, it work the best of them all.</li>
            <li> I should preface this by saying that I just got this today, so I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s longevity, but it&#x27;s already paid for itself on all the things I&#x27;ve used it on, so for $11.99 I wouldn&#x27;t care if it breaks tomorrow! I used it on my son&#x27;s Mickey blanket (the kind with the plush Mickey Mouse and satin back) and after two years and countless washes, it looks like new! I&#x27;m so happy because they no longer make that style with the satin backing, so it&#x27;s pretty much irreplaceable.</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly, and I am happy with the result. I should have bought this earlier. Now I can wear many of my sweaters that I kept in the closet for the longest time.</li>
            <li> This thing saved our Crate &amp; Barrel couch.  After years of kids and dogs, it was looking pretty dingy and \\&quot;hairy\\&quot;.  So before deciding to just sell it and buy a new couch, we tried this thing.  The couch now looks almost new and has at least 10 more years ahead!</li>
            <li> I opened this up and spent an hour going to town on everything I own from, sheets, to leggings, to the sweatpants on my body. Everything is now brand new.</li>
            <li> Gets the pills off furniture just fine but the little holder fills up really fast and needs to be emptied when it&#x27;s about 3/4 full.  We discovered after the first use that we have to take the head off and brush all down into the little needles after each use or they get stopped up and it just isn&#x27;t going to work then.  With a puppy our couch takes a lot of beating so this is a real help with keeping those darn little pills off.</li>
            <li> Genious! Works just like a man&#x27;s electric razor. Did swiping motions, didnt leave on same spot and didnt press hard. No holes. Works perfect! I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> Replacement for my super old Remington fabric shaver that died not long ago, may it rest in peace.  Same exact operation with a sleek new body. Yee-haw</li>
            <li> be careful not to press on the clothes, it will tear them and make holes on them!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this little shaver--it&#x27;s given my old sweaters a new life. I loved it so much that I bought it for all my sisters-in-law and they love it too.</li>
            <li> Use it to take the fuzz off the unholstered living room furniture and it does a good job without making holes or tears.</li>
            <li> I like to read the bad reviews to see what people don&#x27;t like about products. I couldn&#x27;t see anything wrong with this I think it worked just great. Some people said you have to be real careful or it might cut a hole in what your defuzzing I used it on a few things when I got it and I wasn&#x27;t being careful and I don&#x27;t see how you could.</li>
            <li> Gets those fabric bits like a champ.</li>
            <li> Good to use, I shaved all my sweaters! Though the plastics parts feel cheap, but the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> I  have shirts that are perfectly fine except for the pills,  Now they can be removed and still wearable.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but this saved my sheets. Amazing!! Great price, does amazing job! Well worth it!!</li>
            <li> I am not sure what others were doing with this, but I could not get it to remove pills from sweaters. Pretty useless.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I needed to remove pilling from sweaters!  It also picks up lint and some hairs at the same time as an extra bonus to the fine job it does on sweaters. I love it and it&#x27;s well worth it at a small price.</li>
            <li> Wondering why I didn&#x27;t have this device earlier... does a good job of shaving of unsightly lint and fuzz balls..  Uses two AAA batteries which comes with it, though I wish they had been AA batteries instead.  Good stuff though..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really wanting to buy this product, but when I reach the checkout page, it displays a photo for the RTFS-100.  Can someone please tell me what product it is that you receive when placing an order for this item from this page?  I like the look of the RTFS-2 more than the RTFS-100, and I believe it&#x27;ll be more efficient for use in my car as it doesn&#x27;t have a handle that will make tight spots hard to reach.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This little gem has worked very well. And it just keep going as long&lt;br /&gt;as you clean off the heads; after each job.&lt;br /&gt;If so, it won&#x27;t overload and burnout. Nice gadget to remove those little&lt;br /&gt;lint balls that form on some shirts and paints.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good machine and easy to use it now continuously.. Thank you for this wonderful product. good good x-d</li>
            <li> Not what i expected. Thought it would take the fuzz off, but everytime i used it the blades would stop. Not a good product the bigger one is better.</li>
            <li> This works well but is very small. That means that you are going to be able to get rid of the fuzz that forms on a new sweater, but you will still be picking any big, unsightly pills off with your fingers. Still, the device  took about 3 cubic inches of fuzz, including many of the smallest size pills, off of one large sweater and the appearance was greatly improved.</li>
            <li> This unit did the job as advertized. My sweater looked 10 times better after shaving but it did not look brand new. Still, i got my money&#x27;s worth. I also wish that it shaves faster.</li>
            <li> Very happy itch this little shaver. You can tell by the sound that in comparison to other shavers, this one is superior to any other. Worked wonders on an old and very loved hand knitted blanket.</li>
            <li> This Remington fabric shaver works great on our fleece sheets and tee shirts as well.  For the price, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> You have to over and over the same area for it to work right.</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver is not the best, but does work on some fabrics. The first problem I encountered was the amount of noise it emits, its very annoying and irritating! It occurs from the blades scraping across the metal grill over and over at high speeds. One major issue that unsettled me was it ripped one of my t-shirts several times in less than 1/2 a minute! Made me very upset and weary of using it again! It does work on thicker fabrics such as fleece and blankets and hats but I would not use it on thin cotton or silk or any expensive fabric you don&#x27;t want to possibly tear. One good thing is that all the lint and beads are captured in the tray which makes for easy cleaning. I deducted 2 stars for the tearing and noise, but gave it 3 out of the fact it can still be useful and is easier cleanup than a roller. I would recommend this to someone but would also add the fact it can ruin some fabrics.</li>
            <li> Dont go around with all those little pills on your sweater --- use the fabric shaver and add years to your favorite sweater.  I love this item and have used one for over 20 years.  It is worth the few minutes it takes to make your sweater look new again.</li>
            <li> A good little motor with good cutters. I used it to get rid of pillies on my couch</li>
            <li> Small form makes it easy to hold in your hand. It moves easily around the fabric and does a great job clearing those little fuzz balls!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  Took care of some old sheets that were pilling up.  Easy to use and empty out.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I never knew this product existed until now. I used to just shove &amp;#34;pilled&amp;#34; sweaters to the back of my closet but this fabric shave just made all of them look brand new. People think that I went on a sweater shopping spree! It&#x27;s a tad noisy and the container gets filled too fast in my opinion but those are the only drawbacks. In regards to the container, I doubt I&#x27;ll have problems with its size in the future as I&#x27;ll never let my sweaters get to that condition again. I&#x27;ve saved close to $1000 because I didn&#x27;t have to go out and buy new wool sweaters. The ROI on this is, well, awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Compact.&lt;br /&gt;Gentle even on my most delicate sweaters.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and results are clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Small holding compartment for &amp;#34;pills/lint.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat noisy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does what it says and this really should be an essential tool in everyone&#x27;s closet.</li>
            <li> over priced but does the job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working .great thing.Easy to use.its fulfill my requirement.too good .After using this cloths are  looking new . no fuzzball.</li>
            <li> No matter how one tried to put the 2 batteries in, the place where they were to go was defective, so the product did not work.  No receipt was in the box or instructions as to how to return.  I feel had.</li>
            <li> This replaces slightly larger unit that lasted 20+ yrs. Put it through the paces upon receipt and performed very well. Used firm pressure on heavily textured items (like homemade, cabled knits) but lighter sweeping motion on firmer finish (yoga pants). Would subtract 1/2 star because in downward position, working item on flat surface, gravity causes contents of storage compartment to compact near blades...and compartment seems apt to detach during use (will just secure with tape as I had to do with previous model).</li>
            <li> Gets rid of all the fuzzies easily and effectively. Makes my clothes look much better!</li>
            <li> I use the fabric shaver to &amp;#34;depill&amp;#34; the occasional sweater, but mainly on socks. Not sure why socks are made the way they are in recent years, but they tend to pill, or get fuzzies, after the first wash and there after. This product will take care of those irritating pills, or fuzzies, that cover the socks. The unit does catch the fabric from time to time and snags it. Does not happen all that often, so not sure what causes it? Overall, I very satisfied with it!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for one of these for sometime since I have a couch that gets some beads on it. It works well for clothes, but does not work so well if it is being held vertically. It works best if held diagonally or vertically, which isn&#x27;t really what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> So pleased with this. My linen Pottery Barn couch was covered in fuzz balls and nothing would fix it. Now it looks brand new and I am ecstatic.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this, because I remembered a generic version of one of these I bought years ago, and it was a hunk of junk.&lt;br /&gt;However, this one really does shave off the pills!&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that fuzz builds up rather quickly around the blades, so you have to keep an eye on that and empty it out. I had to use tweezers to get it out. But even that said, I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This thing works very well. Shaves the little white balls right off! For some reason it really frightens my relatively large (90lbs) dog. I guess she is aware of what this little thing is capable of.</li>
            <li> Product worked but didn&#x27;t last.  It did remove pills from a sweater but the metal guard broke during the first use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small but really removes the pills and stuff. Just dont press it too hard against the fabric. It&#x27;s a little loud and makes my ears ring after I turn it off. Maybe it&#x27;s just me. Overall, this is very good. I wish I had this sooner!</li>
            <li> It works very well and not expensive.  Although I don&#x27;t like the fact that I had to purchase other items just to get this.</li>
            <li> This works! I wasn&#x27;t sure it would, and some reviews said it cut into their clothing (read those, because I haven&#x27;t had this problem and don&#x27;t know if there are certain types of materials or ways of using this that result in that), but it has been great for me. Those little pills on clothes annoy the crap out of me and this shaved them right off. Not PERFECTLY smooth but just about there. The little holder for shavings works well too and keeps a mess from forming. This is inexpensive and a really neat tool to have.</li>
            <li> I purchased this fabric shaver after some of my dress shirts (The kind of work, weddings, etc) started to develop a ton of little lint balls on them.  They were starting to get so bad my options were to try a fabric shaver or just donate the shirts to good will.  The shaver is easy to use, and it had no issues at all.  After one use the shirt I tried this on is smooth and looks almost brand new now.  The one downside to these is that as small as they are, it can take an eternity to cleanup just one article of clothing.  I have no complaints about the shaver at all, and if I ever needed another one would most likely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This lint remover is amazing. It takes off pills/lint with ease, making my sweaters and shirts look like new. I even was able to use it on a couple of ties as the stitching on the pattern began to come loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is ONE big issue that you must know about, because if you are careful it won&#x27;t be a problem at all. The shaver tends to get fabric caught in it from time to time, especially on clothing with rougher textures. If you just move it all around on this piece of clothing you&#x27;re trying to shave and apply a lot of pressure, threads are bound to get caught and pulled out. It&#x27;s bound to happen every so often, and you can use the shaver to go over the spot and take down any new loose threads you&#x27;ve created, but if you aren&#x27;t careful this will happen a lot and you will probably end up ruining your shirt. Just move it slowly and gently, without pressing too hard, and you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this is a perfectly good product that will bring your old clothes back to life. I would definitely recommend it, just remember to be careful and you&#x27;ll be all set.</li>
            <li> I thought at first that the product wasn&#x27;t working but you just have to be patient and go over your clothing several times (slowly) before seeing results but it&#x27;s worth it. I have used it on a few items and the battery hasn&#x27;t run out yet even though it&#x27;s on for quite a bit each time. I also used it on a thin, cotton shirt and I didn&#x27;t have any problem with it creating holes. For the price, a great value.</li>
            <li> Remove lint and pills effortlessly. I tried it with sweaters, athletic wears and socks. Make sure you have the garment on a flat surface so it doesn&#x27;t chew up your project.</li>
            <li> Took a lot of going over and over to fix the problem. Thought it could have been a little more powerful. Never used one before, so had nothing to which I could compare it though.</li>
            <li> great item. i had a knitted sweater that i loved but never wore because of all the small lint balls on it. now with this item i can enjoy it once again. great item to have in the home. i would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> This did great with my heavy wool coat.  I had to empty it a couple times because the lint trap is kinda small.  The blades are nice and sharp; I had no troubles.</li>
            <li> I bought this to rescue an old tee shirt dress that was covered in fuzz and pills...I am addicted. Using this and seeing how much comes off your clothes is super satisfying. I&#x27;ve found myself searching the house to find things I can use this on.</li>
            <li> My husband left a &amp;#34;kleenex&amp;#34; in the  pocket of his washable wool/poly blend trousers, and it created a horrible pilled mess all over the pants from waist to hem when they were washed.  This little shaver cost a mere fraction of those trousers, and it cleaned up the entire mess.  Instructions were easy to read and follow.</li>
            <li> Does the job as we had hoped. Removed the little fuzzy pills without ruining the garment. Pills are trapped in the removable compartment and easily disposed. No need to buy an expensive one!</li>
            <li> I use this not only on sweaters but on an old couch that tends to pill easily.  It works quickly with out clogging and makes the surfaces look smooth and new again.  I have used it probably 20 times by now and still have not replaced the batteries.</li>
            <li> Broke not too long after I bought it. Don&#x27;t know if that was my fault or not. Did a decent job when it was working.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent fabric shaver for the price. Managed to make a year-old lambswool sweater look practically new! Make sure you test it on a less noticeable part of your sweater/shirt before you go ahead and shave the entire piece of clothing. I did eventually shave a hole in one of my sweaters, but that was my fault for not shaving on a flat surface. I don&#x27;t expect this shaver to last more than the season, but it will have proved its worth well.</li>
            <li> Standard defuzzer.  I was pressing pretty hard against a book and it did catch one of my nice sweaters and created a hole.  Not cool.  It does an OK job.  I wish there was something that worked better.</li>
            <li> I had expected it to be bigger.  The head of it is so small that it takes along time and lots of effort to go over an entire sweater, i.e.</li>
            <li> Broke after 2 uses. The flimsy screen that covers the blade snapped apart. How does a sweater break a piece of metal? No using an exacto blade to scrape off fuzzies. Takes a long time, but its better than this junk.</li>
            <li> This does a good job of rejuvenating the looks of athletic wear and bedding. It is actually kind of fun to use.</li>
            <li> Does the job.  Have only used it a few times, but no complaints.  Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend. Better then doing it by hand.</li>
            <li> Saw a fren wit this 1st then got my own 2 when I ruin my daughter sweater now it&#x27;s back to new love it</li>
            <li> This was every thing I thought it would be . I also bought one for the Shop I work in . We use it all the time</li>
            <li> Works very well. The pill catcher tends to slip off easily, but not enough of a problem that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great &amp; very effective as advertised.  I was especially surprised as I didn&#x27;t have much expectation given such an cheap price. I bought this for trimming the sock cotton balls in all my sneakers for whish it is perfect.  If I would like to nitpick the battery cover slips off easly so covering it with some sticky tape helps when handling it thus 4 star rating.</li>
            <li> Saved pillows and cushions on our couch, ruined by dogs.  Have used it for several hours and still going strong - very impressed for an $8 product!</li>
            <li> A must have in every business mans closet for that last second touch up. It also gives life to that old favorite sweater.</li>
            <li> I have a North Face Denali WindPro and this little shaver did an excellent job.  I didn&#x27;t have any issues with snagging or cutting/tearing fabric.  I highly recommend this useful little tool.</li>
            <li> This item worked well for half a sweater.  After that it was entirely ineffective.  Taking it apart for cleaning was not helpful.  Do yourself a favor and buy a better fabric shaver, this one is a real lemon and complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Love it, came on time and works perfectly. It is exactly as advertised and for the price I can&#x27;t complain. I don&#x27;t over use it for fear of over heating and I make sure to remove lint BEFORE it builds back up to the blades so the cleanup is easier.</li>
            <li> This is a life saver. I&#x27;ve managed to revive sweaters pajamas gloves and not had to purchase new ones.</li>
            <li> Definitely for bigger areas.</li>
            <li> Ripped holes in my clothes.  Be careful!</li>
            <li> This does absolutely nothing to remove fuzz from any piece of clothing or textile.  I tried every scenario to achieve success.  The item is simply a useless gadget.  I guess I&#x27;ve made it clear and the message is don&#x27;t waste your money.  I have a little plastic defuzzer that I got free from the Gap that is most effective.</li>
            <li> Love this thing. Makes old sweaters like new!</li>
            <li> cheap little shaver works good. i have used it for my sweaters ans socks and so far no problems, highly reccomd for a cheap one you cant beat it</li>
            <li> It works very well, and small that easy to carry for traveling. Anyway why i have to say so much to grade this shaver... It just a good shaver...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find one of these for years! Thank GOD I found one finally :-)</li>
            <li> SWEATERS LOOK LIKE NEW</li>
            <li> Love this lint shaver. Keep it in my bathroom to touch up those nasty lint balls after a wash. It works great. I have had this for about 2 years and have not even changed the batteries. Would recommend!!</li>
            <li> The shaver is a good idea, but this in particular is not powerful, and is not working like I expected, be careful I don&#x27;t recommend it, please try with another.</li>
            <li> This little fabric shaver is the best one I&#x27;ve purchased to date. The jumbo one I purchased at a local big box craft store stopped working after using it on no more than 10 wool sweaters. I returned it and the same thing happened with the replacement and another replacement. I also had another small shaver. It worked for a good while then quit. This Remington has outlasted both of the. It&#x27;s small so it doesn&#x27;t cover as much area as the jumbo one did.</li>
            <li> I gotta say this is a pretty good product for the money. It definitely took the pills off my sweaters and socks, it&#x27;s just a little slow going. Also, unlike other reviewers I did not have problems with thinner sweaters. Worked on just about anything that pills. Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I have had many different sweater shavers through the years and I think this one is the best.  The price is reasonable and the blades stay sharp longer than most that I have used.  The shield prevents snagging on most fabrics if you are careful.  It works great to remove the lint balls that form on the elastic on bras, making them look new.</li>
            <li> .... until the grill broke.  I don&#x27;t know if I was using it any harder than anyone else would.  It&#x27;s kind of cheap.</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT,DOESN&#x27;T WORK QUITE AS WELL AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD AS FAR AS REMOVING THE FUZZIES,I HAVE TO GO OVER THE AREA SEVERAL TIMES BUT IT WORKS BETTER ON CERTAIN MATERIALS SO I WILL KEEP IT TO USE ON THEM</li>
            <li> This thing works exactly as it should.  It does take some time if you plan on de-fuzzing an entire shirt.  I had a couple winter hats that were balling up and it fixed them.  Also my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s blanket looks new again.</li>
            <li> This little thing removes lint balls excellently and for a great price. Havent ever had any problems it and havent ever had to change the batteries and i use it fairly often.</li>
            <li> Super light, super good...awesome little lint shaver that quick shaves all those annoying lent on your socks. The collector catches all the shaved lent, super easy to empy. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!</li>
            <li> Had another shaver yrs ago and I have been looking for a replacement for a long time. This works better than most I have tried. Read that it &amp;#34;ate&amp;#34; some fabrics in the review, not a problem for me. But I have used it mostly on sweaters, not any fine fabric like silk. Still not as good as my old one, but works fine for the price.</li>
            <li> Works well and does a decent job of removing piling from sweaters and such. Def well worth the price for this product</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this crap. Very poorly designed, the plastic cover that collects lint keeps falling off. If I could, I would return mine and ask for money back.</li>
            <li> Great for defuzzing sweaters</li>
            <li> Works great, just wish I would of brought a bigger size,</li>
            <li> The battery cover and lint container cover comes off too easily when I turn it on or off. Don&#x27;t particularly like the shape. It functions well though.</li>
            <li> Works as it said it would, satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use this on some wool I had, and it did not work at all. It seemed to collect some fuzz in the compartment, but all the pills were still there. A sweater stone worked better.</li>
            <li> Good product, works just fine. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> great item. glad i purchased it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This razor did not help much. Too light and dull. My sweaters look exactly the same as they did before I tried this razor.</li>
            <li> Works as needed. Great for the price</li>
            <li> I picked up this little gem for some sheets that had grown quite a bit &amp;#34;pilly&amp;#34; and it works like a charm!  MY wife has a wool pea coat that needed some love as well and it looks like new.  I&#x27;m not sure how to address concerns about the suction being too powerful and pulling fabric in. I didn&#x27;t notice any issues in that regard.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product works great and was a great price. Saved me money from not having to go to a dry cleaner of sorts to get all the weird fuzzies removed from my clothes. Love it.</li>
            <li> I got this cut some puffs on my cloth seat covers in my car...this thing worked perfectly.  I am sure this thing could be used for so many other fabric shaving options, I will keep it handy for my next puff cutting projects.  p.s. it is an amazon add on</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver specifically for my fabric couch that was pilling terribly.  This little shaver has made it look so much better!  It works really well and I even had a little fun going over the fabric and getting rid of those pills!  I can&#x27;t attest to whether or not it works well on other fabrics, but it worked perfectly for what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> Used this on a couple of my fave sweaters where the fabric has pilled together. It&#x27;s tiny and works amazingly well! I get scared it will overheat with how long I use it per session, but so far so good. Really enjoyed this purchase!</li>
            <li> I used this and was very happy with how well it worked on my blazer. It didn&#x27;t put any holes in it which others have in the past. I suppose it depends on the fabric, but if using it on a more delicate fabric, just pull it taut first.</li>
            <li> It was just ok.  I mean, for the amount of lint I had to remove, I would say I needed one that was bigger and more powerful.  but for the price, it was great.  it does remove those pill sized lints on my socks and blankets.</li>
            <li> This fuzz buster really works. I was skeptical to think this would really to the job with fuzz on sweaters, but it does. Great buy!!!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work at all:( Did not remove lint!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money on this, seriously :( !</li>
            <li> I use this very often to keep my pants, sweaters, jackets, and other clothes looking fresh.  It&#x27;s been a great help, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it!</li>
            <li> Great for what it is designed to do. It is a good little machine. Helps to keep clothes looking new and while cheap should last long enough to pay for itself.</li>
            <li> This little shaver is amazing.  It works extremely well, is sharp and so far, very durable.  I have bought 4-5 of these as gifts.  They remove fuzz and lint balls very well.  I HIGHLY recommend this little guy.</li>
            <li> it worked very well and didn&#x27;t cut into the fabric. I used it on wool sweaters and coats, fleece jackets.</li>
            <li> Pretty basic fabric shaver, does what you need it to do. My only complaint about this little guy is that the lint trap comes off easily when you are using it, which is why I took off one star.</li>
            <li> Great product, removes pilling and lint from sweaters fairly well.  Only complaint is the size...it&#x27;s time consuming to do an entire sweater thoroughly, but not a fault in the product.  I recommend a larger version of this product if you plan to use it frequently, but otherwise I would buy again even if the one I have breaks!</li>
            <li> It works ok.  I had one in the past, can&#x27;t remember if it was this brand or not.  But my old one worked better, the holes in the metal top were a little bigger, so the fabric balls could get inside and be cut off.  This one cut a few of them, but leaves most behind.</li>
            <li> Has saved a ton of my sweaters from looking tired and worn out. Refreshed them really nicely. Didn&#x27;t ruin the fabric at all like some users complained. Gave me a few of my favorites back! Wish I had discovered this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I had lint pills on my pants and blankets and the scratchy texture was slowly annoying me out of my mind. I foolishly got lint rollers as I initially thought that was how you remove lint pills. Upon consulting the Google however I found out about fabric shavers. However I am extremely glad I did. This thing is (without overstating) one of the best purchases I made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When reading the reviews I was hesitant on getting this as I didn&#x27;t want a gaping hole in my clothes/bedding. Upon receiving it I immediately removed all the annoying lint pills on my pants and blanket. Even applying pressure on them it did not end up with a hole in my pants and blanket. What did result though was an extremely smooth and soft fabric (and I mean baby soft). I am extremely glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> This is simply an amazing product. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this. Just throw a few batteries in it, turn it on, and those lint balls on your sweatshirts, etc. are gone. Would recommend since it is priced great!</li>
            <li> Only did one knit blazer so fat and it seems to work pretty well... will see how long it lasts after doing some more items. The shaver face is large so that is helpful and the blades seem sharp. No dragging or pulls on the pillage yet.</li>
            <li> Works the best after  so many several kind tried.I had to buy more for the family after I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li> Great, so easy to use and it works so good on my sofa :)&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it for sure.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best things I have ever purchased! I bought it to use on my comforter, and it worked like a charm. I have also used it on several items of clothing. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the covers for the batteries and the lint trap slide off a bit too easily while you&#x27;re using it. Despite that, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Small but very powerful, does exactly what&#x27;s expected</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver makes great work of fleece clothing in particular, and I was pleased to have some of my clothing renewed.  However, the metal used to make the shaver head is extremely fine, and a section of mine broke off with the pressure of using the device, within a very short time.  It still works, but I have to be extremely careful not to snag clothing on the sharp edge where the metal broke.  I would not buy this again.  I have heard that Brookstone produced a similar product that holds up much better, but I don&#x27;t know if they are still making it.  I&#x27;m a little wary of buying another.</li>
            <li> transformed my old sweaters</li>
            <li> This works great!  I didn&#x27;t think it would be as powerful as it is due to its size, but its just fine for my sweaters.</li>
            <li> I typically consider myself to be an intelligent person, until this little fabric shaver arrived.  It didn&#x27;t work at all.  I checked the batteries&#x27; strength, read what I assumed would be oh-so-obvious instructions (and they were), but the shaver didn&#x27;t remove even one insignificant &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; from the comforter -- until I removed the safety cover from the blade shield.  THEN it worked fine, although my ego was a little sore...</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo37MOPDPBIDG7E]]This thing is CRAY-ZEE!!! For ages, I had relegated two of my favorite thumbhole hoodies to \\&quot;only wear in house\\&quot; status. Then I bought this and now I can wear my hoodies in public again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There wasn&#x27;t anything wrong with the hoodies, but once they get these lint ball things on them they look old and cheap. Now that I shaved the stuff off, they look brand new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch the video! I shave off some particularly gnarly lint balls off of a thermal sock. It&#x27;s KEE-RAY-ZEE!</li>
            <li> Great product the only issue I have is the lint holder is too small, needs to remove shaved lint constantly.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this.  She uses it all the time.  I recommend that you practice on an old sweater before you really go to town with it.  She was pretty aggressive and holed a sweater.  Other than that, she loves it!</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t think this thing would work.  My sister-in-law recommended it and I was suspicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sooo wrong!  This little worker bee chews up lint balls like nobody&#x27;s business.  I use it on everything, socks, sweaters, coats, blankets, you name it, I use this on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had it for over three years and the blades are just now getting a little dull.  If you have an expensive garment, be careful.  The blades are sharp, but with lots of use, they obviously dull and can lightly pull on the material.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems, but with kashmir it might be something to use initially, but not forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would HIGHLY recommend this for the removal of all things fuzzy on your clothes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on buying another one as a backup.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this product work well by reading good review.  Unfortunately, this is very cheap made product.  It was not functioning with first use.  The surface is very thin and chap made, almost like aluminium foil.  I would not recommend at all.</li>
            <li> My whole family is hooked on this thing.  The little &amp;#34;vacuum&amp;#34; really makes the little pills and snags stand up, and the clippers work great.  The chamber jut doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of fuzz so you have to empty it often but it makes your clothes look new.</li>
            <li> Worked great at getting pile off our bamboo sheets.</li>
            <li> Battery life is long and it gets the job done. Wish it was a little more powerful but for price it works great.</li>
            <li> Tried to save a sweater dress that was getting &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34;. This reduced the pills on the sweater. The sweater is by no means brand new looking but better than it was. Will keep this around for future use. I read to be careful with thin fabrics though.</li>
            <li> I have had several sweater shavers and this was by far the worst. Barely worked one time and was designed poorly.</li>
            <li> works great, thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> Powerful and portable. Should be use with care as every other shaver like this one.&lt;br /&gt;I never destroyed any clothes with it.&lt;br /&gt; Love it!</li>
            <li> saved so many outfits now with this little machine, batteries seems to last a long time (using regular coppertop).  Awesome on bras, sweaters, blankets.... save your clothes and make them look sharp again for a $6 investment... totally worth it.  And with having kids fleece blankets always just getting thrown in a load of laundry quick and then you have a load of pilled up clothes at the end, this is your solution (when my husband does the laundry this happens often, I&#x27;m thankful for his help but this little machine is a must!)</li>
            <li> I have looked long and hard to find a good one. This one does the job!</li>
            <li> I had one of these before and it finally died on me. I was so glad to be able to still find these shavers. It takes all the &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; off your clothing and leaves it looking great. I&#x27;ve not had any of the problems other people seemed to have with the shaver &amp;#34;eating&amp;#34; any of my clothing.</li>
            <li> No seriously. Is it possible to love a sweater shaver? I&#x27;m not sure I have ever loved a cheap little product this much. It works FABULOUSLY and I still have the original batteries in it even though I&#x27;ve been using it consistently (once or twice a week for about 10 minutes at a stretch) for a few months. My clothes are looking brand new again. I wish I had this years ago--so many sweaters could have been saved! Buy it!</li>
            <li> This product works fine and does the job required.  Looked all over and glad I found this item for me.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Easy to use. Love it! It does take time to clean up garments, but it is well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Following reviewing the various &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; removers on Amazon I settled on this one.  I am very glad this was the one I chose.  I primarily decided on the Remington because of price and the overall pretty good reviews.  I was skeptical of it operating on 2 AA batteries as I generally find battery operated devices to be poor quality. Not true with this.  Plenty of power and longevity of operation.  I primarily use it to remove pills from bedding/sheets and it works excellently if you use it as directed----just make sure you keep the discharge vessel cleaned out thoroughly and remove the cover to remove any shorn fabric that will likely start to tangle the spindle.  I&#x27;ve found that if I do this, again, as directed, it works great!!!</li>
            <li> I only was able to use once before it broke- the blades went through metal cover/screen. Not happy at all with the quality.</li>
            <li> Works great- I used it on an upholstered chair that was &amp;#34;balling up&amp;#34; and for the inner thigh of some of my pants.</li>
            <li> First, I trialed this product on a long-sleeved cotton shirt that was starting to pill a little at the end of the sleeves. The shaver LITERALLY shaved a hole to the sleeve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to return it after that, but thought it was my fault for trying it on a thinner item of clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried it again on a thick pair of gloves that were pilling. Excellent! It worked GREAT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEN...I tried it on a thin rug that had all kinds of lint and pills. The shaver got jammed. I cleaned it out and noticed the metal cover had chipped. Without the cover on, the blade spins just fine. However, with the cover, it is jammed and will not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed in the quality of the product. Granted, perhaps it&#x27;s not to be used for rugs...or shirts... But I thought this product would be more versatile. I am returning it.</li>
            <li> This product worked so well for exactly what it is supposed to do! I bought it to use on a pair of my boyfriends polyester/nylon workout pants, because after one wash they were terribly pilled! It took the pills off in one swipe and did not destroy or even at all do any damage to the pants themself. I also decided to try it on one of my fleece columbia sweatshirts, and it worked great! I deffinatly would recomend this product to anyone! My mom is thinking of buying one as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, very easy to use. Although you have to be careful with light fabrics because it can open big holes</li>
            <li> This shaver is one of those items you would probably never buy on your own, but you are so grateful for it when it comes in your life. I had a ton of sweaters with fuzzy, irritating lint balls and I was about ready to throw them out. As a last stitched effort, I ordered the shaver and am so glad I did. All my sweaters look new. I&#x27;ve used it on thin, cotton shirts to heavy wool jackets - it works on anything I try! Even upholstered items and pillows are no match for the Remington shaver. I love it so much, I bought three more for gifts. And, at the job&#x27;s White Elephant party, it was a sought after item, lol. Some user tips I&#x27;d offer: frequent cleanings are necessary to keep it running efficiently, be sure to unscrew the screen and clean blades (don&#x27;t cut yourself), don&#x27;t press the shaver to the garment-hover over it, and enjoy! As a couple of posters mentioned, it is enjoyable, in a weird way. Great purchase, indeed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy that actually bought this for all my dozen plus pairs of smart wool socks that are all pilled up.  took my time and used this handy dandy pill eater and my socks are like brand new.  This little thing is a beast.</li>
            <li> I was concerned based on reviews that this would be a dud.  It definitely didn&#x27;t return sweaters to like-new condition, but it really did improve the appearance with a bit of babying it around.  It&#x27;s not ideal, but under ten bucks to restore quite a few sweaters to much better condition is well worth it - it&#x27;s only a bit more than the cost of dry-cleaning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three downsides of note:&lt;br /&gt;- Only takes primary (non-rechargeable) AA batteries.  Minor point, but I didn&#x27;t have any lying around.&lt;br /&gt;- The reservoir fills relatively quickly and has to be emptied regularly, pretty much once a garment.&lt;br /&gt;- Be careful.  It&#x27;s not a high quality piece of equipment.  You can bend the metal faceplate and prevent it from working relatively easily.  Also, see the other reviews about it catching on a loose thread or bunched up fabric and tearing holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit of care and babying can prevent all these downsides, so overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth your while.</li>
            <li> The unit keeps battery power well and is a good solution for minor pilling on knitwear.  It quickly and smoothly takes the pilling off without snagging or damaging the knit.  If the garment it extremely pilled or you need to do a large item this is not a good solution in that it would take far too long to do.  That is a job better left for the dry cleaner or a sweater stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is something that anyone that owns knits should have.</li>
            <li> The plastic fuzz collector broke with in minutes of it coming out of the box.  It is now a pain in the butt to try and use because it keeps falling off every 3 seconds.  It functions ok.  I don&#x27;t recommend it for very thick woven sweaters, either.  It works best on fine woven wool sweaters.</li>
            <li> This shaver MIGHT work for very, very light sweater, but for anything else, it is completely useless. I originally purchased it to shave the occasional fuzz ball off of my sofa, but it couldn&#x27;t take out any of them. Also, if I was lucky enough to have it pick one up, the shaver would clog and stop. At that rate, it would take weeks to shave my sofa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not wanting to completely give up on it, I tried it on a wool sweater and a wool jacket (thinking maybe the sofa fabric was just too heavy for the small shaver), but alas, it had the same problems on the sweater and the jacket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It removes &gt;5% of the fuzz under the head at any given time, and about half the time, it gets clogged, regardless of fabric weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very poor design. Disappointing. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a shaver that I had bought back in the early eighties that still worked beautifully but needed new blades which I was unable to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of what I dislike about this shaver is due to my lack of paying attention to the description. This is a travel size item and is very tiny compared to what I&#x27;m used to. Since it is so tiny, it takes much longer to shave something with a large surface area, like a jacket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also very disappointed in its performance. It is absolutely brutal on knit fabrics, even something as sturdy as athletic socks. It seems to suck the fabric into itself and rip the fibers. I ruined a pair of socks and a blanket. Other items I couldn&#x27;t even try it on because it immediately sucked the fabric in. I ruined one of my favorite blankets with it. It is also very messy. I have to clean up a mess of lint after using it. It spews it about during use and it is impossible to empty the reservoir after using it without a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not think this is a good product and I would recommend trying something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I found a small piece of metal on my floor that I didn&#x27;t recognize until I picked up my shaver to try to use it again and saw a large hole in the screen. I have not mishandled this item so I don&#x27;t know how it broke but the shaver is in the garbage now. It&#x27;s amazing to me that something I had bought almost forty years ago lasted so long and this shaver only lasted through several uses (or should I say \\&quot;abuses\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> We have used this on clothing and our couch! My husband was amazed at how well it worked. Great product and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Bought two, just that good</li>
            <li> I had a few sweaters with lots of &amp;#34;pilling&amp;#34; on the back. It removed most of them down to the original, flat surface level. A few spots you can still tell where the fabric looks a little off, but it looks much nicer than before with the pilling.</li>
            <li> The chamber gets lint in it, but looking at the clothes, it&#x27;s a mystery where it&#x27;s coming from. The pilling isn&#x27;t improved.</li>
            <li> I ended up returning this item because it was not what I expected.  Some reviews said it was &amp;#34;too powerful&amp;#34; so I expected it to be..but it left me disappointed. I recommend other products with a handle so it&#x27;s easier to hold.  I also like the Fuzz Wizzard Fabric Shaver because it does the job just like advertised.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of all my lint balls from my clothes. Works as it is advertised. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works very well on fleece, doesn&#x27;t work at all on heavier fabrics like wool with larger pils.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted it for my wool sweaters and coats so it&#x27;s completely useless for that.&lt;br /&gt;The lint cover falls off very easily.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as expected, but it helps so I&#x27;m happy with it. It&#x27;s small enough to take out and the price was great.</li>
            <li> Love this little thing! Gets rid of all those annoying pills and any loose threads. I use it on everything-clothes and other fabrics.</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery would buy again</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Quality product.  Highly recommend. A+++++</li>
            <li> Best thing ever.. It really works!! Just make sure you actually take off the cap before you actually use it.</li>
            <li> I used to have one with more surface area, and i think it was more powerful than this one, but this serves my needs just fine.</li>
            <li> This little guy is the smallest workhorse around town. It looks dinky, but it is powerful and performs exactly the way it is supposed to. We&#x27;ve used it on a handful of more delicate fabrics as well and never had any issues at all. Just don&#x27;t Hulk Hogan it into your fabric and you&#x27;ll be just fine.</li>
            <li> I bought my sofa 6 month ago and the balls comes in from the cloth in a few month, I buy this for my sofa, it works really good, my sofa now looks like new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 4 years and still works. Given the price, this is fantastic and works very well. The only issue I have is that the lint it collects doesn&#x27;t really go into the collector well so I periodically have to unscrew the cap, take out the blades, and scrape out the lint. But that takes a couple seconds so it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Last time I owned one of these things was over 20 years ago.  If you have used one before, you will find that this one is as good as any.  I ran it over a polyester blend shirt that was so pilled, it was unwearable.  It came out looking great, and there were no pulls or snags.  Batteries were still strong when I was done.  Just remember not to feed it any corners or collar points, and keep the fabric flat while shaving.  Also, all pill shavers require extra care on textured fabrics.</li>
            <li> The Fabric Shaver is small and fills up fast.  It&#x27;s ok for small jobs.  Works ok.&lt;br /&gt;s</li>
            <li> Just used and it works great! So happy I bought this!</li>
            <li> Great product. Works really good!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a great job at removing pills from my sweaters and it is very time consuming to use.  I plan to look for a larger one.</li>
            <li> This thing is a lifesaver and takes off both piling and lint.  Makes my sweaters look new again and gets that ratty looking piling off.  Battery&#x27;s last quite a while.</li>
            <li> Used this to remove thousands of pills on a relatively new soft shell (like neoprene) workout jacket.  It easily removed every pill and my jacket looks like new again.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised. It worked great for my thicker clothes! I have also tried it on a lighter piece of clothing and it worked for that as well without leaving any holes.</li>
            <li> This item simply doesn&#x27;t work. Even large &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; and threads are left after going over the same area multiple times.</li>
            <li> I bought this to shave the places that my dog has picked on my sofa with his nails.  It works perfect for that.</li>
            <li> There is always some little fuzz ball build up on my pillow case&lt;br /&gt;I use to use a shark knife and cut over the pillow to remove them some time it will cut the sheet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now i have this all i have to do it run over it&lt;br /&gt;Works great!</li>
            <li> This is the first sweater shaver I&#x27;ve bought and am happy with my purchase.  This works well but is a little loud.</li>
            <li> I feel bad- I used to tease my dog with a lint remover.  This was many years ago when I was only a child and didn&#x27;t know how to respect dogs.  I&#x27;d wait until she was asleep on her dog bed and turn it on near her legs.  She&#x27;d jump up and bite at it.  That was wrong, I know.  Live and learn.  Anyway this lint remover is good but the truth is, depending on the condition of your clothing, it might not work to the best of its ability.  For example an old sweater that&#x27;s seen better days.  This Remington Fabric Shaver won&#x27;t remove the lint as well on an old sweater as it would on a brand new pair of jeans.  Keep this in mind.  It could also depend on the thickness of the clothing.  It probably wouldn&#x27;t work on a winter jacket covered in fuzzies.  Not that I&#x27;ve ever had a winter jacket covered in fuzzies, but some of you may have and could tell me if this product works on winter jackets.  Otherwise, a terrific product that&#x27;s surprisingly durable and dependable.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that this would be cheaply made and inefficient; but it is NOT.  I love this little sweater (and many other items) shaver, it is relative quiet and very efficient, a small size that you can throw into a suitcase and quickly use anywhere.  I had another Remington battery fabric shaver for over ten years!  Finally the interior wires broke and I had to purchase this new one.  AND for the price, if this ones lasts a fourth as long, it is a great purchase!</li>
            <li> It has bitten a couple of holes in my clothes unfortunately, so be careful using it. I adjusted the ring over the blades and made it looser and that seemed to solve the problem of it nipping too much fabric. Uses up batteries pretty quick.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver and use it to shave the pills off my clothing. It&#x27;s powerful and does the job, but as with all shavers, you have to be very careful with the pressure so you don&#x27;t damage the fabric. The price was right and it&#x27;s a MUST have to get extra years off of your favorite pieces. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, so I don&#x27;t have a historical report which will be the real test.</li>
            <li> i have this lovely angora sweater that had these pills covering it. It was so bad that I couldn&#x27;t wear it in public anymore. It takes some time to actually get the pills off the sweater, but is well worth it.</li>
            <li> .&lt;br /&gt;regarding price---I have had mine for over 10 years; and the young lady who helps me was telling me how shattered husband was To throw out an old sports hoodie because it have a lot of sentimental value but it had so many balls of fabric all over it she thought and hideous and didn&#x27;t want him wearing it anymore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product made the sweater looks almost brand-new as well as many other children&#x27;s close that were going to be thrown out. She also had a teenager who was delighted that a pair of her pants and favorite shirts were saved with this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular brand has worked really well for me for over 10 years-- and this purchase was a gift basically-- with happy people who received it</li>
            <li> need to let customer know they stop making them,plus there no replacement parts</li>
            <li> This actually works.  It does a nice job of removing the pills from sweaters.  Added more words to finish review.</li>
            <li> These Fabric Shavers really work and this one is as good as the others.  It&#x27;s not as large as it looks in the picture which I was glad about.  Can&#x27;t lose by ordering this item.  Cost was reasonable also.</li>
            <li> its not the best thing that will keep you happy for long but it could do its job if you&#x27;re not gonna use it often. def does drain your battery after about 20 mins of continuing use. if im big on the fabric shaver thing then i would buy a electric one that pricier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased list removers before and none have worked as well as this one. Sure saves a lot of time and makes items I hadn&#x27;t worn for a while wearable since all the little nubs are removed.</li>
            <li> Tried several different brands, sizes, of shavers. This is the ONLY one that works, works well, and keeps on working well! Love it!</li>
            <li> For a  cheap thing that you don&#x27;t need to use often, it serves the purpose, but barely. It is tolerable but not great.</li>
            <li> Functions perfectly and is addictive to use.  I fished out old sweaters and pajama pants just to use this on them.  The are softer than when I purchased them now!</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver does an adequate job and is certainly easier than picking fuzz by hand.  Don&#x27;t expect miracles from a low cost shaver.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. My mom had one when I was a kid and I couldn&#x27;t find one at any local stores. I machine wash most of my sweaters so I always end up with the dreaded pills. This isn&#x27;t a miracle worker, but if you are patient and diligent you can definitely improve a tired looking sweater. Of course be careful with it because there are blades inside, but I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t had any clothing casualties yet. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of methods for pill removal and this is the best solution I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Yes, this little shaver is a cheapie, but it doesn&#x27;t do much. I bought it to shave the pills off of our courdaroy-style fabric couch, but it really doesn&#x27;t put a dent in them.</li>
            <li> Works good , has gotten a little warm , but have been using it for doing a cloak . very good</li>
            <li> I have always wanted one of these garment shavers and I finally have one. This product is awesome and returns your clothes back to their former glory. I have become somewhat addicted to this though, always trying to find something to shave. My kids love shaving their clothes also. I use rechargeable batteries in mine because the regular batteries only last so long.</li>
            <li> The Remington Battery Operated Fabric Shaver performs adequately on most appropriate fabrics, but doesn&#x27;t clean the surface lint as closely or as quickly as other shavers I have used.  I will certainly use it, but wish it were a bit more efficient.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the poor reviews, but I thought I&#x27;d give it a try based off of the decent reviews. I&#x27;ve been shaving my sweater forever and seems as though I have hours more to go, sadly. The battery compartment is poorly made and this does not do a good job for pilling. I&#x27;m going to try and return it and invest in something better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d not had one of these in years. Bought a sorry one from Windemere. This Remington is much superior. I no longer have all the much polyester, but my synthetic socks do get pills. This takes them right off.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I was that amazed with this shaver, but I haven&#x27;t found a better one either.  It doesn&#x27;t shave that well, you have to press very hard to get the fuzz balls off and it took me forever to get a pair of my son&#x27;s wool longies looking fuzz free.  The plastic cover that holds the lint in falls off frequently.  I don&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li> works okay. kind of small so for an average sized person it takes a long time to work on a full sweater or shirt or pair of pants.</li>
            <li> I def felt like an old man purchasing one of these but i use them to keep my black hoodies looking amazing! The batteries go fast.</li>
            <li> Does what you expect. Funny side effect is making the dogs freak out. Good price.</li>
            <li> Just awful! The last one I had was a gift from my mother, probably twenty or more years ago. It still worked beautifully but I had worn it out right through the metal screen. This &amp;#34;replacement&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t even close in quality! The screen is flexible from brand new so I wonder how long that will last but the horrible part is that the receptacle falls off every time I pick it up as well as the battery cover being loose. I have to put a piece of tape all the way around it to hold it together. I&#x27;m looking for another brand altogether and hope I find one. Remington used to be a name that meant quality but they missed on this one. I&#x27;d have been happier paying twice the price for a quality product than have to live with this cheap junk!</li>
            <li> Works OK Worth the price</li>
            <li> I got this to fix a couple of my favorite cardigans that had a lot of fuzzballs on them. Worked like a charm! Now I use it anytime I see fuzzballs on my clothes to make them instantly look better. The only downside to this amazing fabric shaver is that you have to empty the chamber quite often.</li>
            <li> This device the whole family enjoys. Its job. Purchase satisfied. I recommend. Been reading reviews and was afraid that I could ruin my clothes. But it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> I hate fuzz balls on my sweaters.  I had a favorite that was covered with them.  I got this neat tool... and it really works!</li>
            <li> This seems to work very well on fabrics that pill heavily but not so well on lighter fabrics- the blades don&#x27;t get close enough to remove lint.</li>
            <li> Ever think you can&#x27;t wear this or that again because it has fuzz balls on it from wear or laundry? Well this little device is your new hero!! In a matter of minutes you can easily remove the &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; from you garment and have it looking like new!! Works with 2 batteries, fits easily into your hand and is very simple to use! Highly recommend this to everyone that likes looking fresh and new with no lint or fuzziness to their garments.</li>
            <li> Works very well and can get very close to fabric without putting a hole in your clothes. Easy to use and handle.</li>
            <li> works well, BUT, stay away from silk or other very thin material, WILL CHEW IT UP!</li>
            <li> I believe this is one necessity that people should buy but don&#x27;t usually think of. It&#x27;s essential if you love sweaters - easily take those pills off!</li>
            <li> This works awesome!!! It saved me lots of $ buying new sweaters and allowed me keep my old favorites. I haven&#x27;t tried it on carpet but given how great it worked on removing all the pills from my sweaters, i&#x27;d bet this would do the job on carpets too</li>
            <li> works great, good bye sweater pills</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the same one I used to own, at a Reasonable price, so I got this one. It works almost as good...but not quite. These little gems can bring back to life that one sweater or bedspread that just looks &amp;#34;dingy&amp;#34; (sp?) or Old. Wish I could show before and after pics, so you could SEE what I mean!</li>
            <li> Works great, but due to the design of it, the pills that it has shaved off get stuck under the rotating blade instead of dropping into the pill catcher.</li>
            <li> It works and does exactly what it says it does.  Great!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. It is categorized as a lint remover, which it definitely is not. Even as a shaver, it did not work at all on my wool jacket that had started pilling. I used brand new alkaline batteries to no avail (proof: the storage compartment was empty). I am shocked that some of the reviews here talk about possibly damaging fabric by using this in the wrong direction - I rubbed it all over my jacket in circles and it made no difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I love this little machine - it is compact but powerful. I have read other reviews about it before I bought it, and some customers were complaining that this fabric shaver can make holes - but I honestly don&#x27;t know how you can make a hole with this machine, unless of course you are trying to shave stockings. I used my new fabric shaver on few sweaters and the coat - works great, no holes :-), and I was pressing really good. So my review is 5 starts, and I am very happy with my purchase. Possibly will buy another one.</li>
            <li> Works fine on most fabrics.  The heavier the fabric, the easier to use.  I would not recommend&lt;br /&gt;for fine fabrics.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Gets all the fuzzies off and makes my clothes look new again! :)</li>
            <li> This sweater shaver works fine removing the pills from wool sweaters. I never had one before to compare it, but it&#x27;s ok. Beats having to snip the pills off with scissors and risk cutting holes into your sweaters. The chamber that catches the pills fills up quickly, it is easy enough to empty. Works fine for the price and it won&#x27;t cut holes in your sweaters unless you are mashing it into the fibers, I have not had an issues.</li>
            <li> I love my Remington Clothes shaver.  It works really well and is reasonably priced.  I think Remington makes good products and this clothes shaver is no exception.</li>
            <li> Have had other clothes shaver that were much  more expensive. This inexpensive item works as well or better than the others. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Keeps cloths looking new. I use it for stocking hats &amp; hoodies. My wife uses it on many different tops &amp; other clothing that get fuzzes. If you don&#x27;t have one of these &amp; you got a piece of clothing that looks old because of fuzzes, this will make it look new again :)</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it has enough power, but this only 10 bucks so worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a clothes shaver for a long time! This little shaver works great! I used it for my little girl&#x27;s fleece outfits. This shaver took all the lint off! I have not used it on thinner material.</li>
            <li> Does a decent job, not great but can&#x27;t find one better  for sofa pill balls&lt;br /&gt;Any reccomendations welcome</li>
            <li> Worked fairly well... until it made a whole in my favorite shirt.. :( But then my favorite shirt is quite old, so it was probably quite worn out already.</li>
            <li> Works great. Came in handy.</li>
            <li> i have a sweatshirt that started forming balls on it. i used this as instructed and. no more sweat shirt balls.</li>
            <li> Great product, as advertised, used it for little fabric balls on cloth chairs. Used it on 400 chairs and still going.</li>
            <li> The holes are too small to catch big lint pieces on sweaters</li>
            <li> My new FAVORITE tool to help me with my ebay sales. This makes the used clothing I sell look amazing. My first fabric shaver and I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on my cheap t-shirts, my sweaters, my favorite tank tops. I have even used it on rayon, and it has worked stunningly well. Makes my clothes look so much better--means I don&#x27;t have to buy new ones or get rid of the ones I have. Just read the instructions before you use it, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> The battery is consumed fast so be prepared to change them often. This product really accomplishes the purpose of removing the fuzz and pills.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully!  I de fuzzed and fuzz knots of a hoody.  The outside looks like new again and the inside is no longer scratchy.  I&#x27;ve used in on many other cloths,  even a athletic shirt I thought was through since outside of it had gone from smooth to fuzzy knot&#x27;s.  Not like new,  but at least I can still wear it and look nice.  Haven&#x27;t seen anything this little machine couldn&#x27;t fix within its intended use</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;twork very well battery lid wouldn&#x27;t stay on.used duck tape</li>
            <li> simple, easy to use, easy to clean out</li>
            <li> It does a good job at getting rid of the little fabric balls or pills or lint....but it doesnt last very long on the batteries. After I took the recovery lid off the first time it had a problem attaching after that so I have to keep it on with a piece of tape or the lid will pop off while you&#x27;re using it. The performance is great but the quality of the product isn&#x27;t. I paid about $8 for it and that&#x27;s about what it&#x27;s worth. I&#x27;m going to look for a different product in the near future.</li>
            <li> It works with some patience required - good use of time for a sedentary person - used a tweezers to get threads out of the head -</li>
            <li> This inexpensive option does a great job defuzzing sweaters.  So far, it has not made a hole and the batteries have lasted.</li>
            <li> Well, I don&#x27;t think this product works that well. I wish I did not buy it.</li>
            <li> This little shaver is awesome! It works great! I&#x27;ve used it on many different types of sweaters and shirts. It&#x27;s made them look like new again! I&#x27;m addicted! It&#x27;s only snagged once when I didn&#x27;t have the clothing item laying real flat. It fits really nicely in your hand and just requires 2 AA batteries which are easier to replace (since i usually have them lying around) than the C batteries that some shavers require.</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver saved a lot of my sweaters that I was planning on giving to charity because of the pills.</li>
            <li> I have only used this once and I am already impressed on the job it did. I am very excited about this product because I have a beautiful hounds tooth coat but I can&#x27;t wear it any more becuase of all the lint on it. Now I can wear it proudly.</li>
            <li> Great product!! I was looking for an inexpensive and portable product that can remove pillings from my clothes and the lining of my sneakers. This did the job! It left my clothes looking new and my sneakers as if I hadnt worn them! Definitely recommend this product to anyone! The only con was that it didn&#x27;t include the(2)AA batteries it requires to run.</li>
            <li> I love this thing! It was so incredibly cheap, yet it works extremely well. The blade moves a lot quicker than I expected and it has more power than I expected. It is super easy to clean out and to use. My couch looks so much better thanks to this little shaver!</li>
            <li> Having just bought this item, I have now revitalized a favorite sport coat and a great sweater.  I had another brand of this item and it never really worked properly, so I was a bit skeptical when I saw this one, but the old one had broken a long time ago and things were, well, pilling up all over the place.  After a few minutes of this handy gadget, my sport coat and sweaters looked like new.  Well, mostly.  It&#x27;s easy to use, feels good in your hand, and zips right along.  Altogether a great product that does exactly what it should, and does it very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this after trying many other cheap ones, and for the  price, it works great and much better than my other old ones. For small amounts of pilling on fabric it is perfect, for larger, tougher amounts is not so bad. The only device which I have that does better costs about 10 times more, and is not portable. So overall a good buy for the price and does the job.</li>
            <li> This thing is a bit &amp;#34;addictive&amp;#34; to use... it&#x27;s so satisfying to see all the &amp;#34;pilling&amp;#34; come off into the compartment that catches the fluff. The device also makes a satisfying noise as you run it over your garment. The one complaint I&#x27;ve got about this thing (and it could be entirely related to the fact that it came flying out of the package when I first opened it and hit the floor) -- the cover doesn&#x27;t stay on tight enough.</li>
            <li> This is a small shaver and it doesn&#x27;t feel very high quality, but it works well. I&#x27;ve had it for a while and it still works great - makes my sweaters look clean and new! It&#x27;s easy to use and empty.</li>
            <li> Nice, small, easy to use. The shaver is pretty gentle, a little noisy. It works best on thickish fabric. T-shirt thin fabric is likely to get sucked in a little and make a hole, although it can be done if you are SUPER careful and pull the fabric very tight. This shaver is best for jackets and other heavier materials. I wouldn&#x27;t use it on anything thin and valuable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requires 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li> This little device gets the job done and gets all the little fuzzies I don&#x27;t want on my sweaters.  I have used it on at least 7 sweaters so far and it&#x27;s still going strong!  It also packs easily for traveling.</li>
            <li> GREAT fabric shaver! I got it to remove the pilling from our sofa. Works great!!! Sofa looks like new!</li>
            <li> I bought the shaver about year ago. I works perfect. Shaving quality is good and one pair of Duracell Alkaline batteries last for four months.</li>
            <li> As other-nothing special, peeling sweater took me .I have no idea ...... forever ;)&lt;br /&gt;. it work for someone who is bored... I think that&#x27;s okey but I advise not to try on thin fabrics - unless you like Wear clothes with holes,,,, :)</li>
            <li> I Love it! This lint shaver is an amazing find for a great price. Its simple to use and it&#x27;s very effective.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve used so far. It&#x27;s a small on the go device that really shaves your clothes and makes it look brand new. It works better on socks and wool. Definitely a must get!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is pretty much awesome.  I knew these things existed (sweater shavers I mean), but continued to handpick off sweater pills.. until.. I bought this.  I&#x27;v had pretty much waaay too much fun &#x27;shaving&#x27; all my sweaters (I really like sweaters).  The directions included address the issue about fabric type, etc.. So I&#x27;m not totally sure why some reviewers are having issues with damaging their clothing.  I&#x27;ve used this on a variety of knits/fabrics, and while a bit more care is needed when using this shaver on raised details (such as cabling), or thinner fabrics, I never felt as though I were in danger of damaging the fabric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have an incident when I nicked one of the yarn threads on a knit sweater, and had to patch/reinforce that spot to prevent unraveling, just using a bit of hand threading.  But that&#x27;s just because I was being a bit overzealous.  The directions say not to push down, and to simply allow the pressure to come from the weight of the device (to prevent damage), and I wasn&#x27;t doing that.. again, it all comes back to following the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yeah, it does exactly what it advertises.</li>
            <li> Works great! Cleaned up my new ottoman beautifully.</li>
            <li> I accidentally had a wash cloth in the load with my slacks.  Two of the slacks had a few fuzz balls but one pair had so many I was just going to throw them away.  There were so many that from a distance the slacks looked like they were polka dotted - so evenly placed were the fuzz balls over the entire garment.  As soon as this product arrived I tried it on those pants.  I figured if it ruined them (as some feed back indicated the suction was too strong) I would not be upset since as they were they were ruined already.  I&#x27;m pleased to say that this producye worked very well.  It took some time but I was able to get all the fuzz balls off the pants and they look as good as new.  I defintely would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed with this fabric shaver. It barely does anything. I&#x27;ve tried using it on several different types of fabrics with the same result each time- the fuzz remains.</li>
            <li> Love this thing!  It is definitely cheap, however does the job!  I mean how often do you need to shave lint?  Highly recommended and the price is RIGHT, Bob!</li>
            <li> Tough little shaver. Cleans up sweaters nicely. Wish I had purchased 2. Great size to pack in your suitcase or overnight bag.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would work great and it doesn&#x27;t. I bought a little more expensive one and that works much better.</li>
            <li> Does a wonderful job a cleaning any of clothing.  It&#x27;s quick.  Does a job that make one&#x27;s clothing look great.</li>
            <li> Would buy again.  Simple, easy to use and intuitive.  Clearing lint is easy.  And that is all I can write.</li>
            <li> It works as expected. I have defuzzed lots of things and have not had one problem. It is lightweight, compact, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works well, easy to use</li>
            <li> Works like a charm in removing pilling from clothing or bedsheets</li>
            <li> Does the trick but you have to press down really hard to get rid of the pilling</li>
            <li> Excellent Product !!!</li>
            <li> Good product. Used it on both light and heavy material. For lighter material you need to exert less pressure on the machine. Gently pass it across. This machine picks up lint and dust as well. I can safely say is collects 99% of lint on my clothes.</li>
            <li> Useful product, but I find the cover where the lint stores comes off too easily and doesn&#x27;t do quite as good a job as the previous one I had</li>
            <li> Works fine.  Reasonably powerful</li>
            <li> Eats away all the fuzz!  Great product and packs a punch for such a small device.</li>
            <li> metal cover broke after 1 week, now blades don&#x27;t move</li>
            <li> This is great for removing pills from clothing, pillows, etc.</li>
            <li> Excellent tool for removing pills and fuzz quickly.  It saved me from having to reknit a baby blanket.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister who asked for one for her birthday, so there isn&#x27;t much I can say about it since I left it in it&#x27;s original packaging so that I can wrap it.</li>
            <li> I loved this shaver. People are right if you push too hard you can damage fragile or thin fabrics but for the most part its really just awesome. I made so many beloved sweaters wearable again. My old roomate kept playng with it with the cage off and eventually broke it but I don&#x27;t think this would happen with normal use. I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> This is the best product. I bought one and I am so glad I did! Super easy to use and helpful when you need it.I have gifted this for little &amp;#34;happies&amp;#34; to other family member or as stocking stuffers. This is just nice to have, easy to empty and use!</li>
            <li> Up to now I&#x27;ve been using an old disposable razor to take off those little pills on sweatshirts etc., but always seemed to get a cut in the fabric if I wasn&#x27;t too careful. With this screen on the head, no problem, &amp; it makes a cutting noise over the hum so you know when it&#x27;s hit a pill. You&#x27;ll be surprised how much lint accumulates in the storage area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;d change on this unit is making the battery compartment cover click closed better &amp; the lint trap can come off easily, but those are little things considering how good this thing works.</li>
            <li> This shaver doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Even if I press hard, nothing happens.  It&#x27;s worthless.  Also the battery compartment is poorly designed.</li>
            <li> this product met every expectations. perfect little tool to shave away those little lints that form on clothes. I washed some of my delicate fabrics with other clothes and got these annoying balls of lints of them. Realized its impossible to pick every one of em by hand i ordered this handy little tool and i LOVE it. i just hope it doesnt break down and stop working on me. I am considering purchasing one more to keep it in stock. not to mention very low price. I went to bedbathandbeyond and something similar was $14~20. ordered this on amazon instead.  hope this review helps.</li>
            <li> I started using this shaver right after taking it out of the box with new batteries. I got thru one sweater fine (and cleaned the shavings out of the bin) then half way thru the next sweater it slowed down and stopped. I was surprised, and thought maybe it just uses batteries up quickly. So I put new batteries in, and cleaned out the small amount of shavings from the bin again, and the little thing wouldn&#x27;t turn on again. I recommend not using this product. I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my older Remington fabric shaver gave out. This one works as described but it feels weird in your hand. The clear lint &#x60;reservoir can slip off when your moving around and it doesn&#x27;t hold as much as my older one. The battery compartment which is located on the opposite side also slips off on occasion. The power switch also feels odd when turning on as well. I wish Remington would go back to the older L shape design. It was better overall fit than this one.</li>
            <li> too small, need a shaver for the wonderful pills that pop up on some of our clothing, this is not the one that will remove them</li>
            <li> This shaver chews up the fabric balls on your well, It makes your clothing look like new in just a snap!</li>
            <li> I have been meaning to buy a fabric shaver for a while, and with some of my favorite clothes getting a little worn-looking, it was time. I bought the Remington shaver, and it is perfect! It took all the little balls of fabric and lint off my dresses (and even my bra straps), and didn&#x27;t tear up the fabric at all. The garments look like new! Super quick, powerful, easy, and a great price. Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this fabric shaver and it did not work for very long, I tried to shave some fuzz off of my clothing and it hardly did the job then a short time after purchase it stopped working so I thought the battery had died so I changed it but it still did not work.  I felt very cheated.  I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Shaves NOTHING off of my sweaters. Complete waste of money. I&#x27;m better off using my DeFuzzIt that I&#x27;ve had for 30 years.</li>
            <li> The blades hit the cover and broke a spot in it making it impossible to shave without tearing the fabric.</li>
            <li> Just like one I had many years ago. Works very well. I would recommend it to anyone to use on clothing.</li>
            <li> nice fabric shaver, at very reasonable price</li>
            <li> My old one wore out so I needed a new one- its great!</li>
            <li> I love this thing! User friendly and shows results immediately. Excellent value too! Would make a great stocking stuffer</li>
            <li> Worked well!  Have been using it.</li>
            <li> Over the holidays my husband and I hosted a Christmas party where many sweaters were worn. Somehow the subject of how frustrating balls on your sweater can be came up and I broke out this bad boy. Pretty soon everyone was passing this around and shaving their sweaters, asking where I got it, and exclaiming how awesome it was. At the end of the party everyone had ball-less sweaters. It was both ridiculous and entertaining. 10/10 would buy again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this sweater shaver after years of not getting one for fear of it destroying clothing. Then I read a column about cleaning tips, and the writer recommended a shaver over any other type of device people use for getting pills off of sweaters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is great. It works well, hasn&#x27;t destroyed any clothing, and has brought several sweaters back into rotation since they look so much better after a quick shave (a few pairs of socks, too!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things which are pretty minor considering the price. First, make sure you take off the clear cap on the shaver before using. It&#x27;s nearly invisible and has made me think on several occasions that it isn&#x27;t working. Second, the lint catcher/holder comes off a little too easily when being handled. Again, two minor things that haven&#x27;t stopped me from loving this thing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to rehash all the great reviews out there by trying to give the same information. I want to focus on saving $$$$ with an item like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already read the reviews about how this shaver extends the life of clothing by making it look new again, thereby allowing you to get more years out of your current clothing and thus saving money. I couldn&#x27;t agree more. I keep getting new life out of my sweaters every season with just a little help from this gadget. Obvious money saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I can think of 3 additional ways this has saved me money:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrift store shopping: I can buy items that have fabric pills on them (that no one else would buy, and that have made it to clearance) and make them look fantastic. So I save money by purchasing clothing at thrift stores that can still be &amp;#34;redeemed&amp;#34; from the ash heap of used clothing. Cha-ching!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can buy &amp;#34;lesser brands&amp;#34; in some cases at retail stores, and this shaver keeps the clothing looking as good as the high end name brands. SAVINGS! For example, I bought my 7 year old several pairs of store brand athletic pants made of 100% polyester. From constant wear, they started to get &amp;#34;boogered up&amp;#34;, as my husband would say. My 7 year old also has a high end, name brand hoodie made out of the same fabric. Because it&#x27;s higher quality, though, it hasn&#x27;t pilled yet. It&#x27;s still as smooth as glass. When I pulled out my shaver on the pants, I cleaned them up in no time, they were as smooth as a silk, and they looked just as new as the name brand hoodie. Pre-shaving, they looked like something you&#x27;d buy at a thrift store...you know, like the kind I mentioned above that no one else would buy. Unless they knew about this little miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, when the kiddos outgrow clothing, I can make some items look new again if they&#x27;re not stained or otherwise damaged. Take the shaver for a quick spin over the clothing (like the pants mentioned above) and they can easily be sold on ebay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There you have it. For all you frugal folks, the investment in this shaver is nothing compared to the $$$ it can save.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I was totally confused.  So, as they were inexpensive, I bought 2 different ones.  The other one was a charcoal block from the Vermont Country Store that someone said did the best job.  I&#x27;m inclined to agree.  The charcoal made a bit of a mess at first; then it settled down.  I have to say I haven&#x27;t used this electric one enough to comment but it isn&#x27;t terribly powerful--because you wouldn&#x27;t want it too powerful.  It would be good for traveling, though.  After I&#x27;ve used it more I will try to comment again.</li>
            <li> Works great. However... It small. Only works on small areas and takes forever on a sweater. Also, it can snag. It has snagged several times and put holes in my sweaters. Best on less delicate items. Not worth it. Hoping to find something bigger that wont snag in the future.</li>
            <li> Bought this fabric shaver to remove balls or &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; from sweaters.  Works fantastic and makes sweaters look like new.  Have uses Lava rocks or other pumice stones but they make the sweater look furry.  Lint rollers just can&#x27;t pull the &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; off.  This shaver took the pills off and didn&#x27;t damage the sweater.</li>
            <li> Best $4.99 I&#x27;ve spent in a long time. This thing makes my favorite old sweaters new again. I wish the reservoir held more than it does, but it is what it is, and it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> It works great and fits in my purse/ desk drawer. Helps keep all my sweaters and tops looking brand new by shaving off fabric pills. No complaints.</li>
            <li> This product was the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever bought on Amazon. It broke the day I got it after 2 minutes of use and is now completely unuseable. I didn&#x27;t expect much from a $6 lint remover but I still expected it to work longer than that! The part that touches the fabric is extremely fragile and will break if you put very minimal pressure on it. I would recommend getting a better quality product.</li>
            <li> So this item kind of works. It shaves some off but not all and you&#x27;ll have to do it often.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item and a D-Fuzz-It Comb to compare which one worked best. BY FAR this product works the best! It can even be used on sweaters with raised patterns in the weavings. My sweaters look like new!</li>
            <li> Works great. If it stops working remove the top cover and take the fuzz out of the end where the fan blade is and you are set to go. I thought it was broke after a short time or the batteries went bad fast, but the fuzz in there is the problem. There is also an additional area made for the fuzz to go ino that you will have to empty. Works wonderful on winter coats</li>
            <li> The quality is very good.&lt;br /&gt;Its size is convenient and easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;Very affordable in terms of price.&lt;br /&gt;Durable battery life.&lt;br /&gt;A life savor little gadget :-)</li>
            <li> First, I must say I have been nothing but pleased with my Amazon purchases. This item is the exception. I just received it. I took it to my den and read the instructions carefully. I inserted 2 new alklaline batteries per instructions. I turned it on, and it operated for less than 5 seconds. After it stopped working, I removed the batteries and checked them so I could be sure I had installed them properly. I just couldn&#x27;t get it work. This is just another item of cheap Chinese junk. It seems we are importing more and more merchandise from China, and all the while Americans are losing their jobs because of it. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> As soo as we got this in the mail, my wife started shaving everything... starting with the T shirt she was wearing. It&#x27;s an EXCELLENT product and does everything it says it will do for an AMAZING price!!!!</li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;m usually a woman of many words, but I don&#x27;t have much to say about this fabulous little fabric shaver.  :)  It&#x27;s small, compact, and powerful.  Our clothes look brand new.  And for $6.00, you just can&#x27;t beat it.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone considering buying it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This thing is perfect. It gets the job done. Very compact and efficient. It roomed all the balls from my sweaters.</li>
            <li> Amazing little tool. Removes peals from clothing great.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Completely satisfied with purchase.  Excellent for sweaters and any other fuzz ball making clothing. Great price vs value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for over a year and it is working great so far. I still haven&#x27;t changed the battery yet! I use it approximately once a week.</li>
            <li> Absolute crap.  It either shreds my clothes or does nothing at all.  I really wish I&#x27;d kept the packaging to return this junk.</li>
            <li> Did practically nothing. Not worth it. You can tell this is a cheap product &amp; I haven&#x27;t used it more than 2 times since the many months I owned it</li>
            <li> It does a good job at shaving off fabric pills and lint. The clear lint trap where the shavings go comes off so easily. Really, how hard would it be to make that part more secure? Maybe it&#x27;s just my particular piece?</li>
            <li> I ordered this item based on it&#x27;s reviews, but when i received it it was much smaller than I thought it would be. It&#x27;s shaving area is the size of a quarter, so keep that in mind if you will be using this for adult clothing. It&#x27;s perfect size for baby clothes though. I guess I will be using this on my son&#x27;s clothes, but need to find one with a bigger surface area for me. Shaves pretty well for it&#x27;s size (although the larger ones I&#x27;ve owned shave better).</li>
            <li> I run a small resale eBay business, and my biggest sellers are cashmere sweaters. The thrift shop I shop at for resale items always has cashmere for $2 or $3, but l always had to pass them up because of pilling. Now I can buy them, spend 2 minutes with this cleaning them up, and they look brand new and sell for $30-$40!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great investment!</li>
            <li> This does everything it says. I do wish it was a little bigger just so it would go faster but it is very convient for travel. It really doesn&#x27;t take long to do a shirt though. Very impressed with this.</li>
            <li> I used this shaver on a fleece jacket and it did a great job removing the fuzz balls.  I placed the jacket on a hard surface and followed the instructions.  The device quickly clipped the fuzz balls and it left behind a clean, smooth surface.  I was careful to not apply too much pressure.  My jacket looks brand new now.</li>
            <li> This little shaver does the trick. I have some clothes (blouses, especially) that I&#x27;ve owned for 5+ years and look fine aside from the pilling that comes with age. Using this guy, they&#x27;re like new. It&#x27;s quick and thorough.    Two things to note:  - I do wish it were bigger. It takes quite some time to completely shave a top. For the price I paid, though, this is hardly worth complaining about.  - Be sure to lay your clothes out on a flat surface when you use this. I was lazy and tried to shave a spot on a shirt that I was wearing. The shirt was extremely thin cotton, and since it wasn&#x27;t flat it snagged and the shaver sliced a hole in the shirt. Totally my fault, but a caution to others who might buy and use this.</li>
            <li> My dress pants and sweaters often get pills on them and I was looking for a way to stretch the life of my clothes. This little guy is great! Shaves off the extra pilling in seconds. It&#x27;s very loud though, but gets the job done!</li>
            <li> This little device is powerful - easy to use and very effective.  I love that my sweaters and hats look like new! I had a beloved 20+ year old knitted hat that now looks close to the day I received it.</li>
            <li> Operated better than expected. Cleaned all my wife´s gym clothes that had accumulated lint balls in about 5 minutes.  Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I was wary of using this product, but given Amazon&#x27;s great return policy &amp; the low price, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. In my experience it works great for removing pills/balls from sweaters, hats, gloves, &amp; other knits. I was afraid that the razors might cut holes in my favorite sweaters - if you&#x27;re scared at first, I&#x27;d recommend that you try it on an older sweater or a pair of socks/gloves first. I&#x27;ve used it with great results on fine-gauge cashmere and wool sweaters. I will say that cable knits &amp; chunkier/open-weave designs are trickier because it&#x27;s more likely that you&#x27;ll accidentally shave off a piece of yarn instead of a pill. You do have to empty the fuzz catching compartment after 1-3 sweaters, depending on the condition of the sweater &amp; the type of fabric (it filled up after 1 heavy wool sweater with lots of pilling, and again after 2 fine-gauge cashmere sweaters). Overall I&#x27;d recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This little shaver works great to remove small to large fuzzballs from clothes and makes them look almost new.  I was surprised at its power and ability to avoid \\&quot;stalls\\&quot; on heavy fuzz.  Only minor issue is that when used vertically with the shaver head down (as when clothes lie flat on a table), lint will back up in the head and is a little hard to get out, but not that hard if you take the head off.  Used horizontally or head up and the lint goes into the lint reservoir as it should.  Highly recommended !</li>
            <li> I have a couch and chair that \\&quot;pill\\&quot; every few months and this device does a great job trimming those.  You just run it over the fabric a few times and it shaves off the threads that have balled up.  The shavings are trapped inside a little compartment and you pull that off to empty it.  It&#x27;s very handy.</li>
            <li> This was an impulse buy--I was searching for ways to de-pill clothing and found this link and bought it right away because of the cheap price. I figured if it was a dud, it wasn&#x27;t much money lost. I was more than surprised by the quality of this item. It works PERFECTLY. It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to use, and best of all, it makes my fuzzy sweaters look like new. My friend had given me a sweater that I knew she didn&#x27;t want because it was looking a little ratty... less than five minutes with the Fabric Shaver and the sweater looks brand new--my friend&#x27;s loss! I&#x27;ve tried it out on old pants, even a pair of underwear that had pilled in the dryer. There is no damage to the fabric at all. I don&#x27;t know how it works, it just does!  The clear part that holds the shavings is easy to remove, but one tip: empty it before it gets full. Depending on the type of fabric you are de-fuzzing, it can back up quickly and clog the blades at the top. Fortunately, even the head can be removed and replaced easily, so cleaning it out wasn&#x27;t a problem. I love this purchase and recommend it to anyone--we&#x27;ve all got fuzzies that need to be gone somewhere.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to get pills of of a non-wool pea coat that I own.  It worked wonders on it.  It doesn&#x27;t have a ton of power, and I&#x27;m glad it doesn&#x27;t since it would probably tear up my clothes if it did.  So, it may get stuck depending on what you&#x27;re going over, though that may be a good reason if it stops it from taking off too much.  It&#x27;s easy to clean out, and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing.  I bought two.  I have \\&quot;shaved\\&quot; my favorite dark red sweater so that now I can actually wear it out in public again.  Honest to goodness it was worth the price just to save that one sweater and I have others.  I particularly like the fact that this little magic shaver has larger holes in the head as I think another reviewer mentioned and that allows it to gather more of the fuzzy stuff and pills.  It also has a separate compartment to collect and dispose of the lint unlike the old ones which you just opened up and it fell out.  This one is separate and you dump it out where you want it to go.  I highly recommend this little \\&quot;magic shaver.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I received this product as a gift that I had put on my wishlist and I cannot be more grateful! It works amazing!! I love it! It took all the little pills off of my sheets and sweaters! I would recommend this product for everyone to use!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! IT SAVED MANY CLOTHES I WAS THINKING TO THROW AWAY INSTEAD AFTER I USED IT THEY BECAME LIKE NEW! :)</li>
            <li> Works well however it is impossible to keep the battery backing on the device and the lint builds up in the top instead of filtering down into the clear compartment</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and broke after 2 days of use.They seek them at walgreens  for cheaper with a bigger head</li>
            <li> I bought this just a month ago and now it slow and it gets clogged all the time. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works great. Was a little nervous about purchasing due to bad reviews, but I needed one, and went ahead and purchased it. Haven&#x27;t had a problem with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;You do have to be careful to make sure there isn&#x27;t a thread sticking out of your item, it will pull it and\or cut it, as any item that removes particles from clothing would, causing damage to clothing item, but that&#x27;s not the products fault. Just be careful.</li>
            <li> For the price, it does what it suppose to do.. But, it looks too cheaply made...the plastics seems well off the standards...</li>
            <li> Works well, easy to use</li>
            <li> This shaver is small, cheap, and does the job.  It&#x27;s restored a couple pairs of shorts that started to pill, a number of shirts, and even my Egyptian Cotton bedsheets that had minor pilling in one small section.  Love this little shaver.</li>
            <li> Winter sweaters and jackets always get &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; and this is the perfect way to get rid of them. Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> It just putters out every 3 seconds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d loving  my brand new  lint and pill remover is wrong I don&#x27;t want to be right! Works so well I literally  started  hunting for  other clothing items to &amp;#34;de-pill&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> No more pills on my knits.</li>
            <li> Love this thing!  Update: after five years mine died. I&#x27;m buying a new one because it still so great love this thing</li>
            <li> Seems like a good little clothes shaver, although I did try it on a few of my thinner shirts and ended up getting holes in them. I am assuming it was user error; I probably pressed too hard or didn&#x27;t lay them flat enough -- it was my first try using it. Other than that, it&#x27;s awesome to see all the little balls of fabric that get collected after you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Use on any fuzz!</li>
            <li> This little shaver is great , Very handy, Though it takes couple of your minutes but does it job quite fairly.</li>
            <li> I love my crate and barrel couch but the fabric after a couple months started pilling up. This little guy does the trick to clear that right up.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, battery powered so it loses power quickly.  Doesn&#x27;t effect the product, but something to keep in mind.</li>
            <li> The shaver works, but the metal cover (that comes in contact with the clothes) now has big holes. It got chipped after I used the product to shave a fleece pajama. Without the cover, the shaver is useless because the blades alone will not help. So now have to buy another one!! I expected it to last longer - I used the shaver less than 3-4 times on sweaters.</li>
            <li> I had some nice sweaters and even a Patagonia &#x27;better sweater&#x27; that were saved by this little fabric shaver. You might be surprised at the things you&#x27;ll use this on. A chair cushion? Yes.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it had the highest ratings, but was worried about the hole issue that some people experienced. Well I used it today on a rayon sweater that is pretty thin, and didn&#x27;t experience the hole-making problem that others had. I think the reason people got holes using this product is if they pushed too forcefully when using this to shave off lint. The best thing to do is to lightly and quickly run this shaver over the clothing and just make multiple passes to get the lint off. It works well and was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Bought one for myself to try and salvage a North Face pullover that &amp;#34;pilled up&amp;#34; pretty badly despite following the washing instructions.  Worked great without a lot of effort, jacket looks good again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it on a couple of older sweaters with same success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It happened to be a featured &amp;#34;Add-On&amp;#34; so I bought 2 more as gifts.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love this product.  It&#x27;s really small so de-pilling takes a long time plus it isn&#x27;t very sharp so doesn&#x27;t work on medium or heavy-weight sweaters. It&#x27;s going back.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver.  It is small but mighty. I have used this shaver on alot of things and it is as good as new.  I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought it and tried on my sweaters. Although, I was very careful, it made a hole in my new thin sweater - very noticeable.. I was so disappointed. Plus, whenever you use it on your knits, it leaves an invisible trace of shaved off lint, which you don&#x27;t see, until you wear the item. Then it gets all over you and the other clothing you are wearing.</li>
            <li> Metal cover broke after about 5 uses. CHEAP, cheap, cheap.</li>
            <li> Bought two of these!  They work fine and really spiffy-ed up my wardrobe and some of my furniture also!  My daughter loves Hers!</li>
            <li> Works well. Suits its purpose.</li>
            <li> This is the best invention ever. I love it.</li>
            <li> This thing is cool fixes my nasty pilled sweater and made it beautiful again</li>
            <li> Just as good as the stone, but faster</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work.  It takes a little bit off, but clothing is not much better than where you started.</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver does a fairly good job but isn&#x27;t really powerful enough to get off the big pills on a sweater.  I ended up having to cut those off with a scissors.  It works if your sweater isn&#x27;t in really bad shape yet.</li>
            <li> Died after 2 weeks of having it. Used twice, new batteries, tried to use 2 weeks later and wouldn&#x27;t turn on. Changed batteries, and product was no longer useful. The fabric lint catcher comes off easily.</li>
            <li> Perfect for keeping clothes looking new!</li>
            <li> Product was defective upon arrival, did not function at all. Was very disappointed. Thought I would get a good product with all the positive reviews. Remington (located in Canada) was not much help.</li>
            <li> It works as expected. The balls are gone. It took me about 20 mins to shave my sheets but they are worthed.</li>
            <li> Omg this is awesome, I think I have shaved almost every outfit I own and this little fabric shaver does wonders on you clothing, I am absolutely addicted to this shaver, it may be small but contains plenty of power, my clothes look new again and I love my little fabric shaver...thk you again 💚</li>
            <li> does exactly what I thought it would do.  great for shaving all those little balls off your sweater and other clothing.  makes them look like new again.</li>
            <li> I like it! it&#x27;s quite powerful, stronger than I expected. And it&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
            <li> This little shaver works great to remove fuzz and pills.  We have used it on furniture and sweaters and it really has improved their appearances</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know this product is good or not. However, my wife says to me that this is so convenient.</li>
            <li> I love this fabric shaver. It has resurrected many of my sweaters, gloves, and wool coats from the closet. It&#x27;s light, trims effectively, easy to empty. It clogs up with wool fibers quickly though, but you can unscrew the top (the blue ring) and remove the perforated metal shield, and pick the wool balls with tweezers. It&#x27;s easy to clean, but it&#x27;d be perfect if it didn&#x27;t clog that often!</li>
            <li> It works but it takes a long time. It feels really weak. I guess if it were stronger, it could ruin the fabric.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Works well. I used it on a wool sweater and it did a good job. No problems.</li>
            <li> What I got doesn&#x27;t look like the product shown, regardless i wasted more money on figuring out what the lint remover i have uses as a battery source.</li>
            <li> I have a larger clothes shaver that does not work nearly so well as this item. I have a couple of pairs of pants that I love but they pill up in the wash. This little baby makes them very smooth and presentable again. Other reviewers commented on the catch tray and battery covers coming off more easily than desirable and I agree. But still I love it.</li>
            <li> Work like a charm so glad I got this great for my sweaters and hats.MY sweaters look like new once i use my lint shaver</li>
            <li> It ate my clothes. Sucked the material right into it and made a hole and I hardly put any pressure on it at all. Use with care and think twice if it&#x27;s something you love or want to ever wear again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few fabric shavers from different companies. They all sucked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is amazing. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked soooo well I had to order another for a friend who was stealing it on me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wish the head was a bit bigger so you could cover more clothing in less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: Superb. Bought multiple for myself. Great gift or stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect this machine to be so easy and useful. My old bed was full of pills and though it did take some time to clean it out, the result was fabulous! I then tried it on some old t-shirts and again, they looked like new! The batteries lasted for clearing the entire bed and still going strong. Thank you Remington for this excellent product.</li>
            <li> very happy i purchased this.  I remember when they were popular YEARS ago and a couch I recently purchased started getting the fuzz balls on it.  I found this and bought it and my couches look brand new again.  Very happy!  I only gave it 4 stars b/c it doesn&#x27;t seem that sturdy so not sure how long it will last.  But it was so inexpensive as long as it lasts a little while I will be OK.</li>
            <li> Very good to get rid of fuzz on your sweaters or old clothes. I&#x27;m glad I finally bought it. Good deal.</li>
            <li> This is a great little fabric shaver, I&#x27;ve had mine now for over a year and it still works great. I love having this thing around, no more ruined clothes!</li>
            <li> I must say it works really well at getting all the little fuzzies off. It takes a lot longer for a wooly sweater, but it works. I&#x27;ve already burnt out the batteries, but it has been worth it!  Yay for not having to buy too many new maternity clothes!</li>
            <li> Small but works well. Shipping was fast and product was as described. Would be good to travel with if needed because of the small size.</li>
            <li> is the best item to have</li>
            <li> Works great! You need to be a little careful when using it, making sure whatever you are using it on it perfectly flat so it doesn&#x27;t get chewed up, but I&#x27;m a little careless with it and have only gotten a hole in one garment and have used it countless times.</li>
            <li> I was so very excited about using this, and it worked great for about an hour, but then I noticed it started to snag on my clothes and that the metal screen had actually started to crack. I wasn&#x27;t being rough with it, I&#x27;m so disappointed!</li>
            <li> For the money it is worth it.  Had several merino wool sweaters that looked to bad to wear.  Shaver is not fast, probably 15 to 20 min/ sweater but did clean them up to nearly looking like new.  Does require unscrewing the head ever few minutes to clean out under the blades ans well as emptying the collector compartment every 5 min.  It is definitely not a precision instrument but for 6 bucks with shipping it does the job and how often do you need to use it anyway?</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I do a lot of sweater shaving, so I have to take out the blades to clear the space out quite often, but this is a small price to pay.  Cheaper versions do not cut it, if you&#x27;ll pardon the pun.</li>
            <li> I love these! My sister bought them and I just had to have one myself! It is soooo useful! makes a old fuzzy looking shirt looks new again!</li>
            <li> This replaces one that was damaged when my granddaughter played with it.  This product works well to remove pills.</li>
            <li> I think this was a waste of my money. Maybe I just need an industrial size shaver for my needs. It works for small items and for clothes that don&#x27;t have a lot of pilling. I purchased this to try and remove pilling from a favorite jacket. While it looked a little better, I still couldn&#x27;t remove all the pilling.</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver is perfect for removing pulls and fuzzies, and sprucing up my clothes!</li>
            <li> It does the job decently, just be sure to empty it frequently to not clog up the blades.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it definitely removes those pesky lint balls, but be careful...has a tendency to get caught up in the material if your moving too fast or your clothing isnt totally flat while using it.</li>
            <li> I have searched a long time, tried MANY products and lost many sweaters and other items because of the lintball al over..&lt;br /&gt;  This little unit works GREAT!!! My problem is solved and I no longer have to look, I will buy one for all my children</li>
            <li> This little guy broke after a few uses.  The metal top just chipped away.  :(  I was disappointed but it was pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> This product works very well and seems to be made durable.  I was very impressed with the lint it picked up with the first swipe.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. Didn&#x27;t take off any of the pills I was hoping to remove. Very weak. No good for sweaters that&#x27;s for sure. Maybe this product is meant for cotton fabrics??? Complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li> so i got this because i didn&#x27;t want to risk taking a blade to my northface jacket and this seems to work but nothing could be used to fix a northface jacket after it&#x27;s been washed. anyways it works and used on certain cloth it might be useful but not for what i bought it for. also i think it&#x27;s kinda convenient since it&#x27;s small and could fit it into my hand or bag to take anywhere and no charging so no need for extra stuff to keep up with!</li>
            <li> It does a great job! Helped my blazers look a lot newer and better!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after buying some fleece sweater jackets and an acrylic sweater (fine knit) from Blair. It did a very good cropping on the acrylic sweater and fairly good (left a few little pills that are not very visible) on the fleece sweater jackets. I&#x27;m very glad that I bought it and think I&#x27;ll just avoid fleece clothing in the future. The lint chamber is small and needs to be emptied frequently--instructions say it should not ever be more than 3/4 full. It&#x27;s easy to empty. The head also unscrews, the blade comes out, and you can clean the build-up on the inside of the head.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews here, I was a little wary that using this fabric shaver would leave a hole in my garment. But, I ventured ahead using it on my Ralph Lauren Black Label Angora Sweater anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very powerful shaver with a decent amount of suction. The key is to not let the shaver touch the fabric. Keep it one half inch or so away and it should still grip the pilled knots without sucking in the healthy fabric. Again, a little caution and patience is key. But it was very easy to use and made my sweater look like new again. It has an easy access battery compartment and fabric collector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good purchase for the money. I hope this item lasts me for years. It is travel size but who travels with a fabric shaver? People who wear a lot more wool than me? I&#x27;m really not sure who would take this on a plane. Anyway, don&#x27;t store the batteries in it, and I think it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Product does not work very well. The suction power and cutting is minimal. I.ve used other brands and they worked much better, guess i have keep looking for a better one</li>
            <li> This product broke the very first time I used it.  I used it on a really fuzzy baby blanket.  After I&#x27;d done about a foot of fabric I looked at it and noticed the metal part that touches the fabric was broken, and the sharp parts kept getting caught on the fabric.  I opened it and discovered that it only had 2 blades instead of 3.  I don&#x27;t know if I just got a defect or what.  I looked everywhere for the third blade and it was nowhere to be found.  I am extremely disappointed, and I can&#x27;t return it because I already threw away the packaging.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for every home . I am amazed by the way it cleans up the fuzz on clothes and renders them new looking. Have been using it for Three weeks now and it is holding good.&lt;br /&gt;Good build. Uses 2 AA batteries. All in all recommended</li>
            <li> REMOVED FROM PACKAGE, PUT IN 2 NEW BATTERIES AND NOTHING.  BRAND NEW AND WON&#x27;T WORK.  LINT TRAP COVER KEPT FALLING OFF.  I AM RETURNING AND LOOKING ELSEWHERE FOR A FABIC SHAVER. WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK, BUT WHEN MADE IN CHINA WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU EXPECT.  I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER. BRING BACK AMERICAN MADE</li>
            <li> My headboard on my bed is fabric and had accumulated little fabric balls with this thing they were gone with no problem definitely gets the job done</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other fabric shavers before and expected the same so-so quality I&#x27;d seen. But this is quieter, smaller, good design - and most importantly - it gets rid of pilling.</li>
            <li> Nice and small, making it easily portable, but it does a great job getting all the fuzz off. I use this a lot and the batteries last a while also.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this shavers performance. Went out of town &amp; took it with me to spruce up the sweaters I had planned on wearing. It worked beautifully</li>
            <li> I got a better on at a cheaper price. Thsi one works ok, thoukgh</li>
            <li> Is working like a charm as I expected it to so wouldn&#x27;t hesitate ordering another one.</li>
            <li> If you get it too close to the fabric, it&#x27;ll cut it. :-(</li>
            <li> just careful using it on thin fabric.</li>
            <li> Honestly I bought one of these for $1 at Target a couple of years ago and it worked better than this. At least I remember these working much better.</li>
            <li> Lint, pills, gone! I love this item, works very well on all my sweats, shorts and shirts.</li>
            <li> we love it use it alot</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product and saw it isn&#x27;t good for lightweight materials but I bought it anyways. I should have headed the warning! It ripped a small hole in my thin wrap. I figured I pushed too hard and tried on another, thicker cotton shirt. BAM ripped a big hole in the shirt. After that I returned it, because even though it worked for a bit, I was afraid of the risk of ruining more tops.</li>
            <li> I have looked for a long time for a good one. I am very pleased. I would definetly buy again.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product to remove those small lint dots that accumulate on clothes, especially cardigans, after multiple washings.  This didn&#x27;t really do the trick.  In fact, it didn&#x27;t do anything.  I only tried it for a minute or so, but gave up.  I felt like it was just making noise instead of removing lint.  Maybe someone more diligent with more patience will have more luck.</li>
            <li> It is a grate product that works perfect</li>
            <li> My husbands pea coat had a lot of fuzz on it from years of use.  This fabric shaver has it looking like new now.</li>
            <li> It worked as expected. Nice light weight and tucks away in your suitcase.</li>
            <li> This little device does exactly what it should, and quite effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you are frustrated with some minor imperfections in your sweater type garment this is the case when it comes in action.&lt;br /&gt;You can also see the results of your &amp;#34;deeds&amp;#34; in transparent window.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d fully recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, but it does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have defuzzed a few items, and the only issue I have had is a snag here and there.  But the motor stops when it snags, and the fabric pulled out both times without damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend using it on delicate items - the snagging may be disasterous.</li>
            <li> throw it in your night stand and it will always be there for a quick cleanup before you put that sweater on</li>
            <li> Works as you&#x27;d expect and removes the fuzz.</li>
            <li> So yeah, it&#x27;s a little cheap, but it works really good for the price.  It does the trick, I had a few &amp;#34;test worthy&amp;#34; pieces of clothing, and it blew threw them. It will get a little bogged down/clogged up, but all you have to do is clean it out, and it&#x27;s back to normal. 6$ vs 35$</li>
            <li> Love it!! Best $9 I ever spent!!</li>
            <li> Does the job that it was made for so the purchase was worth it.</li>
            <li> Better then I excepted for the price Loved it.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, even though it&#x27;s a small device with relatively little power</li>
            <li> The material is a bit cheapish, but it works.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk.  returned it today.</li>
            <li> This is the best value on a fabric shaver I have come across. Works well and is durable.</li>
            <li> Best for smooth fabric and you must shave slowly. Be careful when using on cashmere items as it may snag and you will have a nice hole. Be sure to lay your item as flat as possible. I take away 1 star for battery consumption.</li>
            <li> This is very poor quality compared to other fabric shaver&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve owned. It just tore a hole in a new sweater the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I would buy again! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this since it just works.  I use it on any type of clothing.  It also works great on snags or clothing damaged by the washer/dryer.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It&#x27;s very easy to use and does exactly what it promises to do.  Also, I travel for work and I love that it&#x27;s small enough to take with me.</li>
            <li> He really liked it. The fabric shaver was affordable and spruced up his old sweaters. Great little Christmas stocking stuffer. Cheers!</li>
            <li> So easy to use and does the job!  Bought this to use on my crate and barrel couch and it pretty much saved it!  Started to hate sitting on my couch because the pilling would rub on my skin, but now it&#x27;s as smooth as ever.  Tried it on a few pieces of non-delicate clothing and it did a good job there as well.  Love simple and cheap solutions to everyday problems...</li>
            <li> Small and mighty shaver.  Don&#x27;t put too much pressure on the sweater, or it will eat it! Be mindful and it just a great job.  It definitely renewed a bunch of sweaters that had become pilly.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase it saved my pants and sweaters. Easy to use. I like how it comes with a cover for the top of the shaver and how the area where the lint collects is clear.</li>
            <li> I just tested this item on very nubby cotton/spandex gloves that I wear often and now they look brand new!  I also tested it on a cotton dress that was rubbed raw from the rough texture of my purse and the wear and tear is definitely undetectable.  At only $5.99, this was a great buy.</li>
            <li> Dollar-for-dollar, this is probably as good as you will get when it comes to lint removers. The battery life with 2 AA batteries is good. It performs well at removing pills from all types of fabric. However, I do find that I have go go over some areas more than once. This may be a function of the size of the shaver, or the speed at which the blades move. Either way, for $6, I couldn&#x27;t have been happier.</li>
            <li> I love this little gadget, it got all those little fuzz balls off and left my clothes looking new, Loved it so much I bought a spare!</li>
            <li> I love this. Its my new toy. The power on this shaver is just right. It doesn&#x27;t snag my clothes. It really does renew my sweaters.</li>
            <li> Just got this package 2 minutes ago, pulled out my favorite sweater i  wear to work and this product made my sweater look BRAND NEW i had lint balls all on my arms and ate the bottom of my sweater but not ANYMORE!!</li>
            <li> The product is definitely good. The motor is strong and the blades are sharp. Earlier I was buying similar product is Moscow. That one was softer than this product. Remington cuts harder. About a year ago I bought a similar thing for a cheap price, after a week the blades cover got a crack and it started to make scrartches on the material. This shaver seems to last longer.  Recomendation: While shaving, keep your material stretched. Otherwise there is a chance it will bite a thread. The baldes are sharp!  Drawdacks: Dust does not want to come from blades part to the dust compartment. The blades section is ALWAYS clogged. Nevertheless, event with this, my overlall evaluation is positive.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a month or so, and it works. It gets rid of the fuzzies and has not broken.</li>
            <li> For $6 ($10 with shipping), I would have said this was a great buy. Until it broke after I used it on just 2 sweaters! The guard is made of thin aluminum and it appears that the blades got caught in the guard somehow and punctured holes in it. Now it won&#x27;t work (the blades stop when they hit the broken fragments of the guard) and even if it WOULD work, I&#x27;m afraid to use it for fear the now too large guard holes would allow the blades to put holes in my sweaters!  Is there any way to get a couple replacement guards so I can actually use this again??</li>
            <li> I have a great pair of skinny dress pants I&#x27;ve had for quite a few years and just can&#x27;t part with them. Unfortunately they started getting fuzzies in the legs and it wasn&#x27;t until my mom suggested this item that I had some hope of saving them since the brand no longer makes them. The item is so easy to use and did exactly what it said. So happy I got this product to save my pants!</li>
            <li> i like this product it has brought renewed use to lots of sweaters otherwise to have been donated.. i use it to remove lint from my toddlers knit black tights all the time.. &amp; the only prob i&#x27;ve had is the battery cover slips off, i probably could just tape it on. had it for a year i think it holds up real well</li>
            <li> First, the good news:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Inexpensive, as I purchased as an Amazon Prime Add-on product.&lt;br /&gt;- Remington is a known and trusted name, so I knew it and trusted it.&lt;br /&gt;- It revived the garments I tried first (pet hoodies, of all things) BRILLIANTLY.&lt;br /&gt;- Probably the most effective pill remover I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers complained of fabric shredding pulling issues and such. I had no similar experiences, and I believe if you take care to exercise common sense when using this (ie., pulling cloth taut, type of material upon which you choose to use it, not treating it like a hedge trimmer and hacking at the garment) you, too, will not suffer any damage from using this on your good clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the bad:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s made like junk.&lt;br /&gt;- The On/Off switch moves from On to Off, but this seems to be purely for my entertainment because it never actually shuts the motor. Maybe it&#x27;s just my unit that&#x27;s flawed, maybe it&#x27;s pandemic; but certainly, it&#x27;s a pain.&lt;br /&gt;- The battery compartment, once you open it, does not want to stay closed. And I mean when it&#x27;s empty of batteries because...&lt;br /&gt;- THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT COVER DOESN&#x27;T FIT WHEN IT&#x27;S GOT BATTERIES IN IT.&lt;br /&gt;- I had to insert the batteries, leave the cover off, and operate it looking half-built and half-brained. But this didn&#x27;t make it any worse to use except aesthetically. The batteries stayed in place throughout the process.&lt;br /&gt;- But the batteries CAN&#x27;T stay in because as I stated above, THE ON/OFF SWITCH IS GLITCHED so the only way to turn the unit OFF is to remove the juice.&lt;br /&gt;- This is how I learned the compartment door won&#x27;t go back on after the batteries are again removed. It just seems that it was made to fit to show all pretty in the package, but once it&#x27;s been jimmied open, it&#x27;s just misshapen enough to not fit back where it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I have a ziplock bag with the unit, the batteries, and the battery compartment door stored together, but disassembled out of necessity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when I DO assemble it and use it, THE PERFORMANCE ON THIS POORLY MADE UNIT IS UNEQUALED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Buyer Beware&amp;#34; is more a case of &amp;#34;Buyer Be Aware&amp;#34; because if you don&#x27;t mind the extra fuss, the results are worth the trouble.disassembled out of necessity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when I DO assemble it and use it, THE PERFORMANCE ON THIS POORLY MADE UNIT IS UNEQUALED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Buyer Beware&amp;#34; is more a case of &amp;#34;Buyer Be Aware&amp;#34; because if you don&#x27;t mind the extra fuss, the results are worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> I live this shaver.  I have bought other more expensive ones but they just don&#x27;t work nearly as well.  Great value for the price!!</li>
            <li> Simple to use. Sometimes gathers balls of wool in the blade chamber but the blades are easy to remove so this is only a mild nuisance.</li>
            <li> Work&#x27;s Great!! Buy it without skepticism ! Defuzzed my hooded sweatcoat in 10 min. .Very happy with the whole purchase..</li>
            <li> Totally does the job, very easily getting rid of &amp;#34;pilling.&amp;#34; Easy to use, does what is advertised, what more do you want? BUY IT.</li>
            <li> An inexpensive way to rejuvenate socks, cloths, etc... I use it on my sweaters for the most part... Not very big so it&#x27;s easy to handle &amp; use. However it is not the most sturdy thing either...  I think it&#x27;s a good bye for the price &amp; does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I just wish the lint collector tray was a bit more secure and did not slide off so easily... ;)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t i know this product even existed until a friend mentioned it....greatest invention ever! My sweaters are all like new again.</li>
            <li> Do not use this on thin fabrics. Make sure your item is laid out on a flat surface, otherwise you will surely create a hole somewhere.</li>
            <li> I had broken my cheaper version of this and desperately needed a new one.  Once I got this, I realized the durability seemed much better than what I had.  I haven&#x27;t used it much yet but it does the job</li>
            <li> You have to go over the same spot two or three times to remove things.  It kept getting clogged and stopped working even though it was not full.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have to say I did not expect much when I bought this unit but when I opened it and tried it I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked! This little tool quickly removes anything on the surface of any fabric without damaging the fabric in any way. I used it to remove little &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; on bedsheets which it did with ease restoring them to their original 600 thread count feel! Also removed the pills that always develop on the heel area of tennis shoes VIOLA like new again! What a great tool, wish I had found it sooner.</li>
            <li> It works well on sweaters.  Batteries ran down kind of fast.  I was able to get one sweater done and part of another one.  It works.</li>
            <li> This shaver does work, but must be cleaned out often as you are using it.  It will make holes in your knits if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> Bought this to bring pilled clothes back to life and was more than impressed with the results.  Great value and my clothes have never looked better.</li>
            <li> As soon as I got it I put batteries in it and started shaving away at my jackets and shirts. I had so much fun! .. Anyway it is very powerful and had no problems. I would suggest extreme caution when using this on a light knit or thin material as I did put two small holes on one shirt luckily the holes were in hidden areas. As long as you don&#x27;t use too much pressure and hold the shirt firmly you should be ok!</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was pretty skeptical about ordering this, but don&#x27;t let the low price fool you. This thing WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t press on the fabric too hard though, I think thats what some ppl have been doing and it ruins their clothes. Gently press on and just swirl it around and it takes off almost all the fuzzies off.&lt;br /&gt;I would DEFINITELY recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I use this product constantly, and have never had a problem with snags, even with delicate material-items like bras.</li>
            <li> The size is smaller than I thought but works great!</li>
            <li> its a good one. it cleans almost my all dirty clothes.</li>
            <li> I have to say, this product DOES do what it&#x27;s supposed to do, which is shave the clothing and get rid of pills on the fabric. However, be warned that it will frequently and unexpectedly put holes in your clothes. I used to use my mom&#x27;s clothes shaver and never had this problem...maybe the holes on this one are too big, or it is too powerful? I blamed it on myself at first for not being careful enough or not laying the clothes flat enough. But when my mom, who is very careful with these things, also put a hole in my shirt with it, I knew it was the fault of the product. I would not recommend buying it...the money you save by getting this one will not be worth it with the amount of clothes you will ruin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shopping on Amazon (a lot) since the early  90s and this may be my favorite purchase. It does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it well. I can&#x27;t account for some of the poorer reviews on here. It&#x27;s really a great product and the price is a steal.</li>
            <li> As stupid as it may seem, I consider 4 star products to be a risk. Despite the fact that this fabric shaver is very cheap, it took me several weeks of consideration before I finally decided to buy it. I could not be more impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s extremely easy to operate; you just gently rub it over your fabrics. I had a few jackets with a ton of lint balls/pills, and this thing made them look brand new. Don&#x27;t push too hard, you will probably damage the fabric. When I&#x27;m using it, I just barely let it touch the surface of the fabric. It works perfectly, and it collects a ton of lint. I even decided to run it over the lower back of some of my polos (a typical place for pills to accumulate) and it worked great. I&#x27;ve used it on a ton of my clothes (and my girlfriend&#x27;s clothes) and the batteries haven&#x27;t died yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, just give it a go if you&#x27;re on the fence. It worked wonders for me. I&#x27;m driving my roommates mad bragging about how good it is and using it on every fabric I can find.</li>
            <li> This battery-operated lint remover works very well.  Purrs and looks like a vibrator sex toy, but don&#x27;t be confused, it&#x27;s a lint ball remover from clothing.  Works well and is very compact for easy storage.  As stated, works well removing lint balls.  Nothing really sexy about it.  Move along now.    Amazon.com rocks!</li>
            <li> works just great. Thanks</li>
            <li> Terrible...didn&#x27;t work even first day I got it.  Very disappointing...also took forever to get.</li>
            <li> This little guy keeps going and going. It works great on both my light, thin cotton sweaters as well as the chunky knit wool sweaters. I haven&#x27;t had any issues of the shaver creating holes or snags. I have noticed that when using the shaver on a large sweater with heavy pilling, the plastic catchment area can fill up and needs to be emptied halfway through the job.</li>
            <li> works well with an easy to change filter.</li>
            <li> Works well to remove fabric pills from lots of different kinds of fabric.</li>
            <li> Good little shaver that does a great job.</li>
            <li> love it.  works fantastic.</li>
            <li> Have not had this for long but it has done a yeoman&#x27;s job so far -- had a lot of catching up to do!  Lent it to a friend who said she stayed up all night de-pilling her clothes.  No battery replacement needed yet.  My only question is how long the blades will stay sharp  I use it for lightweight sweaters and knit tops so it probably isn&#x27;t getting the kind of use that would wear the head down quickly.  We shall see.  In the meantime, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and time with this one.  Difficult to get the clear lint cap to stay in place.  I returned mine.</li>
            <li> I ordered this gadget for my wife who used it to clean up pearling on an expensive (?) sweater.  Worke great.</li>
            <li> Works better than what I thought it would. Where has this been all my life?!?</li>
            <li> works great did what I wanted it to do</li>
            <li> .. in the end, I was pretty impressed.  It completely reconditioned my favorite Columbia Sportswear &amp; Adidas fleece jackets and looking forward to wearing them again more regularly.  The trick I found is to NOT to apply pressure and just lightly skim the surface of the fabric. The only con i can find with this product is it doesn&#x27;t seem it would survive a drop to the floor so heed caution.  Seller/Shipper could also do a better job with packaging.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for! I can keep my clothes looking nice longer.</li>
            <li> This sweater shaver works but it is a bit on the wimpy side so lower your expectations in advance. I use it occasionally but it takes time and you have to stay in the same area on the garment for quite a while to get all of the pills off</li>
            <li> I receieved this item really late and when it arrived it wasnt working i tried all sorts of batteries but it seems that something is wrong with it.,..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WILL NEVER EVER ORDER ANYTHING FROM AMAZON AGAIN!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do and very quickly. Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> This worked okay, but it seems like it needed to be a little bigger and needed a little more power.  I think it would work great on smaller pieces of clothing, but we bought this for our comforter which was WAY too large for this thing.  We would have been more happy with a larger more expensive version of this.</li>
            <li> Very convenient! This product to amazing. I managed to get all the pills and fuzz of my jacket with in minutes. I think everyone should have one in their home. It didn&#x27;t damage any of my clothing either.</li>
            <li> good for a while. After cleaning 3-4 sweaters, intensely. The blade is no longer sharp.....I am not sure whether i can change the blade or not</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, I thought that this shaver would have operated better. I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;You really need to spend some time shaving sections in order to see them &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;, however if you managed to remove all the pills and fuzz, you noticed that the clothes suffer wear, they tend to look worn.&lt;br /&gt;So for the purpose of this device, I&#x27;ll says it provides an average perform. Its not that good, its not that bad, its really for very superficial parts.</li>
            <li> Works great - I have had no problems with this product.  I got it about a month ago and have used it several times with no issues.  I think it&#x27;s a great buy for the price!</li>
            <li> Product works well. I am sure that there are other more expensive products out there that would work better for the price and what I needed it for, it does the job.</li>
            <li> does the job.  i was looking for something to use with my pilling sweaters.  Using it was quite straightforward,  easy to insert batteries</li>
            <li> It works overall, but you have to be really careful on thin sweaters. It ate a couple holes already. It&#x27;s a very simple design and you can take it apart to clean very easily</li>
            <li> Easy to use and effective.  My 7 y.o. kid used it to clean up some of our sweaters.  They look like new now.  You MUST be careful, however, for thin materials and delicate sweaters, etc., as the holes are large and can suck in the material.  This happened a couple times but it did not cut the sweater.  Just pull off carefully.  Not sure what will happen to extremely delicate materials, though.</li>
            <li> I am busy shaving the fuzz balls off my sweater and fleece, now they look like new. Easy to use and very safe too.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well but doesn&#x27;t take off a lot of pills that aren&#x27;t the right size/height/shape to fit through its grill.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the positive reviews, I decided on this shaver against all the other shavers because it was purported to be the best for its money.  It&#x27;s the worst for its money.  The batteries, which were brand new Energizer brand, gave out in about 5 minutes and didn&#x27;t do a very thorough or clean job of clearing all the fuzz from my fabric. I tried just a small area and I feel that it was in much the same condition after the batteries died than it was before I began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s already used up, I do not think I can return the product, but I can advise against a purchaser going with this device.  Please try another one.</li>
            <li> I have used fabric shavers for a number of years now and find them indispensable for knitwear, especially wool sweaters that tend to pill easily and quickly. The Remington unit is a step above the generic variety and will last a couple of years or so. One caveat is that their use on thin or shear knit garments should be undertaken with a delicate touch or you could end up with small holes.</li>
            <li> Painful but works. Worth the price. Beats constant plucking. Not sure there is a painless way to do this  Some skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a fabric shaver before, so I don&#x27;t have another product to compare this to. It works very well and removes pills, lint, and those tiny bits of leaves or whatever that children get embedded in their sweaters that refuse to come out during the normal wash cycle.</li>
            <li> Remington does not fail to meet my expectation for this item. It makes my clothes look almost new again.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This is a great size, comfortable to hold, large holding area for those little fuzz balls we all love so much.  The rotating area is a good size and works quick.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing!  It does a great job.  I&#x27;ve had shavers before and they didn&#x27;t do half the job this one does.  I haven&#x27;t experienced it cutting holes in my clothes as others did.  I think on more delicate materials you would want to apply very little pressure and lay the area you&#x27;re shaving flat.  For the money, you can&#x27;t beat this!!</li>
            <li> all stuff was fuzzin up .. bought it ..  can&#x27;t be happier  with it ..  for the pennies I paid  for this little guy  I was able to revive alot of my Hoodies  and  my bed sheets...  perfect !!</li>
            <li> Brought a bunch of sweaters back to life!  If I had one nitpicky complaint, it would be that if you grip the shaver too tightly, you may accidentally slide open the battery or lint compartments. Overall very happy with the purchase, though.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace one that was very listless -- took forever to get a few pills.  I haven&#x27;t tried it on any lightweight fabrics, so having the fabric pulled into the shaver hasn&#x27;t been a problem, and it&#x27;s done a great job on my pilled sweaters.  One danger:  if you have any OCD tendencies you might end up prowling your closet (and the rest of the house) for pills in need of removal.  And asking friends if they have problems with pills ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least I haven&#x27;t approached strangers ... yet ...</li>
            <li> I can wear my light sweater again!!  I have black crop cardigan sweater that I like to wear when it is a little chilly outside but I mistakenly washed it with something that left while cotton balls (whateva) on it.  I tried to use a velvet lint remover to get it off but no luck so I got this little gadget and it ate all of those little cotton balls up...looks almost as good as new!!</li>
            <li> THE SHAVER WORK VERY GOOD MAKES THE MATERIAL LIKE NEW.  THE SHAVER IS A LITTLE SMALLL, THE CUP FILLS UP FAST BUT IS IS COMPACT.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to make my coat look not so used and beat up and it looks like brand new.  I decided to try it on my couch and although it took a long time, it is like a brand new couch.  I was about ready to buy another couch because I couldn&#x27;t stand sitting on all those annoying fuzzy pill things but now I don&#x27;t have to.&lt;br /&gt;This was very easy to use and worked great.  I did have to empty the catcher a lot and clean out the internal blades periodically but that happens when you de-pill your entire couch.</li>
            <li> This item does not work. It does not remove the fuzz from my sweaters, It was a waste of money.I believe that I should get my money back.</li>
            <li> Put in brand new batteries &amp; it was working fine. Until it wasn&#x27;t. I was de-fuzzing a scarf that I accidentally put in the wash &amp; after about an hour, it just stopped working.</li>
            <li> The is one of the best Fabric shavers that I have owned.  Great small size allows me to travel with it and batter life is excellent.</li>
            <li> This is a very efficient tool for depilling knitted goods to keep them new-looking. It does not snag or nick the fabric.</li>
            <li> Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear, fuzzy wuzzy lost his hair. Its not too bad. My girlfriend wanted it. So i got it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s does the job and its pretty ok price.  But it is pretty intense.  Not made to use on delicate things...used in a bra that somehow ended up in the wash with towels and needed to get the towel fuzz off...I think I pressed to hard and the thing ripped a hole in my favorite bra (seems like it was doomed to begin with).  So it doesn&#x27;t have a sensor mechanism like in the last one that stops it from putting holes in things.  I have been successful using it with other items after the incident. It does a great job.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on a wool sweater, and so far this fabric shaver has been working very well (no tearing of the sweater, which really did look like new afterwards).</li>
            <li> Great item, doesn&#x27;t come with batteries. It does what it says and is sturdy and just feels quality! Very happy!</li>
            <li> I considered throwing away quite a few items of clothing due to pills and such. This little fabric shaver has saved my wardrobe!</li>
            <li> Careful of blades they will fall off when cleaning. It works good, just to small and have to continuously clean. Nice if it were bigger.</li>
            <li> This worked fine for a while, but after using it off and on for about a month, the metal screen on the shaver began cracking and made the product unusable. Because it was so cheap, I&#x27;m not terribly upset, but I would expect a little more than about a month of use. It worked well while I had it, which is why I gave two stars.</li>
            <li> Works but takes a long time. So if you are patient or just really nee the fuzzies off its great. It mainly use it for neck ties and its been perfect so far just not the best for a whole sweater.</li>
            <li> The plastic part that catches the shavings falls off a lot, but other than that it works well and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I would say is that it works great. I did break one because a piece of thread got into it and tangled inside the blades, breaking the smooth metal surface with the little holes, so it wouldn&#x27;t slide on the fabric because the metal bent and would get caught on the fabric. But that was my fault for not seeing a piece of double thread that wouldn&#x27;t get cut.</li>
            <li> While I do not see a huge difference in my sweaters, this shaver must be working because I see remnants inside.</li>
            <li> This is great for getting minor pilling off clothing or furniture. It might be tedious on a really large job but is perfect for sweaters or armchairs. Be cautious with thin fabric, though, as it ripped right through a sundress I was using this on.</li>
            <li> I thought the item would be larger, didn&#x27;t realize was the travel size. It does seem to work but since it covers a small surface, it takes more time to complete the task.</li>
            <li> I have always had one of these little things at home and this one is turning out to work just as well as all the others! Makes life much easier and some clothes can be kept longer!</li>
            <li> This is something that I searched for and others had it for much more. Price and shipping were unbeatable. Thank you very much, what a sweater saver.</li>
            <li> This item works: it shaves off &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; that grow on sweaters. Not so very easy to use, however; and the process is time-consuming.</li>
            <li> I wear gloves everyday and this is great for getting rid of fuzzies that accumulate on them. I haven&#x27;t had it eat any fabric or put any holes in anything and I generally use it while wearing the gloves so they&#x27;re stretched out. I also used it on the inside of a hoodie and it got all the fuzzballs without destroying the lining. Good little product.</li>
            <li> Great gadget for the price. I couldn&#x27;t decide whether to get this or a lint removing (pumice) sweater stone, so I bought both. I found this works better for smoother knit wool fabric with finer fibers and less texture and the stone works better for larger sweaters with coarser fibers. Rechargeable (Eneloop) NiMH batteries work well with this too. Put a piece of bright tape on the clear cap so you&#x27;ll know to take it off and where you&#x27;ve put it.</li>
            <li> I wish I had taken a before and after photo. This product is amazing. My couches were not even a year old and now they look new again. I had those little fuzz balls all over my couch and this amazing product took them all off. It is a little time consuming and does go through batteries fast but heck I would way rather spend money on batteries than have to buy couch covers, buy new couches, or have to sit and look at those ugly fuzz balls. Over all I love this product. I highly recommend it. Just make sure you clean out the area where the blades are. It can get a little clogged then the product wont work as well. Also if it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as it did in the beginning it probably means you need to change the batteries. That is what happened to me.</li>
            <li> i own several other types of fabric shavers, this one is just not special at all, to be used on very fine (small) piles only.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what the folks were doing that claim that this fabric shaver ate holes in their sweater.  Based on those reviews, I used it timidly at first, but eventually realized that i can press firmly on the sweater and not do any damage at all.  I had 5 or 6 sweaters that I was ready to basically give to Goodwill and I was able to rehabilitate them with this shaver so that they look awesome.  It&#x27;s not refined engineering here, and I do allow that maybe a bad one slips by, but this little $10 purchase was way worth it.  When the shaver starts to sound &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; as if the battery was running down, that&#x27;s the time to clean it out.  So freakin&#x27; easy!!!!  LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> This item works well, but it is easy broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to use it long time, you may select another item</li>
            <li> ... the shaving blade gets stuck or clogs a few times when your working on fabric that&#x27;s really thick material.</li>
            <li> This is the travel version which was not described in the product description. Be careful before ordering. I wanted the full size version. Product works, but wish it were the bigger option.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for one of these for awhile, does its job very well. I have not had any problems with it yet. Good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for one specific use, to get the burrs off my tufted ottoman. Since I wanted for one project I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot and so I chose this item. Some of the negative reviews said it was too rough on delicate fabrics but since that didn&#x27;t apply to me, I bought it. It worked great! Very quick and easy to use. You can see clearly in the picture the before and after of the ottoman.</li>
            <li> ... and there&#x27;s no much more to expect from a fabric shaver than to shave fabric! It get&#x27;s the job done :)</li>
            <li> Works great.  Does have to be cleared often and burns through a set of batteries before finishing a set of queen sized linens.  It is also slow going.  If you have the patience and rechargeable batteries defiantly worth it.</li>
            <li> It got a little lint, but I have a sweater dress that has lint all over it and this product made no difference on it. It didn&#x27;t work that great on any other sweaters or tops I used it upon. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my son and daughter-in-law to use on their couch. According to my son, she loves is and used it on the couch as soon as it arrived. They seemed to be very pleased with the results and thought that it worked very well to remove the &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a lot and it has put a few holes in some of my sweaters. The key is to use it when your clothes are hanging and not to stretch the fabric too much while using it. But buyer beware - I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s a 10% chance you&#x27;ll get a hole.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it works great so far.</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d bought this sooner. It works great and doesnt damage clothes. I would recomend this to my friends. :)</li>
            <li> perfect size price and works great</li>
            <li> My couch looks like new. Only used it once so far</li>
            <li> Works great. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It works as described.  I used it incorrectly and cut a hole in a brand new shirt.  Be careful. Follow directions.  Better advice is not to buy clothes that require you to have one of these!</li>
            <li> This unit is cheap and should be sold at the dollar store. The name Remington doesn&#x27;t mean anything. I was very disappointed in the cheap plastic construction of this unit. Be sure to be very careful or you&#x27;ll break the clear waste fabric holding compartment. Drop it once and it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li> I had a bag of clothes waiting for this!! Just what I needed ^_^ thank you!!</li>
            <li> Great for all those saving all those pillled sweaters I was going to donate</li>
            <li> very nice, a little smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Works great. Doesn&#x27;t put holes in my clothes like some people reported. Clothes don&#x27;t look brand new however it does put new life into my sweaters. Arrived quicker than expected</li>
            <li> Works great, gets all the fuzzy balls off, without damaging fabric!  Powerful and compact.  Exactly what I was looking for!, I would absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> Definitely make sure to use this on a flat surface. it&#x27;s a powerful and effective tool to get rid of pilling, but that also means that if the fabric is not on a flat surface, or if it is crumpled, it can make a hole in your shirt. It&#x27;s not a major problem as long as you keep the fabric relatively flat and unbunched. I&#x27;ve only experienced one hole and that&#x27;s because I was using it carelessly, holding the shirt in my hand. It was my fault, but it should be made aware that this can make holes in your shirts.</li>
            <li> great item , very  pleased, plan on buying another one for my daughter for xmas</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm. I ordered this clothes shaver when I pulled out our fall and winter clothes and saw they weren&#x27;t in as good a shape as I remembered. I left them in the boxes until I got the shaver, then washed them all and shaved them one right after the other, molding the sweaters to my knees first and using a light touch. I was done in no time, and the shaver was very effective! No problems with snags, it didn&#x27;t eat the batteries too quickly like some do, and the pills and puffs were gone!</li>
            <li> This was a GREAT purchase, well worth the money, I would have paid double. I had tons of workout clothes, tanks, and bras that had gotten some pilling, after using this it is gone! It was fine on the clothes, never caught or pulled threads, and got EVERYTHING. I&#x27;ve tried tried this on about 5 different fabrics and am yet to have a problem. Great product!</li>
            <li> Best invention ever. Period. I use this on a daily/weekly basis-- amazing!!!! Side note: Make sure you lay the item of clothing on a flat surface before you begin because if there are any bumps, it could create a hole. Also, if the fabric is really lightweight be careful!</li>
            <li> I love this depiller.  It works great so I bought two to give as gifts.  Received quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this thing a about a year ago and still fabulous</li>
            <li> I reviewed several sweater shavers and decided on this one.  It works really good for the price.  I use on my work sweaters.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, especially for the money. Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and it does it well. No complaints.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a couple cotton throw pillows I got from my mom a few years ago that were pilling like crazy, but I didn&#x27;t want to get rid of because they had sentimental value. They now look like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this thing on shirts, socks, even the worn sleeves of my wool coat. It works amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shouldn&#x27;t be used on thin fabrics, or it will be sucked up, but I am so impressed with how well this works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am never throwing away old clothes again!!</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver does the job.  Sometimes the fuzzys from my old couch will get stuck in the blades and it will stop working, but if I just unscrew the cap a little to put more space between the blades and the cover, it will start working again.  It is easy to remove and empty the fuzzy catcher.</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver does in fact shave off some of the excess fabric on my clothes, but I don&#x27;t see it \\&quot;saving\\&quot; any of my clothes in the long run.  I think it&#x27;s definitely worth buying because it will preserve your clothes a lot better then if you didn&#x27;t use it, but it does not get ALL the excess off (still plenty of fabric balls on my clothes when i&#x27;m done using the shaver).  I&#x27;m sure over time it makes a big difference if each time I use it I help my clothes out a bit, so I&#x27;m going to keep at it, but don&#x27;t expect your clothes to look \\&quot;like new\\&quot; again or to be able to keep your clothes that you love forever because of this miracle shaver.  I guess just keep your expectations reasonable, it will HELP, not SAVE, your clothes :)</li>
            <li> I first tried using this item on a wool cardigan that had a moderate amout of pilling.  I immediately noticed that removing all of the pilling was going to take quite some time, as it took several passes on each small section of fabric before the pills were removed.  After about 5 minutes of this, the unit simply shut down, and I needed to gently tap it to get it started again.  It also appears that this unit is a battery draining monster.  I would not recommend this except for the lightest of pilling removal jobs.</li>
            <li> Works well, for about 5 minutes. If you have a surplus of batteries, by all means, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This fun little gadget is definitely not meant for thinner materials. Used it on a light tee and sure enough I got a small hole it the shirt where it wasn&#x27;t laying flat. I recommend laying/stretching your shirts flat and never let it ripple when you&#x27;re going over it and that&#x27;ll reduce any chances of causing holes.</li>
            <li> I used to have a different brand sweater shaver and when it finally died I bought this one.  It does not do nearly as well by comparison.  It does look nice and seems to have enough power, but the holes in the screen are too small to allow in all of the sweater pills so it does not remove everything.  It&#x27;s probably great for cotton stuff, but if you&#x27;re looking to doctor up big fluffy sweaters this did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I like it for small areas.  The lint accumulates quickly and needs to be emptied often so as not to get clogged up.  Great size for travel.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace an old sweater shaver I had that finally just gave out. I am not happy with the replacement at all. It doesn&#x27;t work well - I had to go over the same portion of the sweater multiple times to get the fabric pills off. Plus, it eats batteries and the clear plastic portion that holds the fuzz is too loose and comes off in my hand all the time. Would not recommend. I was able to shave one sweater with it, but using it became so frustrating, I eventually just gave up and threw it away.</li>
            <li> Is it cheap? Definitely. Does it work? Absolutely.&lt;br /&gt;I chose to buy this, even after reading some of the more negative reviews, because I figured its low price tag was worth the risk. I was right. This shaver gives new life to my oldest and most favorite sweaters, some of which I was embarrassed to wear because they were so ratty looking. I&#x27;ve used it on both cotton and cashmere with no problems. The clear compartment where the shaved fuzzies go is less than secure though and it comes detached easily, but I just wrapped a hair band around it to solve that issue.</li>
            <li> This product was great!&lt;br /&gt;Never used one before and it worked perfectly! Was very easy and got rid of all the lint balls that covered my hoodie!&lt;br /&gt;DEFFFFF recommend it</li>
            <li> This is a small fabric shaver but it&#x27;s portable and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. I use it to remove pilling. It has made my peacoat look better. I&#x27;ve also used on my scarves no problem. For delicate fabrics you have to be more gentle. I wish it was bigger but you can&#x27;t get everything. Overall I am happy with my purchse.</li>
            <li> Worked a lot better than expected. I used it on my couch and it worked wonders.</li>
            <li> More powerful than expected.  Easy to hold and cleaning is a snap.  I had a larger, corded version of this in the past, but this one is just as powerful.</li>
            <li> This was a wonderful purchase for me.  I had been borrowing my sister&#x27;s, but when I saw this one, I thought I would order it.  I am so glad I did since it is much better than the one I was borrowing</li>
            <li> This shaver worked great on my sweaters that had become a big shabby because of pilling and wear.&lt;br /&gt;The residue falls into the collector on the shaver and easy to detach to empty.  The key to using this shaver though is&lt;br /&gt;patience and to go slowly with an up and down motion and small areas at a time.</li>
            <li> Does the job at a fraction of the cost of other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a good price and works great.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Horrible. Horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing good to say about it. It did not work AT ALL. It I faster and more effective to pick off each little pill off your sweater one by one.</li>
            <li> As advertised, but, do be careful and don&#x27;t press too hard. Removes pills from sweaters very well ?.. I like it</li>
            <li> Works well.  I have restored quite a few sweaters using this thing. It does get the lint ball off but you have to press down on the fabric.  It is very gentle to the fabric as well.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised.  Works wonderful!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. This was a replacement for and older model that stopped working,  It was easy to find online and was a very good price.</li>
            <li> it worked fine for a day or two then broke.  However, the price was so good i did order a replacement.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re patient, slow and read the instructions - this works great.  All you need to do is follow the instructions and take your time.  For everyone else, just go buy a new sweater.</li>
            <li> Only used it once but completely satisfied. Takes fabric ends off quite easily and occasionally needs to be emptied. For light use, this product is perfect.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s not bad... however a fabric shaver can be had on ebay for $2... which the sellers here are making a mad profit off of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great compact fabric shaver, but as another user pointed out, this unit is WAY TOO POWERFUL for light and thin fabric items.&lt;br /&gt;If your clothing item is not completely flat the shaver WILL cut the fabric at the hems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on a thick sweater and it just kept shaving down the extra fabric that was sticking out no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally. I would have bought it on ebay if I searched for it there first lol.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected! Thanks!</li>
            <li> My husband travels on airplanes for his job and I find that the lower back of a lot of his shirts, tops &amp; sweaters wind up with lots of pills &amp; pulls from sitting in airplane seats for hours at a time.  This removed the pills &amp; pulls and made his shirts look like new!</li>
            <li> Top was broken when I received.  Tried to use it anyway but it pulled my sweaters.</li>
            <li> I never figured this cheap little lint shaver would last but here I am 4 years later and it&#x27;s going strong! It has been used often and on some rough materials and other than needing to be cleaned out fairly often hasn&#x27;t given me any issues!</li>
            <li> My daughter got one of these and raved about it so I got one too. Kind of a pain to clean, but a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> So far so good, works a miracle! Had a new, yellow fleece shirt that was accidentally washed with a towel and literally spotted all over with red fuzz. It took a while to shave the whole shirt but now it looks new again. The storage compartment showed that it only shaved away what was absolutely necessary.</li>
            <li> I have saved sooo much money in sweaters since buying this.  Keeps sweaters and some shirts looking constantly new.  Over time something starts to look old and pill-y, I just run this over it and viola!  Looks new.  Worth every stinking penny!</li>
            <li> Wife likes it. Inexpensive product that does good job.</li>
            <li> works very well i love these for my leggings</li>
            <li> This shaves off pills, but it&#x27;s really flimsy and the battery cover and pill holder cover pop off constantly, making it difficult to use. Also, beware of totally ripping a hole in your favorite sweater if it isn&#x27;t held taut when you&#x27;re using the shaver, which is difficult to achieve unless you have a helper.</li>
            <li> This works ok...I could only see a very small difference in the amount of pills and lint on clothes and if you&#x27;re not careful with the edges of the clothing, or if you do not lay it flat, it can cut a hole through it! Now two of my favorite tops have a small hole..</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  It&#x27;s quite fun also.  I had some cashmere sleep socks that had gotten some major fuzz on them after a year of use.  This brought them back to normal in less than 20 minutes.  Just be sure that the fabric has no lumps or wrinkles or you will easily make a hole in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, empty it often or the fuzz won&#x27;t be able to fall and will not allow it to work as efficiently.</li>
            <li> This did the job I was looking for it to do. I had a few shirts and stretchy pants that after a few washes developed balls.  This worked very well in removing them. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times and the battery compartment is corrupted and no longer works. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Bought this to remove little \\&quot;fuzzballs\\&quot; that built up on the fabric of my couch, and it does a fantastic job. It did such a good job that it has made the color come back when I thought the fabric was actually faded. Of course doing a whole couch will require quite a few batteries, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Highly recommend it. It is very useful for cotten ball things in shoes. Wish it came with the battery though.</li>
            <li> I was thinking whether should I go with this or no because of price :P(relatively cheaper)... But really, very good clothing shaver. I had my shirt full of pills and now its totally clean. Amazing! The grip is very good (very important point) and handy. So, no need to think, just go with this.</li>
            <li> Really dissapointed with this product. It not only doesn&#x27;t work, it ruined a few sets of batteries. I kept inserting new batteries, trying to determine if it was my batteries that were bad, or the product. It must have been doing whatever the equivalent of short-circuiting them is to batteries, making them useless. I finally got it to work for about 10 seconds. Then, those same batteries that were just working fine in another item were useless. Piece of junk. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I ordered the remington fabric shaver to clean up some old sweaters.  It does a good job and I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to buy one of these for a while and finally bought the Remington.  It is pretty powerful for such a small machine.  I guess I will keep this short and just say that it definitely gets the job done.  I used in on some sweaters that had lint balls and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> This thing broke within 1 minute of use! I used it on the sleeve of my coat, it didn&#x27;t even make it around the sleeve :(  Apparently the spinning blades cut a piece of the metal grill, which distorted the grill and the blades couldn&#x27;t spin anymore. I checked out the grill material and it is extremely flimsy... I don&#x27;t recommend this at all!! Now on a mission to find a sturdy fabric shaver...</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old one that had died after several years. This one works just as well as the old and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I use it to trim those little pill balls from my bras, synthetic shirts, and other stuff. It just trims the little pill balls and doesn&#x27;t cut into the actual fabric.</li>
            <li> Just okay. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. The few times it&#x27;s worked, it&#x27;s worked well. The rest of the times... not so well. It has even cut a hole in two of my shirts made of thinner material. Because of that, I would only use it on thicker material.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT COME IN HANDY</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it was a great bargain. It does the job, but has a small head. The batterie power is just enough to do light pill take away.</li>
            <li> I was a little leary about buying this as I had one years ago that was junk.  But, happy day - this one is great so far.  Got it about 3 weeks ago and have used it 3-4 times and it really does shave the little balls off of my clothing.  Seems very powerful for its size.  So far so good.  Like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I used this first on a coat that had major pilling.  The shaver worked perfectly and it looks like a new coat.  I have used it a few times on other items and it hasn&#x27;t let me down.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I had a Remington Shaver before.  It always worked well.  Needed a new one and this absolutely works just as well as my previous one.  Sometimes you just need something to shave the nubs off of sweaters and knits.</li>
            <li> This is a must have if you have clothes.  They seem to be making clothes out of cheaper and cheaper fabrics (but the prices keep going up) and everything seems to pill no matter how much you pay for it.  This little shaver has successfully shaved my sweaters, shirts, sweats, even my bras without damaging them.  I would highly recommend it.  Has a nice little cover for the shaver head.  Empties easily.</li>
            <li> I have small hand and this is easy to hold on to. many of the lint shavers are big  &amp; awkward</li>
            <li> Product removes the balls on my sweaters easily.  It is very easy to use and plan to buy another one for my sister as a gift.</li>
            <li> This is the worst sweater shaver I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  It won&#x27;t stay on, even with brand-new batteries, and it seems to shave away the &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; at random, taking some and leaving others, regardless of the number of times I go over the fabric.  It&#x27;s as frustrating as an old vacuum cleaner.</li>
            <li> ...but rather slowly. Pretty basic, takes a while to really clean a sweater that has a lot of pilling off. The fuzz often gets caught in the blades and I have to clean it rather frequently (1-3x if I am doing a sweater for the first time). I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase this and would make the jump to something more expensive and hopefully more efficient.</li>
            <li> Incredible product! This made my old hoodies that got fuzz balls on it look like new!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because of the quality of the product.  It works great, too.  I would recommend this product because it works so well.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says. It shaved off pills from sweaters, pants, cotton t-shirts, even linen. Made them all look new (we used to give away somany of these clothes). For the price it is excellent. For larger areas you&#x27;ll have to sweat more though. The compartment fills up for a larger work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line : Must have in every home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+++ Very functional&lt;br /&gt;- relatively small compartment</li>
            <li> I really love this little fabric shaver!  It saved my favorite dress! It works really well, and has already paid for itself by saving my dress. My sister in law borrowed it to remove excess fuzz and lint from a hat, it looks brand new!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. I love sweater dresses but my dryer leaves them covered in lint. This fabric shaver doesn&#x27;t quite get all of the lint off, but at least it makes them wearable. All in all, a good purchase.</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver is perfect for getting all the fuzz off any clothing material, from cotton to wool, it works on all of them.</li>
            <li> This does the trick, but it is time-consuming.  It sure beats having to wear a bad-looking garment or having to eliminate it from the wardrobe.</li>
            <li> Works wonders for old clothes with those pesky little balls of lint. I used it on my Nike sweat suit and it looks new again. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product works well to get the pills off the clothes and rejuvinate them.  It was also very well priced.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased this.  I reviewed this type item for a while and was reluctant to purchase on line, but am so glad I did take the chance with this one.  Have used it so many times and am really happy with the results.  Tiny but works like a powerhouse.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite household tool/appliance!  I shaved all of my older sweaters and they look new now.  I had some that I wasn&#x27;t wearing because they looked terrible with the pills all over them.  New life has been added to my closet!</li>
            <li> This product does not work at all. I&#x27;ve had sweater shavers in the past that have worked fabulously. This one is trash and doesn&#x27;t work at all - didn&#x27;t take off anything! And the worst part is that it is more trouble than it cost to return it.</li>
            <li> This worked perfectly on my long fiber, fuzzy sweaters--not so much on the shorter fiber ones (sulphur stone for those). It saved me money by saving some of my favorite clothes.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it operated a bit more quickly, though.</li>
            <li> Extremely bad quality..I ordered one to remove piles/ lint from my overcoat. It broke down and the blades/ it&#x27;s parts falling apart within one use. V v bad quality. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. Look for something more durable and save your money.</li>
            <li> This works well, but it takes a while.  Sometimes I need to go over an extra linty area 10 times for it to be lint free.  It is good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I looked at many other shavers before selecting this one.  Even though others said that it cut holes in the fabric, I gave it a try.  Have not been more satisfied with the results.  I was extra careful using the shaver for fear of cutting a hole in the fabric.  The only down side is it takes a while to do a good job.  I would recommend this to anyone for the price you will pay for this product.</li>
            <li> works very well to refresh a wool coat and sweaters that had developed pills.  ONly used it on cotton and wool sweaters.  Have not tried it on cashmere.</li>
            <li> I had one of these years ago (a different brand), and it just didn&#x27;t seem to do the trick all the time. I found this on Amazon and it was very reasonably priced so I decided to give it a shot. Works great, it does exactly what it says it does!</li>
            <li> This is a high quality and perfect shaver. This fabric shaver from Remington has done marvelous things to my clothes. From the tiniest to the biggest threads, this shaver would gulp anything that comes its way.&lt;br /&gt;The style is good in that I could easily see the lint. So, you would know if it is already full. I dont use this a ton but at the price you cant go wrong</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is great it works really well and I love it. Makes clothes look as good as new. Thanks again</li>
            <li> It eats holes in my clothes. It fills up very quickly. No matter how careful you are, it tend to spill all over the floor upon emptying. It is very powerful for such a small device.</li>
            <li> While searching for a clothes brush, Amazon suggested this product. I was happy to try it out and was hoping that it would match a previous experience with an earlier version of this model which I loved. It works much better than I expected. It has exceeded all expectations. The shaving action is smooth and efficient. I used it on a sweater that had a lot of unattractive lint balls. After ten seconds of use I saw immediate improvement: it did not damage the fabric. Buy it! I highly recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> It works only on curtain kind of sweater. Move it slower will move lint nicely. The kind of sweater have longer lint, it will not work well.</li>
            <li> It worked well for two minutes. Then it stopped and couldn&#x27;t be turned on again even after I put brand new batteries in. I also find it hard to turn the little button on and off.</li>
            <li> The fabric shaver removes fuzz balls very easily and quickly.  It is nicely made and fits into the hand nicely.</li>
            <li> I thought all fabric shavers were the same, the lint catcher falls off often, which is a pain when you are just trying to shave one shirt.</li>
            <li> This shaver easily removes pills from sweaters, blankets, and even my grandson&#x27;s &amp;#34;blankey&amp;#34;.  It works quickly and safely to restore things to their new condition.</li>
            <li> Works well cleaning up the little pills on sweaters.</li>
            <li> Best little shaver I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need and expect. Would be sweet if it would come with batteries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this type of product for years and so am no novice, but this thing destroyed two of my sweaters.  Both were flat knits and I was hold them tight, so I don&#x27;t understand how the blade managed to do what it did through the guard, but it created holes in both garments.  I&#x27;m now out about $90.</li>
            <li> I have used this just a few times and this past time, the screen completely tore and now the device is inoperable (because the small blades now get stuck on the broken screen part).  I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Works great, removes pills quickly, doesn&#x27;t damage sweater.</li>
            <li> This is great for all my sweaters and items that pill.  15 minutes with this little gizmo and it looks like new again.  I really love this gadget.</li>
            <li> Needed to depill some sweaters and polyester sweats.  Knew what I wanted and this was the cheapest I could find.  Did the job just great.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an add-on item. I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times over the last few months. It does what it is supposed to. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I have not used this a ton yet but so far it works great!!!</li>
            <li> I love this thing. I have a few pairs of Ponte Knit leggings from Old Navy, and they are absolute favorite pants. I keep replacing them every couple of months though, because they have a real problem with pilling. This little thing has totally restored my old pairs that I had stopped wearing. It&#x27;s amazing! Works great. The fabric I&#x27;m using it on is heavy though, and I saw some other reviews that said it&#x27;s not great with lighter weight fabric. So be careful! But I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re using it on heavy knits you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Arrived as described-works great (better than the last one I had that fell apart after awhile).  Excellent buy for the money</li>
            <li> really like these. this is my second one. it works well, just be careful on the seams, if the material is thin enough it will make a hole. also, thick sweaters clog it up and it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING. I bought it for two particular shirts, and I was nervous to use it and ruin my shirts based on some reviews - but the shirts looked pretty rotten as they were, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Wow! My nursing tank top and baby wearing shirt are almost as good as new. Some previous reviewers noted that it ripped a hole in their clothes - I think that if you follow the directions (do not push down but rather just stroke the device back and forth, and make sure to not use on pulls in the fabric), there shouldn&#x27;t be an issue. Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, price and quality!</li>
            <li> Great it removes every single fuzz but it doesn&#x27;t come with battries</li>
            <li> Worked well shaving off lint from my sweater for a couple of times. But the battery lid fell off easily and I quickly lost it.</li>
            <li> Seller did a perfect transaction with fast delivery. My only problem with the product is that the cap covering the shreddings slips off very easily and doesn&#x27;t hold much but it works great getting off the fuzz balls.  Thanks, totally recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> Hey, it&#x27;s a brand name, and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, what else can you ask for in a pil shaver!</li>
            <li> I bought this to remove the fuzz from daughters uniform and it is amazing. After struggling with a lint brush this cleared up the uniform flawlessly.</li>
            <li> I tried it on fleece and I was surprised it took off all the &amp;#34;fabric balls&amp;#34; in a few swipes.  Let the blades do the work without pressing down on it too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Blades were sharp (not sure how long this will last though). Also a good amount of power.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  If you use the unit face down (blade down), the balls that get shaved (gigidy) get caught/clogged in the &amp;#34;trap&amp;#34;. Just make sure you clean it out regularly.</li>
            <li> I had researched through the variety of fabric shavers and read all the reviews.  This one was the top one that met my needs.  It is lightweight, large enough holes without pulling in the fabric, and easy to use.  With the larger (not enormous) holes, the battery life is extended.  I sometimes catch myself finding items I have had for awhile and realizing they need to be &#x27;shaved&#x27;.  My only desire would to have a larger lint catcher as this one is narrow.  Otherwise, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> i bought it for my girlfriend after washing her sweaters with clothes i should not have she has been able to remove the fuzzys off those sweaters and more she loves it only complaint is holes are a little small and lint trap needs emptied often but it works great</li>
            <li> But you just have to make sure you shave lightly. If not then the results are sad, which maybe a hole in your favorit cardigan sweater.</li>
            <li> crap. i did not like it. It did not work. Could not clean my coat, had to throw it away</li>
            <li> Received quick and in good condition. Have used and to works well. We can retire the old one now that we have had for the past 15 yrs.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to receive it so I could shave off all the nubs on my winter jacket and the rest of our clothes!  It worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> Did what it said perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a fabric shaver forever, and all the ones I get have destroyed a bunch of my underwear and made wholes to my  tops.&lt;br /&gt;This one was my last try to get a good one, and finally I this one does work perfectly. Yes clothing gets stuck on the razors if you pressure it to close, but still this has happened to me and the fabric hasn&#x27;t even ripped.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I would buy another and would recommend.  Works great on most fabrics.  I have been warned against trying on delicates.  Makes your clothes look new again.</li>
            <li> I got a little overzealous with one of my sweaters and put a hole in it.  It does remove the pilling, just be careful not to over-do it.</li>
            <li> It is a nice product.  The price is reasonable and it does a nice job on my sweaters.  One note of caution, be careful on fine fabrics and it will pull the material.  Overall, it does the job.</li>
            <li> I bought this thing because I have a terrible fuzz problem with all of my tights/leggings and a couple dresses. It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to and quickly shaves the little fabric bumps right off the clothes. A+</li>
            <li> This little guy has a lot of power. It&#x27;s definitely too powerful for light fabric so you have to be careful. Otherwise this tool is so cool.</li>
            <li> ...and people with OCD should be wary.  (You&#x27;ll see why.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all of the reviews here and got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on an older zip-up sweat shirt I had that was quite pilly all over and it was gone and looking like new in a couple of minutes.  I then started looking around for pills on everything and using it.  I even took off some pills that appear on the inside of sneakers after a while.  Sure, there was absolutely no reason to do that but...  I did.  And then I started using it on this blanket and that&#x27;s when I stopped because that would take forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this on all sorts of fabric types and thicknesses and it&#x27;s worked wonderfully.  I haven&#x27;t yet encountered the problem of it pulling in very thin fabrics but I also make sure to hold the areas very taut while working so as to avoid making holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was definitely worth the money (and then some).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of these devices over the years to remove pilling from clothes.  This is definitely one of the best that I have used so far.  It&#x27;s small and compact, yet works well for even large scale depilling from clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, it won&#x27;t last forever... but who cares... the price is right and it works well for what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li> I love this peorduct it was exactly what I needed to remove lint from my clothes without any harm to my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Great tool to have and I could never find it in any store.</li>
            <li> Depending on how badly pilled, it may take a while to shave a sweater.&lt;br /&gt;I have shaved several thick sweaters and they look so much better.&lt;br /&gt;I may try some thinner sweaters... seems like you would have to be shaving a super thin sweater or push down pretty hard to make holes.&lt;br /&gt;Stock up on AA batteries... this goes through them fast.</li>
            <li> The thing is, when a shirt piles, it typically does so all over. The flaw I find in this is that I find my self spending forever, working on one top, stopping several times to empty it. Then I look at it after 10 minutes and see how much more I have to go. Another issue is, lint gets stuck behind the blade, and when you see how it is set up it is nearly impossible to safely remove sometimes. I really don&#x27;t see myself getting much use of this on items like shirts or blouses. Socks and underwear... maybe.</li>
            <li> Used once and metal grate just broke. I&#x27;m gonna try it again, but this was ridiculous. Not happy! I bought it as a gift.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well if you lay the fabric down on a hard surface to use it. It saved a sweater for me that I was ready to get rid of due to severe pilling.</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than it works. If you need a fabric shaver, this is a good cost effective model to choose from.</li>
            <li> Not as good a deviceas the other gadget I have used.  You have to bear down with it in order for it to do the job.</li>
            <li> This is a great little fabric shaver! Has lots of power and took away all of the balls that appeared on my sweater after I washed it the first time!  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I had one of these when I was younger and recently had a couple of sweaters that were in rough shape. This shaver arrived quickly and worked very well! I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase and cannot wait to use it to make my other clothes look like new.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about this product? It does a fairly good job on heavy items eg: a coat....but on thinner finer fabric it can tend to pull. On a knit sweater it doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all. I purchased for my hubby and he seems to like it but I don&#x27;t think it will be something I will use.</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver works great. I have had it for over a year now and it still works perfectly! A must have.</li>
            <li> Extremely easy to use. I got remarkable results on using it on my jacket with piffs. The body is plastic - I hope the blades in the shaver last long.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!  This product is so easy to use. In many of the reviews I read complained of holes being made in the garments, that was not the case for me. I use to get the fuzz off my delicate VS bras and I also used it ruffly on a couple of sweaters. No holes! I wish I had this product a long time ago. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one for years and just now bought another to take on trips etc.  works great.  simple to use and simple to clean out.</li>
            <li> Great investment! And cheap! I shaved about 10 sweaters when I got this and the batteries are still good. The sweaters look much better after shaving them. It works well and I haven&#x27;t had any problem with it sucking up the sweater and making holes. I&#x27;ve used it on both thick and thin wool sweaters, as well as a cotton pillow. It helps to empty the bin frequently to keep the suction working.</li>
            <li> Be careful, it may rip clothing.  Do not use on very delicate fabrics.  It was not expensive and worked as expected.</li>
            <li> I got this to help with a pea coat I got from a friend. It worked miracles! The pilling is gone and some of the extra fuzz that collected from other fabrics has disappeared as well. It&#x27;s a bit noisy like an electric razor but totally worth it. It doesn&#x27;t hurt if it touches your skin, so you&#x27;re safe there. I got really curious and rubbed it while it was running on my fingers and the back of my hand. I&#x27;d say you&#x27;d have to be careful with thinner garments and delicate material. I used it on a wool pea coat and it&#x27;s fine! But I feel like some of the thinner sweaters and many shirts may get eaten through. I would test this on something heavy duty like a coat first before moving on to the delicates.</li>
            <li> This was a great investment. I won&#x27;t dare complain about the price. I plan on buying another one because my mother has kidnapped mine.</li>
            <li> Considered this is very affordable and inexpensive it made my old pilled sweater look much better! Definitely worth it! Great product.</li>
            <li> It works well. Shaved a few sweaters with it and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be failing yet.&lt;br /&gt;just have to be careful not to eject the the shavings storage otherwise you will also need a lint roller.</li>
            <li> I purchased this fabric shaver for the pills that were forming on my flannel sheets and for the occasional shedding sweater. This device definitely does its job and nicks those pills right off. It&#x27;s battery operated and I have only used it several times, so I&#x27;m not sure of how much battery life the shaver eats up but so far it hasn&#x27;t slowed down with use at all. One thing I did notice is that more pills are removed with more force on the item because I kept on going over the same sections with no avail and realized I had to be more aggressive with it. I was a bit wary because I thought if I pushed it too forcefully on the fabric, it might cut the fabric but nothing at all. Its also very miniature, which is great for things like travel. But when trying to shave the pills off a king sized sheet set, it makes you want the shaver&#x27;s surface area to be bigger. But other than that, no complaints - works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is supposed to do. I&#x27;ve only used it like three times, so I can&#x27;t speak for durability, but each time I have used it, it worked well.</li>
            <li> I have used this on one of my most pilly sweaters and it did a great job.  Was easy to operate.  The lint compartment falls off easy, however and you have to empty often.</li>
            <li> It was a good price for a decent product. Shaves the little nubbles off my clothes just they way I need it to.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for over a year...its difficult to find these...I found this one at Walgreens and paid a lot more then I could get it here... I did not realize amazon carried it... it works great on thick sweaters .....the bally stuff from the material accumulates quickly inside the chambers ,so you can see its shaving very well... the only problem I have had sometimes it stops if the fuzz ball is too large to shave.....so I make sure its turned off....so I can remove the fuzz ball and start all over again.....it sure is easier then using the rollers...and it does a better job....just be careful with thin material because it could get damaged ....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it a 6-7 out 10. It does work, however it does not get as close as I&#x27;d like. Its more like a hair cut.  The thinner the cotton, the better it works.  Works enough to make a sweater or socks not visibly nubby from afar :)</li>
            <li> This works on all my clothing with those little beads of cloth on them after a lot of washing or chaffing. I would recommend it to anyone. It has never destroyed my clothing, it has only left it feeling smoother than I found it and I&#x27;ve owned it for over a year.</li>
            <li> I never ordered this fabric shaver before because...?? This is one seriously powerful little fabric shaver! I&#x27;ve had more expensive ones that didn&#x27;t even come close! I absolutely love it! My pea coat and a bunch of my sweaters look brand new again! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It does aln excellent job.</li>
            <li> I just recieved this and gave it a test run. It may be early, but I am hooked! I am in the process of getting my daughter&#x27;s old baby clothes ready for a consignment sale and I bought this to freshen up the items that were looking more worn. After using it on 10 articles of clothes I have to say I am impressed. It does a great job of de-fuzzing, shaving the top of the fabric, and pulling pills, and stray threads free. I read other reviews about it leaving holes, and I can see how that might happen if you pressed too hard as the metal shield is flexible. However, there is really no pressure required if you glide the shaver (I found doing it in circles helped too) there are no problems so far! A flat surface helps or put your hand behind the fabric you are working with. All in all a great tool! It made old items look new again!</li>
            <li> I like this fabric shaver because it takes off those annoying pills. It works nicely and it helps make my sweaters look better. But it takes a while to do one sweater (20 mins) and it doesn&#x27;t get everything. Your sweaters will look ALMOST like new, but not quiet.</li>
            <li> I needed to clean up some sweaters so I ordered this.  It is great.  I have been going around the house and using it on my husband&#x27;s stuff, my couch, my sweaters and even pairs of pants.  I feel like an accomplished housekeeper maintaining my possessions with this easy to use and very portable product.</li>
            <li> Works really well except the lint keeps getting stuck in the top portion because there appears to be a sort of bottleneck going into the lint resovoir. This just means I need to keep cleaning it out constantly as I use it. Will probably not buy again but fine in the meantime.</li>
            <li> Starts off strong for 20 seconds then gets very weak. Its worth what you pay for it.</li>
            <li> Very great product. Does the job it says it will do and hasn&#x27;t torn any of my clothing. I use it on everything now and would recommend to anyone. Though I would suggest to look around your local store for one before buying it online.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t very effective in removing a lot of pills. This was the first one I&#x27;ve ever purchased but I&#x27;ve used others that work a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> The product is working well.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and gets the job done.  It&#x27;s also easy to clean, which is important.</li>
            <li> The product works as stated but the container that collects the fuzz could stand to be larger. The other concern is that the fuzz seems to gather around the top and not &#x27;go down&#x27; into the collector. Otherwise, decent product.</li>
            <li> You can certainly get bigger and better fabric shavers but for light duty and inexpensive this really gets it done. IF you have materials that get those little white balls on them this&#x27;ll do the trick. Be careful not to push down too much on light fabrics though.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, item is described accurately, and it is very efficient and durable.</li>
            <li> I work with vintage clothing and of course have my own favorite clothes that I wear time and time again. I found this to be excellent in its usage detatching pills etc. It was a little different to get used to the style. With the elongated handle I didn&#x27;t feel I had as much control.I&#x27;m giving it a 4 only for that reason.</li>
            <li> An excellent little clothes shaver you can take anywhere. I bought 2 of them!</li>
            <li> Good product, as advertised. Service was excellent.</li>
            <li> This does take off most fabric nubs.  But it can be very time consuming to do.  Need to keep going back and forth.</li>
            <li> Takes off most of the unwanted fabric parts sticking out. Does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> This item works as advertised. It&#x27;s smaller than I expected but very usable as is -- you should just empty the fuzz collector more often.  I have seen a one star review of this product suggesting that it ruins delicate fabric but, in all fairness, the instructions do warn not to use on delicate fabrics because the fabric may be ruined, so, I think one can say that the gadget works as one would expect it to if you&#x27;ve read the instructions ;)</li>
            <li> This thing works like magic.</li>
            <li> Works A-OK for shaving pills off of sweaters and ski hats. The battery door and lint trap door barely stays clipped on however. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the 9 bucks I paid for it but I don&#x27;t expect it to last very long.</li>
            <li> This little machine gets the job done. All of the reviewers who complained of how easy the battery cover and shaving collector fall off were 100% correct. But, for the price, I&#x27;m not too concerned about the issue. I rehabbed a $400 sweater in about 30 minutes of careful shaving. TIP: make sure to hold the clothing taught while shaving (everyone is right about this aspect as well). Overall, I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
            <li> Really works great, brings new life to things that looked worn out due to pilling.</li>
            <li> I have never owned a fabric shaver so I have nothing to compare it too but this was so cheap &amp; got the job done. I am including some before and after pictures of a loved sweater that I was about to toss until I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> It works,  but not super powerful,  takes a really long time to achieve desired effect.</li>
            <li> Great find for a great price.</li>
            <li> Works great! So far i used it on a sweatshirt and a pair of leggings that i was embarassed to wear because of all the pills on them. It did a fantastic job without taking too much time!</li>
            <li> Works great... removes all the fabric balls and lint easily... the only con is that the transparent cover which holds the lint is a little bit flimsy... other than that is a must have in every house...</li>
            <li> Small, easy-to-use, and efficient!</li>
            <li> Worked great on my favorite sweater.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!! I recommend this to everyone... Very Good...</li>
            <li> Nothing special. It does what it says it&#x27;s going to do, no better or worse than other ones that I have owned.</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver works great for removing stubbly fuzzies that are stuck to the outside of sweaters and hoodies. It takes a long time, and can shred the material if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> Works great. My wife is thrilled. DO NOT USE TO SHAVE YOUR FACIAL HAIR. 😅</li>
            <li> I love this!! Use it on sweater and pants. have even used it on blankets!!!! I had a smaller one that I had before and it dropped it and broke it, but this one was cheaper and works better</li>
            <li> Just received it today and I love it! I used it on two pairs of my dress pants that look like some Velcro pulled up the fabric into a balled up and unpleasant mess. Now instead of buying new pants, they look like new! I didn&#x27;t have any issue with it grabbing at the fabric or making holes.</li>
            <li> For the money, wow! What a powerful, little fabric shaver and I am so happy we got it! It works so well!</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I had hoped. Barely took any fuzz off items.</li>
            <li> super product...gives 2nd life to pilled sweaters!  Love it.</li>
            <li> Works well but not perfectly: will remove pills from sweaters but not all of them to create a &#x27;renewed&#x27; look, Glad I got it though as it does help. It also seems gentle on clothes.</li>
            <li> my mom loves this thing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I bought this to shave off the pills on my sweaters and couches, but it doesn&#x27;t work all that great. It doesn&#x27;t get the big stuff, and I feel like I have to go over the same spots again and again. I get the same results from a pumice stone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lint shaver... It works very well, and it is exactly what we needed to save some of our clothes.</li>
            <li> Great item. Thumbs up</li>
            <li> it is ok, not the greatest.</li>
            <li> this thing didn&#x27;t really work...</li>
            <li> This is a powerful lil&#x27; gadget and works as described.  I&#x27;ve used it on sweaters and furniture; it has worked wonders.</li>
            <li> It does take away fizz on my sweaters and make them look like new.  Good product, I will buy it again</li>
            <li> fuzz tends to clog up between rotary blades and clear container - have to stop frequently to clear out the blockage</li>
            <li> Love this! Makes your knotted up sweaters and sweatshirts look like new. Had one a while ago and the blades finally dulled, had a hard time finding this so I ordered two.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok. You have to go over an area several times to get all the fuzzier off. I previously had a $4 fabric shaver that worked much better so was a little disappointed by this $10 shaver.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t, just don&#x27;t. If researching this product, you are obviously looking for a bargain lint shaver. This is not it. This one is just cheap. It broke 2nd use. Try the Fritz brand for bargains.</li>
            <li> Ok so I know this is just a fuzz shaver but I have been removing 40 years of fuzz from my husband&#x27;s afghan and this did not do the job.  There are several things I dislike about this item:&lt;br /&gt;1. The blade is not removable and you cannot remove the fuzz behind it easily or hardly at all without a toothpick and a lot of effort.&lt;br /&gt;2. The battery cover does not snap on tightly and comes off very easily and frequently during use.&lt;br /&gt;3. The fuzz container also comes open quite easily and frequently during use.&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried using this on sweaters or any other clothing so I cannot say how it would work on that but I have an Evercare brand shaver and it is great. I have used it on this blanket and clothing and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was SO happy with this purchase!  Until a month or two later when the blades got so dull, its not even useable anymore.  BIG bummer!</li>
            <li> Great for removing the pells on sweaters or any clothing that gets balls of fabric from wear.  Works especially well on sweaters, sweat shirts, leggings, or anything knit.</li>
            <li> Very good.  Shipping was fast and the product works nicely. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Works great, makes clothes look like new again.  No problems. Easy to clean, easy to change batteries.</li>
            <li> I had many pairs of Lululemon workout pants and they pill terribly around the thighs. I asked one of my yoga friends if hers do the same and she said yes, and that she uses a sweater shaver to remove the pills. Well I&#x27;m addicted to this little tool now and I love removing the pills from pajama pants, tights, workout pants and even some tops that have pilled. Works great!!!</li>
            <li> My husband finally has a crisp and clean looking coat because of this great tool.  Just make certain, while using it to continually empty out the fuzz that collects.  Also this takes 2 AA BATTERIES, so make certain to order some, too.</li>
            <li> Good product. Sometimes I have to push a little on the sweater and go over the same spot a few times, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The reason I cut one star out because it didn&#x27;t cut all thing in one time. I have repeat the same area for 2-3 time. To make my sweater look new.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway Love it. It can be open all the part to clean.</li>
            <li> Put a small hole in the fabric, a real thin cotton.  However, it did take the fuzzy off.  Luckily it was at the bottom of a summer dress I mostly wear outside.  I&#x27;m hoping for better results on my sweaters.</li>
            <li> This is very cheaply made.  Fell apart the first time I tried to use it.  Then it cut the shirt I was using it on.  Very disappointed and then I waited to long to return it and now I&#x27;m stuck with it.  Not happy!!</li>
            <li> This product is really amazing.I got it from T.J.Max and it was just six dollars that time i didn&#x27;t know about this product .But when i used it i was so happy.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product.  I had sweaters that were unwearable because of &amp;#34;nubbies&amp;#34;, and now I can wear them again.&lt;br /&gt;I would refer this product to any of my friends</li>
            <li> This does a good job of removing the fuzzies, but it also munched a little hole in the middle of my sweater. If I had it to do over, I would spring for a little more expensive one.</li>
            <li> Works very well although I must say that if you need to do a large area you may want to consider a larger unit. But for the price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Being from an old Italian family, the lint balls (or pellini) as we call they really bug us. I cant stand the feel of them and they just make me look dirty. I was being lazy and didnt want to go to the store so I checked amazon  as usual and sure enough I added this to my cart because of the recognizable name and low price combination. I could not be happier, the blades are razor sharp and it powers through the lint like no other.</li>
            <li> Absolute cheap crap! Barely worked from the start, then stopped barely working after about 10 minutes of use. Unfortunately I waited to long so I cannot return it. My plan is to place it under the tire of my Subaru or pound it with a rock for cathartic release of my rage. Will never purchase another Remington product again. Boycott companies that produce this landfill!</li>
            <li> Does its job by removing pills....somewhat. Not very impressed, however I am not sure that a pill remover exists that will truly take off all of the pilled fabric without damaging the item. I used this right away on a nice shirt of mine and did not lay the shirt out flat enough so it made a hole. This was definitely my fault, but BEWARE and practice on an item that you don&#x27;t mind if it gets damaged!</li>
            <li> I thought this was great until I used it on a lightweight sweater and it quickly put a big hole in it to the point that I had to throw the sweater out. I wish I had read the other reviews that it is only good on heavier materials. The holes are large and the blades are very close to the screen. Considering it&#x27;s mainly the more delicate clothing that I have that pills, this will get limited use.</li>
            <li> It worked on my leggings and white tanks. I&#x27;m happy about this product, don&#x27;t press to hard so you wouldn&#x27;t damage your cloths.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter as a small advent gift.  She is thrilled!!!!  Who knew such a small, inexpensive item could make someone that happy.  She did one of her coats, first thing, and said it came out beautifully.  Now for the winter sweaters....Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Have had  a Remington fabric shaver for many many years and always worked perfectly. So when wanted to buy another one for a gift this was the logical buy!.</li>
            <li> It works well... Great price. Just wish the lint catcher held a little more....all in all it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Always surprised how light weight the new products have become and feel flimsy.  It works well for my light weight sweaters.  Good product for price.</li>
            <li> I just got this fabric shaver last night and was looking forward to use on a few things I have put aside. But this morning when I put the new batteries it just didn&#x27;t work. I wrote the manufacturer to see if there is a batch that it is on recall or something. I have read a few reviews with similar issues, but seeing the great amount of good reviews you could think they were just one of those unlucky purchases. Well, I guess I am one of them now. I am planing to return it, but I don&#x27;t know how it will work with all this policy of unopened or in the original package, since this one you have to actually break (the package) in order to get out the product. I would not buy it again or recommended. I previously owned an Emerson which worked very well until my 18 months child decided to crash it against the floor. Maybe I will have to go with the old known, better than the new to be known.</li>
            <li> ok for small jobs.  does its job as listed in instructions  easy to handle and use.  no more fuzzies on sleeves.</li>
            <li> do not think for this price you can find something so useful.&lt;br /&gt;It works to perfection.&lt;br /&gt;It seems a little delicate, but is working perfectly and my wife gives everyday use!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that this would work the amazing way that it did.  I bought this about 2 years ago and it still works.  I took about a half dozen sweaters that I loved, but were filled with pills and returned them to new.  I use this all the time.  It&#x27;s quick and efficient.  I find it works best if you put the sweater on a hard flat surface.  Wonderful buy and can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> It works ok on some materials, but it is a slow and time consuming process and doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all on other materials. The motor is disappointingly weak and it occasionally jams and has to be turned off and back on again.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I had a cheap pillow case that pilled a lot. I was considering throwing it away but I really liked the pillow case so this was my last resort. This item worked so well! It was smooth and precise on the fabric and its shape and size make it easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I believe this is a great product. It does it&#x27;s job and just like every else says there are some small, very small concerns.  Such as don&#x27;t use this on light/weak material. It has a hard time for big pieces of lint so don&#x27;t get for heavy lint material. Best use for medium to small size lint (small as in a pencil dot and big as in a big size ant. lol) The type of material obviously always matters too but it can pretty much work on everything.</li>
            <li> This guy just does the work it is supposed to do. I can&#x27;t stop bringing back to life old sweaters! I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Powerful really does the job used on linen bar chairs that had pills all over really cleaned up nicely!  Recomended</li>
            <li> I did not know such things exist and was very happy to stumble upon this solution. Have been able to get a few sweaters back in to shape using this. I don&#x27;t have problem following the directions, and haven&#x27;t run into much issues. I don&#x27;t think you should hold it in one spot and let it stay too long.</li>
            <li> I love my new fabric shaver! It sucks up all the pills and fuzz; my old sweaters look good as new! You must be very careful to hold it straight up and down and go slowly while using it or it the blades will catch the fabric. I got a small hole in the arm of one sweater because I tilted the shaver, but it&#x27;s nothing a stitch can&#x27;t fix. Overall, I&#x27;m one hundred percent pleased with this. I highly recommend it to all sweater lovers!</li>
            <li> This is a great compact version of the clothes shaver I had years ago.  If it wasn&#x27;t for the battery cover and blue compartment coming off so easily during use, I would have rated this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love this fabric shaver! I bought it to remove lint off some hoodies and sweatpants and it brought my clothes back to life and made them look practically new. I had no issues with it damaging any of my clothing and I used it across a variety of fabrics.</li>
            <li> Love it a little! It&#x27;s a good shaver, I think I need a new blade. Would be nice if it came with an extra blade or options to purchase extra blades. Not sure if available now!</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim since it was so cheap, but I have to say its works great and it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before settling on this fabric shaver. Many of them have poor reviews, stating the units broke quickly or they ate holes through people&#x27;s sweaters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this unit for a couple months now and have used it on a variety of fabrics, including fleece, sweaters, and even my sofa. After using the shaver on several items without incident, I decided to grab an old sock and see if I could make this unit eat a hole through the material (as some reviews state). I pressed fairly hard on the sock but aside from trimming off all of the little \\&quot;nubbies,\\&quot; the unit did not penetrate the material any further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still on my original set of batteries and have done probably 20 or so sweaters, along with various other items. This unit does exactly what it should and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My wife had an expensive coat with &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; all over the arms after one year of use.  I purchased this little guy and was able to restore the coat to brand new condition in about 10 minutes.  Great investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Cheap, effective&lt;br /&gt;Cons: minor lint build-up under rotating blades, which should be cleaned periodically.  (not enough to bring it down to 4 stars)</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver is okay, but I thought I ordered the bigger one....I should have read better.  This will do the job, but it takes a longer time to do it.  Next time I will order the larger one....but it works okay for smaller things.</li>
            <li> super cheap. feel and looks like from the dollar store! recieved broken so never even got a chance to use! garbage!</li>
            <li> I bought this to shave the little fuzzy pills off my sweaters, and it works great without any damage to the sweaters.  It makes my clothes look like new!</li>
            <li> Very useful device and it helped me lot in removing the lints from one of my black shirts that came from the inside of a jacket.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful on clothing and the price was very good. I highly recommend this product to anyone interested in buying a product of this nature.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but pilling on some favorite sweaters made me desperate.  It works like a charm! Totally recommend!</li>
            <li> Good product, works well, easy to use and to hold, requires batteries, not too large, good price, recommend to anyone for lint removal</li>
            <li> Got this included in another purchase for less than 10 bucks. It does the job well for the most part. I only have 2 major complaints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It seems to get fuzz clogged in the area under the blades, preventing some of the fuzz from getting into the clear &amp;#34;waste&amp;#34; container. This just requires cleaning out more frequently than I would like, which leads me to #2...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The &amp;#34;waste&amp;#34; is sometimes easily opened while gripping the device. This has only happened a few times to me, and I think I&#x27;ve trained myself to hold it differently. But it should be noted; no one wants the fuzz going everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a decent device that was discounted nicely, so 3 stars isn&#x27;t too bad considering its just for occasional use.</li>
            <li> Used it as soon as it arrived. It works like a charm. No rips on any of the fleeces or sweaters I&#x27;ve used it on.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful. Goof size and it is easy to use I just wished it was much more powerful however.</li>
            <li> This did the exact job I bought it for, regardless of the fact that it&#x27;s so cheap. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever done a product review!  I&#x27;m doing one now because this product actually, honestly, really works!  I didn&#x27;t take any before and after photos because they would have looked just like the ones sent in by previous owners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for the heck of it, I shaved a little hair on my leg and you know what?  It actually shaved the hair on my leg!</li>
            <li> One downside to my love of vintage sweaters is pilling, but this fabric shaver makes them look new again!  It takes a little while to go over large areas, but it&#x27;s worth it.  Just be careful that your garment is completely smoothed out and pulled taught to avoid shaving a hole through it.</li>
            <li> Product works good, Priced well.  My children are using it daily.  I saved three sweaters,  they look like new.  Love the product.</li>
            <li> Works great to get rid of fuzzies on sweaters, jackets, and my down-alternative comforter. Be sure not to press it directly into the fabric. You should only lightly hover over the fabric. One time it stopped working and I was sure it broke. However, it was just a little clogged up with fluff. I had to take the top off and clean everything out. After that it started working again.</li>
            <li> This little machine works great! It does remove that stubborn lint that forms after many washes.  It leaves your clothing looking great and I do recommend this shaver.  The only drawback is that the manufacturer did not put to much thought into the housing of this unit, meaning that the small blue door which houses the lint falls off relatively easy, making it somewhat frustrating to hold the shaver and the door at the same time so that the door doesn&#x27;t land on the floor!</li>
            <li> I had couple sweatshirts that had pills all over them and this thing did the trick. I thought it might tear through the fabric so I tried it on a pair of thin-ish athletic socks first and it worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clothes don&#x27;t look brand new, but they do look a heck of a lot better, which makes this fabric shaver worth it. I had been looking for a fabric shaver for a few weeks and stumbled upon this one locally.  It&#x27;s decent enough that I wrote a review about it.</li>
            <li> It works fine not the best but it does the job, just past it over twice on the fabric. Remington brand make good quality ones, I was just in a rush to get one, but usually go with ones that have the shaving holes bigger because it will pick up more fuzz.</li>
            <li> This product lets me shave pills off of my stocking caps and other pilly things to make them look and feel new again... and that is awesome.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for. Felt cheap and i thought I was breaking it when i was putting in the batteries. After I turn it on and try it on the first sock it kept getting caught and I kept having to hit it a few times for it to go. Half way down the FIRST sock it got caught on its final fuzzy because no love tap could get the thing running again.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done. But the part that holds the lint and the batter over comes off sometimes when you are using it. Those things are not a big deal for me.</li>
            <li> love this little thing, might order another one, wish there was free shipping though&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;used this on winter hats and gloves which had gotten fuzzy/linty, leaves them looking new</li>
            <li> I really loved this little guy while it was still working, but I&#x27;ve had it three months and it died completely.  I&#x27;ve kept it from gunking up with fuzz and such, but it still just died out of nowhere.  Too bad.  If it wasn&#x27;t crappy, it would have been money well spent. It does rip some lighter fabrics if you don&#x27;t pull it as tight as you can, but it was also great at removing pilling. Too bad</li>
            <li> Used this on some flannel sheets that were pilling...they are like new.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This in one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made on Amazon- a total \\&quot;must have\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve been using it one every kind of fabric and it has renewed all the items. So far it is delicate on clothes and does its job great. I would totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> The Fabric Shaver works well but the fuz often gets stuck behind the blades and does not go through to the receptacle.  It has to be taken apart to unblock the area just before the receptacle.  It is not a big deal but is a little time consuming.  Next time, I would choose a different model.  My old one (which was more of a square shape) never had this problem.</li>
            <li> I totally dislike lint balls on clothes or socks.  This lint remover is a good one because some don&#x27;t get the lint balls off effectively.</li>
            <li> This is a better product than the shaver that you can plug into the wall.  Does not have too big holes that tear your clothes.  Just does the job.</li>
            <li> Great little device to remove those annoying &#x27;pills&#x27; on sweaters! Shape makes it easy and comfortable to use and hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better fabric shavers.  This one is okay.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  The fabric tends to snag on it.</li>
            <li> I looked at several fabric shavers and actually owned two other kinds before trying this one.  I can&#x27;t tell you how much I have used this since buying it!  I have used it on pants, sweaters, sheets,blankets, bras, etc.  It doesn&#x27;t damage the clothing and really does clean up all of the &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This does work, but is a little bit delicate. Handle carefully so as not to break it. Good for sweaters.</li>
            <li> Works much better than similar gadgets I&#x27;ve purchased in mass retail stores. Much gentler on delicate knits, but still powerful and effective on dense wools and cashmere.</li>
            <li> we gave it a 4 star since it works great with a good motor (assuming you used good batteries). It can shave the fuzzies. If you are looking into shaving large fuzzies, then you might need to look/consider a larger shaver since this one is a compact/travel size.</li>
            <li> I would buy this over and over again if I needed to.  It works great, and it is super cheap, so if it breaks then no biggie!  But so far it has been working fine!</li>
            <li> USED DAILY. VERY POWERFUL. NO SNAGS LIKE OTHERS ON THE MARKET. REASONABLE AND RELIABLE. I WOULD BUY THIS AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;DOESN&#x27;T KILL THE BATTERIES TOO QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> This product worked once for 1/4 of a hoodie and hasn&#x27;t worked since. Changed batteries three times hoping that was the issue but it wasn&#x27;t. Worked great when it was functioning ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once but it did what I expected it to.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. Purchased it for my couch, which was covered in little fabric balls. The couch looks new.</li>
            <li> This is so cool. Turns my old clothes new again!</li>
            <li> Loved my Sporty Sweat Shirt, Washed it twice- and it came out covered in impossible to remove lint, looked like it had white spots all over.&lt;br /&gt;I tried picking at them, but how in the world are you ever gonna get the whole sweat shirt done,&lt;br /&gt;I kinda came across this product by accident, never knew these things existed and decided to try it out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put the batteries in, put the head to the fabric...and it DIDNT DO A DARN THING.&lt;br /&gt;I was like what the heck, it wasnt shaving a single bit of lint.&lt;br /&gt;and then (Head smack)...i realised that the head and a clear plastic cap on it&lt;br /&gt;and its easy to miss...so yeah :- TAKE THE CLEAR CAP OF first\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I did that, I was amazed and how well this work...and yeah it cleared the lint right up, it will take a while to do....but ill take that over a linty sweat shirt any day</li>
            <li> So far so good.  It really has helped remove all the lint balls from my slacks and workout clothes.  It is easy to use and easy to remove and dispose of the lint.  Only thing is I have no idea how to replace the blades once they become dull.  I know from past experience will other lint remover there is a good chance I will need them.  Until then this shaver is getting the job done.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver! I recently purchased the giant shaver &amp; it just wasn&#x27;t doing the job. Yeah! No More Fuzz Balls!</li>
            <li> I will be returning .. This has ripped holes n 2 pair of expensive Victoria Secret Sweat Pants .. When especially I was barely tapping it against fabric it grabbed n tore them .. Not worth money should&#x27;ve spent a lil more to buy a better shaver .. Not had any probs. out of any merchandise purchased before from amazon</li>
            <li> I ordered two of them and one of them was damaged - one of the side hooks to hold the transparent cover to the lint repository on was broken.  It works well - I just had to tape it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t get one sooner, this is an awesome product! I feel like I have all new clothes and it&#x27;s addictive to use. This is as essential as an iron! Fast service and neat packaging, I would definitely recommend owning one!</li>
            <li> This little gadget is fantastic!  Works amazingly well</li>
            <li> I have had a few different shavers over the years, but this one works better than all the others.  I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my existing fabric shaver, which suddenly stopped working. The Remington fabric shaver is a great replacement. It&#x27;s easy to hold and gets rid of pilling easily. You do have to apply lighter pressure when using it on lighter weight fabrics but it definitely does the job</li>
            <li> Made my furniture look like new again.  Just had to empty the little reservoir pretty often. Watch out when you clean the top out that you dont loose the little blades.  They come out pretty easily and the first time I just unscrewed the top and shook it in the trash can.  The blades fell out and I had to dig in the trash to find them.</li>
            <li> Favorite sweaters needed help and a friend at work recommended this product whihc works great and refreshes much loved sweaters</li>
            <li> I use it for shaving the stuff on cheap bed sheets that build up around our house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a tedious process but it works and the little bugger does what it was intended to, no complaints and for a great price.</li>
            <li> For less than ten bucks I just revitalized all my favorite sweaters and even some old jackets. Efficient, super easy to clean, straightforward design... I couldn&#x27;t be happier! It does use a lot of battery power so I would recommend using rechargeable batteries with it -- but I feel like in this day and age, most of us should already have those on hand. Would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I like being able to spruce up older sweaters and sweat shirts! It is small enough to pack in my suitcase! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Not sure what other folks are doing, but this has worked brilliantly on everything. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a cheap and powerful lint remover.</li>
            <li> Works really well on pilling pants, sweaters, etc.  I&#x27;ve bought two already because I lost one, and they both worked great.</li>
            <li> THIS SIMPLE LITTLE TOOL CAN MAKE THE MOST PILLED UP RATTY LOOKING SWEATER LOOK BRAND NEW!  I HAD ONE YEARS AGO THAT I SOMEHOW LOST &amp; WAS THRILLED TO SEE AMAZON HAD ONE.  MY WAREROBE WOULDN&#x27;T BE WITHOUT IT !</li>
            <li> This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because my favorite sweater looked dingy.&lt;br /&gt;I ran this over those spots where the fabric had balled up on and it made it look BRAND NEW!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great product and I will definitely be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> This handheld fabric shaver has saved a lot of my clothes. I&#x27;ve had an issue with my black clothes pilling and that showing up as I wear them to work. However, with this shaver, it was extremely easy to clean them up and make them look brand new! I&#x27;ve used it on some of my more delicate fabrics and it didn&#x27;t destroy the material. I would suggest starting off with a small area and seeing how much it picks up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> This thing works just as advertised, and it is relatively inexpensive.  No need to spend a lot of money to get a fabric shaver that works.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of a fellow needle felter. There are just some projects that stay fuzzy because of the nature of the kind of fibers used. I don&#x27;t use it often, but it always works well, and it&#x27;s easy to empty.</li>
            <li> I have always had a Remington Battery Operated Fabric Shaver and this new one is just as good.  It operates very well and I am most pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Had to send back. Stops working as soon as it hits a pill on a sweater. Total crap. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I&#x27;d give it 0 stars if that was an option.</li>
            <li> Yeah, same problem as others stated, it can cut you underwear, socks or really thin T shirts. Carefully place it perpendicular to the fabric would help.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of removing pills from my cashmere sweaters.  I chose this because it has larger storage capacity than others which is convenient because you don&#x27;t have to keep emptying it for one job.  This is a replacement for a similar one (unknown brand) which lasted 20+ years.  I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is my second sweater shaver, and I&#x27;m glad to have it.  I looked around in my local stores for a while before finally buying online, and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.  For the price, it does a great job, and with the clear container it&#x27;s easy to tell when it&#x27;s time to empty.</li>
            <li> This does a very good job and feels very comfortable in your hand. Easy to use and easy to empty.</li>
            <li> one of the blades came off after first use, didn&#x27;t work properly</li>
            <li> Works perfect! Gets a lot of use!</li>
            <li> This little gadget has been a great help with my wardrobe. It removes &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; from any kind of fabric. Its helped me keep some of my favorite knitwear.  When this one wears out - I will buy another one.</li>
            <li> I got this for my babies woolie covers, but I ended up spending the entire day defuzzing this huge sweater I love that&#x27;s gotten out of control. this was waay too small for such a big project, but it actually did a great job, tho tedious. it&#x27;ll be great for small projects tho. I was constantly having to empty the little lint catch and the batteries lasted a long time. even after such a big project the blades r still sharp.</li>
            <li> Was not as impressed as I was told this would be.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, for the little amount of time I use it, it is ok&lt;br /&gt;I will saved it got me out of a jam once. I had a brand new shirt I was going to sell until I saw a snag on it. I used this shaver and it cut the snag off without leaving a hole and saved the day</li>
            <li> I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work when I received it but sure enough, this works perfectly! Very surprising how much lint ends up in the reservoir! Will definitely buy again if this one dies.</li>
            <li> cheap , last and does the job. I bought this for my wife. needless to say she was very very impressed with its price and performance</li>
            <li> The blade seems a little weak but it seems to be doing the trick thus far and it has removed the bulk of the little fuzz balls on my comforter.</li>
            <li> PURCHASED THIS REMINGTON BATTERY OPERATED FABRIC SHAVER HERE ON AMAZON AFTER MY VERY OLD ONE BROKE AFTER MANY, MANY YEARS OF USAGE.  STUCK WITH THE REMINGTON BRAND BECAUSE THE LAST ONE LASTED 15 YEARS.  THIS ONE IS STREAM LINED AND SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD WORK OUT.  ALSO GOT THE BEST PRICE HERE ON AMAZON FOR IT!</li>
            <li> This is a heavy duty unit as far as fabric shavers go.  It&#x27;s important that you recognize that before deciding to purchase this.  If you aren&#x27;t careful or push too hard, there&#x27;s a good chance you&#x27;re going to cut the fabric itself.  That&#x27;s the tradeoff you make for something that&#x27;s going to clear pills from your fabric at an incredible pace and there&#x27;s just no way around it.  Awesome product all around.</li>
            <li> The fabric shaver renewed all my sweaters without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;It is very small, so fit in my suitcase or purse very well.&lt;br /&gt;I did have a little trouble at first in opening and closing the battery&lt;br /&gt;case.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well!</li>
            <li> I have found Remington Fabric Shaver to be the best.  Over the years I have tried others, more expensive, but not as effective as the low cost Remington Fabric Shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver likes to grab at the material that you are shaving and it will stop working.  I do not use it very much as it ruins my sweaters.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for over a year now, and going strong.  I purchased it from Amazon in August 2011 (under a different account, which is why it does not show up as a verified purchase here).  At the time, it was sold by Amazon, for $5.99, and was eligible for Prime.  All of that aside, I&#x27;ve used it quite a bit and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.  I was skeptical, but it actually does the job.  I&#x27;ve used it on many different fabrics, including delicates, and have not encountered any problems with shaving the fabrics.  Note, though, that if your material is VERY thin (such as lingerie) it will work but you must be VERY careful to hold the fabric taut, or it will get sucked up resulting in a smal snag or hole.  On these fabrics, hold them taut, go slow and don&#x27;t press down hard - it will work.  The plastic lint trap does seem to come off too easily sometimes - a wrong touch, and it pops off.  I just snap it back on and continue, but do feel like this could be improved upon.  It takes two AA batteries, which seem to have a good lifespan. It&#x27;s small, light, and fits comfortably in my hand.  Overall length is just under 5 inches.  The shaving head is about 1 1/2 inches in diameter (size of a dollar coin maybe?), so if you&#x27;ve got a larger area / item to shave, it does take some patience (use it while you&#x27;re watching TV, or waiting at your kid&#x27;s practice / lesson or whatever) ... but it works!  Depending upon how bad your garment is, you might want to have a trash can nearby to empty the lint trap often.  It definitely extends the life of your clothes ... would recommend.</li>
            <li> It does not actually take most of the little pills off of a sweater, but I suppose better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I read a review of this before I bought it and laughed about how the purchaser had gone around their whole house shaving everything and taking pictures of it. Then I got mine in the mail and found that it worked so well on our fabric couch that I tried it on our blankets, then our sweaters, and before I knew it I was shaving everything too! It just makes everything look so nice and new all over again!</li>
            <li> Does the job, but  I wish I had ordered a product with a wider head.</li>
            <li> very efficient for cutting small thread for clothes, and socks..you can use for bedsheets also however the cutting surface area is very small so you will take forever if you have lot of thread..pretty good quality not much of noise..using it for 6 months and still going well with the batteries i had put in... you can clean it very easily  and easy to use also...</li>
            <li> I have now used this shaver many times on a variety of materials. Has worked perfectly on everything. I&#x27;ve not experienced any damage or difficulty using. Has brought new life to some garments and a needed &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34; to others. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> ONE OF THE THREE HAD A CRACK DOWN THE SIDE OF THE LINT CATCHER.  WILL TRY TO SUPER GLUE AS IT&#x27;S NOT WORTH THE TIME, EFFORT AND $ TO SEND IT BACK.</li>
            <li> I LIKE MINE, ITS FANTASTIC!!! MAKES CLOTHES NEW AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;I WISH IT WAS NOT BATTERY OPERATED, HOWEVER. YOU CAN GO THRU SOME IN NO TIME.&lt;br /&gt;OTHER THAN THAT ITS CUTE, SMALL AND WORKS!!!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRICE, BUT MAKE A RECHARGEABLE ONE PLEASE...THE COST OF BATTERIES TO KEEP IT RUNNING IS MORE THAN THE COST OF THE SHAVER IN THE LONG RUN.</li>
            <li> I use this on my wool coats, sweaters, cotton shirts, etc. It works very well, is easy to empty, and the best value you can find in these things. Get it.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago and is still works the same as the first day I got it in the mail. It works fast and hasn&#x27;t cut anything yet. I even use it for lint when I get lazy sometimes and I don&#x27;t feel like looking for a lint roller.</li>
            <li> Works great on sweaters and wool coats.</li>
            <li> I love these machines.  I never new they existed growing up, but then again, I was a kid, so what did I know of dress etiquette.  I have yet to use this particular one myself.  It was a gift for my wife.  Her feed back after using it, is she is a happy person again :)</li>
            <li> i got this little baby to make my sweaters look more new. i have used it a few times and it is powerful and useful. i dig it!</li>
            <li> BOTH PRODUCTS ARE OF MY SATISFACTION AND AS EXPECTED BY AMAZON. SYED</li>
            <li> with modern clothing and sweaters pilling more often than higher quality clothing from days of yore... this is an absolute must-have device! i have a new favorite wrap sweater from Banana Republic that pills something awful, so whenever i put the sweater on, i break out the sweater shaver and I begin shaving myself in front the mirror, cracks me up!  but the sweater, and I, look so much better after!</li>
            <li> I have used this to shave a couple of sweaters since I purchased it and have to say that it is a handy and functional item. I am glad to have it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! I&#x27;m required to wear a black Polo shirt for work and this made it look brand new again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything. Save time and money - Just get the Izumi Sweater Shaver instead and RESTORE your knitted items to like NEW condition [[ASIN:B000E1FGHW Izumi Sweater Shaver]]</li>
            <li> Made it all look like new! And it is small and compact so you are able to take it with you or leave it in the car like me!</li>
            <li> Works well. People who have cut cloth with it must not have been very careful.</li>
            <li> Compact versatile and easy to use. Very pleased. Highly recommended!! works as advertised. You will not be disappointed. Good bargain!</li>
            <li> This works great, I was impressed.</li>
            <li> After I purchased this, I read online that a disposable razor does the same thing that this fabric shaver does. It&#x27;s true... a disposable razor will do the same thing! But this fabric shaver is more cost effective. I like the size of it-- I can stick it in my purse or in my gym bag. It does work a little slow though, so patience is needed. I have used these on my pants and blankets. I would be extremely careful with thin materials though... I&#x27;ll bet that this would tear a hole in it!</li>
            <li> Very Happy with product and price. Worked great and was easy to use. Is small, but that worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> This a a great shaver!  I have only used it a couple of times so I am not sure of its durability over time, but so far it has worked beautifully on some shirts and pj&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> works great, excellent product</li>
            <li> This is a great product!!! It took off all the bad textures immediately. It is definitely value for the money. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The metal pieces on the inside broke off during the first use :(</li>
            <li> This Remington fabric shaver worked very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Some have said it&#x27;s a bit aggressive, but that&#x27;s what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot more material to shave, and I&#x27;ll see how it does in the long run.</li>
            <li> This is a great thing to have, has extended the life of many otherwise perfect clothes except those annoying fluff balls that appear on wool and linens, perfect!</li>
            <li> This little gadget is fantastic. It easily &#x27;shaves&#x27; away little &#x27;balls&#x27; that form on sweaters, shirts and pants. Takes 2 AA batteries which last a pretty long time. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I just received this toy today and immediately tried it on one of my cashmere sweaters.  Out of the box the fabric shaver looked small; this is because the shaver is travel size.  My first impression was the power of this little toy, after I placed two AA 1900mAh freshly charged ENELOOP batteries the shaver showed incredible performance.&lt;br /&gt;I just finished the entire sweater and I am highly pleased of my purchase. The only concern I have is that the shaver drained the batteries so fast that at the end of the sweater the blade was barely spinning. That means that batteries have to be changed often, almost every use:(</li>
            <li> I was too broke to go shopping for new clothes this winter. A starving student, I decided to but this little shaver and it has transformed my fuzzy coats and sweaters in to clothing I am no longer embarrassed to wear. I can’t imagine it will last very long, the blade must get dull quickly but so far so good.</li>
            <li> this thing is great, far exceeded my expectations. i wear a lot of old hoodies that pill up and the pills are tight to the fabric. this tool has things looking like new in a matter of seconds.</li>
            <li> I had a zip up hoodie my mother bought me as a souvenir that balled up after wearing it a few times. Extremely noticable because it&#x27;s a very bright neon pink-orangey color. I tried a razor, pumce stone, washing it inside out. My heart was broken because the sweatshirt was brand new and looked like I got it from a thrift store. This little product has been a life saver. I&#x27;m still working on the sweatshirt, but it was literally all balled up on the entire hoodie. I layed it on a flat surface, stretched it a little and started away. Like new. I did have to push down kinda hard for it to get it all, but considering the fabric and it was a new hoodie; I&#x27;m not surprised.  I have used the same method (flat surface like thr top of the dryer and stretched the fabric a litte) on other clothes. Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I previously had a cheaper product that I loved but it began to rust so this is what I went for as a replacement. As a fabric shave it leaves a lot left behind and doesn&#x27;t get a close shave. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This may go down as one of the most &amp;#34;is this real?&amp;#34; inventions i have ever purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it worked great on a set of linen that was starting to &#x27;pimple&#x27;, and an old favorite skirt i pulled out of storage.</li>
            <li> Barely works at removing lint, the motor keeps turning off when its trying to remove lint. Would not recommend. Found a manual handheld one at Von Maur and it works great.</li>
            <li> Nice strong spinning blade that doesn&#x27;t snag too easily.  Easy to clean by opening the clear holding bin on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well.</li>
            <li> How have I lived so long without one of these!? It&#x27;s perfect for my super expensive Victoria&#x27;s Secret bras that always seem to snag or collect little fuzzballs on the material.</li>
            <li> Be careful, does the job but will make holes if in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Every house needs to clean the bumps on items that get those beads..thanks</li>
            <li> OMG This little item works so good.  Took off all those ugly sweater bumps on my good ANN TAYLOR sweater. Does not pull or snag just goes easily over fabric and takes all the unwanted material and puts in a little holder Love it Batteries a little hard to snap in, but wow takes any age off clothes.  So cheap, afraid to use it on expensive clothes, worked perfect. Shipped very quickly</li>
            <li> For my purposes it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Small and light weight, fits easily in the hand, have used it so far on a few articles of clothing, works as advertised. I used it to smooth out some \\&quot;pills\\&quot; on a few collared shirts&#x27; collar areas, and it made the shirts look like new again. I used it (carefully) on a sweater, and it smoothed the surface to look like new. The only thing I noticed negative (hence the 4/5 stars) is that when I used it on the sweater, because there was a lot of fuzz, the fuzzies all attracted each other and clumped around the blades. Only a little bit made it down into the clear pocket. The blades got congested so that they started making noise. When I cleared the blades out, the shaver worked as normal again. This item would be 5/5 stars if the air was strong enough to circulate and \\&quot;force\\&quot; the fuzzies down into the clear pocket. (Or, \\&quot;up\\&quot;, I should say, since when the shaver is used, the blade is normally faced down on the article of clothing, and the pocket is up.)</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine for the price.</li>
            <li> Works as described.  No Issues</li>
            <li> Well it worked perfectly fine until the End mettle piece broke its not mettle just crappy plasticky stuff but besides this it worked amazing for removing pills from jackets and hoodies</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily to bring life back into wool sweaters. The shaver does just that and uses 2 AA batteries. I use rechargeable batteries and am able to buzz several sweaters per charging session. Go slow and it will nab any fuzzballs that fit in the screen holes.</li>
            <li> I bought this fabric shaver based on all the great reviews, and I was not disappointed!  My sweaters, fleece pants and winter coat all look like new--and it was entertaining to use this thing while watching TV.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is just how I remember it when I was a kid. I didn&#x27;t know if they still made these shavers but thankfully Amazon had them. I had so many old sweaters that I just wasn&#x27;t ready to give up yet and this little inexpensive device helped my sweaters look like new again! I love it!</li>
            <li> I chose the one star rating because the shaver does not work.  I installed batteries 3 times and the shaver does not work.  I am assuming the on/off switch is defective.  I would think they would have tested the shaver before they shipped it, but I guess not.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to decide whether to contact the company and pay for shipping or just write it off as a $10 life lesson.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of sweaters and a few polyester workout pants. Both get balls this fabric shaver is great!&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would definitely recommend this product not only for the price but what it does.</li>
            <li> This product is every bit as good as it says. It did suck up part or my shirt though and left a small hole but that was my fault because i hadn&#x27;t read the instructions about needing to stretch the fabric before starting. I&#x27;ve used it a few times and hope it will last.</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver is cheap but works great. Need to use it on my work shorts but also comes in handy after washing hoodies and such.</li>
            <li> This has been such a help to me, I love it!</li>
            <li> This reeves it&#x27;s purpose. It removes the balls from any surface. I use it on sweaters and coats. Great product</li>
            <li> Nice and i like the is good stafe and berfict and good and good and yes and good and yes</li>
            <li> My sofa pills and I needed a way to get rid of it.  This easily does the job.  We also tried it on a sweater - again an improvement.  Good purchase, we&#x27;ll use it often.</li>
            <li> This is not a good product because of the way it is made!!!!!!!!!!!1111</li>
            <li> The manufacturer cut too many corners making this cheap shaver.  There is a metal screen covering the blades.  In the old days, the screen was made from a fairly sturdy piece of metal.  Now, the screen is slightly thicker than a piece of aluminum foil like Alcoa Wrap.  The result is that the foil broke after one use.  For what does it profit a man to gain a whole quarter and lose his own shaver?</li>
            <li> Everything communicates. Even though that sweet sweater, awesome pair of herringbone slacks or those high end yoga pants look good from a distance. You and I can both see the pills on them from all the wear. This little shaver brings those old favorites back to life. It works like a charm and in my opinion, pays for itself after you empty the pill-filled reservoir for the first time. A rewarding feeling.</li>
            <li> This does  a fantastic job of depilling sweaters and coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes no claim about removing cat hair, and that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t remove cat hair.</li>
            <li> Love it, this little power machine does wonders only all fabrics. Very glad I purchased this, it&#x27;s so easy to use. Worth every penny in my book! Only tip, if fabric super fluffy (like a plush sweater), make sure to use on a flat surface and keep fabric taunt while using.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised, gets most of the lint out of clothing g r e a t g r e a t</li>
            <li> My sweaters had all pilled and I didn&#x27;t know how to save them.  I bought this and tried it out.  I was amazed at how new my sweaters look again.  This product is reasonably priced and easy to use.  Thinking of order more for holiday gifts later on.</li>
            <li> Does a good job for the price</li>
            <li> This shaver is extremely compact, well designed and works perfectly. I had a couple sweaters that I thought were going to need to be donated, this saved them!</li>
            <li> Sad to say this completely didn&#x27;t work -- the power stops the second it makes contact with the pill. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Good price.</li>
            <li> Good Quality. Make sure that you clean the unit out once you are done. My wife used this to clean up the couch a few times and then thought it was dead. I opened the head of the unit and pulled all the junk out of the mechanics and it worked like new again.</li>
            <li> This really works on our soft fabric removing all the loose fibers and pills from wear.&lt;br /&gt;  Worth the price. Absolutely.</li>
            <li> I used it to repair a bit of fuzziness on my husband´s pants. It worked like a charm. Now I regret tossing my old sweaters. They probably could´ve been saved.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds weird to love a fabric shaver but I do. My couch just pills like crazy after I wash the covers. I have 4 kids not washing the covers isn&#x27;t a option. Not anything you can see but you can feel it when you run your hand across the surface. Well not anymore with this. Sliced them all off and now my cushions feel like new.</li>
            <li> There were so many mixed reviews on this but I still went ahead and got it.  This saved my living room chairs which were pilling really badly.  I love this thing!</li>
            <li> Works amazing !  I used it on a fuzzy sweater (don&#x27;t press too hard) and on a pair of stretchy workout pants.  Worked super on both! very pleased :)</li>
            <li> This shaver did take some of the little balls off of my sweater, but not all of them. It also made a tiny hole in it which was probably user error. Don&#x27;t press down too hard, or you may do the same.</li>
            <li> This inexpensive sweater shaver works great and was well worth the purchase! It restored my sweater to like-new condition. I was considering buying a much more expensive electric shaver, but I&#x27;m glad I followed the reviews and didn&#x27;t.  TIP: While using this product, the resevoir should be emptied frequently for optimum performance.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, easy to use, total no brainer of a purchase. Any reviews that have negative comments on this product are probably a result of someone using this on a garment that it wasnt meant to be used on, or perhaps user error. The device consists of 3 high speed spinning blades...if you dont use it with care then yes, your garment will see the effects.</li>
            <li> It never worked.I bought new batteries just to make sure. /the instructions for polarity were vague but neither way worked.  Not worth postage to return, I threw it away.</li>
            <li> This product does not work, but it&#x27;s so inexpensive, it&#x27;s not worth going through the trouble to return this item.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because of the many positive reviews, and of course because of the price.  I was however concerned with how it would handle certain fabrics considering some of the negative experiences some users had, but I went with it anyway and to my surprise it worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used it on my favorite Nike sport polyester coat that has been fuzzing up because I where it so often and it made it look brand new.  I would have taken pictures of the before and after but I was so anxious to begin.  I did however used it on a pair of BBall shoes that where fuzzing up from my socks and attached some pics which you can find in the &amp;#34;customer images&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Replaced the one I have had for 15 years!</li>
            <li> Cleans up the wool covers really well. Seems to go through batteries quickly though. Not as noisy as my last one. I do have to clean the blades and shavings under the blades more than id like. Other than that its a good shaver.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for more than a year. It matches the description and is very good to remove the threads poking out of old clothes. I have used it on my T Shirts and they look like new afterwards. Will definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This shaver works well but it takes a long time to de-pill an entire sweater, or even worse, something larger. Be prepared to spend some time doing it. Your sweaters may still be a little pilly but the pills will be more flat. I am glad to have this on hand for when I need it but it will not restore something to brand new.</li>
            <li> Works great!  My coat looks brand new now!  Sometimes, it can be tough to get a lot of pills at once so you have to work at it, but worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my heavy pea coat and it simply was not strong enough to handle the &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34; balls on that. It works great on lighter materials like sweaters, but do not buy if you are hoping to remove fuzz, etc from a heavy coat!</li>
            <li> I was surprised with how fast it was delivered and it how well it works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many shavers over the years.  I even bought a plug in one, thinking it might work better. That one barely worked, and this one took off what the other left behind.  It seems to work as well as the pricier ones, for much less.  As others have said, the holes are on the large side, so use with care. NEVER push on the fabric, or not just the fuzz nitt, but the fabric will be sucked in too.  I&#x27;ve no idea how long this will last, but it&#x27;s a good value. 9/30/2013- Still love it. Buying another for upstairs.</li>
            <li> It works great.  My sweaters are like new again.  However, I didn&#x27;t realize it was going to be such a small device so it does take a while to get one sweater done.  I knew it was travel sized, but I was still surprised at how small it was.  Also a little piece of the plastic on the lint holder broke off the first time I used it.  Hence the reduction in &amp;#34;stars&amp;#34;.  Otherwise a great little fabric shaver.</li>
            <li> Its like a shaver for your clothes! I put my under armour jacket in the wash and dryer with socks and towels. Came out wth the pills/lent balls all over it. This thing removed almost all of them. It took me about 15-20min on the jacket. Had i spent more time i probably wouldve gotten them all. My girlfriend uses it on her cotton/vinyl tank top without issues. This thing is not for all types of material, but will do many if not most common materials with the right touch. I dont know how people are putting holes in their clothes.</li>
            <li> Works great on everything I have tried it on with no issues. Would recommend it to anyone needing this type appliance.</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically for my fleeces sweaters, thick winter socks, and flannel sheets. You need to be a little patient to get the big fuzzes off the material, pressing down does NOT increase results. Of course, I did not buy this for thin material, but given the &amp;#34;suck&amp;#34; it has on the fleeces etc. I can understand why some people may have experienced rips on more sensitive clothing types. Super easy to clean, but don&#x27;t shake it about too much as the fuzz/debris that collects in the collection compartment does &amp;#34;dust out&amp;#34; a bit.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product as advertised!  Quick shipper.  Works great</li>
            <li> Yes it works great but after just a few uses I lost one of the shaving blades and found out on the remington website that this item is discontinued and spare parts are no  longer available.</li>
            <li> This works great and is easy to open to dispense lint shavings. Low voltage the battery last well.</li>
            <li> I bought this item with a steamer, It works great! I love this item and is small and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I loved this product. It is one of the greatest inventions ever. I used this on two of my sweaters that are all bally along the sleeves and it cleared it up without any effort. It was amazing.</li>
            <li> For the price, works great. The write-up and the service were very good. I would definitely recommend it as a good buy, but probably not for large jobs.</li>
            <li> I received broken. very fragile, I did not like.</li>
            <li> read the reviews and was a bit nervous this might tear my clothes or not do the job, however i have had this for a few weeks now, and from the moment i slapped in the batteries i am beyond pleased with this mighty little shaver. I&#x27;ve used it on sweaters, hoodies, a blanket and a thin t-shirt and it worked its magic on it all.</li>
            <li> Kinda shoddy construction, but functions perfectly for now.  It gives me the impression that it wont last.</li>
            <li> This has been so helpful keeping my clothes looking new. I would suggest everyone have one. Easy to use and did a good job.</li>
            <li> A blade was missing, the package was difficult to open, and the blade is nowhere to be found inside the package or in the product&#x27;s interior. An image should be posted depicting the missing blade.</li>
            <li> I was dissapointed that this item did not work to get the fuzz off my sweaters. I returned the item.</li>
            <li> Great for the money.  It works plenty fast and does a good job.  It did just what I wanted and my sweaters look better.</li>
            <li> This cheap little thing works awesome gets lint off and very good at removing dog hair</li>
            <li> This is another item that I ordered mostly because it was cheap, I needed it, and I did not want to go to the store.  Works great, pretty much what you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> The product works as advertised.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  The plastic cover that catches the lint broke the second time I used it.</li>
            <li> This shaver does not work well at all. I don&#x27;t even use it and ended up getting a different one at the drugstore for $4 that works great. Very disappointed in the performance of this as it had decent reviews.</li>
            <li> This inexpensive shaver works as advertised. We had an earlier model that my wife used for years, then an old battery leaked and destroyed it. It does a nice job, just use it carefully -- very light pressure and don&#x27;t stay too long in one spot. Keep moving while you use it. It is not a precision piece of equipment, like an electric razor. For a cheap \\&quot;gadget\\&quot;, it works quite well.</li>
            <li> I had this model, lost it in a move, and then tried to replace it with other brands I found locally.  The replacements either didn&#x27;t work straight out of the package or fell apart after one use.  I searched online till I found the exact Remington shaver I lost, and it was well worth paying a little shipping to get it here.  This model works great and is built better than any others I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  Only thing that has worked to get those annoying sweater balls off</li>
            <li> This shaver does not really get all of the fuzzies off of my fleece jacket, really disappointed by it by it</li>
            <li> The title says it all. It works very well, and it&#x27;s kind of relaxing to use. It&#x27;s also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well, but needed emptying a little sooner than I&#x27;d have liked (could only do one sweater before having to empty it).</li>
            <li> This item clogs easily a ended up breaking (the blades bent) just after a few uses.  I would not recommend wasting your money.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for a friend a while ago and she loves it. I have used it several times and also love it. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I used to have a much larger type of fabric shaver that worked very well. I decided to get a replacement. I did not think this would be as small as it was. It could literally fit in the palm of our hand. However, the small size is very convenient for traveling and I do think it works very well for its purpose. The only complaint that I have is that the mesh material is very flimsy, a little stronger than heavy duty aluminum foil. I had the blade get caught up once and the mesh cracked on the second use. Amazon CS was very great to work with and gave me a full refund. I would order again but be very cautious on how hard I am pressing down on my garments.</li>
            <li> Keep this in your laundry room, and you will see how much you need this, I used my for kids cloth and keep it like new.</li>
            <li> LIFESAVER!!  I highly recommend for every home!</li>
            <li> This device has a couple small flaws, but once you get used to them you seem to be able to deal with them okay.  Firstly, both the battery compartment lid and the little lint storage compartment keep sliding off the body of the shaver.  The snap locking tabs are inadequate and could use some beefing up.  And secondly, if you hold the shaver face down, the lint will build up in the cutting area and may ball up inside.  I had to clear this area with a bent paper clip a couple of times.  Other than these somewhat annoying problems, the device works well and is probably worth its small cost.</li>
            <li> Works just as promised. Rescued my fleece pants and various other fleece items which I stopped wearing due to pill buildup. Shaved them quickly and smoothly . A must own if you own different items of fleece.</li>
            <li> Great shaver.... Just wished it would take the bigger lints. But i guess I won&#x27;t be able to use it on my cashmere sweaters if it was stronger. Been using it on everything I can-- some it works great some hardly any difference. I think it depends on the materials ...... some cashmere I don&#x27;t know why. It&#x27;s my first shaver - and so far so good!</li>
            <li> For looking and feeling cheap it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Beware though, if you&#x27;re not careful you can shave holes into some of your thinner shirts.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this in the stores anymore and knew that over time I had purchased several that my children had taken.  I got this one pretty quickly and it worked great.</li>
            <li> My sister had been raving about her shaver and I finally got around to buying one and now using it.  Two down, about 50 to go!  So far I&#x27;ve used it on a fleece and a wool sweater and it has worked great.  I&#x27;m not one to write reviews, but that&#x27;s how pleased I am with this!</li>
            <li> Love using this product. Easy to use and it makes our clothing look almost like new. Our sweaters no longer have any pilling. The clear cover on this is where the shaved fabric ends up and it&#x27;s easy to clean out; just snap it off and dump the shaved fabric then snap it on again. Really couldn&#x27;t be easier.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected. Haved used it on several items and it works great. Small enought to store anywhere. A very good buy.</li>
            <li> Shaves pills off sweaters and jackets very nicely.  I&#x27;ve tried the stone and the comb, but this really does the job.</li>
            <li> Does the job but is a battery eater.  Ordered non battery product on Open Sky. Product made by Julie Morganstern.</li>
            <li> The shaver works as advertised; it does a good job removing pills from clothing.  After a few months of infrequent use, the face of it broke making it useless (and sharp! I cut myself trying to fix it)  I&#x27;m looking for a new fabric shaver now.</li>
            <li> It does the job but the motor is not that strong so it takes a little longer..</li>
            <li> It works great and fast, but watch out not too shave too close or you&#x27;ll make tiny holes in your clothes.</li>
            <li> I had a larger version of this shaver, but it did not work very well. I ordered this model based on other reviews and was really pleased with it&#x27;s efficacy. I was shaving the balls off cashmere sweaters and it did a great job and the sweaters look like new again. I had no problem with it sucking in the fabric and making holes. Maybe others were pressing too hard??? The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the working surface is smaller than my plug in one. However, the effect is better than the old one, so I am happy with it. I am going to give one of these to my sisters and as a stocking stuffer for my daughters-in-law.</li>
            <li> This is not a great shaver. In the past ive purchased these (fabric shavers) for much cheaper &amp; they actually worked alot better. This remington unit requires multiple passes to remove lint from a single area of a garment. Very time consuming process.. I&#x27;ll be returning this... It just doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> Good product for the money.  Easy on batteries.</li>
            <li> This shaver works well and it has rejuvenated several articles of clothing.</li>
            <li> Works great!  removes pills from sweaters, which is what I need it to do!</li>
            <li> It was great while it worked.  It didn&#x27;t make it a year with very light use.  Part of that time I had to press and hold the on button for it to go.  That no longer works.  Will move on to another brand.  My mom had a large Remington brand fabric shaver for years and years and she used it all the time.  Wish she would have bought a case.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my work clothes. My slack started having these elastic threads pop out after a couple washes, and thought this would get rid of them. It does, but it takes forever.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll spend less time picking the lint balls by hand then trying to get this device to work.  Everytime I turn it on it works for, quite literally, one second...if that.  I have never been able to use it, because everytime I try it turns off just as quick as it turned on.  Definitely not worth my money and at this point, not worth my time to return it to the company.  So, all in all - Seller: 1, Buyer: 0.</li>
            <li> very good product for the price.  good power for the price.  works great.  it is compact in size but does the job</li>
            <li> This thing actually works!  And it&#x27;s kind of fun to use.  This little guy transforms all those old sweaters of yours into practically-new sweaters.</li>
            <li> Works better than my old one did.</li>
            <li> This shaver does a pretty good job but the part that holds the shavings tends to slip out of place and make a mess. Also no very ergonomic in the hand, tends to slip out of my small hands and the battery compartment is not very secure.</li>
            <li> It does its job slowly but surely. I gave it to family members for stocking filler. I would recommend this product to anyone for the price.</li>
            <li> This has saved my wool knit coat soooo many times.  It takes old, fuzzy material and makes it look brand new again.  I&#x27;ve also used it with much success on my son&#x27;s fleeces.</li>
            <li> love shaving my woolies!</li>
            <li> Small but works great.</li>
            <li> Love it! I am highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> This shaver does work and it works ok but that&#x27;s about it. It seems to work will with fabrics that are less durable such as cotton. The more robust material does not cut well. If I buy another one, I will likely try a more robust model with heftier blades that are able to cut through the thicker fabrics.</li>
            <li> I am a thicker girl so I often have issued with lint balls in the inner thigh of my pant legs. This shaver has saved my sweat pants and a few pair of other pants. Everyone in my household has found use it. From Sweaters to Blankets. It is a great little shaver.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much since I paid so little for it, I just needed something easy to clean up my husbands coat. So far I have done two of his jackets, three of mine and my sons jacket. Love this little thing.</li>
            <li> I had a very badly pilled cashmere sweater I was about to toss. I had to go over the sweater a few times to remove all the pills, but it worked. I filled the storage compartment with pills! The sweater now looks fine and a wardrobe favorite is saved. I was worried that the shaver might do damage, especially because the sweater has cables, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Where has this been all my life? What a handy gadget. I use it on my socks. Works perfectly. I don&#x27;t understand the reviews that talk about it putting holes in things. Certainly hasn&#x27;t been my experience. Love it.</li>
            <li> (From the wife) This is a great little shaver! It does its job without eating the fabric. If you are doing a lot, you will need to empty it often as sometimes the fuzz doesn&#x27;t move down into the holding caddy so well, but it usually does and you can tell when it isn&#x27;t. I have to admit, I was pretty underwhelmed when we opened it. The clear part fell off immediately and chipped one end before I even got to turn it on. We christened it our little POS and debated whether to even try it, but all doubts left when we did. It really made a huge difference on the pillow I wanted to shave! I gave it 5 stars because functionality is what I care about and it delivers.</li>
            <li> The product is okay . Has to go over area several times to fuzz off. Tape works better</li>
            <li> It works just like you said it would.  Great!</li>
            <li> I have never owned a fabric shaver before, so I can&#x27;t compare it&#x27;s abilities. It works ok - it removes some stuff but it is still a lot of work.</li>
            <li> This is the Grandaddy, Super-Sonic fuzz Buster. I first tried it on an old sweater that I loved, but was too embarrassed to wear. After using this, the sweater looked great! I decided to try it in a cashmere sweater. Success again. It  has plenty of power and cuts closer and faster than any I have tried. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works really well to take off the pulls and the (what look like) dust bunnies but are just fabric that got rubbed too much. Makes stuff look like new and doesn&#x27;t ruin the fabric.</li>
            <li> I hate having a million gadgets cluttering up the place, so really resisted getting this while looking for a way to save my favorite sweater coat from extinction.  It took a while, because I needed the warnings about going too fast and cutting fabric, but the coat, which is a combination of black wool body with knitted sleeves, looks great.  It was majorly pilled, and this shaver took off several compartments full.  It made such a difference, I&#x27;m looking around for other things to use it on.  Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> We bought an expensive sofa with custom upholstery, and within a year it was full of the beady pulls.  I looked online and saw this recommended so we gave it a try.  It worked perfectly...my couch looks new again.  The fabric we had was very thick houndstooth, not sure how it would do on thinner fabrics.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work on upolstry which Is why I bought it</li>
            <li> The product is ok but sweaters that pill are almost hopeless.  It&#x27;s better to stay away from any sweaters containing acrylic.  Stay with cotton.</li>
            <li> It can snag and tear clothing if you are not watching.  It does remove lint if you do it carefully.</li>
            <li> snagged easily on fabric .... I used on crochet projects. Also it barely got off any of the fuzz, even after trying for a long time in one area. Maybe would be better on different material</li>
            <li> For its size it does a great job.  Used it on a old winter jacket and what a difference!</li>
            <li> It really works!  I found that varying the direction made it more thorough.  I went over my sweaters back and forth and then circular motions.  If one way missed any, the other way would smooth them.  So happy to find something that works this well and at such a great price!</li>
            <li> These are so handy for sweaters, blankets, etc., and the price was very reasonable. Works great.</li>
            <li> Good for removing lint. The debris chamber and blades get jammed by lint a little more often than I&#x27;d like, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Dose his job perfectly, comfortable to handle</li>
            <li> Great product! Works perfectly to remove unwanted fuzzes off of clothing. Clothes look new again!</li>
            <li> The shaver works well with two downsides:  (1) the battery cover and fuzz holder pop off constantly while shaving.  Flimsy and difficult to control because of this.  (2) if you aren&#x27;t careful, this will quickly rip a hole in your cashmere sweater.  The sweater must be held taut, which is hard unless you have an extra pair of hands.  The end result, though, was an old pilly sweater looking like it was almost new.  So it&#x27;s a good value overall.</li>
            <li> It can remove only small pills and does not work for larger pills of a sweater.</li>
            <li> works as adverstied. Still going strong after a year of moderte use</li>
            <li> This is made my sweaters just like new. Works good on cashmere too.</li>
            <li> Awesome little gadget to have! Works really good and it saved your clothes so you can wear them longer. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love it! Does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> This works well enough. It shaves off all the fuzzies. My only complaint is that it will fall apart if you look at it wrong. The battery compartment and the fuzz catcher will just come off in your hand sometimes. It is easy enough to put back together... but still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as with all of these fuzz shavers, be careful not to put holes in your clothes. The material must be held taut or you will cut the fabric.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend. Made my socks look new. Like damn a shaved my whole comforter with this s*** and had no holes. This s*** works forreal</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. It gets the job done. Nothing to extra special, but it isn&#x27;t bad either. Pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> Perfect for shaving off clothes that pill in places.</li>
            <li> Not like the one we had for years.... Cheaply made and performs sub-par</li>
            <li> This broke before I even finished my first sweater. You definitely get what you pay for. The fuzz clogs the head and is impossible to get out. Don&#x27;t buy this product. You will regret it.</li>
            <li> I love my de-fuzzer!! My son in college loved it so much I bought one for him too! Works great!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for the office to shave down some of the wool.  It works pretty good.  I&#x27;d like it even better if it were a bit bigger and shaved faster.  It takes several passes to get the fluff to get sucked into the unit. But I&#x27;m glad it works and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> The shaver did a super job removing the little knots and fuzzies from my sweaters.  It went very quickly.  The sweaters look so much better.</li>
            <li> Love this!! It has saved so many of my shirts and sweaters. I suggest going over the pill-y spots very slowly and in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> I keep this item in my purse.  Is this product perfect ?  No, but it is the best device I have purchased for the removal fabric pills .  I gave it 4 stars because it does have some flaws.  The shaving head developed a hole and the device would not work.  The case for the battery does not stay closed.  The clothing that I used the shaver on looks brand new.  So I guess it&#x27;s a trade off.</li>
            <li> This thing is great. My husband and I call it the fuzz eater - because it works very efficiently and is almost fun to use. I am happy with my purchase, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I love vintage clothing.  I especially love vintage sweaters.  I bought this to clean up the edges of sweater sleeves, waistbands and any area that is fuzzy or pilling.  It does exactly that.  The surface area on the head is small, but I have tried larger surface area shavers and they dont have the power this thing does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on vintage coats I purchase.  Does wonders on the sleeve detail as well as pockets, trim ect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use small circular motions against the fabric. I also have a sewers ham that I place under the fabric which helps keep fabric taught.  If the fabric is not taught I imagine it could snag on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun shaving!</li>
            <li> I used this on my old cable knit Ugg boots that had gotten fuzzy and they look brand new! After reading other reviews I was worried they would be damaged but it worked great.</li>
            <li> My Remington Battery Operated Fabric Shaver arrived today.  Before I forget, batteries don&#x27;t come with the shaver so have 2 AA on hand.  First went over a pair of socks that always seem to come out of the dryer with nubbies all over them.  Nubbies gone in the blink of an eye.  This is a small machine so be prepared for that.  You&#x27;ll be able to get stuff off your clothes every other shaver you&#x27;ve had left on.  At least that&#x27;s the case for me.  My last fuzz buster died a few months ago so had some \\&quot;busting\\&quot; to do.  I&#x27;ve removed lint, nubbies, fuzz off a shawl I had, pills on cushions where legs rub the fabric...and they&#x27;ll be more.  Ok, Ease of use and quality of performance: A+.  Down side is you&#x27;ll have to empty the cup more often because it IS small.  Not such a bad deal though because this shaver is very easy to open.  It&#x27;s a breeze to empty the lint cup or take the cap off the blades and take the blades out once in a while to really get all the lint completely out.  So, ease of cleaning this shaver:  A+.  Cost...a no brainer...cheap.  Longevity..????..who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update December 12th:  There is a cap over the blades that is made of a very thin laced metal.  Perfect holes for shaving everything by the way.  Maybe there was a little crack in mine...not sure.  I know it wasn&#x27;t because of too much pressure on my part because I&#x27;m very careful with it.  In any event I heard a crunch sound.  Next thing I know I&#x27;ve got a small jagged hole in the blade cover.  I&#x27;m going to buy another one as soon as I get my refund and give it one more try.  This is just too perfect of a fuzz buster to give up after one mishap which could have just been a manufacturing defect.  Return is easy.  Just pack it up, print out a pre-paid return label, I include a copy of my invoice and off it goes back to Amazon.  My refund should be quick once they get it back.  Over the years I haven&#x27;t returned many items but it&#x27;s always been a flawless experience.</li>
            <li> This works really well. I like that you can see when the unit is getting full.  I have not had any issues with shaving too far and damaging my sweaters. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the reviews on this product I got it and I love it - works great. Barely touching the fabric and it takes all the pilling of I couldn&#x27;t get off with those tape rollers. I had another one that did nothing, this one rocks!</li>
            <li> Nice Fabric shaver. A little hard to remove flat fuzzy pieces on sweater.</li>
            <li> Cheap.  Works.  &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
            <li> I have successfully &amp;#34;restored&amp;#34; many of my sweaters to a like-new condition due to this little guy. It trims the awful pilling that makes anything look worn and used. It&#x27;s one of my closet secrets to maintaining my clothes in great condition.</li>
            <li> I use this almost every time I iron and I have never had a problem with it snagging.  Very easy to use and a laundry necessity.</li>
            <li> The Remington Fabric Shaver was exactly what I expected it to be. I&#x27;ve already used it on sweaters that were so full of &#x27;pills&#x27; that I couldn&#x27;t wear them anymore. It takes off little strings that are hanging loose on clothing and even the pulls my cat made from &amp;#34;marching&amp;#34; on my favorite teddy bear. ;)&lt;br /&gt;It collects everything inside the clear chamber and is easy to dump into the trash. I take the top off and blow off the blade after every use. Good product, does what it says.</li>
            <li> We bought this to clean up burrs on our La-Z-Boy pillows. Works great for this purpose! Haven&#x27;t tried it on more delicate pieces tho.</li>
            <li> I wanted this to cut off the balls that roll up on my sweater that is pretty new.  It takes a good chunk off but not all them and I have to repeat areas often.</li>
            <li> This small gadget makes the garmet look new after using it.  It fits very well in those of us with small hands, even though you need to empty it frequently, it is so worh having.  It is important to keeping my clothes and my appearence at my best.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product negative 5 stars I would. This thing is awful. I put brand new batteries in to it, it worked wonderfully for four minutes &amp; then died. I adjusted the batteries got it to work for 30 more seconds and then it died again (this time for good). It wasn&#x27;t expensive but I did not expect for it to die so quickly. Horrible product. Save your money and buy a different one.</li>
            <li> A few of my bed sheets needed a good shave and I didn&#x27;t want to get anything too expensive or big. Found this and I think it works great. Got all of the little fuzzy things out of my sheets and some pillows. Just don&#x27;t press to hard so you don&#x27;t end up cutting holes in your stuff and you are fine. I didn&#x27;t try this on anything I consider delicate, but for cotton and cotton blend items it worked just as expected.</li>
            <li> Turned an old zip up jacket into feeling like brand new. It was previously COVERED with pills and looked really bad and felt bumpy! Its kind of slow work but it worked like a dream!</li>
            <li> Product works well, however, the cover both where the fabric being pilled comes into the machine and the battery door slides off quite frequently while in use. Other than that, the functionality of the product is fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes that it would actually work the way it promises.  I honestly had low expectations since it was so cheap, but when it came in the mail and i used it for the first time, I was so impressed by how good of a job it does.  It made my old hoodies and sweaters look new again by taking off the little fuzzies that have began to pull out over time.  Love it!</li>
            <li> My pill shaver arrived quickly with appropriate packaging. It works like a dream. I have revived sweaters, mattresses, socks, blankets, pillows and more. Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This shaver really works! Makes my clothes look like new. My sweaters last longer and look like I just bought them.</li>
            <li> It is a very slow and challenging process removing pills from sweaters with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an attempt to expedite some progress, I used the shaver in a circular motion; and I also went across the sweater rather than up and down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not handle the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as effective is a gentle wire bristled clothing brush (have had one for ions) moved gently up and down the sweater.</li>
            <li> I use this shaver on my merino wool sweaters and it does a great job removing the fuzz but it has cut holes in almost every sweater I have used it on.</li>
            <li> Makes old clothes brand new again. Cheap an well built. Nice blades. But you must be careful when cleaning , very sharp blades may cut you . .</li>
            <li> the blades get stuck every so often and you have to take the top and hte blades out and dig put he clumps hte fabric, but it does what i want it to do.</li>
            <li> 10-12 pair of extremely pilled athletic socks now look &#x27;like new&#x27; thanks to this great little product - and the first pair of AA batteries are still going strong.  Although not advertised that way, loosening/tightening the screen also provides a nice &amp;#34;closeness&amp;#34; adjustment.</li>
            <li> I did not realize this fabric shaver was so small and a bit slow. It takes forever for me to do my sweater. I have a whole list of sweaters and things lined up for shaving but with this tiny thing, it will take me eons to complete them all.</li>
            <li> I have silk sheets and they develop &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34;. This shaver removes them and returns them to the smooth texture they should be.</li>
            <li> Works great ggf g h g g h g h. G t h h. H j j g h h h</li>
            <li> I use this shaver on my couch.  It pills up pretty bad.  The shaver works pretty good but the fluff doesn&#x27;t move down into the little compartment so well and you do need to ensure the fabric is taut so you don&#x27;t get too deep into it, ergo a 4 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I once tried to vacuum the fluff out from the top since it gets stuck in there... sucked that blade right out and into the vacuum hose!!!  Not such a good plan!  It is a bit of a pain to clear the fluff out but not so much it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> It returns shaved fabrics to as new condition. Would recommend using rechargeable batteries. Light weight and suitable for travel. Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have had a fabric shaver before, I  just need to replace it, this is small but it works well.</li>
            <li> I actually like the way the shaver works in that the blades seem sharp and the motor is strong.  It&#x27;s a lightweight, inexpensive, handy little fabric shaver.  BUT - the cover to the compartment that collects the debris comes off super easily - you barely need to touch it and it&#x27;s off.  This is a pain in the neck because it&#x27;s messy, and twice already I&#x27;ve lost the cover because it lands under the couch or somewhere else.  I think I&#x27;m going to put a thick rubber-band to keep the cover on.  So maybe if you don&#x27;t mind securing the cover, then it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> Great product, great service.</li>
            <li> I thought this would work well, given the reviews. This product failed within a few minutes. I JUST missed the return window, so I can&#x27;t even exchange it for another one. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I found it worked really well on an old sweater that needed the little balls of fuzz removed.  You do have to be careful as it&#x27;s very powerful, but it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This little bugger works wonders.  Can&#x27;t beat it for the price. You might want to be sure and clean the head out by blowing into it after each use.  The material removed seems to kind of collect in there.  Otherwise, no complaints. Only praise. : )</li>
            <li> I have been impressed by how much stuff this little shaver can actually pick up.  It dramatically improves the looks of most any fabric but just be careful not to press too hard.  If you need to go over an area just keep going over lightly.  Not a lot pressure is needed.  Easy emptying too.</li>
            <li> It was better than I expected.  It didn&#x27;t remove all the pills on my polyester shirt, but probably 95%, which is very good.  And it didn&#x27;t grab and pull any threads</li>
            <li> This device is meant for shaving off all those little fuzz balls that build up on some materials and can make a sweater, for example, look too well-worn.  I remember when these devices were first introduced, and the manufacturers were so afraid of clothing damage that the holes were too small and then the product didn&#x27;t even work (big fabric &#x27;pills&#x27; could not fit into the holes to be snipped off!). Now some reviewers complain of fabric damage because now the holes are too big.  So...what size hole in front of the blade is &#x27;just right&#x27;?  (sound like a Goldilocks story? :-) I think the size of the holes in this shaver are just right!  Be aware that these type shavers are really designed for heavier type fabrics (think of sweaters, comforters, socks...) that tend to pill up easily (especially wools &amp; fuzzy acrylics) and fabrics that are NOT very fragile, vs sheers and silks.  So just be cautious if you choose to use it on more delicate fabrics.  On delicate fabrics, I&#x27;d recommend the obvious: try an inconspicuous area first, and stretch the fabric very firmly while you shave it so it can&#x27;t be pulled inside the device.  Using this method (which really should be used no matter WHAT type of fabric!) I&#x27;ve shaved heavy fabrics and sheer fabrics, and not had any problems!  I recommend!  (I would have given this 5 stars if it was priced slightly lower)</li>
            <li> wonderful, brought my wooly outdoor research hybrid coat to a brand new standstill.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made.  The battery cover doesn&#x27;t stay on very well.  Does an okay job.</li>
            <li> It works great but one of the blades popped off while I was clearing the fuzz out and would not go back in properly. It still works but I have to be extra careful that the blade doesn&#x27;t disappear. For the price, it was worth it to me to save a king-sized quilt from the garbage. I would actually purchase it again and be extra careful cleaning it out.</li>
            <li> I really, really love this shaver. My neighbor lent me her inferior shaver and after an hour of little result I decided to purchase a better one myself. I could not be happier, great product for the price.</li>
            <li> This fabric shaver does a great job for the price that I paid.  I make sure to lay my garment on a flat surface and I&#x27;m good to go.  I&#x27;ve run over seams and it hasn&#x27;t caused any damage.  It is easy to empty and even easier to use.  I think it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> It is not as powerful as I would have liked. It does however get the job done, you may have to apply a little force or go over an are though</li>
            <li> Should have bought a larger size cause have to empty the holder where the fuzz goes too often. Batteries ran out fast</li>
            <li> Amen!  I&#x27;ve been through several of these that were a joke! no power, no shaving!  This one shaves very well, I use it on thick sweaters and piling.  Lots of reviews says it eats your clothes.  I would not use it on fine or thin fabrics, but this does exactly what I want on my thick stuff.  Would buy again</li>
            <li> This takes most of the pills on our sweaters without snagging the fabric. Great price for this fabric shaver too!</li>
            <li> This product is great.  Good power and very good at removing those annoying balls of lint from my daughter&#x27;s dance tights.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the casing that holds the lint slides off sometimes while using it. Other than that it does the job is supposed to do.  It also had pretty good battery life.</li>
