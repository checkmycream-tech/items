    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The cleaner for the blender is wonderfully scented and doesn&#x27;t stay on the sponge once its cleaned.  </li>
            <li>This sponge is the best one I have ever used.</li>
            <li>and it smells delightful!  &amp; softer than ever!  </li>
            <li>The sponge is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>And the beauty blender itself is awesome.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve tried cheaper alternatives and haven&#x27;t been impressed, try this</li>
            <li>I use a stippling motion instead of a sweeping motion and this seems to work the best.</li>
            <li>I tried the Beautyblender with Lancome Color Ideal makeup and it did not work well at all.</li>
            <li>This is a quality product and is a good size; my daughter was very happy to have received it!</li>
            <li>This item was purchased as a gift for my daughter, who is very pleased with it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is truly a great purchase for me.</li>
            <li>The Beautyblender is a great sponge for makeup application, but cleaning it takes time.</li>
            <li>The cleanser works great for cleaning up the blender and my brushes.</li>
            <li>This sponge is amazing, it gave me the best coverage with my makeup.</li>

            <li>This thing is super awesome too!</li>
            <li>Love he beauty blender!  </li>
            <li>The cleanser is also amazing.</li>
            <li>liked it</li>
            <li>It just seemed to absorb most of the foundation instead of spreading it nicely on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been in the cosmetic industry for 15 years, and the beauty blender is by far one of the best tools I&#x27;ve ever used for foundation application!</li>
            <li>I have to say that I&#x27;m a lot more happy than expected. :D</li>
            <li>I love the blender.  </li>
            <li>the beauty blender sure does its&#x27; job</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>A foundation brush works so much better.</li>
            <li>It works better for me when it&#x27;s damp.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll understand the hype :)</li>
            <li>but I have to say it is now my favorite way to apply my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>Loved that it is so easy to clean &amp; the blendercleanse works perfectly for the beautyblender &amp; my other makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>quality of the beautyblender is much better than my cheap alternatives.</li>
            <li>The package arrived surprisingly quickly, considering the seasonal postal overload!</li>
            <li>It is great for blending concealer, and especially for blending around areas like your nose or eyes.</li>
            <li>I primarily use it to apply cream and liquid foundation and concealer.</li>
            <li>My makeup applies so smoothly and there is no cakey-ness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This could be because my foundation has SPF in it or is oil free, but I still think the sponge is overrated.</li>
            <li>Great product &amp; I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to someone else!</li>
            <li>I love the way I can put less foundation but still get great coverage.</li>
            <li>It was worth it!</li>
            <li>I originally read about it in a magazine, and pre-ordered it from amazon as I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Clean up is EZ with their product.  </li>
            <li>When it was time to clean the sponge with the cleanser, I had to use a lot of cleanser and scrub and scrub, and the sponge would still not come totally clean.</li>
            <li>It has a very light lavender fragrance and is gentle and soy-based.</li>
            <li>I prefer using my gentle soap to clean, does a much better jjob.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used large blending sponges for many years and the brand I loved is no longer being made, so I searched the internet for a long time to try to find replacements.  </li>
            <li>The price point is a little intimidating, but after having used it for a few months, I believe the excellent quality makes it a good value.&lt;br</li>
            <li>blend blend blend, air brush finish  quick and fun.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is good, I really like that there is no residue left on the sponge after I wash it.</li>
            <li>The Blendercleanser deposits too much soap on the sponge which requires quite a bit of time to rinse clean.</li>
            <li>The texture is perfect for makeup, wet or dry.</li>
            <li>I feel like a fool for paying so much for a goofy pink egg and strongly scented cleanser.</li>
            <li>But I have so many brushes that cleaning them is such a chore.</li>
            <li>I have a difficult time blending out my under eye concealer but with the beauty blender I get a flawless blend.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews and seeing it multiple times on YouTube I had to try this sponge for myself.</li>
            <li>I give this product two thumbs up and would absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li>This cleanser  works great even on old dried</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to spend so much for it</li>
            <li>(So you don&#x27;t have to use as much foundation</li>
            <li>I ordered the cleanser too, so hopefully it will be a better product that I can use on other blending sponges.</li>
            <li>I never use it and hope to sell it if I can get it clean enough.</li>
            <li>I have used this with two different liquid foundations, Shiseido and Maybelline&#x27;s new FIT Me foundation.</li>
            <li>if purchasing from amazon, as it&#x27;s a better value, and you&#x27;ll have an extra one for travel, or to alternate between the sponges if you don&#x27;t feel like cleaning them all the time!</li>
            <li>I have also used it on my brushes with same success.</li>
            <li>But after several cheap I finally bit the bullet and purchased the Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much (about the size of a dime, which is what is dispensed if you use the bottle as directed) if you are cleaning your sponge on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>My makeup looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>Not sure I love the cleanser tho.</li>
            <li>Although generally I wouldn&#x27;t buy cleanser this expensive, I am happy that I have it.</li>
            <li>If there is an area of the sponge with stubborn makeup (like thick concealer) make sure that area is saturated with plenty of water first so the soap has an opportunity to actually suds up.</li>
            <li>Im lazy and don&#x27;t always clean my brushes immediately after using.</li>
            <li>The sponge has remained soft and supple even after multiple uses, something that I can not say for my cheapies.  </li>
            <li>I wind up with tiny hot pink specks on my face.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Dab, dab, dab....blend blend blend, air brush finish  quick and fun. Clean up is EZ with their product.  I am a professional beauty consultant and this is secret pros keep to themselves!!!</li>
            <li> I have heard about the Beautyblender for a long time but felt like it was a lot of money to spend on a &#x27;sponge&#x27;. It was worth it! I love the way I can put less foundation but still get great coverage. I have used this with two different liquid foundations, Shiseido and Maybelline&#x27;s new FIT Me foundation. The cleaner&#x27;s applicator is a little hard to use, but I have no real complaints. I would buy this again in a heartbeat and am likely to one for each of my 2 sisters.</li>
            <li> I love the blender.  The cleaner for the blender is wonderfully scented and doesn&#x27;t stay on the sponge once its cleaned.  But I didn&#x27;t get any sort of bottle/applicator to clean/store the blender.  I got a small little bottle of the cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so I kept it - but I wish I had the little holder/stand.</li>
            <li> This sponge is the best one I have ever used. It is great for blending concealer, and especially for blending around areas like your nose or eyes. I originally read about it in a magazine, and pre-ordered it from amazon as I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else. The price point is a little intimidating, but after having used it for a few months, I believe the excellent quality makes it a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes about using the cleanser:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is dispensed from the bottle by gently pushing the sponge down on the pedestal (exactly like the picture, you just push down and a small amount of cleanser is dispensed directly on to the sponge. Although generally I wouldn&#x27;t buy cleanser this expensive, I am happy that I have it. It has a very light lavender fragrance and is gentle and soy-based.

If you haven&#x27;t cleaned it in a few days you might need to repeat a few times, but eventually the makeup will all come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this sponge and will be buying more as gifts for friends and family. I would recommend buying the 2-pack if purchasing from amazon, as it&#x27;s a better value, and you&#x27;ll have an extra one for travel, or to alternate between the sponges if you don&#x27;t feel like cleaning them all the time! I did notice that the beautyblender website sells this sponge &amp; cleanser combination for a lower price than amazon (plus shipping though), so you may also want to shop around a bit before making this small investment!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used large blending sponges for many years and the brand I loved is no longer being made, so I searched the internet for a long time to try to find replacements.  I thought this brand would work.  But as I use it, the sponge disintergrates.  I wind up with tiny hot pink specks on my face.  Either the ones I ordered are old and already deteriorating or the product is flawed.  I would not buy these again.  Unfortunately I did not keep the receipt so I will have to eat the cost.  I ordered the cleanser too, so hopefully it will be a better product that I can use on other blending sponges.</li>
            <li> This duo set is a-mazing!  I wash my beauty blender... and ALL of my makeup brushes with this solution and it smells delightful!  &amp; softer than ever!  the beauty blender sure does its&#x27; job well... which is blending everything.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the beautyblender because the priced was so hefty. I tried to find cheaper alternatives instead. But after several cheap I finally bit the bullet and purchased the Beauty Blender. It has change my LIFE! Well it has changed my makeup life. I primarily use it to apply cream and liquid foundation and concealer. My makeup applies so smoothly and there is no cakey-ness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the beautyblender is much better than my cheap alternatives. The sponge has remained soft and supple even after multiple uses, something that I can not say for my cheapies.  The cleanser is also amazing. It cleanses the beautyblender effortlessly. I have also used it on my brushes with same success. Im lazy and don&#x27;t always clean my brushes immediately after using. But I have so many brushes that cleaning them is such a chore. This cleanser  works great even on old dried makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is truly a great purchase for me. LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> The Beautyblender is a great sponge for makeup application, but cleaning it takes time. The Blendercleanser deposits too much soap on the sponge which requires quite a bit of time to rinse clean.</li>
            <li> I tried the Beautyblender with Lancome Color Ideal makeup and it did not work well at all. It just seemed to absorb most of the foundation instead of spreading it nicely on my face. When it was time to clean the sponge with the cleanser, I had to use a lot of cleanser and scrub and scrub, and the sponge would still not come totally clean. This could be because my foundation has SPF in it or is oil free, but I still think the sponge is overrated. I feel like a fool for paying so much for a goofy pink egg and strongly scented cleanser. I never use it and hope to sell it if I can get it clean enough. A foundation brush works so much better.</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time blending out my under eye concealer but with the beauty blender I get a flawless blend. It works better for me when it&#x27;s damp. The cleanser works great for cleaning up the blender and my brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in the cosmetic industry for 15 years, and the beauty blender is by far one of the best tools I&#x27;ve ever used for foundation application!</li>
            <li> The texture is perfect for makeup, wet or dry. Loved that it is so easy to clean &amp; the blendercleanse works perfectly for the beautyblender &amp; my other makeup brushes. Great product &amp; I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to someone else!</li>
            <li> The sponge is wonderful.  My makeup looks very natural.  Occasionally I wash the sponge with my facial cleaner.  It seems to get the sponge cleaner.  Sponge must be cleaned after each use</li>
            <li> The cleanser works WONDERS for brushes and beauty blenders. And the beauty blender itself is awesome. If you&#x27;ve tried cheaper alternatives and haven&#x27;t been impressed, try this and you&#x27;ll understand the hype :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my younger sister. She had specifically asked for it for Christmas. When it arrived, it was in a manila envelope with all the pieces thrown in. The actual sponge did not have a plastic wrap on it and all of the instructions and info were crumpled at the bottom and damaged from shipping. Needless to say, it was no where near gift quality. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love he beauty blender!  Not sure I love the cleanser tho. I prefer using my gentle soap to clean, does a much better jjob.</li>
            <li> When I told my guy I was buying this he was a little shocked at the price. I actually bought this a ton cheaper on amazon that if I would of gone to Sephora. This thing is super awesome too! I&#x27;ve always been picky about my makeup sponges... I have to say that I&#x27;m a lot more happy than expected. :D</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews and seeing it multiple times on YouTube I had to try this sponge for myself. I was hesitant to spend so much for it but I have to say it is now my favorite way to apply my liquid foundation. I do wash it before each use because when it&#x27;s wet (squeeze the excess water out) it will not absorb all of your product. (So you don&#x27;t have to use as much foundation and it gives the smoothest application.) I use a stippling motion instead of a sweeping motion and this seems to work the best. The cleanser is good, I really like that there is no residue left on the sponge after I wash it. If there is an area of the sponge with stubborn makeup (like thick concealer) make sure that area is saturated with plenty of water first so the soap has an opportunity to actually suds up. I have had mine for 8 months, I use it about 3-4 times a week and there is no disintegrating happening yet. I don&#x27;t have acrylic or long nails so this might be a factor in wear-and-tear. I hope this helps! I give this product two thumbs up and would absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> This item was purchased as a gift for my daughter, who is very pleased with it! The package arrived surprisingly quickly, considering the seasonal postal overload! This is a quality product and is a good size; my daughter was very happy to have received it!</li>
            <li> This sponge is amazing, it gave me the best coverage with my makeup. Not to cakey and not to sheer... Love it!!</li>
