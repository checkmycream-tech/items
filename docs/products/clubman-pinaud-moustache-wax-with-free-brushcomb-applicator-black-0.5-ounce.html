            <li>Awesome stuff!</li>
            <li>All in all very pleased!  </li>
            <li>It works great on my handlebar mustache and has a great smell.  </li>
            <li>Works great for the stash.</li>
            <li>lol  </li>
            <li>lol  </li>
            <li>lol  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Worked great after I learned how to use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;d probably be good if you wanted to darken your moustache/beard though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it doesnt even hold good either, even if it did match my color.    </li>
            <li>Good mustache &amp; goatee wax.</li>
            <li>This is a good moustache wax.  </li>
            <li>I bought neutral color and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>and I swear I was stopped every 20 feet because ppl were complimenting either my amazing stache or my five fingers</li>
            <li>This wax is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I use the maximum hold one now, and with its almost pasty like substance it holds my mustache with ease, and for more than a day.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>It was an ok product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but my handlebar wouldn&#x27;t stay styled as desired.</li>
            <li>No point in returning it because it will cost more in shipping than I paid for the product.  </li>
            <li>A can or tin of wax would be better and make for easier removal and usage.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of all the outstanding reivew.</li>
            <li>However, I found a better value in the Walgreen&#x27;s store.  </li>
            <li>Applies easily and washes out at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>i consistently get great praise on my handlebar mustache, and it&#x27;s all thanks to this wax.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic seller&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
            <li>I use it everyday make my mustache perfect</li>
            <li>Washes out almost instantly with water which is also great cause</li>
            <li>I very much enjoyed my first experience with this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because it was hot and humid while I was trying to use it, or my mustache just required more hold -</li>
            <li>It has a bit of a lemony smell that&#x27;s pleasant, which is different from the wax smell of Murray&#x27;s wax (which i didn&#x27;t mind).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tried and true.</li>
            <li>Thanks for being able to order on this site</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to other people who are trying to grow great mustaches like I was</li>
            <li>Like very much &amp; helps moustache stay in place.  </li>
            <li>I think I may try brown next just to match my hair color better.</li>
            <li>This is and will be my first choice for styling a handlebar mustache.</li>
            <li>I suspect that the neutral version of this product is worth the money and would work well, but unless you are a stage actor or work in theater production, I HIGHLY suggest you steer away from the colored versions.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that I live in Miami, FL and from the combination of the heat, humidity and me sweating its starts to droop like 4 or 5 hrs into my day, sooner if I&#x27;m spending a lot more time outdoors.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say it makes his beard look much nicer...</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t really help much with &amp;#34;forming&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Wax doesn&#x27;t hold very well</li>
            <li>This wax does the job if you are trying to keep your moustache under control and growing straight.</li>
            <li>so it looks very foolish when it is stuck in your beard and mustache.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hold on very well either.</li>
            <li>but it just looks very unnatural and smears all over your face when trying to style it.  </li>
            <li>And the black coloring comes off easy and smudges on face!</li>
            <li>Doing so would be fine and dandy, however it started to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>Just because it says it&#x27;s for your mustache, and it&#x27;s marketing towards the dapper younger individual, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s what&#x27;s best intended for your stache.</li>
            <li>having this black wax gives the stache more thickness, and it allows me to mold it into curls.  </li>
            <li>B0026MFHAI Vibram FiveFingers W&#x27;s Classic]]</li>
            <li>Be warned, you will make a bit of a mess, but it gets better over time.</li>
            <li>This wax is probably great for theatrical application, but it is a messy pain in the posterior for daily use.</li>
            <li>the neutral leaves a white residue on my black mustache switched to the one with black tint and works great have to blend it in really well</li>
            <li>It seemed to dry out quickly in the tube.</li>
            <li>This is the black I purchased, if your mustache is black perfect if not it will be black after you use it.  </li>
            <li>Pretty simple - brush / comb works.  </li>
            <li>My beard looks naturally fuller</li>
            <li>I Think it&#x27;s old.</li>
            <li>I had a good 3 min conversation at college today with some random guy about my stache</li>
            <li>opinion was that clear is a lot better even though you have to work it in to make sure it doesn&#x27;t show up because the black is too messy (i.e. it&#x27;s black and tends to get on everything.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>What is more, it is not a natural shade of black</li>
            <li>Hides the grey and darkens the mustache very well and last the whole day.</li>
            <li>I made a mess on my face, lips and hands, even the sink was full of blackness.</li>
            <li>I just wanted wax not black wax.</li>
            <li>It is easy enough to apply, but keeping the VERY black pigment on the mustache</li>
            <li>I also purchased a white/neutral and it works better for a person like me who has some grey mixed in with the black.</li>
            <li>As a black guy my hair is very curly.</li>

            <li> As a black guy my hair is very curly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and thick, but you can add water if you&#x27;d like to thin it out.</li>
            <li> It did the job very well, that little brush it comes with is not very sturdy  </li>
            <li> The only annoyance i have with this product is how dry it goes on.</li>
            <li> This was actually the boyfriend&#x27;s purchase since he wanted to try black (his hair is naturally black) instead of the clear which is all he can find in stores around here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the super tacky hold of the product, after a few minutes it has a really strong hold but its very messy and the color is crazy unnatural.  </li>
            <li> Product is dry and crumbly.</li>
            <li> No more wild hairs.</li>
            <li> Since this is black it matches his facial hair even when it&#x27;s dry and stays put all day.</li>
            <li> However, if you need the black one and have access to the wife or girlfriend&#x27;s mascara, by all means that will work just the same.</li>
            <li> Dont buy the black one at all, get the white one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Asian man with a black mustache</li>
            <li> About the only thing I like about this is the little comb that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use this wax on my goatee when I want to add a little color &amp; character to my facial hair.</li>
            <li> I am an asian guy, so it&#x27;s hard to grow facial hair.  </li>
            <li> If you use this product, don&#x27;t scratch your face, or rub your mustache, or get your mustache wet from drinking from a cup or something.</li>
            <li> Unlike other waxes, it&#x27;s not very &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much, it only takes a little bit to do the trick!</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments from other beard enthusiasts.</li>
            <li> so it broke on me within a few days of starting to use it, but you could always find a little replacement like an eyelash brush.</li>
            <li> my husband likes to curl his mustache and had a hard time with other products turning white and flaking.</li>
            <li> I tried this product to get my mustache to stay down and not to bristly.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t tell you that it&#x27;s black.  </li>
            <li> It tends to get on your fingers, then anything you touch, but you can&#x27;t blame black wax for that.</li>
            <li> Adds a lot of black to your mush</li>
            <li> I purchased the black wax because I thought it would make my stache look thicker</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Murray&#x27;s Black Bees Wax for my mustache.</li>
            <li> After watching videos of Clubman Black Moustache Wax users, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> This is black and inky.</li>
            <li> It should say \\&quot;BLACK HAIR ONLY\\&quot; on the damn thing, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get unless you are black.</li>
            <li> Have a black moustache.</li>
            <li> I ordered this black wax because I have a black mustache</li>
            <li> and I thought that I needed the black one.</li>
            <li> It left black smudges around the edges of my mustache/beard and left the hairs a matte black finish, so it looks like I have a fake mustache.</li>
            <li> Beware, black means black.</li>
            <li> I got black figuring it would be slightly muted and let me subtler mask some reddish hairs</li>
            <li> I opened the tube and discovered it was black.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not a fan of how black it makes my mustache.</li>
            <li> the black coloring makes a mess of everything and makes my fingers look like I&#x27;ve been out working on the car all afternoon, even after washing my hands.  </li>
            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> If your hair is black with a few grays the black wax will help hide a few.</li>
            <li> I do like the little mustache comb it came with though.</li>
            <li> VERY dark color.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a heavy, creamy consistency, sort of like Vaseline, that could I apply to the brush.</li>
            <li> Only is next to impossible.</li>
            <li> The wax in this tube is extremely dry and difficult to extract.</li>
            <li> My mustache hair is long, but very thin and sparse, so</li>
            <li> Maybe I just used it wrong, but it is SO messy.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this was not the case.</li>
            <li> Eh, idk if im using it wrong but the hold lasts for like 2 hours then my mustache droops.</li>
            <li> Maybe I did it wrong (although I followed the directions) but the stuff behaved just like boot polish would have.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to spread evenly without getting dirty all over.</li>
            <li> Artificial colour.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>

            <li> Fantastic seller&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
            <li> My beard always grew in patchy and I tried a ton of things to fill it out. This wax is the best by far.  It&#x27;s good and thick, but you can add water if you&#x27;d like to thin it out. It has a tiny brush for pinpoint accuracy. It tends to get on your fingers, then anything you touch, but you can&#x27;t blame black wax for that. You can only blame mother nature. And if you got a problem with mother nature, you got a problem with me.  It can rub off, but a holding spray or spritzer can help it hold. My beard looks naturally fuller and i&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments from other beard enthusiasts.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It does everything I want.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my mustache in check. No more wild hairs. After it sets no worries of it getting on your clothes.</li>
            <li> This was actually the boyfriend&#x27;s purchase since he wanted to try black (his hair is naturally black) instead of the clear which is all he can find in stores around here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His opinion was that clear is a lot better even though you have to work it in to make sure it doesn&#x27;t show up because the black is too messy (i.e. it&#x27;s black and tends to get on everything.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;d probably be good if you wanted to darken your moustache/beard though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that he likes Clubman&#x27;s and I have to say it makes his beard look much nicer...keeps his beard in control.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It works great on my handlebar mustache and has a great smell.  It&#x27;s tried and true.</li>
            <li> Need a stronger holding wax. Wears off after an hour</li>
            <li> I like how this makes the mustache look thicker, but the color rubs off on your face and makes it look like you have dirt or dust or something on your face.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t really help much with &amp;#34;forming&amp;#34; the mustache.  If you use this product, don&#x27;t scratch your face, or rub your mustache, or get your mustache wet from drinking from a cup or something.</li>
            <li> I thought that mustache wax was the obvious answer to twirling my stache. Unfortunately this was not the case. My mustache becomes frayed after about 4 hours. I also have to use an excess amount to even hold anything in a presentable manner. Doing so would be fine and dandy, however it started to dry out my skin. I decided to switch to a gel based product, but I needed something that would hold. I switched to moco de gorila, or Gorilla Snot. I use the maximum hold one now, and with its almost pasty like substance it holds my mustache with ease, and for more than a day. Hell I even jumped in the pool and got out and it was still holding after the initial dunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, in my opinion, don&#x27;t go for mustache wax. Just because it says it&#x27;s for your mustache, and it&#x27;s marketing towards the dapper younger individual, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s what&#x27;s best intended for your stache.</li>
            <li> Works great for the stash. The only annoyance i have with this product is how dry it goes on. Unlike other waxes, it&#x27;s not very &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Eh, idk if im using it wrong but the hold lasts for like 2 hours then my mustache droops.</li>
            <li> Artificial colour. Adds a lot of black to your mush</li>
            <li> I use it everyday make my mustache perfect</li>
            <li> Wax doesn&#x27;t hold very well</li>
            <li> I ordered this just out of curiosity.  It somewhat does what it&#x27;s intended for.  However, if you need the black one and have access to the wife or girlfriend&#x27;s mascara, by all means that will work just the same.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  I purchased the black wax because I thought it would make my stache look thicker and it does.  Very happy about that lol  I recently went out of town and I swear I was stopped every 20 feet because ppl were complimenting either my amazing stache or my five fingers [[ASIN:B0026MFHAI Vibram FiveFingers W&#x27;s Classic]] lol  I had a good 3 min conversation at college today with some random guy about my stache lol  The only downside is that I live in Miami, FL and from the combination of the heat, humidity and me sweating its starts to droop like 4 or 5 hrs into my day, sooner if I&#x27;m spending a lot more time outdoors.  All in all very pleased!  Washes out almost instantly with water which is also great cause I don&#x27;t like smudging my pillow cases with stache wax.  I will buy some again soon.</li>
            <li> my husband likes to curl his mustache and had a hard time with other products turning white and flaking. Since this is black it matches his facial hair even when it&#x27;s dry and stays put all day. Awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> It was an ok product. It seemed to dry out quickly in the tube.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just used it wrong, but it is SO messy.  It would constantly get on my lips and hands (although the hands part is my fault since I constantly touch it.)</li>
            <li> I very much enjoyed my first experience with this. There is definitely a learning curve with applying it, however I was please with the results. I think I may try brown next just to match my hair color better. Definitely gives it a fuller look. Be warned, you will make a bit of a mess, but it gets better over time.</li>
            <li> This wax is probably great for theatrical application, but it is a messy pain in the posterior for daily use. It is easy enough to apply, but keeping the VERY black pigment on the mustache Only is next to impossible. I suspect that the neutral version of this product is worth the money and would work well, but unless you are a stage actor or work in theater production, I HIGHLY suggest you steer away from the colored versions.</li>
            <li> As a black guy my hair is very curly. I&#x27;ve been using Murray&#x27;s Black Bees Wax for my mustache. It&#x27;s okay, but my handlebar wouldn&#x27;t stay styled as desired. After watching videos of Clubman Black Moustache Wax users, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold. This stuff makes it stay put as desired. This is and will be my first choice for styling a handlebar mustache. It has a bit of a lemony smell that&#x27;s pleasant, which is different from the wax smell of Murray&#x27;s wax (which i didn&#x27;t mind). If your hair is black with a few grays the black wax will help hide a few. So if you&#x27;re looking for a wax to style that mustache, this is it!</li>
            <li> Product is dry and crumbly. I thought it would be a heavy, creamy consistency, sort of like Vaseline, that could I apply to the brush. I Think it&#x27;s old. No point in returning it because it will cost more in shipping than I paid for the product.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The wax in this tube is extremely dry and difficult to extract. A can or tin of wax would be better and make for easier removal and usage. And the black coloring comes off easy and smudges on face!</li>
            <li> This wax does the job if you are trying to keep your moustache under control and growing straight. I didn&#x27;t necessarily buy it to get rid of the gray hairs but it does that to. I would recommend this item to anyone with a lot of moustache, it&#x27;ll allow you to shape it as you desire.</li>
            <li> Too chunky for my taste it&#x27;s difficult to spread evenly without getting dirty all over. Try the wax that comes in a chap stick like container.</li>
            <li> About the only thing I like about this is the little comb that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two problems with the product -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) the black coloring makes a mess of everything and makes my fingers look like I&#x27;ve been out working on the car all afternoon, even after washing my hands.  Since they offer a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; color this wouldn&#x27;t be the end of the world except for ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It doesn&#x27;t hold my mustache.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because it was hot and humid while I was trying to use it, or my mustache just required more hold - but this didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Maybe I did it wrong (although I followed the directions) but the stuff behaved just like boot polish would have. It was a bit greasy and it hardened to my mustache. What is more, it is not a natural shade of black so it looks very foolish when it is stuck in your beard and mustache. I would recommend trying a different product.</li>
            <li> I am white. This is black and inky. It got all over my skin and looked like s*** on my face. Why didn&#x27;t anyone tell me this is not for white people? It should say \\&quot;BLACK HAIR ONLY\\&quot; on the damn thing, but it doesn&#x27;t. Pissed me off. I shaved my moustache off the same day I got this s*** in the mail.  And it doesnt even hold good either, even if it did match my color.    Don&#x27;t get unless you are black. Have a black moustache.</li>
            <li> I ordered this black wax because I have a black mustache and I thought that I needed the black one. Boy was I wrong! I made a mess on my face, lips and hands, even the sink was full of blackness. It didn&#x27;t hold on very well either. Dont buy the black one at all, get the white one.</li>
            <li> It left black smudges around the edges of my mustache/beard and left the hairs a matte black finish, so it looks like I have a fake mustache. Not cool.</li>
            <li> Great product. Beware, black means black. VERY dark color. I bought neutral color and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I like the super tacky hold of the product, after a few minutes it has a really strong hold but its very messy and the color is crazy unnatural.  I got black figuring it would be slightly muted and let me subtler mask some reddish hairs but it just looks very unnatural and smears all over your face when trying to style it.  I would maybe try it again for the tac but in a different color.</li>
            <li> I requested the neutral color - since my mustache was white.  I opened the tube and discovered it was black.  Not what I wanted. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the outstanding reivew. I&#x27;m an Asian man with a black mustache and I&#x27;m not a fan of how black it makes my mustache. It looks almost un-natural. I do like the little mustache comb it came with though. I think I&#x27;ll stick with my Firehouse mustache wax.</li>
            <li> Like very much &amp; helps moustache stay in place.  Only place can find product is here.  Thanks for being able to order on this site</li>
            <li> Just what I askef for.</li>
            <li> i consistently get great praise on my handlebar mustache, and it&#x27;s all thanks to this wax.  I am an asian guy, so it&#x27;s hard to grow facial hair.  My mustache hair is long, but very thin and sparse, so having this black wax gives the stache more thickness, and it allows me to mold it into curls.  Definitely recommend it!  if it gets on your face while you&#x27;re trying to mold it, just use a qtip to wipe away the extra unwanted wax on your face.</li>
            <li> Worked great after I learned how to use it.</li>
            <li> Pretty simple - brush / comb works.  This is the black I purchased, if your mustache is black perfect if not it will be black after you use it.  I also purchased a white/neutral and it works better for a person like me who has some grey mixed in with the black.</li>
            <li> Good mustache &amp; goatee wax. I use this wax on my goatee when I want to add a little color &amp; character to my facial hair. Applies easily and washes out at the end of the day. Shipping was prompt.</li>
            <li> This is a good moustache wax.  However, I found a better value in the Walgreen&#x27;s store.  For the same price at Walgreen&#x27;s The wax came with a comb and sissors.  However, not all Wallgreen&#x27;s carry moustache wax.</li>
