            <li>Amazon is the best : )  </li>

            <li>best spray on market,Aveda products are top of the line and they smell clean too.</li>
            <li>sometimes my hair will fly if there&#x27;s a strong wind</li>
            <li>Nice scent as well.</li>
            <li>But, I have to be honest.</li>
            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell, very easy to brush or comb out.  </li>
            <li>She was so very happy to get a new can of Aveda Air Control.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very strong and pungent.</li>
            <li>Smell is not as good as the shampoo either but holds well and a fine spray not overwelming.</li>
            <li>It is perfect to add volume, never stiff or sticky.  </li>
            <li>It is okay not that amazing like the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray because I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both love and use Air control by Aveda.  </li>
            <li>Love this product - goes on nice and light, and yet keeps my style all day.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, I have used it for years and will always return to it.</li>
            <li>Love is product...</li>
            <li>Nice light aroma.</li>
            <li>Love Aveda products.</li>
            <li>Very light hold, so it is easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Love this hairspray, it&#x27;s light but adds volume and texture.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells like pine trees, STRONGLY, all about my head and face area.</li>
            <li>I give this product high marks for feeling light and giving good hold, but I dislike the smell.  </li>
            <li>I am 63 and have tried every product ever on the market for baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light but has a strong spray of air with it or something, so if you have fine hair, look out because it will blow your style all over the place.  </li>
            <li>which is fine...</li>
            <li>A light went on and I shopped Amazon...</li>
            <li>Hold the can about 12 inches from your hair and spray lightly while moving the spray can around your head.</li>
            <li>(Something pine-tree free, preferably.)</li>
            <li>Light spray with adequate hold.</li>
            <li>As someone with fine, thin hair, I haven&#x27;t had great success with most hairspray products.</li>
            <li>Very light hold and all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Pricey and not crazy about the scent</li>
            <li>This hair spray leaves your hair feeling good not sticky like other products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right for hair like mine.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I really like how it holds my hair in place without weighing it down</li>
            <li>The smell is light and natural.</li>
            <li>Overall I love Aveda Air Control.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely be purchasing replacement bottles online as they are cheaper and much more convenient than finding an Aveda retail location.</li>
            <li>I took off 1 star because you need to apply a lot of product to get a decent hold for up-dos, so it uses up quickly.</li>
            <li>Aveda also has another spray called Controlforce which I think would be the better choice for thicker, coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I have never paid this much for hair spray and people around me</li>
            <li>I was thinking something much lighter and freshner, not that it would feel akin to having 6 pine tree air fresheners hanging from my ears.</li>
            <li>Bought this to try because I like the shampoo so much from Aveda.</li>
            <li>Bairly can feel it&#x27;s on, but still holds very well</li>
            <li>and I really like the smell.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this feels on your hair.</li>
            <li>I only wish it came in a travel size, because I would like to have an extra handy at work and in my travel bag.</li>
            <li>First off the scent of this hairspray is divine :) it works well for my fine, thin hair; doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it sticky, and it&#x27;s easy to brush out.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair like some of the other reviewers, and, like them, had high hopes that this would be the one product that would really work for me.</li>
            <li>highly reccommed this product</li>
            <li>I have straight fine hair and this product was supposed to keep my hair in place without bogging it down.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the hold is reasonably good, and my hair is still reasonably \\&quot;touchable\\&quot; given that it&#x27;s been showered in 500 spritzes of gunk in the morning (exaggeration).</li>
            <li>Kudos to Aveda for working to develop a hairspray with significantly lower VOCs than other aerosol hairsprays.  </li>
            <li>Just flip your head upside down and spray this, soft, clean volume all day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Aveda is a all natural product.  </li>
            <li>However, I won&#x27;t be surprised if I return to a cheaper, drug store alternative later on.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair greater lift, shape and hold without weighing it down or looking too stiff.</li>
            <li>Right now I can blow dry or roll my medium vamp bob, then turn my head upside down, spray, then stand up and pick hair line into place....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a fine mist that gently controls my hair without making it stiff or hard!  </li>
            <li>My hair is so thin and fine</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My hair is so thin and fine</li>
            <li> I might be more sensitive than some people, however, since I only occasionally use hairspray and hate perfume.</li>
            <li> said she had been making her other can last and last and was over the moon.</li>
            <li> You must hold the spray at least 12 to 15 inches from you hair style then spray gently.  </li>
            <li> Mostly because I&#x27;m afraid they might murder me with a cigarette lighter/hairspray bomb in my sleep.</li>
            <li> When I went outside to walk to a bus stop which only took about 10 min or so, my hair just went down.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s honestly not much better than the over-the-counter Herbal Essences hairspray I was using previously, and the one thing that the Herbal REALLY has going for it over this is the smell, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly terrible with hair products, and so many people love this hairspray that I&#x27;m hesitant to write anything negative about it.</li>
            <li> Less harmful to human and environmental health.  </li>
            <li> I do like the way my hair feels compared to other products, and the bottle was pretty expensive, so I&#x27;ll finish it out and see if I don&#x27;t come around.</li>
            <li> Only use a small amount .  </li>
            <li> Which means I&#x27;ll continue using it, but they need to tone it down a bit!</li>
            <li> They tend to be heavy, sticky, and have an artificial/chemical scent.</li>
            <li> without leaving it heavy or stiff</li>
            <li> so I need a hairspray that can tame fly-aways but still allows for movement without being sticky.</li>
            <li> Hate the price, but it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> also use this when I need my hair to have some &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; and lose it slick, slipperiness.</li>
            <li> rather that happen then to have a stiff hairdo that looks like a helmet!</li>
            <li> Would still recommend it if you don&#x27;t have thick hair.</li>
            <li> are always asking me what the weird smell is.  </li>
            <li> Holds while allowing movement (no helmet head effect), a difficult combination to find.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the amount of aerosol in the</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry buying this product.</li>
            <li> I seriously can&#x27;t smell anything else but the hairspray!!</li>
            <li> STINKS.</li>
            <li> The hold is mediocre, but the SMELL is awful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I will not be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> I hate that!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this stuff! Pricey and not crazy about the scent but it does the job without the crunch.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love and use Air control by Aveda.  She does not have a store in her town&lt;br /&gt;that sells it and makes the bottles I buy her when she visits last.  A light went on and I shopped Amazon...&lt;br /&gt;Of course ..they had it!  Amazon is the best : )  She was so very happy to get a new can of Aveda Air Control.&lt;br /&gt;She said she had been making her other can last and last and was over the moon. to get this.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have straight fine hair and this product was supposed to keep my hair in place without bogging it down.  I believe it is a good product but I need something stronger to keep my hair in place all day.  Would still recommend it if you don&#x27;t have thick hair.</li>
            <li> The hold is mediocre, but the SMELL is awful.  I can&#x27;t even stand to use it.  I have never paid this much for hair spray and people around me are always asking me what the weird smell is.  I think it must be the cloves in there or something, but it is overpowering.</li>
            <li> Love this product - goes on nice and light, and yet keeps my style all day. Nice scent as well.</li>
            <li> I am 63 and have tried every product ever on the market for baby fine hair. This is the only one I would recommend. I wish I had discovered it before I was 61 ! Hold the can about 12 inches from your hair and spray lightly while moving the spray can around your head. Then style with your fingers. Holds while allowing movement (no helmet head effect), a difficult combination to find. It worked equally well on my short, messy, spiked punk rocker layed do as it now works on my straight vamp medium length bob. Right now I can blow dry or roll my medium vamp bob, then turn my head upside down, spray, then stand up and pick hair line into place....lots of volume that holds! Hate the price, but it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> best spray on market,Aveda products are top of the line and they smell clean too.It does not build up and get sticky</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light but has a strong spray of air with it or something, so if you have fine hair, look out because it will blow your style all over the place.  You must hold the spray at least 12 to 15 inches from you hair style then spray gently.  Has a nice smell, very easy to brush or comb out.  I still use it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hairspray, works great and smells good too!!</li>
            <li> Very light hold, so it is easy to work with. This brand always has great products, so I am a fan of the makeup and hair products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly terrible with hair products, and so many people love this hairspray that I&#x27;m hesitant to write anything negative about it. Mostly because I&#x27;m afraid they might murder me with a cigarette lighter/hairspray bomb in my sleep. But, I have to be honest. I have fine hair like some of the other reviewers, and, like them, had high hopes that this would be the one product that would really work for me. It&#x27;s not. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the hold is reasonably good, and my hair is still reasonably \\&quot;touchable\\&quot; given that it&#x27;s been showered in 500 spritzes of gunk in the morning (exaggeration). However, it&#x27;s honestly not much better than the over-the-counter Herbal Essences hairspray I was using previously, and the one thing that the Herbal REALLY has going for it over this is the smell, in my opinion. This stuff smells like pine trees, STRONGLY, all about my head and face area. When people kept referring to its \\&quot;natural\\&quot; smell I was thinking something much lighter and freshner, not that it would feel akin to having 6 pine tree air fresheners hanging from my ears. Anyway, it&#x27;s okay. I do like the way my hair feels compared to other products, and the bottle was pretty expensive, so I&#x27;ll finish it out and see if I don&#x27;t come around. Maybe I will. However, I won&#x27;t be surprised if I return to a cheaper, drug store alternative later on. (Something pine-tree free, preferably.)</li>
            <li> This is truly a movable hairspray and I like everything about it except that the smell overpowers my perfume scent!!!! I hate that! I seriously can&#x27;t smell anything else but the hairspray!! Bummer, cuz I love how it works! Which means I&#x27;ll continue using it, but they need to tone it down a bit!</li>
            <li> Aveda is awesome, all of it.   It is nonsense when people say the drug store brand is just as good.  Only use a small amount .  good stuff</li>
            <li> As someone with fine, thin hair, I haven&#x27;t had great success with most hairspray products. They tend to be heavy, sticky, and have an artificial/chemical scent. A friend suggested I try this, and thankfully I did. It&#x27;s just right for hair like mine. It gives my hair greater lift, shape and hold without weighing it down or looking too stiff. I can actually put a brush through my hair after I spray to touch up. The smell is light and natural. I only wish it came in a travel size, because I would like to have an extra handy at work and in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> gift product...like the environmental properties</li>
            <li> I have curly hair so I need a hairspray that can tame fly-aways but still allows for movement without being sticky. Overall I love Aveda Air Control. I think this is my 3rd or 4th bottle now. Unfortunately the amount of aerosol in the can sometimes isn&#x27;t sufficient to get all of the hairspray out of the bottle (this happened on 1 bottle I bought online otherwise my rating would be 5 stars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing replacement bottles online as they are cheaper and much more convenient than finding an Aveda retail location.</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray!!  It is perfect to add volume, never stiff or sticky.  And it smells soo good.  My hair is so thin and fine, I am forever trying  to add volume.  Forget the mousse!  Just flip your head upside down and spray this, soft, clean volume all day.&lt;br /&gt;I also use this when I need my hair to have some &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; and lose it slick, slipperiness. Like when I do a sock bun or something.</li>
            <li> Kudos to Aveda for working to develop a hairspray with significantly lower VOCs than other aerosol hairsprays.  Less harmful to human and environmental health.  I give this product high marks for feeling light and giving good hold, but I dislike the smell.  It&#x27;s flowery and overpowering.  I might be more sensitive than some people, however, since I only occasionally use hairspray and hate perfume.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Bought this to try because I like the shampoo so much from Aveda. It is okay not that amazing like the shampoo. Smell is not as good as the shampoo either but holds well and a fine spray not overwelming.</li>
            <li> The best hairspray ever.  Bairly can feel it&#x27;s on, but still holds very well</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray, it&#x27;s light but adds volume and texture. The only con is the smell...it&#x27;s very strong and pungent.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this hairspray.  Strong a hold as you desire with layering, smells great, doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel starched, all-around-awesome buy!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray because I have very fine hair and I can apply a ton of this spray and it give me a great hold without giving me a helmet head - :-)</li>
            <li> but it wouldn&#x27;t spray! What a nuisance to return and all. It is my favorite hair spray when it sprays!</li>
            <li> STINKS. The hold is about 4/10. When I went outside to walk to a bus stop which only took about 10 min or so, my hair just went down.</li>
            <li> Aveda is a all natural product.  If I use anything else it does not agree with my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I have used it for years and will always return to it. Has a wonderful woodsy, sandlewood smell not the alcohol smell of most hairsprays.</li>
            <li> Love is product...it works great on my hair ...which is fine...without leaving it heavy or stiff&lt;br /&gt;I highly reccommed this product</li>
            <li> Light spray with adequate hold. Nice light aroma.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I really like how it holds my hair in place without weighing it down, however, this is my second bottle that the aerosol spray has stopped working. The nozzle is not clogged it just won&#x27;t spray. The cost does not allow for throwing away 3/4 of a bottle. I&#x27;m afraid I will not be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> Love Aveda products. This hair spray leaves your hair feeling good not sticky like other products. You will not be sorry buying this product. Excellent!!</li>
            <li> It holds good and I really like the smell.</li>
            <li> this is my holy grail for keeping my hair in place.  it&#x27;s a fine mist that gently controls my hair without making it stiff or hard!  sometimes my hair will fly if there&#x27;s a strong wind but i&#x27;d rather that happen then to have a stiff hairdo that looks like a helmet!</li>
            <li> First off the scent of this hairspray is divine :) it works well for my fine, thin hair; doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it sticky, and it&#x27;s easy to brush out. I took off 1 star because you need to apply a lot of product to get a decent hold for up-dos, so it uses up quickly. Aveda also has another spray called Controlforce which I think would be the better choice for thicker, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray ever.  Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Very light hold and all natural ingredients. I really like the way this feels on your hair.</li>
            <li> I like it but this time I received a can that got clogged when I sprayed. Never had that happen before.</li>
