            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>We all love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Lotion for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love this product makes my skin feel, so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>once worked for a company that distributed Goat Milk lotions and was glad to find it at Amazon</li>
            <li>I use the Canus Goats Milk Bar Soap and love it for it&#x27;s moisture</li>
            <li>The moment it touched my skin, I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>Smells like warm, sweet milk.</li>
            <li>best lotion and soaps out there for dry skin or winter itch.  </li>
            <li>Works great to keep your feet soft too.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful and it keeps my rough fingers from snagging fine linen or silk threads.  </li>
            <li>Makes skin smooth as silk and the scent doesn&#x27;t smell very natural but is really good.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh &amp;#34;off the shower&amp;#34; scent and its moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li>The lotion goes on smoothly and does not leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>It has a rich feel and does not leave your hands feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>The original scent is good for both male and females.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m able to stitch very soon after applying the lotion.  </li>
            <li>Cannot say enough good about this product.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is very good for dry skin and it is not irritating at all.  </li>
            <li>I think it would be ok for older women.</li>
            <li>It also soaks in quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>It seems they&#x27;ve changed the formula a little, but still a great product.</li>
            <li>Was looking for something natural to use for body lotion but the scent was so overwhelming</li>
            <li>I thought this really sounds good, so I bought the larger bottle.</li>
            <li>This lotion is good but its a little watery when applying it to your skin.</li>
            <li>My first bottle of this lotion was a gift from a fellow stitcher.  </li>
            <li>This lotion keeps them smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my winter hands!</li>
            <li>The first time I used this was at a stove/fireplace shop.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought I would not like the scent, but I feel it is a clean and natural scent that I like very much.  </li>
            <li>I had used the Canus -Goat&#x27;s Milk shower gel and really liked it so decided to give some of their other products.  </li>
            <li>Although the lotion is absorbed quickly, the scent is almost over-powering and lasts more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li>It smells good and is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>i tried the canus soap bar before, but i guess this one is complementary to it as the soap bar tends to dry out the skin even more than liquid soap</li>
            <li>It might be a find product and it&#x27;s definitely a matter of taste, but I don&#x27;t care for strongly scented anything.</li>
            <li>This product really lives up what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>I use it on my whole body, even my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lotion does what it&#x27;s supposed to very well</li>
            <li>so I thought this...being Original Fragrance...would smell the same.  </li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t want to jinx this but the dry, cracked areas are smooth and soft for now.  </li>
            <li>A must buy and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>We live in New Mexico, very low humidity here, so your skin dries out so quickly.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself has good texture and absorbs without leaving a greasy feeling behind.</li>
            <li>The lotion smooths right in and is totally not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to find in the store so it is very easy to order it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Really leaves my skin soft and not dry for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>very natural scent and moisturizing product.</li>
            <li>I first found out about Canus goat products from my college Varsity Cross Country and Track &amp; Field women&#x27;s locker room.  </li>
            <li>I use it frequently since there is no lingering feel.</li>
            <li>I was amazed to hear that her skin problems have completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>Ill be buying more!</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis on my hands and joints so nothing much helps other than to keep some moisture on the surface and temporary smoothness.  </li>
            <li>This is always hard to find for me, always a part of my daily routine, so I was excited that Amazon offered it,.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Product is good but i didnt like the smell.I wasn&#x27;t milky as i expected but smelled like old grandma perfume!I like packing and consistency.It could be thicker but i wouldn&#x27;t buy it again cause of the smell!</li>
            <li> My first bottle of this lotion was a gift from a fellow stitcher.  I will always be grateful.  I am very impressed with the results. I have psoriasis on my hands and joints so nothing much helps other than to keep some moisture on the surface and temporary smoothness.  I did find, though, that this seemed to do a really good job of that.  I certainly don&#x27;t want to jinx this but the dry, cracked areas are smooth and soft for now.  I use it often and even ordered 2 bottles this time.  I also do a lot of needlework by hand and this lotion does not leave a greasy feel or residue on my hands so I&#x27;m able to stitch very soon after applying the lotion.  It is wonderful and it keeps my rough fingers from snagging fine linen or silk threads.  I&#x27;m hoping they don&#x27;t discontinue or stop distributing this product.  That would make me very sad.  :-)</li>
            <li> This product really lives up what it says it will do. Really leaves my skin soft and not dry for the whole day.  I love, Love, Love this lotion. Would recomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is great lotion. It has a rich feel and does not leave your hands feeling greasy.  I use it frequently since there is no lingering feel. Is not slimy when you wash your hands.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite lotion. I love the fresh &amp;#34;off the shower&amp;#34; scent and its moisturizing effect. The scent dissipates a notch after a couple of hours but can still remain on the skin. The lotion goes on smoothly and does not leave a greasy feeling. Currently now on my reorder list and also hoping to find it in one of the stores.  A must buy and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for almost 5 years and it is great. We live in New Mexico, very low humidity here, so your skin dries out so quickly. I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy and icky and the fragrance is not overwhelming. I use it on my whole body, even my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I order this lotion alot. I love the way it moisturizes my skin and I also give it as a gift. It is hard to find in the store so it is very easy to order it on Amazon. I will order this again in the future.</li>
            <li> This lotion has changed my sister&#x27;s life. She has had problems with psoriasis for years. I came across this lotion one day and decided to purchase it for her to see if it would help at all. I was amazed to hear that her skin problems have completely disappeared. She no longer has the dry flaky patches and is no longer irritated. I suggest this product to anyone who has skin problems.</li>
            <li> Love love love this hand lotion. I use this in conjunction with the body butter. It&#x27;s the only lotion I use on my hands. Nothing else could possibly compare to this and I&#x27;ve tried just about everything! I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 years and will never use anything else again!</li>
            <li> I use my hands every day at work! They get dry. This lotion keeps them smooth and soft. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  At first I thought I would not like the scent, but I feel it is a clean and natural scent that I like very much.  The lotion is very good for dry skin and it is not irritating at all.  The lotion smooths right in and is totally not greasy at all.  I will purchase this again and again.</li>
            <li> I puchase this product for myself, my mother and my grandmother. We all love it. It is not sticky. It smells good and is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> great Item  !!! my wife loves it</li>
            <li> This is always hard to find for me, always a part of my daily routine, so I was excited that Amazon offered it,.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself has good texture and absorbs without leaving a greasy feeling behind. The one problem I do have with it is the scent is too overpowering and it ended up giving me a headache so I doubt I will use it often or at all.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Smells clean and feels great!</li>
            <li> very natural scent and moisturizing product. i tried the canus soap bar before, but i guess this one is complementary to it as the soap bar tends to dry out the skin even more than liquid soap</li>
            <li> The best smelling and the most lather.</li>
            <li> Cannot say enough good about this product.  Lasts throughout the day and has a very pleasant smell.  Priced amazingly well compared to the retail stores.  Ill be buying more!</li>
            <li> Was looking for something natural to use for body lotion but the scent was so overwhelming I washed it off and couldn&#x27;t use it. I think it would be ok for older women.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this on Amazon! It is the best lotion I have ever had. Great</li>
            <li> best lotion and soaps out there for dry skin or winter itch.  The original scent is good for both male and females.</li>

            <li> I first found out about Canus goat products from my college Varsity Cross Country and Track &amp; Field women&#x27;s locker room.  One of my teammates had the body butter, and I would steal a little bit every now and then from her locker after a shower.  I bought a pump bottle of the stuff from Amazon and had it shipped to her because I wound up using hers ALL THE TIME.  It&#x27;s so good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Lotion for many years.  It seems they&#x27;ve changed the formula a little, but still a great product.</li>
            <li> Makes skin smooth as silk and the scent doesn&#x27;t smell very natural but is really good. Smells like warm, sweet milk.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product everyday and loves it.  She has used these products for quite some time and has given it as gifts to others.</li>
            <li> We have used this product for years but have always had trouble finding it. We found it to be great for the skin. Glad to see we can get it from Amazon - don&#x27;t know why we didn&#x27;t think of it sooner!</li>
            <li> This lotion is good but its a little watery when applying it to your skin. I would buy again because of the price.</li>
            <li> I 1st bought for a friend; she loved, bought some for me.  I think it&#x27;s a good year-long lotion, but will prob. use something thicker in winter months.</li>
            <li> I had used the Canus -Goat&#x27;s Milk shower gel and really liked it so decided to give some of their other products.  The moisturizing lotion have become a go to favorite lotion, not greasy and softens nicely.  Works great to keep your feet soft too.</li>
            <li> Although the lotion is absorbed quickly, the scent is almost over-powering and lasts more than a few minutes. Haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my winter hands!</li>
            <li> I love this product makes my skin feel, so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to my friends&lt;br /&gt;I once worked for a company that distributed Goat Milk lotions and was glad to find it at Amazon</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent...clean and fresh!  Great lotion, it softens and lasts quite well.  It also soaks in quickly.  I shall definitely re-buy!</li>
            <li> It smells awesome and it is a really nice lotion for dry skin,I love it and the bottle is the cutest thing!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift, she likes it</li>
            <li> I do like the texture and scent of the product. After working with my hands.I find that the product does soften rough skin.  I find it difficult to find the product in local stores.  With the added cost of mailing and purchasing through the internet, I consider the product a bit pricey,but I do like it.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing ability of this lotion is A-MAZ-ING. I use the Canus Goats Milk Bar Soap and love it for it&#x27;s moisture and I loved the smell so I thought this...being Original Fragrance...would smell the same.  It does NOT.  It stinks like perfume BAD. And not good perfume.The lotion does what it&#x27;s supposed to very well but I can&#x27;t use it because the smell sticks with you for a very long time after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GO WITH THE UNSCENTED!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this was at a stove/fireplace shop.  I thought this really sounds good, so I bought the larger bottle. The moment it touched my skin, I fell in love with it.  I have begged the store to keep it in stock but they balk.  So, I checked it out and found it cheaper on Amazon than in the shop. I have been using this Canus Goat Milk&#x27;s Lotion for about 4 years.  Now that I have found I can order this at Amazon, I won&#x27;t be pleading with the store to stock it.</li>
            <li> this is the best lotion I have ever used.  Put it on, and it disappears into your skin.. . . . NO greasy feeling.  And it smells wonderful</li>
