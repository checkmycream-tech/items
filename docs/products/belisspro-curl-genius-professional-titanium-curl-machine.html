            <li>and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>I feel like Julia Roberts (her hair was awesome )in pretty Woman.</li>
            <li>Worked perfectly out of the box, easy to use, and FUN!  </li>
            <li>it truly is amazing.</li>
            <li>but it is amazing and despite the lack of beeps</li>
            <li>I curl my hair and pull it on top of my head and it looks so good...</li>
            <li>ur hair kind off</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another nice feature:</li>
            <li>Her &amp; her friends really liked it.</li>
            <li>I say save your money or invest in a nice curling iron instead.</li>
            <li>zero science you don&#x27;t have to put the curls in any kind of form</li>
            <li>I am more than pleased!</li>
            <li>My hair is color treated and very fine, but I have a lot of it and</li>
            <li>the product came very fast and I am so happy I got it now with all the partys I have coming up  even with x-mas....</li>
            <li>Be sure not to over load the curler, I did a couple of times and it stops and beeps and releases, allowing me to easily get my hair out!</li>
            <li>I liked how easy the product was to use.</li>
            <li>there are certain ways to hold it and there are some great tips.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did, I feel like I saved $50.  </li>
            <li>Extremely pleased with the curl genius.</li>
            <li>if I could I would post a pic I love how my hair looked</li>
            <li>I love this curl machine.  </li>
            <li>I wish it grabbed more hair.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>But for straight hair, it works great.</li>
            <li>Got this today and I am TOTALLY IN LOVE with it.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this machine.</li>
            <li>I love the texture my hair is after I use this.  </li>
            <li>Still, I love the waves.  </li>
            <li>I got this for Christmas last year from my wonderful mother that knows I have no hair styling talent</li>
            <li>Ince you get the trick to this you would love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done my hair many times and everyone likes it.</li>
            <li>I was not about to cut my hair as many others have, so my husband tried to disassemble it, but no go.  </li>
            <li>Here I am 15 minutes later typing this with a head full of curls !!!!!!</li>
            <li>and I was able to make curls without even looking in the mirror</li>
            <li>I was very excited about making curls like the ones I saw on tv.</li>
            <li>The curls it did produce looked great, but had to break off the hair that hot caught, no way to get it free.</li>
            <li>It still produces beautiful locks that look natural without the option of direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So easy and results are pleasing. :)</li>
            <li>Always brush the hair with a brush and then with a fine tooth comb to make sure the tangles are all gone.  </li>
            <li>My 9 year old can do it to herself and it looks great on her too.  </li>
            <li>Make sure hair is combed out and smooth.</li>
            <li>Easy way to curl your hair.</li>
            <li>The hair was easy to release from the chamber without losing any hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is incredibly easy to use and the curls are</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>My hair grabs curl so easily.</li>
            <li>I was thinking it would be nice to have to curl my hair for special occasions, but it is so quick and easy</li>
            <li>Cool stuff:)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may be working fine for you, but believe me, you will get all tangled up eventually.  </li>
            <li>I have been cursed with fine &amp;#34;nothing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>it is quick once you get the hang of it!  </li>
            <li>Her hair turns out super cute.</li>
            <li>Except for the fact that it has simplified one tiny part of my life, which makes it SMART to own!!!</li>
            <li>My niece introduced me to the BeLiss Pro Curl, and I thought it was fantastic when she got through curling my hair.  </li>
            <li>This product does make amazing curls, for longer straight hair.</li>
            <li>it worked perfectly with out any trouble.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Affordable and super easy to use on myself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Today I tried it on 2 of my Granddaughters, the youngest has super, baby fine hair</li>
            <li>I was so excited to give it to her for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>I bought this in October and have used it several times on my own hair, love the curls and the fact that even after I sleep on them they are still there.</li>
            <li>Easy, Fun and Professional!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am able to do beautiful and consisent loose curls in a quarter of the time than with a regular wand curling iron, and they look 50 times better cause it gets the tip of the hair</li>
            <li>i just woke up with a head full of curls</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and create a new style for you when you need it.</li>
            <li>but this is so easy to use that I have already styled my hair a few times and gotten so many compliments!!</li>
            <li>This does wonders on my fine, straight hair!  </li>
            <li>It gets very hot</li>
            <li>Well it curls fast and strong.</li>
            <li>its fast and easy.</li>
            <li>Not only would it not let go, but it continued to gather more hair until it was up against my scalp!  </li>
            <li>and it makes all the curls look uniform and really pretty!</li>
            <li>My hair is as straight as hair can get, this not only curls beautifully, but the curls stay and last for many hours.</li>
            <li>its a good machine, it curls the hair beautifully and fast, my only con is that my hair got stuck on it a few times</li>
            <li>My wife loves it, great little machine and for that price, when you get used to it</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re like me, you purchased this curling machine because you suck at doing your own hair, especially when it comes to curling it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this twice but am happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I couldn&#x27;t tell if it left my hair frizzy from not distributing heat evenly</li>
            <li>Well worth the money to get this iron.</li>
            <li>Key make sure that your hair is clean.</li>
            <li>and I freaked out and opened it right away and pulled so it made a knot with my hair inside of it.</li>
            <li>right.  </li>
            <li>but wow I love mine  and use it every day  what  very neet to have it realy  </li>
            <li>Since I have naturally wavy hair, my hair holds curl easily.</li>
            <li>so I prefer a 1 1/4\\&quot; curling iron as my preferred method to get nice, loose curls.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried that it would take me time to learn how to use it and get it to look good.</li>
            <li>I saw an add on tv and thought I would check here first.  </li>
            <li>would recommend it to anyone who is willing to buy it</li>
            <li>at first..</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>First use it caught my hair up and no release, I ripped my hair out of it.</li>
            <li>First attempt, I set it at lowest heat and on 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>or if it was frying my hair (pretty sure it was the latter).</li>
            <li>The first time she used it, her hair got stuck in it.</li>
            <li>So the first time I used this thing, it was a NIGHTMARE.</li>
            <li>I did decide to give it another go, and I realized that if your hair gets stuck, make sure you DONT open the device.</li>
            <li>The first go at it</li>
            <li>Overall, I love it.</li>
            <li>It works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>and I have had multiple friends borrow it just to try it out! :)</li>
            <li>Finally I was free!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In closing, i say this is a good machine if you want messy looking curls</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t feel right leaving the house with straight hair anymore.</li>
            <li>Flat iron works better and curls stay longer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, worth every penny</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone who has fine, straight hair and wants to try a new look!</li>
            <li>Pretty soon my entire office will be full of curly-haired women!</li>
            <li>not much just need to make sure to out it in the right place</li>
            <li>My hair is very long and my curls are fabulous!</li>
            <li>It was so easy, my Husband was amazed at the way the hair is just sucked up by the machine and 4 beeps later ( it beeps to let you know the curl is done)</li>
            <li>my expectations were very high</li>
            <li>me putting too much hair in it.</li>
            <li>ty seller for getting it out so fast..</li>
            <li>If you put to much hair in, it just beeps at you and you have to redo it.  </li>
            <li>Considering it didn&#x27;t use to hold a curl even until I had finished my whole head</li>
            <li>After using a couple times I really got the hang of it.</li>
            <li>and it works really well</li>
            <li>Recvd fast.</li>
            <li>, you just have to be mindful of not trying to put too much hair in the machine at one time.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is dummy proof is for people of that it is so easy-to-use thanks</li>
            <li>It is a nice mindless thing to do when I have time.  </li>
            <li>i purchased the vidal sassoon styling wand, which works so much better and is easy to use even for a novice like me, and allows me to create victoria secret curls which was the look i was going for</li>
            <li>, I sent it back for a full refund.</li>
            <li>so I would not recommend it for everyday use as it will likely damage your hair if you use it too frequently but for special occasions it is a nice addition to my styling options.</li>
            <li>Apparently, I just could not figure out the right way to use it.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for curls around my face, but I have used it all over</li>
            <li>While pricey, the machine is high quality.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are other professional brands that offer additional features for more money, but I think that this model did the trick for me.  </li>
            <li>I got this a few days ago and from the first day it didn&#x27;t have the beeps before the four quick beeps!</li>
            <li>Curling irons normally don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I have long thick hair and thought this would be great.  </li>
            <li>The first time it took over a half hour to finish my hair, but the second time I was able to cut that time by about 1/3rd</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight, long hair, and the curls only lasted a couple of hours even with hairspray.</li>
            <li>different settings for all kinds of curls.gentle smooth curls that last until you wash.</li>
            <li>The curl is pretty, but there is no way to get your hair back after it is pulled in to the machine.</li>
            <li>I dont even use a lot of hair spray and it stays pretty curled for the entire day!</li>
            <li>and I thought this looked so easy to use and would still allow me to get the look i wanted with little work, wavy curls.</li>
            <li>My solution was to put tons of hairspray in my hair and go for a&amp;#34; new wave/rock /my hair was caught in a fan&amp;#34; look which suited me well as I was a professional singer in Pop/Rock bands.</li>
            <li>The curls seem to last quite a bit longer then they do with a conventional curling iron and left nice waves for day 2.  </li>
            <li>it is worth every single penny that it cost.</li>
            <li>when you use it, it fry&#x27;s your hair, even at the lowest heat setting, my hair felt coarse and very brittle afterwards.</li>
            <li>she was surprised.  </li>
            <li>Maybe she needed more practice, but she was soured on it and no longer wanted to try/practice.</li>
            <li>If you have a Sally&#x27;s near you though, buy it there.  </li>
            <li>If you accidentally add too much hair, it beeps at you and the barrel revolves backwards to give your hair back!  </li>
            <li>wow curls</li>
            <li>This saves my hand from cramping, but doing spiral curls the old fashion way.  </li>
            <li>I think you have to have pretty long hair for it to work.</li>
            <li>My hair is too long to do this everyday, but it looks extra special for a night out or special occasion.  </li>
            <li>particular model only curls the hair in one direction.  </li>
            <li>As long as you hold the tool correctly, and don&#x27;t overload it with too much hair, it works.  </li>
            <li>Since my hair is in long layers, this is much easier to use than a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I saw reviews on the more expensive brand, and it seemed to have a few issues with women getting their hair caught and NOT being able to get it out again.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very long, around 26 inches, and i held the machine close to the root of my hair and it sucked it all up and curled it to the very tip.</li>
            <li>i put it in last week and still wow wow</li>
            <li>It heated up and do not curl my hair and had some major malfunctions.</li>
            <li>while it did curl I had to be really careful not to get too much hair as it would snag, got caught a couple of times on the roller, but we got it out.</li>
            <li>I must have put in too much hair (although I was being careful) and the mechanism clamped onto my hair and wouldn&#x27;t let go.  </li>
            <li>i would write more loves if i wasnt tired...</li>
            <li>After a few tries I learned how much hair was just right to put into the barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>older Granddaughter has thick hair, with some natural curl or body and hers took really well....</li>
            <li>Since my hair is pretty long, I had to use small sections of hair which takes much longer than just using my curling iron.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair barely curled and frizzy.</li>
            <li>It shuts down if you put too much hair in and releases your hair.  </li>
            <li>Best part for me; I have a bad shoulder so curling all of my hair kills it, this little contraption has allowed me to curl it all without bothering my shoulder at all!</li>
            <li>Even if I hold it using the longest setting and minimum hair (less than an inch), the curl wasn&#x27;t tight at all, just a light wave.</li>
            <li>It cuts the time it takes to get ready in half</li>
            <li>It literally would go straight now  and jus have a little flip at the end.</li>

            <li> This was a really great curling iron.</li>
            <li> This product is so great it even beeps so that you release the hair before tangling occurs..</li>
            <li> Oh, it does make a great curl.</li>
            <li> Wife says it&#x27;s great quality</li>
            <li> Anyways, this thing makes great curls.</li>
            <li> My hair is medium length and turns out great.</li>
            <li> This gives me a really great wave but not the spiral curls.  </li>
            <li> I asked my Air Force Officer Husband (LOL) to do my hair</li>
            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> Works great...</li>
            <li> and I LOVE what her hair looks like when she uses it, so I saw win win!</li>
            <li> However, when the time came for me to use it on my own, ouch!  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and works great!</li>
            <li> it works good for longer hair</li>
            <li> It works good</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> I received the Curl Genius as a Christmas gift and gave it two good attempts at curling my hair.</li>
            <li> It also makes my hair look like it is in good condition even when I need a trim.  </li>
            <li> I have had so many compliments on my hair because of the beautiful curls from using this, I&#x27;ve had to tell everyone what I&#x27;m using, where I bought it, and now they are all purchasing one for themselves.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love love love it!!!</li>
            <li> The BeLissPRO is a great product bought it for my girls they love it.....</li>

            <li> I love this and wouldn&#x27;t give it up for the world!</li>
            <li> and we love it!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> I feel like Julia Roberts (her hair was awesome )in pretty Woman.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly out of the box, easy to use, and FUN!  </li>
            <li> it truly is amazing.</li>
            <li> but it is amazing and despite the lack of beeps</li>
            <li> I curl my hair and pull it on top of my head and it looks so good...</li>
            <li> ur hair kind off</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another nice feature:</li>
            <li> Her &amp; her friends really liked it.</li>
            <li> I say save your money or invest in a nice curling iron instead.</li>
            <li> zero science you don&#x27;t have to put the curls in any kind of form</li>
            <li> I am more than pleased!</li>
            <li> My hair is color treated and very fine, but I have a lot of it and</li>
            <li> the product came very fast and I am so happy I got it now with all the partys I have coming up  even with x-mas....</li>
            <li> Be sure not to over load the curler, I did a couple of times and it stops and beeps and releases, allowing me to easily get my hair out!</li>
            <li> I liked how easy the product was to use.</li>
            <li> there are certain ways to hold it and there are some great tips.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did, I feel like I saved $50.  </li>
            <li> Extremely pleased with the curl genius.</li>
            <li> if I could I would post a pic I love how my hair looked</li>
            <li> I love this curl machine.  </li>
            <li> I wish it grabbed more hair.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> But for straight hair, it works great.</li>
            <li> Got this today and I am TOTALLY IN LOVE with it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this machine.</li>
            <li> I love the texture my hair is after I use this.  </li>
            <li> Still, I love the waves.  </li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas last year from my wonderful mother that knows I have no hair styling talent</li>
            <li> Ince you get the trick to this you would love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done my hair many times and everyone likes it.</li>
            <li> I was not about to cut my hair as many others have, so my husband tried to disassemble it, but no go.  </li>
            <li> Here I am 15 minutes later typing this with a head full of curls !!!!!!</li>
            <li> and I was able to make curls without even looking in the mirror</li>
            <li> I was very excited about making curls like the ones I saw on tv.</li>
            <li> The curls it did produce looked great, but had to break off the hair that hot caught, no way to get it free.</li>
            <li> It still produces beautiful locks that look natural without the option of direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So easy and results are pleasing. :)</li>
            <li> Always brush the hair with a brush and then with a fine tooth comb to make sure the tangles are all gone.  </li>
            <li> My 9 year old can do it to herself and it looks great on her too.  </li>
            <li> Make sure hair is combed out and smooth.</li>
            <li> Easy way to curl your hair.</li>
            <li> The hair was easy to release from the chamber without losing any hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is incredibly easy to use and the curls are</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> My hair grabs curl so easily.</li>
            <li> I was thinking it would be nice to have to curl my hair for special occasions, but it is so quick and easy</li>
            <li> Cool stuff:)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may be working fine for you, but believe me, you will get all tangled up eventually.  </li>
            <li> I have been cursed with fine &amp;#34;nothing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it is quick once you get the hang of it!  </li>
            <li> Her hair turns out super cute.</li>
            <li> Except for the fact that it has simplified one tiny part of my life, which makes it SMART to own!!!</li>
            <li> My niece introduced me to the BeLiss Pro Curl, and I thought it was fantastic when she got through curling my hair.  </li>
            <li> This product does make amazing curls, for longer straight hair.</li>
            <li> it worked perfectly with out any trouble.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Affordable and super easy to use on myself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Today I tried it on 2 of my Granddaughters, the youngest has super, baby fine hair</li>
            <li> I was so excited to give it to her for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> I bought this in October and have used it several times on my own hair, love the curls and the fact that even after I sleep on them they are still there.</li>
            <li> Easy, Fun and Professional!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am able to do beautiful and consisent loose curls in a quarter of the time than with a regular wand curling iron, and they look 50 times better cause it gets the tip of the hair</li>
            <li> i just woke up with a head full of curls</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and create a new style for you when you need it.</li>
            <li> but this is so easy to use that I have already styled my hair a few times and gotten so many compliments!!</li>
            <li> This does wonders on my fine, straight hair!  </li>
            <li> It gets very hot</li>
            <li> Well it curls fast and strong.</li>
            <li> its fast and easy.</li>
            <li> Not only would it not let go, but it continued to gather more hair until it was up against my scalp!  </li>
            <li> and it makes all the curls look uniform and really pretty!</li>
            <li> My hair is as straight as hair can get, this not only curls beautifully, but the curls stay and last for many hours.</li>
            <li> its a good machine, it curls the hair beautifully and fast, my only con is that my hair got stuck on it a few times</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, great little machine and for that price, when you get used to it</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re like me, you purchased this curling machine because you suck at doing your own hair, especially when it comes to curling it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice but am happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, I couldn&#x27;t tell if it left my hair frizzy from not distributing heat evenly</li>
            <li> Well worth the money to get this iron.</li>
            <li> Key make sure that your hair is clean.</li>
            <li> and I freaked out and opened it right away and pulled so it made a knot with my hair inside of it.</li>
            <li> right.  </li>
            <li> but wow I love mine  and use it every day  what  very neet to have it realy  </li>
            <li> Since I have naturally wavy hair, my hair holds curl easily.</li>
            <li> so I prefer a 1 1/4\\&quot; curling iron as my preferred method to get nice, loose curls.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that it would take me time to learn how to use it and get it to look good.</li>
            <li> I saw an add on tv and thought I would check here first.  </li>
            <li> would recommend it to anyone who is willing to buy it</li>
            <li> at first..</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> First use it caught my hair up and no release, I ripped my hair out of it.</li>
            <li> First attempt, I set it at lowest heat and on 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> or if it was frying my hair (pretty sure it was the latter).</li>
            <li> The first time she used it, her hair got stuck in it.</li>
            <li> So the first time I used this thing, it was a NIGHTMARE.</li>
            <li> I did decide to give it another go, and I realized that if your hair gets stuck, make sure you DONT open the device.</li>
            <li> The first go at it</li>
            <li> Overall, I love it.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> and I have had multiple friends borrow it just to try it out! :)</li>
            <li> Finally I was free!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In closing, i say this is a good machine if you want messy looking curls</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t feel right leaving the house with straight hair anymore.</li>
            <li> Flat iron works better and curls stay longer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, worth every penny</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone who has fine, straight hair and wants to try a new look!</li>
            <li> Pretty soon my entire office will be full of curly-haired women!</li>
            <li> not much just need to make sure to out it in the right place</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and my curls are fabulous!</li>
            <li> It was so easy, my Husband was amazed at the way the hair is just sucked up by the machine and 4 beeps later ( it beeps to let you know the curl is done)</li>
            <li> my expectations were very high</li>
            <li> me putting too much hair in it.</li>
            <li> ty seller for getting it out so fast..</li>
            <li> If you put to much hair in, it just beeps at you and you have to redo it.  </li>
            <li> Considering it didn&#x27;t use to hold a curl even until I had finished my whole head</li>
            <li> After using a couple times I really got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> and it works really well</li>
            <li> Recvd fast.</li>
            <li> , you just have to be mindful of not trying to put too much hair in the machine at one time.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is dummy proof is for people of that it is so easy-to-use thanks</li>
            <li> It is a nice mindless thing to do when I have time.  </li>
            <li> i purchased the vidal sassoon styling wand, which works so much better and is easy to use even for a novice like me, and allows me to create victoria secret curls which was the look i was going for</li>
            <li> , I sent it back for a full refund.</li>
            <li> so I would not recommend it for everyday use as it will likely damage your hair if you use it too frequently but for special occasions it is a nice addition to my styling options.</li>
            <li> Apparently, I just could not figure out the right way to use it.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly for curls around my face, but I have used it all over</li>
            <li> While pricey, the machine is high quality.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are other professional brands that offer additional features for more money, but I think that this model did the trick for me.  </li>
            <li> I got this a few days ago and from the first day it didn&#x27;t have the beeps before the four quick beeps!</li>
            <li> Curling irons normally don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and thought this would be great.  </li>
            <li> The first time it took over a half hour to finish my hair, but the second time I was able to cut that time by about 1/3rd</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight, long hair, and the curls only lasted a couple of hours even with hairspray.</li>
            <li> different settings for all kinds of curls.gentle smooth curls that last until you wash.</li>
            <li> The curl is pretty, but there is no way to get your hair back after it is pulled in to the machine.</li>
            <li> I dont even use a lot of hair spray and it stays pretty curled for the entire day!</li>
            <li> and I thought this looked so easy to use and would still allow me to get the look i wanted with little work, wavy curls.</li>
            <li> My solution was to put tons of hairspray in my hair and go for a&amp;#34; new wave/rock /my hair was caught in a fan&amp;#34; look which suited me well as I was a professional singer in Pop/Rock bands.</li>
            <li> The curls seem to last quite a bit longer then they do with a conventional curling iron and left nice waves for day 2.  </li>
            <li> it is worth every single penny that it cost.</li>
            <li> when you use it, it fry&#x27;s your hair, even at the lowest heat setting, my hair felt coarse and very brittle afterwards.</li>
            <li> she was surprised.  </li>
            <li> Maybe she needed more practice, but she was soured on it and no longer wanted to try/practice.</li>
            <li> If you have a Sally&#x27;s near you though, buy it there.  </li>
            <li> If you accidentally add too much hair, it beeps at you and the barrel revolves backwards to give your hair back!  </li>
            <li> wow curls</li>
            <li> This saves my hand from cramping, but doing spiral curls the old fashion way.  </li>
            <li> I think you have to have pretty long hair for it to work.</li>
            <li> My hair is too long to do this everyday, but it looks extra special for a night out or special occasion.  </li>
            <li> particular model only curls the hair in one direction.  </li>
            <li> As long as you hold the tool correctly, and don&#x27;t overload it with too much hair, it works.  </li>
            <li> Since my hair is in long layers, this is much easier to use than a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I saw reviews on the more expensive brand, and it seemed to have a few issues with women getting their hair caught and NOT being able to get it out again.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very long, around 26 inches, and i held the machine close to the root of my hair and it sucked it all up and curled it to the very tip.</li>
            <li> i put it in last week and still wow wow</li>
            <li> It heated up and do not curl my hair and had some major malfunctions.</li>
            <li> while it did curl I had to be really careful not to get too much hair as it would snag, got caught a couple of times on the roller, but we got it out.</li>
            <li> I must have put in too much hair (although I was being careful) and the mechanism clamped onto my hair and wouldn&#x27;t let go.  </li>
            <li> i would write more loves if i wasnt tired...</li>
            <li> After a few tries I learned how much hair was just right to put into the barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> older Granddaughter has thick hair, with some natural curl or body and hers took really well....</li>
            <li> Since my hair is pretty long, I had to use small sections of hair which takes much longer than just using my curling iron.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair barely curled and frizzy.</li>
            <li> It shuts down if you put too much hair in and releases your hair.  </li>
            <li> Best part for me; I have a bad shoulder so curling all of my hair kills it, this little contraption has allowed me to curl it all without bothering my shoulder at all!</li>
            <li> Even if I hold it using the longest setting and minimum hair (less than an inch), the curl wasn&#x27;t tight at all, just a light wave.</li>
            <li> It cuts the time it takes to get ready in half</li>
            <li> It literally would go straight now  and jus have a little flip at the end.</li>
            <li> , the machine sucks up your hair and curls it and viola, if done right you are left with wavy spiral curls.</li>
            <li> It heats up quicly and has a long cord.&lt;br /&gt;The curls however are not long lasting.</li>
            <li> kinda flipped it out with my flat iron.</li>
            <li> So apparently I&#x27;m not too scared.</li>
            <li> I have tried using curling irons have tried using flat irons</li>
            <li> They also last a very long time unlike curls I get with a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> ...wanted to make sure I could take this crazy thing back!!!  </li>
            <li> I have a full head of serious curls in about 30 minutes!  </li>
            <li> , my older sister has a mane of thick ( my Mother is a Mexican Indian) blue black (naturally) hair which I&#x27;ve always envied.</li>
            <li> it is long</li>
            <li> I have long, textured hair that has to have some sort of heat to keep it from being frizzy</li>
            <li> It does take a long time to do all of my hair.  </li>
            <li> That, and I am usually not smart enough to use things like that triple barrel thing, this is like &amp;#34;curling hair for dummies&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> But other brands comes with a clip, comb and  bag for the accessories for the same price.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very long,</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas to use during cheerleading, so it wouldn&#x27;t take her very long to do her hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and long, but I can get a head full of curls in less than half an hour.  </li>
            <li> On mine, that is very thin and straight, the curls stay for longer time, but my daughter, that has a straight but thick hair, it&#x27;s more difficult to keep the curls.</li>
            <li> I finally enlisted the help of my husband who had to yank at it with all his might a bit at a time while I struggled to hold my roots down.  </li>
            <li> The other thing was her hair was NOT dry, it was slightly damp</li>
            <li> and I was hesitant because I have very long, straight, thick, heavy hair.</li>
            <li> it grabs such little hair that it takes forever.</li>
            <li> So being careful, I did just a bit at a time.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, thick hair with just a hint of natural curl/body</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t catch your hair (like my flat iron does) unless you try to put too much in or put the curler in your hair the wrong way.  </li>
            <li> I discovered that you could only put in small strands of hair or the curler</li>
            <li> You can make them really tight or just loose &amp; wavy.</li>
            <li> I has high hopes for this but was very dissatisfied and disappointed.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair got jammed in the chamber a few times but that was due to</li>
            <li> My hair is long, past my shoulder blades,(also worked on my bangs)</li>
            <li> It makes doing the back of my hair a breeze and no more curling iron burns!</li>
            <li> so I had to use less hair per curl.  </li>
            <li> I have REALLY LONG hair that is hard to curl.</li>
            <li> It worked but it ATE my hair, winding tightly.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Beliss Pro Curl Genius after researching a little bit about it and watching youtube videos.</li>
            <li> Does not curls, it only curls if you put 2 hairs in it.&lt;br /&gt;very weak heat.</li>
            <li> Also, the machine leaves the roots of your hair looking messy and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I went out a few nights ago</li>
            <li> My daughter had trouble manipulating the appliance to get the hair to curl in the direction she wanted.  </li>
            <li> Wanted to return since it was a waste of money but buyer pays for shipping.</li>
            <li> What a waste of $100.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, and I would be afraid my hair would get stuck in it, due to the natural curl.</li>
            <li> in my opinion this is not better than a curling wand even though a curling wand requires some practice and little moreeffort.</li>
            <li> but if you want salon quality curls, or long wavy Victoria secret curls this won&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li> I used very small sections, less than recommended, and it still caught and trapped my hair about once every 5 curls.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that this is heavy to hold and hard on your wrists, but I did not think so at all.</li>
            <li> I was not  sure about this product  </li>
            <li> I usually have to unplug it and detangle it by hand.</li>
            <li> When I curl just the bottom 4-6 inches, that is done in less than five minutes!!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not easy to work with it!</li>
            <li> and I tried hot rollers once and burned the crap out of my fingers so....</li>
            <li> but it is to heavy for people with weak wrist</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t work for me hard to used damage the hair  </li>
            <li> It needs practice and it&#x27;s hard to have time to be practicing...</li>
            <li> Just filed a complaint with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission after my hair got stuck in the Curl Genius</li>
            <li> you may get tired, rather like a heavy barrel curling iron or a travel dryer in weight.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical this would actually work but bought it because I am terrible at curling my hair with a regular curling iron or flat</li>
            <li> The curls are not as sleek as you would get with a curling wand, and if you are looking to style your hair with curls that sort of curl away from your face,  you&#x27;ll achieve that on one side of your head, but the curls on the other side will curl towards your face, unfortunately you cannot control which way the hair curls with Beliss Pro.</li>
            <li> But it is a little on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> Even with my bad experience, I would definitely recommend trying it!</li>
            <li> Not a good Idea</li>
            <li> hair which I&#x27;ve hated my whole life</li>
            <li> I do agree if you have weak wrists</li>
            <li> May work for thin hair.</li>
            <li> this is the absolute worst product ever!!</li>
            <li> I HAD SERIOUS DOUBTS!  </li>
            <li> I have a terrible time curling my hair the traditional way with rollers and irons</li>
            <li> Needless to say</li>
            <li> Oh, and if the terrible looking \\&quot;curls\\&quot; weren&#x27;t scary enough, it catches your hair and pulls.</li>
            <li> It is scary when it gets caught because your hair won&#x27;t come out of a chamber that&#x27;s burning it at 360 degrees.</li>
            <li> This is a dangerous, expensive and poorly designed product.</li>
            <li> Another expensive paperweight. !</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> Used it once and got my hair caught in the tool so bad I had to cut my hair out.  </li>
            <li> It was smoking really bad &amp; freaked my husband out</li>
            <li> but this item again  :(</li>
            <li> so he cut it off with his knife! :(</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> She was so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Hate when that happens.</li>
            <li> I hate this</li>
            <li> My hair is very difficult to curl and keep a curl even when I use a can of hairspray!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> THIS CURLER IS TERRIBLE!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have had so many compliments on my hair because of the beautiful curls from using this, I&#x27;ve had to tell everyone what I&#x27;m using, where I bought it, and now they are all purchasing one for themselves. Pretty soon my entire office will be full of curly-haired women! I just don&#x27;t feel right leaving the house with straight hair anymore. I love this curler and can&#x27;t imagine living without it now!</li>
            <li> Easy way to curl your hair. If u are one of those girl who cannot curl your hair with the curling iron, or with the hair straightner, this is perfection!</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re like me, you purchased this curling machine because you suck at doing your own hair, especially when it comes to curling it. I bought the Beliss Pro Curl Genius after researching a little bit about it and watching youtube videos. I have a terrible time curling my hair the traditional way with rollers and irons and I thought this looked so easy to use and would still allow me to get the look i wanted with little work, wavy curls. Well, it did just that, the machine sucks up your hair and curls it and viola, if done right you are left with wavy spiral curls. My hair is very long, around 26 inches, and i held the machine close to the root of my hair and it sucked it all up and curled it to the very tip. The issue i have with this machine is that when you use it, it fry&#x27;s your hair, even at the lowest heat setting, my hair felt coarse and very brittle afterwards. Also, the machine leaves the roots of your hair looking messy and frizzy. The curls are not as sleek as you would get with a curling wand, and if you are looking to style your hair with curls that sort of curl away from your face,  you&#x27;ll achieve that on one side of your head, but the curls on the other side will curl towards your face, unfortunately you cannot control which way the hair curls with Beliss Pro. Also, my hair got jammed in the chamber a few times but that was due to me putting too much hair in it. The hair was easy to release from the chamber without losing any hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, i say this is a good machine if you want messy looking curls but if you want salon quality curls, or long wavy Victoria secret curls this won&#x27;t do the trick. i purchased the vidal sassoon styling wand, which works so much better and is easy to use even for a novice like me, and allows me to create victoria secret curls which was the look i was going for so i will be returning this. in my opinion this is not better than a curling wand even though a curling wand requires some practice and little moreeffort.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this curling iron.  I saw an add on tv and thought I would check here first.  The one advertised on tv was $150 and this one was $100, so I crossed my fingers and went with the cheaper one.  I&#x27;m glad I did, I feel like I saved $50.  This works perfectly!!!  It doesn&#x27;t catch your hair (like my flat iron does) unless you try to put too much in or put the curler in your hair the wrong way.  I went out a few nights ago and my friend thought that I had been to the salon, when I told her I did it myself with this machine she was surprised.  My 9 year old can do it to herself and it looks great on her too.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I just had to get this after my hair stylist used it on me. I got it at sallys. Well it curls fast and strong. It heats up in two seconds. Cool stuff:)</li>
            <li> One word: AMAZING!!! I am in love! Beautiful curls! Best part for me; I have a bad shoulder so curling all of my hair kills it, this little contraption has allowed me to curl it all without bothering my shoulder at all! That, and I am usually not smart enough to use things like that triple barrel thing, this is like &amp;#34;curling hair for dummies&amp;#34; LOL. Except for the fact that it has simplified one tiny part of my life, which makes it SMART to own!!!</li>
            <li> The BeLissPRO is a great product bought it for my girls they love it.....would recommend it to anyone who is willing to buy it</li>
            <li> I liked how easy the product was to use. It heats up quicly and has a long cord.&lt;br /&gt;The curls however are not long lasting. I have fine, straight, long hair, and the curls only lasted a couple of hours even with hairspray.</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased with the curl genius. My hair is as straight as hair can get, this not only curls beautifully, but the curls stay and last for many hours. Best results I have ever had with any curling tool. Highly recommend, worth every penny</li>
            <li> This is incredibly easy to use and the curls are fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter and I are having a blast using it!</li>
            <li> I was not  sure about this product  at first.. but wow I love mine  and use it every day  what  very neet to have it realy  does the trick  now I even seen them in mag now.. an lot of hair dresser use this..  so happy with it,,, GREAT for any time.. I curl my hair and pull it on top of my head and it looks so good... the product came very fast and I am so happy I got it now with all the partys I have coming up  even with x-mas....ty seller for getting it out so fast..</li>
            <li> I bought this in October and have used it several times on my own hair, love the curls and the fact that even after I sleep on them they are still there. Today I tried it on 2 of my Granddaughters, the youngest has super, baby fine hair and it&#x27;s very long, while it did curl I had to be really careful not to get too much hair as it would snag, got caught a couple of times on the roller, but we got it out. The other thing was her hair was NOT dry, it was slightly damp and therefore I think that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t curl as well.&lt;br /&gt;The older Granddaughter has thick hair, with some natural curl or body and hers took really well....I want to see what it looks like after she sleeps on it.&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is one of the best products I have used for curling hair and I have tried just about all of them. I have shoulder length, thick hair with just a hint of natural curl/body and I love the way my hair looks when I curl it with this curler!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter had trouble manipulating the appliance to get the hair to curl in the direction she wanted.  Maybe she needed more practice, but she was soured on it and no longer wanted to try/practice.</li>
            <li> it works good for longer hair but it is to heavy for people with weak wrist but it stays in curl when curls it curls out</li>
            <li> This product did not work for my two granddaughters.  A friend had purchased this product and reccommended to me.  I was VERYdisappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> It works good yeah sumtimes it ur hair kind off get stuck but not much just need to make sure to out it in the right place if I could I would post a pic I love how my hair looked</li>
            <li> I love this curl machine.  If you have a Sally&#x27;s near you though, buy it there.  It&#x27;s only 99 dollars, not 140!  You can buy an extended warranty as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular model only curls the hair in one direction.  I thought that the lack of direction choice would bother me before I bought it, but now that I&#x27;ve used it, it doesn&#x27;t.  It still produces beautiful locks that look natural without the option of direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other professional brands that offer additional features for more money, but I think that this model did the trick for me.  Affordable and super easy to use on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice feature: If you accidentally add too much hair, it beeps at you and the barrel revolves backwards to give your hair back!  After a few tries I learned how much hair was just right to put into the barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five Stars!</li>
            <li> I wish it grabbed more hair. it grabs such little hair that it takes forever. I do get  tons of compliments</li>
            <li> Does not curls, it only curls if you put 2 hairs in it.&lt;br /&gt;very weak heat. my expectations were very high but i&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> It really works! I loved it. It&#x27;s very easy to use and create a new style for you when you need it.</li>
            <li> i would write more loves if i wasnt tired... i just woke up with a head full of curls i love it i put it in last week and still wow wow wow curls omg this is my world</li>
            <li> As long as you hold the tool correctly, and don&#x27;t overload it with too much hair, it works.  Used it once and got my hair caught in the tool so bad I had to cut my hair out.  Needless to say, I sent it back for a full refund.</li>
            <li> i sent back don&#x27;t work for me hard to used damage the hair  i don&#x27;t but this item again  :(</li>
            <li> This was a really great curling iron. I got this for my daughter for Christmas to use during cheerleading, so it wouldn&#x27;t take her very long to do her hair. Her &amp; her friends really liked it. But it is a little on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> This saves my hand from cramping, but doing spiral curls the old fashion way.  I love this curl machine!  I did my entire head in 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice but am happy with the results so far.  My hair is color treated and very fine, but I have a lot of it and it is long so I had to use less hair per curl.  The first time it took over a half hour to finish my hair, but the second time I was able to cut that time by about 1/3rd so it does get faster with practice.  It is lightweight so wasn&#x27;t a problem to hold up for me.  The curls seem to last quite a bit longer then they do with a conventional curling iron and left nice waves for day 2.  It gets very hot so I would not recommend it for everyday use as it will likely damage your hair if you use it too frequently but for special occasions it is a nice addition to my styling options.</li>
            <li> I love this!  It is so easy to use.  I can&#x27;t see how you would get your hair stuck in it, unless you had a lot of product on your hair.  If you put to much hair in, it just beeps at you and you have to redo it.  It is so simple to use.  It makes doing the back of my hair a breeze and no more curling iron burns!</li>
            <li> This curl has no release button, the hair got stuck three times and had to cut my hair out. It fried it.  The curl is pretty, but there is no way to get your hair back after it is pulled in to the machine. Try another brand...</li>
            <li> I must admit...I HAD SERIOUS DOUBTS!  I quizzed the salesgirl about return policy and all...wanted to make sure I could take this crazy thing back!!!  But I&#x27;m keeping it...it makes beautiful curls and is a snap to use.  ADVICE...don&#x27;t just jump in without reading the instructions...there are certain ways to hold it and there are some great tips.  My hair is thick and long, but I can get a head full of curls in less than half an hour.  When I curl just the bottom 4-6 inches, that is done in less than five minutes!!  LOVE THIS THING!!</li>
            <li> First use it caught my hair up and no release, I ripped my hair out of it. Returning it. I am very disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t look anywhere else. This product is so great it even beeps so that you release the hair before tangling occurs..different settings for all kinds of curls.gentle smooth curls that last until you wash. My hair is very long and my curls are fabulous!</li>
            <li> I have long, textured hair that has to have some sort of heat to keep it from being frizzy so I prefer a 1 1/4\\&quot; curling iron as my preferred method to get nice, loose curls. Since I have naturally wavy hair, my hair holds curl easily. I received the Curl Genius as a Christmas gift and gave it two good attempts at curling my hair. First attempt, I set it at lowest heat and on 10 seconds. It left my hair barely curled and frizzy. I ended up having to put my hair in a braid to hide it. Next attempt, kicked up heat to highest level and on 12 seconds, hair ended up looking like a lion&#x27;s mane...big, frizzy and disproportionate curls. To be honest, I couldn&#x27;t tell if it left my hair frizzy from not distributing heat evenly or if it was frying my hair (pretty sure it was the latter). Since my hair is pretty long, I had to use small sections of hair which takes much longer than just using my curling iron.  Oh, and if the terrible looking \\&quot;curls\\&quot; weren&#x27;t scary enough, it catches your hair and pulls. My hair got so stuck at one point I thought I was going to have to cut it out. I say save your money or invest in a nice curling iron instead.</li>
            <li> My niece introduced me to the BeLiss Pro Curl, and I thought it was fantastic when she got through curling my hair.  However, when the time came for me to use it on my own, ouch!  I discovered that you could only put in small strands of hair or the curler will jam.  After it happening a couple of times, I realized this.  So being careful, I did just a bit at a time.  Then came doing the back of my head.  I must have put in too much hair (although I was being careful) and the mechanism clamped onto my hair and wouldn&#x27;t let go.  Not only would it not let go, but it continued to gather more hair until it was up against my scalp!  I unplugged it, pulled, and screamed in pain because I could not hold onto my roots to keep from feeling the agony of me yanking it.  I finally enlisted the help of my husband who had to yank at it with all his might a bit at a time while I struggled to hold my roots down.  It was quite the harrowing experience and have stayed away from it as a result.&lt;br /&gt;There should be some mechanism installed to prevent this from happening in the future.  Oh, it does make a great curl.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter. The first time she used it, her hair got stuck in it. Make sure hair is combed out and smooth. This product does make amazing curls, for longer straight hair. I have curly hair, and I would be afraid my hair would get stuck in it, due to the natural curl. But for straight hair, it works great.</li>
            <li> Wife says it&#x27;s great quality and I LOVE what her hair looks like when she uses it, so I saw win win!</li>
            <li> My hair is medium in thickness. Even if I hold it using the longest setting and minimum hair (less than an inch), the curl wasn&#x27;t tight at all, just a light wave. Plus the curl didn&#x27;t hold. I has high hopes for this but was very dissatisfied and disappointed. Wanted to return since it was a waste of money but buyer pays for shipping. I only used twice and did 5 curls each time and I can already tell it doesn&#x27;t work. Flat iron works better and curls stay longer. Another expensive paperweight. ! Hate when that happens. May work for thin hair.</li>
            <li> So the first time I used this thing, it was a NIGHTMARE. My hair got stuck in the chamber and I freaked out and opened it right away and pulled so it made a knot with my hair inside of it. It was smoking really bad &amp; freaked my husband out so he cut it off with his knife! :( I did decide to give it another go, and I realized that if your hair gets stuck, make sure you DONT open the device. You need to keep it shut to let it pause and reverse your hair back out. That was a mistake I won&#x27;t make again. Anyways, this thing makes great curls. You can make them really tight or just loose &amp; wavy. I love it! Even with my bad experience, I would definitely recommend trying it!</li>
            <li> Got this today and I am TOTALLY IN LOVE with it. I have REALLY LONG hair that is hard to curl. I was a little worried that it would take me time to learn how to use it and get it to look good. I was wrong! The first go at it it worked perfectly with out any trouble. there is nothing to learn it does it by itself! from the moment I saw it demonstrated I knew I had to have it. it is worth every single penny that it cost. its fast and easy. BUY IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE! I used this to curl my hair on Saturday night, It now Monday and there is still curl in my hair. Considering it didn&#x27;t use to hold a curl even until I had finished my whole head I am more than pleased! it also only took be about 35min, to curl my entire head of hair, which used to take me 1.5+ hours. it truly is amazing. The lady that showed this to me at Sally&#x27;s has changed my life! BUY IT!</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Sally&#x27;s and I was hesitant because I have very long, straight, thick, heavy hair. Curling irons normally don&#x27;t work for me. This takes the hair and twists it around inside, then heats it for 8-12 seconds. It beeps, and you&#x27;ve got a beautiful curl! The only downside is sometimes the hair will get stuck, but it attempts to release the hair. Overall, I love it.</li>
            <li> This does wonders on my fine, straight hair!  I have a full head of serious curls in about 30 minutes!  My hair is long, past my shoulder blades,(also worked on my bangs) and this just does a beautiful job of giving me luscious spiral curls!  Be sure not to over load the curler, I did a couple of times and it stops and beeps and releases, allowing me to easily get my hair out! I saw reviews on the more expensive brand, and it seemed to have a few issues with women getting their hair caught and NOT being able to get it out again.  THIS curler DOES release if you over do or put tangled hair in it. Worked perfectly out of the box, easy to use, and FUN!  I do agree if you have weak wrists you may get tired, rather like a heavy barrel curling iron or a travel dryer in weight.  I highly recommend to anyone who has fine, straight hair and wants to try a new look!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical this would actually work but bought it because I am terrible at curling my hair with a regular curling iron or flat iron- and it takes me forever to get so-so results.  The BeLiss Pro works AWESOME!  Perfect not-too-tight curls, and it is quick once you get the hang of it!  I was thinking it would be nice to have to curl my hair for special occasions, but it is so quick and easy I want to curl my hair every day!  I read some reviews that this is heavy to hold and hard on your wrists, but I did not think so at all.</li>
            <li> Very good, but the curls depend on the hair. On mine, that is very thin and straight, the curls stay for longer time, but my daughter, that has a straight but thick hair, it&#x27;s more difficult to keep the curls.</li>
            <li> Ihad to cut my hair in order to get it out. It was not a big strand of my hair, it was the recommended size. Not a good Idea but it does give wonderful curls!</li>
            <li> I choose those item because my sister had one, my hair has never held a curl and with this it does!!</li>
            <li> After using a couple times I really got the hang of it. Makes beautiful curls and I get a lot of compliments. My hair is medium length and turns out great. My daughter also bought one and she has longer hair and some extensions. Her hair turns out super cute.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it.  It works exactly as advertised.  I use it mainly for curls around my face, but I have used it all over and it works really well</li>
            <li> THIS CURLER IS TERRIBLE! got stuck in my hair I called the company and they told me to cut it out!! this is the absolute worst product ever!! I hate this</li>
            <li> I love this machine. It cuts the time it takes to get ready in half and it makes all the curls look uniform and really pretty! I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it does tangle from time to time. It is scary when it gets caught because your hair won&#x27;t come out of a chamber that&#x27;s burning it at 360 degrees. I usually have to unplug it and detangle it by hand. Needs a release button for when that happens, otherwise I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got this a few days ago and from the first day it didn&#x27;t have the beeps before the four quick beeps! I just don&#x27;t understand! A friend has this and hers beeps! Like, what?! Lolz but it is amazing and despite the lack of beeps I love this and wouldn&#x27;t give it up for the world! Just someone explain the beep thing please...?</li>
            <li> I purchased this for me and my 3 girls and we love it! So easy and results are pleasing. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this from Sally&#x27;s and I absolutely love it!  It shuts down if you put too much hair in and releases your hair.  I have no idea how people have gotten their hair stuck and have to have it cut out.  Always brush the hair with a brush and then with a fine tooth comb to make sure the tangles are all gone.  I would recommend this product to anyone!  My daughter can&#x27;t wait to use it tonight after seeing my hair done.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not easy to work with it! It needs practice and it&#x27;s hard to have time to be practicing...</li>
            <li> I was very excited about making curls like the ones I saw on tv. Apparently, I just could not figure out the right way to use it. So, I will be returning this when I figure out the process. I think you have to have pretty long hair for it to work. My hair is just about shoulder length.</li>
            <li> Does a beautiful job! Easy to use. Recvd fast. Hair turns out shines and curly. Absolutely love love love it!!!</li>
            <li> I love the texture my hair is after I use this.  I&#x27;ve never gotten it tangled in the machine - just read the directions and follow them.  It does take a long time to do all of my hair.  I&#x27;ve got a lot of hair, so I use bigger sections.  This gives me a really great wave but not the spiral curls.  To get spiral curls, I&#x27;d have to use smaller sections, and that would take forever.  Still, I love the waves.  They also last a very long time unlike curls I get with a curling iron.  It also makes my hair look like it is in good condition even when I need a trim.  Since my hair is in long layers, this is much easier to use than a curling iron.  I can never get all of the layers in the curling iron, but this machines gets them all quiet nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it takes awhile to do all of my hair, it is sort of theraputic.  It is a nice mindless thing to do when I have time.  My hair is too long to do this everyday, but it looks extra special for a night out or special occasion.  While pricey, the machine is high quality.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> its a good machine, it curls the hair beautifully and fast, my only con is that my hair got stuck on it a few times</li>
            <li> Just filed a complaint with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission after my hair got stuck in the Curl Genius and I had to cut off about 8 inches of my hair to get the thing out!!  This thing needs to be recalled!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this curling machine! My hair is very difficult to curl and keep a curl even when I use a can of hairspray! I got this for Christmas last year from my wonderful mother that knows I have no hair styling talent and this does a wonderful job! It is easy to use and works great! I dont even use a lot of hair spray and it stays pretty curled for the entire day! I would recommend it to anyone and I have had multiple friends borrow it just to try it out! :)</li>
            <li> Ince you get the trick to this you would love it. I&#x27;ve done my hair many times and everyone likes it. But other brands comes with a clip, comb and  bag for the accessories for the same price.</li>
            <li> My hair grabs curl so easily. With this thing it looked like I jus kinda flipped it out with my flat iron. It literally would go straight now  and jus have a little flip at the end. I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> bought this for my granddaughter.  I was so excited to give it to her for Christmas.  Well it didn&#x27;t work on her hair at all and she discarded all the info so I couldn&#x27;t return it.  She was so disappointed.  What a waste of $100.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and thought this would be great.  It worked but it ATE my hair, winding tightly.  It has no \\&quot;release\\&quot; button.  It burned and hurt.  I was not about to cut my hair as many others have, so my husband tried to disassemble it, but no go.  We finally went into his workshop and he hit it with a hammer and used all sorts of tools to get it out.  Finally I was free!  I would post a photo if I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be working fine for you, but believe me, you will get all tangled up eventually.  This is a dangerous, expensive and poorly designed product.</li>
            <li> This iron is the best!  I am able to do beautiful and consisent loose curls in a quarter of the time than with a regular wand curling iron, and they look 50 times better cause it gets the tip of the hair curled perfectly.  Well worth the money to get this iron.</li>
            <li> I have been cursed with fine &amp;#34;nothing&amp;#34; hair which I&#x27;ve hated my whole life, my older sister has a mane of thick ( my Mother is a Mexican Indian) blue black (naturally) hair which I&#x27;ve always envied. My solution was to put tons of hairspray in my hair and go for a&amp;#34; new wave/rock /my hair was caught in a fan&amp;#34; look which suited me well as I was a professional singer in Pop/Rock bands. Well the &#x27;80&#x27;s are over and I haven&#x27;t know what to do with my hairs since. I&#x27;ve never been one to stand there for an hour and curl my hair one curl at a time (!!!) with a curling iron  and I tried hot rollers once and burned the crap out of my fingers so.... I saw this demoed on Youtube and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m so unsure of my skills I asked my Air Force Officer Husband (LOL) to do my hair, I figured if a macho guy with big &amp;#34;man hands&amp;#34; and NO beauty skills  could do it then I could as well. Here I am 15 minutes later typing this with a head full of curls !!!!!! It was so easy, my Husband was amazed at the way the hair is just sucked up by the machine and 4 beeps later ( it beeps to let you know the curl is done) voila&#x27; CURLS! I feel like Julia Roberts (her hair was awesome )in pretty Woman. I am just amazed AND I did it myself and I was able to make curls without even looking in the mirror, you just have to be mindful of not trying to put too much hair in the machine at one time. I feel beautiful!</li>
            <li> I Like it... Scared me when it wont let go of my hair.  I still use it probably 3 times a week.  So apparently I&#x27;m not too scared. LOL</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, great little machine and for that price, when you get used to it (she got used to it in a couple uses) you will be AMAZED of the result! Easy, Fun and Professional!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Works great...so glad that I got it, I love it!! Never one to do my hair but this is so easy to use that I have already styled my hair a few times and gotten so many compliments!!</li>
            <li> I have tried using curling irons have tried using flat irons I just don&#x27;t have the knack to use these tools I can never get the curls right.  This curling iron is dummy proof is for people of that it is so easy-to-use thanks zero science you don&#x27;t have to put the curls in any kind of form, just get done it&#x27;s fabulous.  Key make sure that your hair is clean.</li>
            <li> I used very small sections, less than recommended, and it still caught and trapped my hair about once every 5 curls. The curls it did produce looked great, but had to break off the hair that hot caught, no way to get it free. Will return.</li>
            <li> The product was defective. It heated up and do not curl my hair and had some major malfunctions. I had no choice but to return it</li>
