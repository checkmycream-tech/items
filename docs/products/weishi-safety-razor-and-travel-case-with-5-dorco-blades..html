            <li>It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>The example I received in gleaming chrome finish seemed close to flawless and the TTO mechanism worked well.  </li>

            <li>It works okay, not the best construction.  </li>
            <li>Nice razor shave kit!</li>
            <li>However, I can say that it gave me the best shave I have had in many a year.  </li>
            <li>Weishi 9306-F and a Astra SP, what a nice shave!</li>

            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Not a Gillette quality, but seems to be a good working product.</li>
            <li>Good Tool.</li>
            <li>Good bye $10, $20, $30+ packs of razors.</li>
            <li>Good quality, travel case and sample &amp;#34;Dorco&amp;#34; brand(Korean) blades.  </li>
            <li>great price; nice travel case; doors and mechanism worked fine; chrome plating is very good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this razor for about a year and am very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>very cheaply made!</li>
            <li>I love this shaver!</li>
            <li>It is comfortable in the hand and provides a great shave.  </li>
            <li>the shave is amazing</li>
            <li>NICK FREE, GREAT CONTROL</li>
            <li>and I liked the size.</li>
            <li>It is kind of like training wheels on a bike</li>
            <li>I have a light-medium beard and get a nice close shave with this (Weishi) safety razor -</li>
            <li>A styptic pencil comes in handy for that.</li>
            <li>It really is a fairly nice razor.  </li>
            <li>This one was delivered in a reasonable time and I&#x27;m very impressed.  </li>
            <li>Nice Razor.</li>
            <li>I bought this one for myself and the Microtouch for my father and honestly you can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
            <li>It comes with a handy travel kit.</li>
            <li>Honestly the best one I have boughten so far, you may think twice because of the price</li>
            <li>Very easy to change blades</li>
            <li>Good fit and finish;</li>
            <li>So far I am very happy with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth functioning, and has good weight.  </li>
            <li>more cost effective than those plastic razors.</li>
            <li>was at first impressed with how quickly it arrived.</li>
            <li>The knurled grip is very secure.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: this would make a good vacation or travel razor for a quick shave or touch up.  </li>
            <li>You do get a real nice clean shave with this razor and much more economical to use.</li>
            <li>That said, I was delighted from the very first stroke.  </li>
            <li>This Weishi might be okay for people with very light beards.  </li>
            <li>I can see this razor giving me a better shave than anything else</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t built like a tank (more like a Yugo).</li>
            <li>This razor doesn&#x27;t really give me that great a shave, but I like the case.</li>
            <li>I love the look and the package of this kit</li>
            <li>I do love that it comes in a travel case.  </li>
            <li>Shaving gels also work OK with a brush.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s where a dab of canned foam and a bit of fingertip touch is most efficient.</li>
            <li>The travel case is extremely handy for those of us on the go and holds everything, including your blades, securely.</li>
            <li>This is creating more nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>but time to move on to a more quality model.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better and faster</li>
            <li>the more I use it.</li>
            <li>If they made a chrome plated one it would be much better.</li>
            <li>I believe that most folks have is the angle of the razor.  </li>
            <li>there is nothing better than a Gillette fusion.</li>
            <li>Muker is a better razor, but it&#x27;s also 3 times the price.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>IT.CAN USE THE BLADE FOR MORE THAN ONE SHAVE.</li>
            <li>Better than the one advertized on TV by the Pawn Shop Guy.</li>
            <li>Just wish it were a bit more aggressive.</li>
            <li>I already have a Lord L6 and like many others enjoy DE shaving because it is cost effective and more interesting than disposables or electrics.  </li>
            <li>Would like it better if the handle were longer.  </li>
            <li>Much better then the disposable.</li>
            <li>the package, I was pleased to feel the weight of the product.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s identical to Microtouch One Razor just a better price.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I am beginner at the DE razor, and I am confident I will stick to them.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this razor after reading some of the other reviews, some great, some not so great.  </li>
            <li>Quality was pretty good.</li>
            <li>Used with a decent soap and brush it gives a very nice shave.</li>
            <li>stars because it is as advertised and reviewed, gives a great shave, and will last if you are kind to it.</li>
            <li>It came in a nice plastic case and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Bought the Weishi to transition to a more comfortable way of shaving.</li>
            <li>Pros: Much better than the two blade non pivoting Wilkinson Sword disposables that I bought for $2.37 + tax for a dozen at Walmart, blades for the DE are as cheap as $0.10 each.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 5 or 6 brands and these dorco are great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously your mileage may vary but for a razor in the sub $15.00 price range I found the Weishi very acceptable and good value.  </li>
            <li>It works great with gillette Super Speeds, since it is really just a copy of one.</li>
            <li>And still more to be expected, very good quality.</li>
            <li>: Very, very, very mild shave if you find the correct shave angle.  </li>
            <li>With these old time safety razors as with my straight razor you have to figure out the best shaving angle for yourself.  </li>
            <li>Easy put away</li>
            <li>My morning shave is a comfortable, smooth, enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read often that this is a good razor for those of us just getting started with a DE for the first time, and I find it to be perfectly true.</li>
            <li>Great to go back to to this old standby for a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a cheap product, and I&#x27;ve never been able to get a really clean shave.</li>
            <li>With care, it will be fine.</li>
            <li>However, the razor and included blades are just fine.  </li>
            <li>for the construction of the Weishi – it’s just fine.  </li>
            <li>and 205lbs, the Weishi will work for me just fine.</li>
            <li>I bought a 5[pack of Dorco blades, which seem to work fine.  </li>
            <li>Works just fine and blades are 10/$1 if you look around.</li>
            <li>I read reviews about the razor after I made the purchase, and I think that they are accurate:  </li>
            <li>Truly fantastic.</li>
            <li>As the others experienced, the opening mechanism froze and finally broke today.</li>
            <li>This item has some cheap looking packaging both box and case.  </li>
            <li>Handle is short, but this makes it a great compact razor.    </li>
            <li>Blades for this thing are so cheap</li>
            <li>And I was smooth.  </li>
            <li>Razor is effective, especially for someone just getting  into traditional or &amp;#34;wet shaving.&amp;#34;  Price is excellent, however, you can tell by the mechanical workings that it isn&#x27;t a precision instrument.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy mine.</li>
            <li>To put that in perspective, I have been using [cheap] disposable razors all those years, so I am comparing the Weishi 9306-F results to the disposables results.  </li>
            <li>It is a cheap razor and i comes with a travel case, blades and brush for cleaning it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not getting that baby smooth shave that was promised with these razors.</li>
            <li>The butterfly opening makes it easy to change blades and clean.</li>
            <li>Avoid cheap safety razors and get a trusted brand</li>
            <li>A cheap, but well made razor.</li>
            <li>I got a smooth shave on both my face and my head, no nicks.  </li>
            <li>case makes my bath room counter stay clutter free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap piece of junk</li>
            <li>great razor gives a really close shave replacement blades are very affordable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild, so for the price not a bad beginners razor.</li>
            <li>It is ideal for the first time double edged safety razor shaver.</li>
            <li>This is my first DE(double edge) razor, and in about a month, I love it.  </li>
            <li>I shave my head, but I figure as this works really well on my skull, it should be fine on your face:)  </li>
            <li>it comes with a mirrored case and razor brush to clean the razor.</li>
            <li>My husband was very happy with this razor he had been complaining about how the other razors don&#x27;t get his beard really close</li>
            <li>( perfect marrage) dullblade and dull razor.  </li>
            <li>After about two months of using it 5-6 days a week, the knob would not turn any more and the whole assembly broke apart in my hands.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as the gilette but thats good if you are just starting out.</li>
            <li>All in all I really liked shaving old school.</li>
            <li>However, it is not as good quality as the razor I had back in 1971.  </li>
            <li>But I will say this:  if you have never used a double edge razor before and want to try one, this is a good one to start with.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll spend $30 on a good Merkur or Edwin Jagger.</li>
            <li>I have about an average beard, and with a lot of time and care I can get roughly as good a shave with this as I could with my Gillette Atra, and with a bit more razor burn (no nicks, though).  </li>
            <li>Not a bad razor for the price.</li>
            <li>Not a bad entry level safety razor.</li>
            <li>Not a bad choice.  </li>
            <li>It was smoother and more comfortable than a new disposable razor, with no nicks or razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>However, for the price I think I still saved money over my old Mach 3 blades, and it does provide a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>as described good quality you expect more decription than i have to say this is what i like least about buying from you to many words required i said it all in the first words</li>
            <li>I found the razor to feel light, it feels lighter than the Lord L6 which has a hefty head, but certainly can be used without applying any significant pressure.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much!</li>
            <li>The blades that come with it are pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>Love my new retro razor.</li>
            <li>Much better than expected and perhaps even better than the Lord L6 which I find quite mild.  </li>
            <li>Great little kit and havent had any issues with it.</li>
            <li>On the other hand the razor is compact and comes with a nice easy to pack and compact case.  </li>
            <li>It is a great razor for beginners or someone that shaves everyday</li>
            <li>After you replace the cheap blades, the razor works really well.</li>
            <li>With alittle practice, nicks and razor burn will be an extremely rare occurrence.</li>
            <li>(I can still see him with a pan of water, fresh off the Coleman stove and a sliver of soap,  crouched by the truck&#x27;s rear view mirror scraping away.)  </li>
            <li>Good way to start wet shaving and save lots of money instead of buying those Mack 3, 4, 5, 10, 20 replacement blades and avoid razor burn.</li>
            <li>One feature that would make this better is if a standard packet of razors would fit inside the case.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34; closure is effective, but not entirely symmetrical.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, this razor arrived about a month earlier than anticipated which was nice.  </li>
            <li>A longer handle might be nice but is not critical.</li>
            <li>The replacement blades are economical as well.  </li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied as it is easy to use and nearly no learning curve.  </li>
            <li>This product shipped pretty quick.</li>
            <li>It is a shame because the product does look identical but they just do not have the angle right</li>
            <li>If you do not find the right shave angle, it will not cut the whiskers.  </li>
            <li>As always, I reserve the right to revise this review.</li>
            <li>Now I can leave those cheap plastic quick to dull disposable razors for good .</li>
            <li>I am online to buy a new double-edged safety razor, as I really do like the shave it gives as well as any of the multiple-blade razors, but I will be looking for something much better made.</li>
            <li>Anyone can buy a decent bottle of wine for $30.00, getting a decent bottle of wine for $12.00 is a bit more</li>
            <li>you just want to try safety razor shaving without spending much, this is not a bad buy.</li>
            <li>If the razor were a little more aggressive, I would give this one more star.  </li>
            <li>makes great gifts to get back back to &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The duration of a good wet shave does not have to take a whole lot longer than shaving with multi-blade razors, and saves a ton of money.</li>
            <li>This razor has not only worked great but came is within a week and the eta was a month later</li>
            <li>they are very economic.  </li>
            <li>and in addition to this great little razor you get a high quality plastic case.</li>
            <li>I learned to shave with a DE safety razor, and picked this one first when I decided to return to one many years later.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I was fairly satisfied.</li>
            <li>I just had my first shave with this razor.  </li>
            <li>It is most definitely NOT aggressive (the problem I had 20 years</li>
            <li>Just received and tried for the first time.  </li>
            <li>The blades are of a higher quality than I see out of cartridge-type razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure more expensive razors are a bit more refined.  </li>
            <li>Used blades go into a dollar store piggy bank for safe disposal later.</li>
            <li>I bought a weishi as my first Saftey Razor a couple months ago.</li>
            <li>Just had my first shave with the DE razor.</li>
            <li>There were a lot of convincing sounding endorsements, but maybe all of these fellow had leather skin like my Father, who used double edged blades and would shave even on a hunting trip; with one.  </li>
            <li>The next time was better.  </li>
            <li>This is a well made inexpensive saftey razor, it was my first.</li>
            <li>And the product is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>This was my first foray into the safety razor world.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always subscribed to the &#x27;first blade lifts the whisker&#x27; theory as presented by Gilette.  </li>
            <li>But now I have something more permanent that will last a life time .</li>
            <li>it would do in a real pinch, but otherwise would just chuck it in the F-it bucket!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very forgiving to the beginner when you don&#x27;t have quite the right angle.  </li>
            <li>it is great for a beginer to wet shaving having never used a double edge before I found it very forgiving.</li>
            <li>I bled twice and think that is reasonable for my first time having never used a safety razor before.  </li>
            <li>Since then I have used it pretty much every day.</li>
            <li>the angle is pretty much figured out for you.  </li>
            <li>Shaves as good if not better that any three or five blades razors</li>
            <li>I have several of these Weishi Shavers, and enjoy using them very much.</li>
            <li>I cannot easily cut muself, but the blade angle on this isn&#x27;t steep enough for me.</li>
            <li>you will very quickly find out that these are simply extended life disposables.  </li>
            <li>I have used all types of shavers over my life, most of then were single use shavers .</li>
            <li>I am certain this is a matter of hair type.&lt;br /&gt;DAB</li>
            <li>In short - Using a safety razor is a new technique for me (need to use more H2O) and</li>
            <li>I paired the Weishi with Shark Super Stainless blades and Proraso sensitive shave soap.</li>
            <li>Being “older” I remember my first shave with my Dad’s adjustable Gillette “safety” razor.  </li>
            <li>Good for a beginner shaver because it is hard to cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I then tried a different brand of double-edged safety razor, made in Germany, and it gives a wonderfully smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Treat them gently.</li>
            <li>Be gentle with the twist mechanism.</li>
            <li>I have straight brown hair 1.2 mils in diameter.</li>
            <li>A REAL Weishi 9306 series weighs in at about 1.9 ounces (without the case) and is quite sturdy.</li>
            <li>Makes it very practical when traveling.</li>
            <li>and he says gives very close shave.  </li>
            <li>it was a very comfortabe shave .</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>$12.30, I consider it to be a real bargain.  </li>
            <li>I have a couple of blade sampler packs and enjoy trying out different blades.  </li>
            <li>I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li>it is cheaply made and the handle is to short.</li>
            <li>Well, what got me thinking was the fact that closest shave I&#x27;d ever had was in a barber chair with a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>They say stainless</li>
            <li>Delivered fast.</li>
            <li>Better quality than expected for the price.</li>
            <li>And still get a real close and durable shave.  </li>
            <li>Plus you&#x27;ll start saving $125/year on inferior Gillette/Schick replacement blades by buying more environmentally conscious, Turkish Derby double edge blades ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>note of importance, I am confident that most of the poor reviews are from those who have improperly handled the shaver.  </li>
            <li>I expected a very very mild (non aggressive) shave from this razor based on the other reviews but discovered that if you find the razors sweet spot, which I found easy to do, it shaved very well.  </li>
            <li>used this razor with a sharp blade (blue Personna lab prep), and I found the correct shaving angle, so I was able to get a comfortable shave from this razor.  </li>
            <li>If you are interested in going old school and saving some money on the daily task of shaving, this little kit is a great way to get started.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the Mach 3, Fusion, and all the other department store junk.</li>
            <li>If you chose, you can move on to other more fancy razors.  </li>
            <li>Just take it slow and easy, and you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li>I was being careful while using this to for the record with the Art of Shaving kit also which is way better than normal shaving cream.</li>
            <li>The razor itself is very sturdy - nice and heavy!</li>
            <li>There iis also a certain level of pride I get from learning a new skill.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I can now just buy the much cheaper double-edge blades rather and shave soap than the much more expensive cartridges and aerosol foam.  </li>
            <li>Product is fine if you can deal with a single blade.  </li>
            <li>Best investment I&#x27;ve made in a long time, Never liked the multiple blade concept, they may shave close but they will not trim around the upper lip to shape or maintain a  mustache, just to mention I have gotten 7 clean shaves with this razor/Blade combo.</li>
            <li>With the new modern disposable systems</li>
            <li>I highly recomend to anybody looking to buy a saftey razor to pass on this one, pay a little extra money and get a good quality one.</li>
            <li>I almost started using it as my main razor.  </li>
            <li>However, there was visible stubble on my face within six hours after shaving, so this razor is too mild for me to use on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fairly decent quality for the price.  </li>
            <li>The main thing is that you keep your face lubricated with the soap.  </li>
            <li>all know we can go out there and buy a decent DE razor in the $30.00 and up category.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So is the Weishi a decent DE razor for about $12.00?  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but somehow they still rust like high carbon steel.</li>
            <li>It worked OK for several months although I did cut myself several times when I used a new blade.</li>
            <li>The butterfly mechanism stuck a few times, but it was OK.</li>
            <li>After using this razor once, I am completely hooked on double edge wet shaving, and I have already bought some more, higher quality equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice butterfly open mechanism where as other brands I&#x27;ve seen come completely apart to change blades.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice little double edged razor for the price.</li>
            <li>I still have this new razor in my travel kit.</li>
            <li>Why did have to change to the new Razors?&lt;br /&gt;The Retro Razor works</li>
            <li>B001NT9SFU Derby Extra Super Stainless Double Edge Razor Blades - 30 Ct]])</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re thinking about trying double edge wet shaving, I couldn&#x27;t recommend this product any more.</li>
            <li>but the butterfly mechanism is not working properly and in fact is not holding the blade at the exact position.  </li>
            <li>and I received it nearly 3 weeks before the scheduled delivery date!</li>
            <li>I have fewer nicks from it that my other DE and I feel that it actually gives me a better shave.  </li>
            <li>I should point out that this is my first DE (double edge) razor, so I can&#x27;t compare it to a Merkur or vintage Gillete, because I haven&#x27;t used them.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was how short the handle is, but looks like what my dad used 50 yrs ago :) Solid built!!</li>
            <li>Hate to pay huge premium for a high end unit but given the short life of this one....not a great value either.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all a good deal, no plastic waste!!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this razor for a month and had no trouble staying out of the Emergency Room.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the quality.</li>
            <li>If you treat this razor gently, I think it should last decades.</li>
            <li>It does no where near the job as Gillette.</li>
            <li>and it wouldn&#x27;t take much to make it work just the same.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t handle this, my face is fairly sensitive though.</li>
            <li>Having shaved with a triple blade disposable for the last 5 years of my life, there is no comparisson, no matter how much oil, lather, etc.</li>
            <li>Yesterday I tried out my old safety razor</li>
            <li>Using an old-style shaving brush and quality shaving soap from a big stainless camping mug I&#x27;ve got, I whip up some foam.</li>
            <li>but I feel it helps those of us with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am the type of person who wants to buy things that are well made and built to last.</li>
            <li>Shave was actually very close with just a bit of stubble left on the neck.</li>
            <li>Cons: Not as close as my Gillette Fusion Power 5 blade razor but nearly as close, however cartridge refills are $16 for four cartridges.</li>
            <li>Those who have had negative experiences try a better blade.</li>
            <li>Razor came as advertized and heavy duty metal....not cheap.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to go with a cheap option, just in case I disliked the experience.</li>
            <li>It is early days yet</li>
            <li>will last a while if treated reasonably gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>I got this to save on the % blade cost product and so far I am achieving that goal.</li>
            <li>This razor is nothing but a bubble gum machine razor compared to my old Gillette.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this razor worked well for me.</li>
            <li>I went with an inexpensive razor just to try things out in order to see if the extra blades were worth the extra money.    </li>
            <li>The mirror is a bit small, and it could use a razor safe, but the razor is heavy and doesn&#x27;t rust quickly.</li>
            <li>After several months it wouldn&#x27;t open and close properly when I needed to clean or replace the blade.</li>
            <li>The only reason I bought a new one is because my original fell one day and the clamp was slightly misaligned.</li>
            <li>In particular, the mechanics to open and close the blade chamber froze and often I had to use pliers to turn the mechanism.</li>
            <li>I have medium or average facial hair in density and coarseness, if that is a relevant factor.  </li>
            <li>handle is on the small size, but overall I love it.</li>
            <li>I loaded a Lord Stainless blade in the Weishi because the other reviewers pretty much universally condemned the Dorco blades that come with it.  </li>
            <li>I am going to get one that is a little more expensive and hopefully better made.</li>
            <li>it almost ruined my first wet shave experience.</li>
            <li>it are a little mild for my tastes, but it shaves well with Derby Blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my new Weishi double edge razor for about a month, from day one</li>
            <li>I was also pleasantly surprised that once you find your angle with this razor, it gives a really solid shave.</li>
            <li>I later came across an old vintage gillette that I now use.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only used it once so far.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, it may not be aggressive enough for you.</li>
            <li>Having spent over a decade in Asia, I am familiar with Chinese quality and was prepared for some rough edges on the handle.</li>
            <li>at first i felt it was not aggressive enough when i was using he Dorco blades included, but when i switched to a sharp blade like Astra it made a world of difference.</li>
            <li>The blades it come with are sharp, and replacements are cheap, but the actual razor itself is less than supremely durable.</li>
            <li>I was new to wet shaving when I bought this.  </li>
            <li>Generally, I use the straight razor and then touch up what I have trouble with with a Gillette Fusion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it&#x27;s the same razor as the one that Pawn Stars guy was hawking but for a whole lot less</li>
            <li>Shaving this way is a simple acquired skill, and can be accomplished with a little time.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first, but as long as you do a little prep it is no problem.  </li>

            <li> Good quality, travel case and sample &amp;#34;Dorco&amp;#34; brand(Korean) blades.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor for about a year and am very satisfied with it.  </li>

            <li> I love this shaver!</li>
            <li> It is comfortable in the hand and provides a great shave.  </li>
            <li> the shave is amazing</li>
            <li> NICK FREE, GREAT CONTROL</li>
            <li> and I liked the size.</li>
            <li> It is kind of like training wheels on a bike</li>
            <li> I have a light-medium beard and get a nice close shave with this (Weishi) safety razor -</li>
            <li> A styptic pencil comes in handy for that.</li>
            <li> It really is a fairly nice razor.  </li>
            <li> This one was delivered in a reasonable time and I&#x27;m very impressed.  </li>
            <li> Nice Razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for myself and the Microtouch for my father and honestly you can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
            <li> It comes with a handy travel kit.</li>
            <li> Honestly the best one I have boughten so far, you may think twice because of the price</li>
            <li> Very easy to change blades</li>
            <li> Good fit and finish;</li>
            <li> So far I am very happy with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth functioning, and has good weight.  </li>
            <li> more cost effective than those plastic razors.</li>
            <li> was at first impressed with how quickly it arrived.</li>
            <li> The knurled grip is very secure.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: this would make a good vacation or travel razor for a quick shave or touch up.  </li>
            <li> You do get a real nice clean shave with this razor and much more economical to use.</li>
            <li> That said, I was delighted from the very first stroke.  </li>
            <li> This Weishi might be okay for people with very light beards.  </li>
            <li> I can see this razor giving me a better shave than anything else</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t built like a tank (more like a Yugo).</li>
            <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t really give me that great a shave, but I like the case.</li>
            <li> I love the look and the package of this kit</li>
            <li> I do love that it comes in a travel case.  </li>
            <li> Shaving gels also work OK with a brush.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s where a dab of canned foam and a bit of fingertip touch is most efficient.</li>
            <li> The travel case is extremely handy for those of us on the go and holds everything, including your blades, securely.</li>
            <li> This is creating more nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li> but time to move on to a more quality model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better and faster</li>
            <li> the more I use it.</li>
            <li> If they made a chrome plated one it would be much better.</li>
            <li> I believe that most folks have is the angle of the razor.  </li>
            <li> there is nothing better than a Gillette fusion.</li>
            <li> Muker is a better razor, but it&#x27;s also 3 times the price.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> IT.CAN USE THE BLADE FOR MORE THAN ONE SHAVE.</li>
            <li> Better than the one advertized on TV by the Pawn Shop Guy.</li>
            <li> Just wish it were a bit more aggressive.</li>
            <li> I already have a Lord L6 and like many others enjoy DE shaving because it is cost effective and more interesting than disposables or electrics.  </li>
            <li> Would like it better if the handle were longer.  </li>
            <li> Much better then the disposable.</li>
            <li> the package, I was pleased to feel the weight of the product.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s identical to Microtouch One Razor just a better price.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I am beginner at the DE razor, and I am confident I will stick to them.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this razor after reading some of the other reviews, some great, some not so great.  </li>
            <li> Quality was pretty good.</li>
            <li> Used with a decent soap and brush it gives a very nice shave.</li>
            <li> stars because it is as advertised and reviewed, gives a great shave, and will last if you are kind to it.</li>
            <li> It came in a nice plastic case and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Bought the Weishi to transition to a more comfortable way of shaving.</li>
            <li> Pros: Much better than the two blade non pivoting Wilkinson Sword disposables that I bought for $2.37 + tax for a dozen at Walmart, blades for the DE are as cheap as $0.10 each.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 5 or 6 brands and these dorco are great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously your mileage may vary but for a razor in the sub $15.00 price range I found the Weishi very acceptable and good value.  </li>
            <li> It works great with gillette Super Speeds, since it is really just a copy of one.</li>
            <li> And still more to be expected, very good quality.</li>
            <li> : Very, very, very mild shave if you find the correct shave angle.  </li>
            <li> With these old time safety razors as with my straight razor you have to figure out the best shaving angle for yourself.  </li>
            <li> Easy put away</li>
            <li> My morning shave is a comfortable, smooth, enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read often that this is a good razor for those of us just getting started with a DE for the first time, and I find it to be perfectly true.</li>
            <li> Great to go back to to this old standby for a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a cheap product, and I&#x27;ve never been able to get a really clean shave.</li>
            <li> With care, it will be fine.</li>
            <li> However, the razor and included blades are just fine.  </li>
            <li> for the construction of the Weishi – it’s just fine.  </li>
            <li> and 205lbs, the Weishi will work for me just fine.</li>
            <li> I bought a 5[pack of Dorco blades, which seem to work fine.  </li>
            <li> Works just fine and blades are 10/$1 if you look around.</li>
            <li> I read reviews about the razor after I made the purchase, and I think that they are accurate:  </li>
            <li> Truly fantastic.</li>
            <li> As the others experienced, the opening mechanism froze and finally broke today.</li>
            <li> This item has some cheap looking packaging both box and case.  </li>
            <li> Handle is short, but this makes it a great compact razor.    </li>
            <li> Blades for this thing are so cheap</li>
            <li> And I was smooth.  </li>
            <li> Razor is effective, especially for someone just getting  into traditional or &amp;#34;wet shaving.&amp;#34;  Price is excellent, however, you can tell by the mechanical workings that it isn&#x27;t a precision instrument.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy mine.</li>
            <li> To put that in perspective, I have been using [cheap] disposable razors all those years, so I am comparing the Weishi 9306-F results to the disposables results.  </li>
            <li> It is a cheap razor and i comes with a travel case, blades and brush for cleaning it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not getting that baby smooth shave that was promised with these razors.</li>
            <li> The butterfly opening makes it easy to change blades and clean.</li>
            <li> Avoid cheap safety razors and get a trusted brand</li>
            <li> A cheap, but well made razor.</li>
            <li> I got a smooth shave on both my face and my head, no nicks.  </li>
            <li> case makes my bath room counter stay clutter free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap piece of junk</li>
            <li> great razor gives a really close shave replacement blades are very affordable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mild, so for the price not a bad beginners razor.</li>
            <li> It is ideal for the first time double edged safety razor shaver.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE(double edge) razor, and in about a month, I love it.  </li>
            <li> I shave my head, but I figure as this works really well on my skull, it should be fine on your face:)  </li>
            <li> it comes with a mirrored case and razor brush to clean the razor.</li>
            <li> My husband was very happy with this razor he had been complaining about how the other razors don&#x27;t get his beard really close</li>
            <li> ( perfect marrage) dullblade and dull razor.  </li>
            <li> After about two months of using it 5-6 days a week, the knob would not turn any more and the whole assembly broke apart in my hands.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as the gilette but thats good if you are just starting out.</li>
            <li> All in all I really liked shaving old school.</li>
            <li> However, it is not as good quality as the razor I had back in 1971.  </li>
            <li> But I will say this:  if you have never used a double edge razor before and want to try one, this is a good one to start with.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll spend $30 on a good Merkur or Edwin Jagger.</li>
            <li> I have about an average beard, and with a lot of time and care I can get roughly as good a shave with this as I could with my Gillette Atra, and with a bit more razor burn (no nicks, though).  </li>
            <li> Not a bad razor for the price.</li>
            <li> Not a bad entry level safety razor.</li>
            <li> Not a bad choice.  </li>
            <li> It was smoother and more comfortable than a new disposable razor, with no nicks or razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> However, for the price I think I still saved money over my old Mach 3 blades, and it does provide a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> as described good quality you expect more decription than i have to say this is what i like least about buying from you to many words required i said it all in the first words</li>
            <li> I found the razor to feel light, it feels lighter than the Lord L6 which has a hefty head, but certainly can be used without applying any significant pressure.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much!</li>
            <li> The blades that come with it are pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> Love my new retro razor.</li>
            <li> Much better than expected and perhaps even better than the Lord L6 which I find quite mild.  </li>
            <li> Great little kit and havent had any issues with it.</li>
            <li> On the other hand the razor is compact and comes with a nice easy to pack and compact case.  </li>
            <li> It is a great razor for beginners or someone that shaves everyday</li>
            <li> After you replace the cheap blades, the razor works really well.</li>
            <li> With alittle practice, nicks and razor burn will be an extremely rare occurrence.</li>
            <li> (I can still see him with a pan of water, fresh off the Coleman stove and a sliver of soap,  crouched by the truck&#x27;s rear view mirror scraping away.)  </li>
            <li> Good way to start wet shaving and save lots of money instead of buying those Mack 3, 4, 5, 10, 20 replacement blades and avoid razor burn.</li>
            <li> One feature that would make this better is if a standard packet of razors would fit inside the case.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34; closure is effective, but not entirely symmetrical.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, this razor arrived about a month earlier than anticipated which was nice.  </li>
            <li> A longer handle might be nice but is not critical.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades are economical as well.  </li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied as it is easy to use and nearly no learning curve.  </li>
            <li> This product shipped pretty quick.</li>
            <li> It is a shame because the product does look identical but they just do not have the angle right</li>
            <li> If you do not find the right shave angle, it will not cut the whiskers.  </li>
            <li> As always, I reserve the right to revise this review.</li>
            <li> Now I can leave those cheap plastic quick to dull disposable razors for good .</li>
            <li> I am online to buy a new double-edged safety razor, as I really do like the shave it gives as well as any of the multiple-blade razors, but I will be looking for something much better made.</li>
            <li> Anyone can buy a decent bottle of wine for $30.00, getting a decent bottle of wine for $12.00 is a bit more</li>
            <li> you just want to try safety razor shaving without spending much, this is not a bad buy.</li>
            <li> If the razor were a little more aggressive, I would give this one more star.  </li>
            <li> makes great gifts to get back back to &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The duration of a good wet shave does not have to take a whole lot longer than shaving with multi-blade razors, and saves a ton of money.</li>
            <li> This razor has not only worked great but came is within a week and the eta was a month later</li>
            <li> they are very economic.  </li>
            <li> and in addition to this great little razor you get a high quality plastic case.</li>
            <li> I learned to shave with a DE safety razor, and picked this one first when I decided to return to one many years later.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I was fairly satisfied.</li>
            <li> I just had my first shave with this razor.  </li>
            <li> It is most definitely NOT aggressive (the problem I had 20 years</li>
            <li> Just received and tried for the first time.  </li>
            <li> The blades are of a higher quality than I see out of cartridge-type razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure more expensive razors are a bit more refined.  </li>
            <li> Used blades go into a dollar store piggy bank for safe disposal later.</li>
            <li> I bought a weishi as my first Saftey Razor a couple months ago.</li>
            <li> Just had my first shave with the DE razor.</li>
            <li> There were a lot of convincing sounding endorsements, but maybe all of these fellow had leather skin like my Father, who used double edged blades and would shave even on a hunting trip; with one.  </li>
            <li> The next time was better.  </li>
            <li> This is a well made inexpensive saftey razor, it was my first.</li>
            <li> And the product is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> This was my first foray into the safety razor world.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always subscribed to the &#x27;first blade lifts the whisker&#x27; theory as presented by Gilette.  </li>
            <li> But now I have something more permanent that will last a life time .</li>
            <li> it would do in a real pinch, but otherwise would just chuck it in the F-it bucket!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very forgiving to the beginner when you don&#x27;t have quite the right angle.  </li>
            <li> it is great for a beginer to wet shaving having never used a double edge before I found it very forgiving.</li>
            <li> I bled twice and think that is reasonable for my first time having never used a safety razor before.  </li>
            <li> Since then I have used it pretty much every day.</li>
            <li> the angle is pretty much figured out for you.  </li>
            <li> Shaves as good if not better that any three or five blades razors</li>
            <li> I have several of these Weishi Shavers, and enjoy using them very much.</li>
            <li> I cannot easily cut muself, but the blade angle on this isn&#x27;t steep enough for me.</li>
            <li> you will very quickly find out that these are simply extended life disposables.  </li>
            <li> I have used all types of shavers over my life, most of then were single use shavers .</li>
            <li> I am certain this is a matter of hair type.&lt;br /&gt;DAB</li>
            <li> In short - Using a safety razor is a new technique for me (need to use more H2O) and</li>
            <li> I paired the Weishi with Shark Super Stainless blades and Proraso sensitive shave soap.</li>
            <li> Being “older” I remember my first shave with my Dad’s adjustable Gillette “safety” razor.  </li>
            <li> Good for a beginner shaver because it is hard to cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I then tried a different brand of double-edged safety razor, made in Germany, and it gives a wonderfully smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Treat them gently.</li>
            <li> Be gentle with the twist mechanism.</li>
            <li> I have straight brown hair 1.2 mils in diameter.</li>
            <li> A REAL Weishi 9306 series weighs in at about 1.9 ounces (without the case) and is quite sturdy.</li>
            <li> Makes it very practical when traveling.</li>
            <li> and he says gives very close shave.  </li>
            <li> it was a very comfortabe shave .</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> $12.30, I consider it to be a real bargain.  </li>
            <li> I have a couple of blade sampler packs and enjoy trying out different blades.  </li>
            <li> I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li> it is cheaply made and the handle is to short.</li>
            <li> Well, what got me thinking was the fact that closest shave I&#x27;d ever had was in a barber chair with a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> They say stainless</li>
            <li> Delivered fast.</li>
            <li> Better quality than expected for the price.</li>
            <li> And still get a real close and durable shave.  </li>
            <li> Plus you&#x27;ll start saving $125/year on inferior Gillette/Schick replacement blades by buying more environmentally conscious, Turkish Derby double edge blades ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> note of importance, I am confident that most of the poor reviews are from those who have improperly handled the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I expected a very very mild (non aggressive) shave from this razor based on the other reviews but discovered that if you find the razors sweet spot, which I found easy to do, it shaved very well.  </li>
            <li> used this razor with a sharp blade (blue Personna lab prep), and I found the correct shaving angle, so I was able to get a comfortable shave from this razor.  </li>
            <li> If you are interested in going old school and saving some money on the daily task of shaving, this little kit is a great way to get started.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the Mach 3, Fusion, and all the other department store junk.</li>
            <li> If you chose, you can move on to other more fancy razors.  </li>
            <li> Just take it slow and easy, and you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li> I was being careful while using this to for the record with the Art of Shaving kit also which is way better than normal shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The razor itself is very sturdy - nice and heavy!</li>
            <li> There iis also a certain level of pride I get from learning a new skill.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I can now just buy the much cheaper double-edge blades rather and shave soap than the much more expensive cartridges and aerosol foam.  </li>
            <li> Product is fine if you can deal with a single blade.  </li>
            <li> Best investment I&#x27;ve made in a long time, Never liked the multiple blade concept, they may shave close but they will not trim around the upper lip to shape or maintain a  mustache, just to mention I have gotten 7 clean shaves with this razor/Blade combo.</li>
            <li> With the new modern disposable systems</li>
            <li> I highly recomend to anybody looking to buy a saftey razor to pass on this one, pay a little extra money and get a good quality one.</li>
            <li> I almost started using it as my main razor.  </li>
            <li> However, there was visible stubble on my face within six hours after shaving, so this razor is too mild for me to use on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fairly decent quality for the price.  </li>
            <li> The main thing is that you keep your face lubricated with the soap.  </li>
            <li> all know we can go out there and buy a decent DE razor in the $30.00 and up category.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So is the Weishi a decent DE razor for about $12.00?  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> but somehow they still rust like high carbon steel.</li>
            <li> It worked OK for several months although I did cut myself several times when I used a new blade.</li>
            <li> The butterfly mechanism stuck a few times, but it was OK.</li>
            <li> After using this razor once, I am completely hooked on double edge wet shaving, and I have already bought some more, higher quality equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a nice butterfly open mechanism where as other brands I&#x27;ve seen come completely apart to change blades.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice little double edged razor for the price.</li>
            <li> I still have this new razor in my travel kit.</li>
            <li> Why did have to change to the new Razors?&lt;br /&gt;The Retro Razor works</li>
            <li> B001NT9SFU Derby Extra Super Stainless Double Edge Razor Blades - 30 Ct]])</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re thinking about trying double edge wet shaving, I couldn&#x27;t recommend this product any more.</li>
            <li> but the butterfly mechanism is not working properly and in fact is not holding the blade at the exact position.  </li>
            <li> and I received it nearly 3 weeks before the scheduled delivery date!</li>
            <li> I have fewer nicks from it that my other DE and I feel that it actually gives me a better shave.  </li>
            <li> I should point out that this is my first DE (double edge) razor, so I can&#x27;t compare it to a Merkur or vintage Gillete, because I haven&#x27;t used them.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was how short the handle is, but looks like what my dad used 50 yrs ago :) Solid built!!</li>
            <li> Hate to pay huge premium for a high end unit but given the short life of this one....not a great value either.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all a good deal, no plastic waste!!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a month and had no trouble staying out of the Emergency Room.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality.</li>
            <li> If you treat this razor gently, I think it should last decades.</li>
            <li> It does no where near the job as Gillette.</li>
            <li> and it wouldn&#x27;t take much to make it work just the same.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t handle this, my face is fairly sensitive though.</li>
            <li> Having shaved with a triple blade disposable for the last 5 years of my life, there is no comparisson, no matter how much oil, lather, etc.</li>
            <li> Yesterday I tried out my old safety razor</li>
            <li> Using an old-style shaving brush and quality shaving soap from a big stainless camping mug I&#x27;ve got, I whip up some foam.</li>
            <li> but I feel it helps those of us with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am the type of person who wants to buy things that are well made and built to last.</li>
            <li> Shave was actually very close with just a bit of stubble left on the neck.</li>
            <li> Cons: Not as close as my Gillette Fusion Power 5 blade razor but nearly as close, however cartridge refills are $16 for four cartridges.</li>
            <li> Those who have had negative experiences try a better blade.</li>
            <li> Razor came as advertized and heavy duty metal....not cheap.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to go with a cheap option, just in case I disliked the experience.</li>
            <li> It is early days yet</li>
            <li> will last a while if treated reasonably gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> I got this to save on the % blade cost product and so far I am achieving that goal.</li>
            <li> This razor is nothing but a bubble gum machine razor compared to my old Gillette.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this razor worked well for me.</li>
            <li> I went with an inexpensive razor just to try things out in order to see if the extra blades were worth the extra money.    </li>
            <li> The mirror is a bit small, and it could use a razor safe, but the razor is heavy and doesn&#x27;t rust quickly.</li>
            <li> After several months it wouldn&#x27;t open and close properly when I needed to clean or replace the blade.</li>
            <li> The only reason I bought a new one is because my original fell one day and the clamp was slightly misaligned.</li>
            <li> In particular, the mechanics to open and close the blade chamber froze and often I had to use pliers to turn the mechanism.</li>
            <li> I have medium or average facial hair in density and coarseness, if that is a relevant factor.  </li>
            <li> handle is on the small size, but overall I love it.</li>
            <li> I loaded a Lord Stainless blade in the Weishi because the other reviewers pretty much universally condemned the Dorco blades that come with it.  </li>
            <li> I am going to get one that is a little more expensive and hopefully better made.</li>
            <li> it almost ruined my first wet shave experience.</li>
            <li> it are a little mild for my tastes, but it shaves well with Derby Blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my new Weishi double edge razor for about a month, from day one</li>
            <li> I was also pleasantly surprised that once you find your angle with this razor, it gives a really solid shave.</li>
            <li> I later came across an old vintage gillette that I now use.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only used it once so far.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, it may not be aggressive enough for you.</li>
            <li> Having spent over a decade in Asia, I am familiar with Chinese quality and was prepared for some rough edges on the handle.</li>
            <li> at first i felt it was not aggressive enough when i was using he Dorco blades included, but when i switched to a sharp blade like Astra it made a world of difference.</li>
            <li> The blades it come with are sharp, and replacements are cheap, but the actual razor itself is less than supremely durable.</li>
            <li> I was new to wet shaving when I bought this.  </li>
            <li> Generally, I use the straight razor and then touch up what I have trouble with with a Gillette Fusion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it&#x27;s the same razor as the one that Pawn Stars guy was hawking but for a whole lot less</li>
            <li> Shaving this way is a simple acquired skill, and can be accomplished with a little time.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first, but as long as you do a little prep it is no problem.  </li>
            <li> The feel is firm not weak</li>
            <li> I have heard other reviewers caution against treating it too rough, so I have handled it very gingerly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because I wanted to get back to using a single double-edged blade safety razor as I used years ago, before razors first added a second, then a third, and even more stupidly and expensively a fourth blade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small investment and one that is likely to save you a lot of $$ over time, all while you are satisfied with a very old and simplistic way of shaving!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my second safety razor and I have been shaving a long time.</li>
            <li> However, buying new blades helped a little.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I went real old school and got myself a Wade and Butcher straight razor from back in the late 1800’s.  </li>
            <li> That is not to say I recommend it over other, more expensive double edge razors.  </li>
            <li> and I was shocked at how much more hair it cut directly after I pass the Weishi razor.</li>
            <li> I recently discovered double edge wet shaving and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> This razor works fine and refills are not too expensive.</li>
            <li> My advice for \\&quot;beginners\\&quot; would be, don&#x27;t be afraid to start with a more aggressive razor.  </li>
            <li> After getting used to using a double-edged razor again, I found that the extra blades were not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> As a couple of people have mentioned, it&#x27;s not very aggressive, meaning that it doesn&#x27;t expose enough of the blade.  </li>
            <li> alright and will save money in the long run</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with this one for a long time.</li>
            <li> I had relatively low expectations from the Weishi given some of the reviews saying it was not very aggressive.  </li>
            <li> Environmentally friendly as the only waste is a thin steel blade and not a plastic cartridge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy by far to shave.</li>
            <li> but I personally want a extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> ( I would shave only every other day with my 4-blader</li>
            <li> (or perhaps any) single blade product if you are used to a multi blade setup.</li>
            <li> How could a single blade ever give me a close shave?  </li>
            <li> Sturdy well built razor with a little weight to it, should last a long time.</li>
            <li> The razor is heavy enough to do the work, and the Dorko blades are sharp enough to cut through a couple of days of growth without a lot of pulling or nicking.  </li>
            <li> Before I actually tried out the razor, I watched a couple of You Tube clips on the subject.  </li>
            <li> the only difference is this one costs less and comes with a cleaning brush and a case rather than a stand</li>
            <li> This is the SAME razor &amp;#34;as seen on TV.&amp;#34; And for $10 less.</li>
            <li> So, in looking for a well made, basic razor for Round 2.</li>
            <li> The beard (and brush) ought to be wet before working the lather.</li>
            <li> I had been having some trouble with the part of the razor that you twist to open it up sticking,</li>
            <li> The blade does not move around at all in the safety razor even before i have closed the doors.</li>
            <li> not very aggressive</li>
            <li> I also suggest watching some tutorial videos on the art of wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Received on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Shipping from China, I expected a several-week transit time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve calculated, with this kit, and a set of 100 replacement blades, I would be set for close to two years worth of shaving with the razor and blades for not more than $30!!!!  </li>
            <li> The shave is O.K. and not very aggressive.</li>
            <li> Needless to say it didn&#x27;t close quite right afterwords.</li>
            <li> The Weishi gives a decent shave but the quality of the razor is really poor.</li>
            <li> I was tired of using the plastic shavers and have wanted a product like this for some time but very hard to fine.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t slice up my face, in other words.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine why I would buy any other model.</li>
            <li> , I change them every other shave.</li>
            <li> Keep your other razor&#x27;s that Walmart sells trust me</li>
            <li> I would like a longer handle but other than that</li>
            <li> same as i had in army 50 yrs ago no more crappy disposables</li>
            <li> it feels like if you are a little bit rough with it that it will break.</li>
            <li> Lighter, though otherwise visually identical shavers are quite common and less resilient.</li>
            <li> and I had to manually file it down with a file so it wouldnt irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I bore down too hard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Those two factors brought my rating down to a \\&quot;it&#x27;s OK\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> One caveat the blade is slightly wider than the shaving head , so take note .</li>
            <li> I agree the handle could be perhaps a half to an inch longer</li>
            <li> It all comes in a convenient little plastic travel box, therefore I&#x27;ll make this my travel</li>
            <li> However, the Weishi razor turned out to be so poorly made that even as one of the least expensive double-edged razors available, it is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Shaving with the DE takes about 3-4 times as long, had a few nicks tho nothing serious.</li>
            <li> Just a tad on the heavy side.</li>
            <li> The review below is what I wrote a few months when I had just started using this razor.</li>
            <li> A few days ago, my shaving brush gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li> the mechanism holds the blade firmly .</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Also, the blade was very slightly misaligned in the razor, but this did not seem to impact the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying so much money for refills for those expensive plastic razors for women.</li>
            <li> Very little pressure is either needed or wanted.</li>
            <li> If you tap these razors or drop them on hard surfaces, or crank the handles or twist mechanisms down hard</li>
            <li> Well, I was not sure about this.  </li>
            <li> because I usually had nicks and irritation that had to heal up.</li>
            <li> I usually shave after I shower and that softens up the face.  </li>
            <li> looking so forword to getting it took about 1 month to arrive and first shave with it,alli was doingwas wiping the shave cream off my face, disappointed in it, the bladeistofarbackfromthe combto feel on yourface.</li>
            <li> it is very heavy duty</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I had tried to shave my face with a hospital prep razor and ended up seriously mauled.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate shaving for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> He also likes that it came with a hard shell case.</li>
            <li> Just start slow.</li>
            <li> Less expensive that the MicroTouch One razor.</li>
            <li> tonight it was stuck so bad that I actually had to use a set of pliers to try to break it loose and in doing so ended up cutting myself and breaking the razor.</li>
            <li> Very small in relation to size of a man&#x27;s hand and very hard to hold on to.</li>
            <li> I dialed it up to 10 and watched the blood travel down my neck as I scrambled for the styptic pencil and some cold water!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Besides, my beard is tough as wire.</li>
            <li> Truth was my Dad may have been tough, but he had skin just like the rest of us.  </li>
            <li> In this sub $15.00 price range I would not expect anything to be built army tough and survive any abuse.  </li>
            <li> DONT WASTE UR MONEY ON THIS!!!</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> I still got a few nicks, but it was nowhere as bad as I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> Out of all the purchases I&#x27;ve made on Amazon this is BY FAR the worst.  </li>
            <li> My husband decided to try this because disposable razors have become so expensive.  </li>
            <li> but if something goes wrong i will probable update the review</li>
            <li> No cuts, well balanced, simplistic and yet functional.  </li>
            <li> Hope you learn from my disappointment.</li>
            <li> It turns out I was using the wrong angle 20 years ago (surprise, surprise, user error!).</li>
            <li> i knew i no longer will have to buy expensive blades ever again!</li>
            <li> With a bad spell 20 years ago, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a bundle.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the razor.</li>
            <li> Although I can&#x27;t recall the brand of that evil double-edged razor, it put me off single-blade shaving for over 20 years.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I learned to shave with a DE safety razor, and picked this one first when I decided to return to one many years later.  Not the best decision.  As a couple of people have mentioned, it&#x27;s not very aggressive, meaning that it doesn&#x27;t expose enough of the blade.  I have about an average beard, and with a lot of time and care I can get roughly as good a shave with this as I could with my Gillette Atra, and with a bit more razor burn (no nicks, though).  I then tried a different brand of double-edged safety razor, made in Germany, and it gives a wonderfully smooth shave.  My advice for \\&quot;beginners\\&quot; would be, don&#x27;t be afraid to start with a more aggressive razor.  Just take it slow and easy, and you&#x27;ll be fine.  This Weishi might be okay for people with very light beards.  I&#x27;ll just keep mine at work where I might occasionally need an emergency spare.</li>
            <li> makes great gifts to get back back to &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Bought the Weishi to transition to a more comfortable way of shaving. It worked well for about 2 months. The butterfly mechanism stuck a few times, but it was OK. After about two months of using it 5-6 days a week, the knob would not turn any more and the whole assembly broke apart in my hands. However, for the price I think I still saved money over my old Mach 3 blades, and it does provide a more comfortable shave. Overall, I was fairly satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great razor, good shave, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great razor for a beginner.  I just had my first shave with this razor.  I bled twice and think that is reasonable for my first time having never used a safety razor before.  I can see this razor giving me a better shave than anything else once I master it.  Learning curve?  Yes, I say two to four weeks.</li>
            <li> Not quite as close a shave as I wanted but good nonetheless. Much better than the Mach 3, Fusion, and all the other department store junk. Very easy to change blades and I liked the size. It also had a good feel to it. Used with a decent soap and brush it gives a very nice shave.</li>
            <li> Buy a $20 Weishi safety razor and feel the difference. You will be stunned! Plus you&#x27;ll start saving $125/year on inferior Gillette/Schick replacement blades by buying more environmentally conscious, Turkish Derby double edge blades ([[ASIN:B001NT9SFU Derby Extra Super Stainless Double Edge Razor Blades - 30 Ct]]) at $25 for a year&#x27;s supply. I cannot believe what a difference this shaving experience is.     A friend had been suggesting that I make the switch for a year - and I&#x27;m elated that I finally did! Truly fantastic. Do not be intimidated. I&#x27;ve had this razor for a month and had no trouble staying out of the Emergency Room. No nicks or gushers.</li>
            <li> I was new to wet shaving when I bought this.  I read reviews about the razor after I made the purchase, and I think that they are accurate:  it&#x27;s very forgiving to the beginner when you don&#x27;t have quite the right angle.  I don&#x27;t slice up my face, in other words.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try this type of razor, don&#x27;t know if its the brand model or type, but it wasn&#x27;t for me, everyone is different, but this razor tore my face up.</li>
            <li> Good razor. Just a tad on the heavy side.</li>
            <li> i bout this razor in july not even a month after i got it i had to oil it because it was locking up on me and i went to use it today and it broke in two pieces...i have never had a double edge razor that has done this before and i have used one since i started shaving at 12.</li>
            <li> The review below is what I wrote a few months when I had just started using this razor. As the others experienced, the opening mechanism froze and finally broke today. The metal used to make this one is a very low quality one. My dad&#x27;s gillette adjustable razor is still working after 4 decades of use. Am going to spend money to buy one like that.    DONT WASTE UR MONEY ON THIS!!! DIDNT LAST 10 MONTHS!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because I wanted to get back to using a single double-edged blade safety razor as I used years ago, before razors first added a second, then a third, and even more stupidly and expensively a fourth blade. I went with an inexpensive razor just to try things out in order to see if the extra blades were worth the extra money.    After getting used to using a double-edged razor again, I found that the extra blades were not worth the extra money. However, the Weishi razor turned out to be so poorly made that even as one of the least expensive double-edged razors available, it is not worth the money. In particular, the mechanics to open and close the blade chamber froze and often I had to use pliers to turn the mechanism. This morning, the mechanism finally broke.    I am online to buy a new double-edged safety razor, as I really do like the shave it gives as well as any of the multiple-blade razors, but I will be looking for something much better made.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a double-edged razor since 1987. Although I can&#x27;t recall the brand of that evil double-edged razor, it put me off single-blade shaving for over 20 years. A few days ago, my shaving brush gave up the ghost. As I shopped for a brush, I ran across double-edged razors. It turns out I was using the wrong angle 20 years ago (surprise, surprise, user error!). So, in looking for a well made, basic razor for Round 2. With a bad spell 20 years ago, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a bundle. Having spent over a decade in Asia, I am familiar with Chinese quality and was prepared for some rough edges on the handle. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. I was also pleasantly surprised that once you find your angle with this razor, it gives a really solid shave. It is most definitely NOT aggressive (the problem I had 20 years ago).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to remember something with Chinese products: Treat them gently. If you treat this razor gently, I think it should last decades. Be gentle with the twist mechanism. It isn&#x27;t built like a tank (more like a Yugo). With care, it will be fine. If you crank on it like you are putting on a lug nut, the razor may last a month and may eventually jam. Treat your razor with respect and it will treat YOU well :-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars because it is as advertised and reviewed, gives a great shave, and will last if you are kind to it.</li>
            <li> Great little kit and havent had any issues with it.</li>
            <li> What a shame!  I bought this because I wanted a second razor like my Gillette two sided adjustable razor(My dad bought in 1960 and gave it to me a year ago).  I had been told this company made an identical product and had paid to use the patent So I ordered one. When it came it was not the Silver one I ordered it was Gold. oh well.  Tried it out and compared to my Gillette.  No where close to the same. It does no where near the job as Gillette. It is a shame because the product does look identical but they just do not have the angle right and it wouldn&#x27;t take much to make it work just the same. Hope you learn from my disappointment.</li>
            <li> Just received and tried for the first time.  I am completely satisfied as it is easy to use and nearly no learning curve.  Shaves as good if not better that any three or five blades razors I&#x27;ve used, and they were all I shaved with.  I will definately keep this as my travel kit and only get a more expensive kit for my home.</li>
            <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t really give me that great a shave, but I like the case. It works great with gillette Super Speeds, since it is really just a copy of one. It&#x27;s very mild, so for the price not a bad beginners razor.</li>
            <li> I used this once and put in the drawer to forever collect dust. I am so used to the Mach 3 razors I couldn&#x27;t handle this, my face is fairly sensitive though. I was being careful while using this to for the record with the Art of Shaving kit also which is way better than normal shaving cream.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001D4Z87W Weishi Safety Razor and Travel Case]]&lt;br /&gt; This is a well-made razor. The parallelism of the parts is impeccable. The knurled grip is very secure.  The blades are of a higher quality than I see out of cartridge-type razors.&lt;br /&gt;That said, it is not aggressive enough for me. I have straight brown hair 1.2 mils in diameter. I cannot easily cut muself, but the blade angle on this isn&#x27;t steep enough for me. I am certain this is a matter of hair type.&lt;br /&gt;DAB</li>
            <li> This item has some cheap looking packaging both box and case.  However, the razor and included blades are just fine.  Handle is short, but this makes it a great compact razor.    For all intents and purposes, I will ONLY use this razor for travel.  Having shaved with a triple blade disposable for the last 5 years of my life, there is no comparisson, no matter how much oil, lather, etc. you use.      Product is fine if you can deal with a single blade.  I would not recommend going to this (or perhaps any) single blade product if you are used to a multi blade setup.</li>
            <li> This is my second safety razor and I have been shaving a long time. The only reason I bought a new one is because my original fell one day and the clamp was slightly misaligned. I love the look and the package of this kit but it just doesn&#x27;t get a close enough shave. It is a great razor for beginners or someone that shaves everyday but I personally want a extremely close shave. Yesterday I tried out my old safety razor and I was shocked at how much more hair it cut directly after I pass the Weishi razor.</li>
            <li> Not a bad razor for the price. it is great for a beginer to wet shaving having never used a double edge before I found it very forgiving. It is kind of like training wheels on a bike lol. I later came across an old vintage gillette that I now use. I still have this new razor in my travel kit. It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as the gilette but thats good if you are just starting out. deffinetly helps the learning curve lol.</li>
            <li> 1/2 the price of the ones marketed by the dude from pawn stars and its the same razor</li>
            <li> I find this razor works well for me.  I have a light-medium beard and get a nice close shave with this (Weishi) safety razor - with no razor burn or rash.      I am glad I can now just buy the much cheaper double-edge blades rather and shave soap than the much more expensive cartridges and aerosol foam.  Plus, using a safety razor, brush and a bar of shave soap is \\&quot;greener\\&quot; than cartridge razor and foam.    In short - Using a safety razor is a new technique for me (need to use more H2O) and I like it very much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor for about a year and am very satisfied with it.  It is sturdy and does the job.  I&#x27;m sure more expensive razors are a bit more refined.  I do love that it comes in a travel case.  That&#x27;s what drew me to this model.    I can&#x27;t imagine why I would buy any other model.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap product, and I&#x27;ve never been able to get a really clean shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a double edge, not a multi blade, so using this shaver a throwback to a different way of shaving. Using an old-style shaving brush and quality shaving soap from a big stainless camping mug I&#x27;ve got, I whip up some foam. Shaving cup or bowl type is quite optional. An Arko shaving stick, mashed into the bottom of the cup is my choice for soap. Shaving gels also work OK with a brush. Ignore the elitists online who disdain any shaving products in a can. The brush cleans the skin and softens the whiskers, so I work the lather into my face for a minute or so. The beard (and brush) ought to be wet before working the lather. If the shaving cream isn&#x27;t just about all scraped off after the blade passes over it, the shaver angle is probably incorrect. Very little pressure is either needed or wanted. Dual edge razors want about a 30 degree blade to skin angle, and the simple skill of maintaining the angle throughout a shave comes with time. Blades for this thing are so cheap, I change them every other shave. Besides, my beard is tough as wire. Used blades go into a dollar store piggy bank for safe disposal later. I keep a ten cent cheapo plastic twin blade around in case I can still feel some whiskers after a second pass with the Weishi.  Here&#x27;s where a dab of canned foam and a bit of fingertip touch is most efficient. Please note that age and ethnicity both affect the toughness of facial hair. I have several of these Weishi Shavers, and enjoy using them very much. A REAL Weishi 9306 series weighs in at about 1.9 ounces (without the case) and is quite sturdy. Lighter, though otherwise visually identical shavers are quite common and less resilient. Accept no substitutes. Shaving this way is a simple acquired skill, and can be accomplished with a little time. The duration of a good wet shave does not have to take a whole lot longer than shaving with multi-blade razors, and saves a ton of money. Just start slow. Soon, you&#x27;ll feel the accomplishment of a job well done. With alittle practice, nicks and razor burn will be an extremely rare occurrence.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for about 6 months. It works flawlessly. I switched to a safety razor after struggling with razor burn for years. I&#x27;ll never use anything else. There have been complaints about the lack of aggressiveness but I feel it helps those of us with extremely sensitive skin. I paired the Weishi with Shark Super Stainless blades and Proraso sensitive shave soap. I don&#x27;t hate shaving for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> I bought a weishi as my first Saftey Razor a couple months ago. Since then I have used it pretty much every day. The Weishi gives a decent shave but the quality of the razor is really poor. I had been having some trouble with the part of the razor that you twist to open it up sticking, tonight it was stuck so bad that I actually had to use a set of pliers to try to break it loose and in doing so ended up cutting myself and breaking the razor. I highly recomend to anybody looking to buy a saftey razor to pass on this one, pay a little extra money and get a good quality one. I am the type of person who wants to buy things that are well made and built to last. What the hell was I thinking when I orderd this? Do not let this happen to you.</li>
            <li> Having been used to Merkur razors this was supposed to by my travel setup. Well, when they pressed the metal they missed a spot and I had to manually file it down with a file so it wouldnt irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> If you are interested in going old school and saving some money on the daily task of shaving, this little kit is a great way to get started.  The razor is heavy enough to do the work, and the Dorko blades are sharp enough to cut through a couple of days of growth without a lot of pulling or nicking.  The travel case is extremely handy for those of us on the go and holds everything, including your blades, securely.</li>
            <li> Started out great but after about 5 months the mechanism locked up.  I worked with it but I cannot explain it perfectly but the butterfly mechanism is not working properly and in fact is not holding the blade at the exact position.  This is creating more nicks and cuts.  I need to look for another option.  Hate to pay huge premium for a high end unit but given the short life of this one....not a great value either.  It did convince me to switch from disposables and cartridges so I give it credit for that but time to move on to a more quality model.</li>
            <li> Just had my first shave with the DE razor. Pros: Much better than the two blade non pivoting Wilkinson Sword disposables that I bought for $2.37 + tax for a dozen at Walmart, blades for the DE are as cheap as $0.10 each. Sturdy well built razor with a little weight to it, should last a long time. Environmentally friendly as the only waste is a thin steel blade and not a plastic cartridge. Shave was actually very close with just a bit of stubble left on the neck. Cons: Not as close as my Gillette Fusion Power 5 blade razor but nearly as close, however cartridge refills are $16 for four cartridges. Shaving with the DE takes about 3-4 times as long, had a few nicks tho nothing serious. A styptic pencil comes in handy for that. All in all I really liked shaving old school. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better and faster the more I use it. Very happy with my purchase and I received it nearly 3 weeks before the scheduled delivery date!</li>
            <li> It works okay, not the best construction.  It&#x27;ll shave your face though.  For the price it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband because he missed the close shaved feeling that he just wasn&#x27;t getting with disposables. He never cared for electric razors so when I saw this on Amazon &amp; showed it to him, his eyes lit up like a kid at Christmas. He is extremely happy with the look and feel of it and is loving the close shaved feeling again. He also likes that it came with a hard shell case. Makes it very practical when traveling.</li>
            <li> Well, I was not sure about this.  There were a lot of convincing sounding endorsements, but maybe all of these fellow had leather skin like my Father, who used double edged blades and would shave even on a hunting trip; with one.  (I can still see him with a pan of water, fresh off the Coleman stove and a sliver of soap,  crouched by the truck&#x27;s rear view mirror scraping away.)  Truth was my Dad may have been tough, but he had skin just like the rest of us.  He just knew how to shave.  If you take a double edge to your face as you would one of those quadruple blade shavers, you should have 911 on speed dial.  A few years ago, I had tried to shave my face with a hospital prep razor and ended up seriously mauled.  I bore down too hard.&lt;br /&gt;  Before I actually tried out the razor, I watched a couple of You Tube clips on the subject.  I already have a shaving mug and use Williams mug soap.  I still got a few nicks, but it was nowhere as bad as I thought it would be.  And I was smooth.  The next time was better.  I then worked up the courage to shave two days in a row. ( I would shave only every other day with my 4-blader because I usually had nicks and irritation that had to heal up.) I had a styptic pencil standing by, but did not need it.  Today was the third day in a row.  I will probably still give my face a rest for the weekend, but I am sold using a double edge.  Even the most expensive imported blade is still a fraction of the cost of a Quatro.  There iis also a certain level of pride I get from learning a new skill.  There is a learning curve, but you do not have to be leather-faced to use a razor like this.</li>
            <li> good blade -- need dispenser for used blades</li>
            <li> The price is very fair for this pedisrian razor . The feel is firm not weak the mechanism holds the blade firmly . Great product for traveling with it&#x27;s mirrored plastic box , and cleaning brush. It is now my stow-n-go razor . Now I can leave those cheap plastic quick to dull disposable razors for good . One caveat the blade is slightly wider than the shaving head , so take note .</li>
            <li> This is a well made inexpensive saftey razor, it was my first. Good way to start wet shaving and save lots of money instead of buying those Mack 3, 4, 5, 10, 20 replacement blades and avoid razor burn.</li>
            <li> Wanted this razor for a traveling razor.  It really is a fairly nice razor.  I have fewer nicks from it that my other DE and I feel that it actually gives me a better shave.  I almost started using it as my main razor.  One feature that would make this better is if a standard packet of razors would fit inside the case.  The slot where the razors come is not quite big enough.  The biggest problem however is that the razor itself is starting to rust after only 1 week of use. Well there goes that idea. Those two factors brought my rating down to a \\&quot;it&#x27;s OK\\&quot;.  If they made a chrome plated one it would be much better.</li>
            <li> Razor is effective, especially for someone just getting  into traditional or &amp;#34;wet shaving.&amp;#34;  Price is excellent, however, you can tell by the mechanical workings that it isn&#x27;t a precision instrument.  The &amp;#34;butterfly&amp;#34; closure is effective, but not entirely symmetrical. Still, for the price point, it is a solid value.  I enjoy mine.</li>
            <li> good cofortable shave as described good quality you expect more decription than i have to say this is what i like least about buying from you to many words required i said it all in the first words</li>
            <li> This razor has not only worked great but came is within a week and the eta was a month later I would highly recommend it it&#x27;s just like the microtouch one the only difference is this one costs less and comes with a cleaning brush and a case rather than a stand</li>
            <li> I was tired of using the plastic shavers and have wanted a product like this for some time but very hard to fine.  Until I found it at Amazon.com. Prompt delivery, etc. Excellent order.  And the product is exactly what I wanted.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Very small in relation to size of a man&#x27;s hand and very hard to hold on to. I do nt recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Just what was needed.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  Great razor.  Bought for my husband and he says gives very close shave.  Comes with storage case to keep the razor in.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice razor shave kit!</li>
            <li> Ive owned two weishi razors. they both were of excellent quality. at first i felt it was not aggressive enough when i was using he Dorco blades included, but when i switched to a sharp blade like Astra it made a world of difference. I had been using a Parker 22 but ive come back to the weishi. the Weishi holds the blade snuggly and always gives me the same experience every time. The blade does not move around at all in the safety razor even before i have closed the doors. and in addition to this great little razor you get a high quality plastic case. Those who have had negative experiences try a better blade.</li>
            <li> My husband decided to try this because disposable razors have become so expensive.  He seems to like it alright and will save money in the long run</li>
            <li> great razor gives a really close shave replacement blades are very affordable</li>
            <li> Pros: Good fit and finish; great price; nice travel case; doors and mechanism worked fine; chrome plating is very good.  Good for a beginner shaver because it is hard to cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Very, very, very mild shave if you find the correct shave angle.  If you do not find the right shave angle, it will not cut the whiskers.  Also, the blade was very slightly misaligned in the razor, but this did not seem to impact the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this razor with a sharp blade (blue Personna lab prep), and I found the correct shaving angle, so I was able to get a comfortable shave from this razor.  However, there was visible stubble on my face within six hours after shaving, so this razor is too mild for me to use on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: this would make a good vacation or travel razor for a quick shave or touch up.  If the razor were a little more aggressive, I would give this one more star.  If the blade aligned correctly, I would give it yet another star.</li>
            <li> Being “older” I remember my first shave with my Dad’s adjustable Gillette “safety” razor.  I dialed it up to 10 and watched the blood travel down my neck as I scrambled for the styptic pencil and some cold water!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this razor arrived about a month earlier than anticipated which was nice.  When it arrived I unwrapped it, took it upstairs and lathered up to give it a try.  A few years ago I went real old school and got myself a Wade and Butcher straight razor from back in the late 1800’s.  Generally, I use the straight razor and then touch up what I have trouble with with a Gillette Fusion.  This system allows me to use the Fusion blades for about 4 to 5 weeks, saves me some money and gives me a sense of history.  Now I won’t need the Gillette anymore because this Weishi will take its place and finish what my Wade and Butcher can’t get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I believe that most folks have is the angle of the razor.  With the new modern disposable systems the angle is pretty much figured out for you.  With these old time safety razors as with my straight razor you have to figure out the best shaving angle for yourself.  It takes some adjustment but, if you hang in there you will be just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the construction of the Weishi – it’s just fine.  I agree the handle could be perhaps a half to an inch longer but, that said, at 6’2” and 205lbs, the Weishi will work for me just fine.</li>
            <li> This product shipped pretty quick. It&#x27;s not easy by far to shave. Keep your other razor&#x27;s that Walmart sells trust me there is nothing better than a Gillette fusion. You will know why all the president&#x27;s all had beards.</li>
            <li> I have several safety razors, and for the price this is one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;My Muker is a better razor, but it&#x27;s also 3 times the price.&lt;br /&gt;The Dorco blades that came with it are a little mild for my tastes, but it shaves well with Derby Blades.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the razor. It worked OK for several months although I did cut myself several times when I used a new blade. After several months it wouldn&#x27;t open and close properly when I needed to clean or replace the blade. I had to use a pair of pliers to try to get it to open-but the razor was damaged and I had to throw it in the trash. I am going to have to buy another one. But I won&#x27;t buy this one again. I am going to get one that is a little more expensive and hopefully better made.</li>
            <li> i cut my teeth with this razor .  ha ha . it was a very comfortabe shave . i used it a bout 8 months . flawless , used it with feather blades . not very aggressive but thats how i relearned to shave using d e razors . all in all desent razor for the money, but not gonna buy another one . while trying to replace the blade the dang thing broke</li>
            <li> The razor itself is very sturdy - nice and heavy! The travel case is convenient as well.</li>
            <li> It rusted out after about 5 months of use, as I tried to replace the blade the twist at the bottom stuck and I had to get pliers to actually open it. Needless to say it didn&#x27;t close quite right afterwords. The blades it come with are sharp, and replacements are cheap, but the actual razor itself is less than supremely durable.</li>
            <li> I decided to get an &amp;#34;old fashion&amp;#34; razor. I was tired of paying so much money for refills for those expensive plastic razors for women. This razor works fine and refills are not too expensive. It came in a nice plastic case and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Replaced my electric.  Great to go back to to this old standby for a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;I can shave faster with the double edge and get a closer shave than with my electric!</li>
            <li> VERRY CLOSE SHAVE, MY HUSBAND LOVED IT.CAN USE THE BLADE FOR MORE THAN ONE SHAVE.</li>
            <li> Fairly decent quality for the price.  However, it is not as good quality as the razor I had back in 1971.  It feels like if it were overtightened I fear it would strip the threads on the tightening mechanism.</li>
            <li> Razor came as advertized and heavy duty metal....not cheap.  Neat case, mirror and blades.  Better than the one advertized on TV by the Pawn Shop Guy.</li>
            <li> This was my first foray into the safety razor world.  I remember my dad shaving with one of these and he even gave me one without the razor to pretend shave when he was shaving.  I wish I still had that razor.  This one was delivered in a reasonable time and I&#x27;m very impressed.  It has a good weight to it and shaves wonderfully.  I was hesitant at first, but as long as you do a little prep it is no problem.  Don&#x27;t be scared.  I usually shave after I shower and that softens up the face.  I also bought a shaving mug and brush with this and it makes a lot of difference.  The main thing is that you keep your face lubricated with the soap.  Go ahead and get one of these.  It has already saved me a lot of money and gives me a close shave.  This one feels solid in your hands.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is a nice little double edged razor for the price. It is comfortable in the hand and provides a great shave.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Nice Razor. I would like a longer handle but other than that I like the razor.</li>
            <li> looking so forword to getting it took about 1 month to arrive and first shave with it,alli was doingwas wiping the shave cream off my face, disappointed in it, the bladeistofarbackfromthe combto feel on yourface. I used thedorco blade that came withit ( perfect marrage) dullblade and dull razor.  wieshi is a toy</li>
            <li> Out of all the purchases I&#x27;ve made on Amazon this is BY FAR the worst.  Product that arrived was not even the published brand.  Simply trying to twist close the razor made one of the guards fall off.  Blue container was cracked and brush was not packaged in the sleeve shown.  Extremely disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> product as described and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I gave the &amp;#34;Weishi 9306-F Twist to Open Double Edge Safety Razor&amp;#34; 4 stars instead of five only because it just arrived yesterday and I&#x27;ve only used it once so far.  I just don&#x27;t have enough experience and usage history with it to give it five stars.  However, I can say that it gave me the best shave I have had in many a year.  To put that in perspective, I have been using [cheap] disposable razors all those years, so I am comparing the Weishi 9306-F results to the disposables results.  I have medium or average facial hair in density and coarseness, if that is a relevant factor.  I used one of the five blades included with the razor.  That said, I was delighted from the very first stroke.  It was smoother and more comfortable than a new disposable razor, with no nicks or razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $12.30, I consider it to be a real bargain.  That is not to say I recommend it over other, more expensive double edge razors.  I don&#x27;t have the experience with any others and thus have no basis for such a recommendation.  But I will say this:  if you have never used a double edge razor before and want to try one, this is a good one to start with.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap razor and i comes with a travel case, blades and brush for cleaning it. I didnt test it yet but if something goes wrong i will probable update the review</li>
            <li> Not a fan and it almost ruined my first wet shave experience. I&#x27;m not getting that baby smooth shave that was promised with these razors. Next time I&#x27;ll spend $30 on a good Merkur or Edwin Jagger. However, buying new blades helped a little. I&#x27;m not getting cut anymore by those crappy Dorco blades that came with it. The butterfly opening makes it easy to change blades and clean. Avoid cheap safety razors and get a trusted brand</li>
            <li> Not a bad entry level safety razor. A cheap, but well made razor. Just wish it were a bit more aggressive.</li>
            <li> I recently discovered double edge wet shaving and decided to give it a try. (My standard razor is the 5 blade Gillette Fusion ProGlide). I wanted to go with a cheap option, just in case I disliked the experience. After using this razor once, I am completely hooked on double edge wet shaving, and I have already bought some more, higher quality equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shipped out of Virginia, and living in NC it arrived an entire week before the estimated date. The manufacturer even included an additional 5 astra blades as well as the marketed 5 dorco blades. It all comes in a convenient little plastic travel box, therefore I&#x27;ll make this my travel set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about trying double edge wet shaving, I couldn&#x27;t recommend this product any more. I also suggest watching some tutorial videos on the art of wet shaving.</li>
            <li> The mirror is a bit small, and it could use a razor safe, but the razor is heavy and doesn&#x27;t rust quickly. It&#x27;s perfect. I&#x27;ll stick with this one for a long time.</li>
            <li> Best investment I&#x27;ve made in a long time, Never liked the multiple blade concept, they may shave close but they will not trim around the upper lip to shape or maintain a  mustache, just to mention I have gotten 7 clean shaves with this razor/Blade combo. And still more to be expected, very good quality.</li>
            <li> not that good or a quality</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor after reading some of the other reviews, some great, some not so great.  I already have a Lord L6 and like many others enjoy DE shaving because it is cost effective and more interesting than disposables or electrics.  I have a couple of blade sampler packs and enjoy trying out different blades.  I had relatively low expectations from the Weishi given some of the reviews saying it was not very aggressive.  I like the idea of a TTO razor and wanted to try one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all know we can go out there and buy a decent DE razor in the $30.00 and up category. I like to think buying DE razors is like buying wine.  Anyone can buy a decent bottle of wine for $30.00, getting a decent bottle of wine for $12.00 is a bit more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So is the Weishi a decent DE razor for about $12.00?  I think it is.  The example I received in gleaming chrome finish seemed close to flawless and the TTO mechanism worked well.  Yes it rattles a bit.  In this sub $15.00 price range I would not expect anything to be built army tough and survive any abuse.  It wouldn’t, and neither would my Lord L6.  If you tap these razors or drop them on hard surfaces, or crank the handles or twist mechanisms down hard you will very quickly find out that these are simply extended life disposables.  It is early days yet but it looks to me like the Weishi will last a while if treated reasonably gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it shave?  I expected a very very mild (non aggressive) shave from this razor based on the other reviews but discovered that if you find the razors sweet spot, which I found easy to do, it shaved very well.  Much better than expected and perhaps even better than the Lord L6 which I find quite mild.  I loaded a Lord Stainless blade in the Weishi because the other reviewers pretty much universally condemned the Dorco blades that come with it.  I found the razor to feel light, it feels lighter than the Lord L6 which has a hefty head, but certainly can be used without applying any significant pressure.  The handle is short, but I get finer control over the blade angle with DE shaving by holding the handle closer to the head anyway.  The handle provides a good grip.  A longer handle might be nice but is not critical. On the other hand the razor is compact and comes with a nice easy to pack and compact case.  Overall I like the form factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously your mileage may vary but for a razor in the sub $15.00 price range I found the Weishi very acceptable and good value.  I got a smooth shave on both my face and my head, no nicks.  So far I am very happy with the purchase.  At some point I will buy a $30.00 and up DE razor.  Obviously my expectations will double commensurate with the price.  As always, I reserve the right to revise this review.</li>
            <li> very cheaply made! the one that I got is a completely different brand than what it says on the listing, it&#x27;s a knock off. it says its supposed to be made out of brass but its not its very very cheaply made very thin it feels like if you are a little bit rough with it that it will break. I bought one of these razors from a brick and mortar store and it was a different brand from this one but it was well constructed it is very heavy duty it works beautifully the shave is amazing so if you&#x27;re wanting to get this type of razor it&#x27;s definitely recommended but I would not recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Poor quality. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> same as i had in army 50 yrs ago no more crappy disposables</li>
            <li> Would like it better if the handle were longer.  You do get a real nice clean shave with this razor and much more economical to use.</li>
            <li> My husband was very happy with this razor he had been complaining about how the other razors don&#x27;t get his beard really close and this does</li>
            <li> Great shaver for the price. Received on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.  It&#x27;s smooth functioning, and has good weight.  I&#x27;m using Derby blades in mine, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I should point out that this is my first DE (double edge) razor, so I can&#x27;t compare it to a Merkur or vintage Gillete, because I haven&#x27;t used them.  Also, I don&#x27;t shave my face - I shave my head, but I figure as this works really well on my skull, it should be fine on your face:)  I&#x27;ve read often that this is a good razor for those of us just getting started with a DE for the first time, and I find it to be perfectly true.</li>
            <li> Love my new retro razor. Why did have to change to the new Razors?&lt;br /&gt;The Retro Razor works Great and I can get replacement blades so cheep.</li>
            <li> it is cheaply made and the handle is to short.</li>
            <li> Good product. Not a Gillette quality, but seems to be a good working product. I got this to save on the % blade cost product and so far I am achieving that goal.</li>
            <li> Much better then the disposable. Easy put away case makes my bath room counter stay clutter free.</li>
            <li> Weishi 9306-F and a Astra SP, what a nice shave!</li>
            <li> Blades were not that great, but, the razor is excellent!</li>
            <li> I used to use a Gillette adjustable double edge razor. I was trying to find a comparable product, but this razor is not it! This razor is nothing but a bubble gum machine razor compared to my old Gillette.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always subscribed to the &#x27;first blade lifts the whisker&#x27; theory as presented by Gilette.  I was looking for the day of six blades running across my face giving me an even closer shave than five.  How could a single blade ever give me a close shave?  Well, what got me thinking was the fact that closest shave I&#x27;d ever had was in a barber chair with a straight razor.  I saw the commercial with the the bald guy from the pawn store show pitching the Micro Touch and started doing some research online.  I discovered the Weishi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was at first impressed with how quickly it arrived. Shipping from China, I expected a several-week transit time.  However, the package arrived about 9 days after placing the order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening the package, I was pleased to feel the weight of the product.  It has substantial weight and the quality seems to be very good.  I have heard other reviewers caution against treating it too rough, so I have handled it very gingerly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note of importance, I am confident that most of the poor reviews are from those who have improperly handled the shaver.  It took me about 3-4 days to get onto it, but my results now are incredible. I use Cremo shaving cream, which I also recommend, and I do not use the blades (Ying JiLi)  that come with the shaver.  I bought a 5[pack of Dorco blades, which seem to work fine.  I will probably purchase them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product with a good price to value.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my new Weishi double edge razor for about a month, from day one i knew i no longer will have to buy expensive blades ever again! My morning shave is a comfortable, smooth, enjoyable experience. I wonder why it took all these years to give it a try!</li>
            <li> I have used all types of shavers over my life, most of then were single use shavers . But now I have something more permanent that will last a life time .</li>
            <li> Good Tool. The blades that come with it are pretty cheap. They say stainless but somehow they still rust like high carbon steel. After you replace the cheap blades, the razor works really well.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver! Honestly the best one I have boughten so far, you may think twice because of the price but it&#x27;s identical to Microtouch One Razor just a better price. I bought this one for myself and the Microtouch for my father and honestly you can&#x27;t tell the difference. I love it</li>
            <li> Feels like your pulling all the hair out of your face rather then shaving. Have to repeatedly go over areas to get all the hair</li>
            <li> NICK FREE, GREAT CONTROL</li>
            <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s a cheap piece of junk but it works. I would guess if I used it every day it would last 3-4 months before the mechanism broke.&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s the same razor as the one that Pawn Stars guy was hawking but for a whole lot less cash.&lt;br /&gt;If you just want to try safety razor shaving without spending much, this is not a bad buy.</li>
            <li> This is the SAME razor &amp;#34;as seen on TV.&amp;#34; And for $10 less. Works just fine and blades are 10/$1 if you look around. Good bye $10, $20, $30+ packs of razors.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this razor worked well for me. It came with the st300 dorco razorblades. I&#x27;ve tried 5 or 6 brands and these dorco are great for my sensitive skin. I never cut myself or get razorburn. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, it may not be aggressive enough for you. It has a nice butterfly open mechanism where as other brands I&#x27;ve seen come completely apart to change blades.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was how short the handle is, but looks like what my dad used 50 yrs ago :) Solid built!!</li>
            <li> Delivered fast. Quality was pretty good. Better quality than expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Good quality, travel case and sample &amp;#34;Dorco&amp;#34; brand(Korean) blades.  The kit is simple, yet functional.  This is my first DE(double edge) razor, and in about a month, I love it.  Not a bad choice.  No cuts, well balanced, simplistic and yet functional.  I am beginner at the DE razor, and I am confident I will stick to them.  There are several reasons, as others point out...  they are very economic.  The replacement blades are economical as well.  I&#x27;ve calculated, with this kit, and a set of 100 replacement blades, I would be set for close to two years worth of shaving with the razor and blades for not more than $30!!!!  And still get a real close and durable shave.  I&#x27;ve read a lot of people(men and women) are making the move to these.  Go ahead and give it a try!!!!  It&#x27;s a small investment and one that is likely to save you a lot of $$ over time, all while you are satisfied with a very old and simplistic way of shaving!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several ways to shave, it takes a bit of time, you will not be dissapointed.  Select the shaving cream you are happy with, and go a it.  Dispose of the old blades in an empty beer or soda can.  Recycle them after a while.  It&#x27;s all a good deal, no plastic waste!!!!  If you chose, you can move on to other more fancy razors.  I am happy with the Weishi 9306-F.  It comes with a handy travel kit.</li>
            <li> Less expensive that the MicroTouch One razor. They both look to be manufactured by the same company. The shave is O.K. and not very aggressive. It is ideal for the first time double edged safety razor shaver.</li>
            <li> handle is on the small size, but overall I love it. it comes with a mirrored case and razor brush to clean the razor. more cost effective than those plastic razors.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well and definitely made for TINY hands...it would do in a real pinch, but otherwise would just chuck it in the F-it bucket! (NOT SELLER&#x27;S FAULT!!!)</li>
