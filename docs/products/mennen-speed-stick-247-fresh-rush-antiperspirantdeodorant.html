            <li>This is a great way to save money!</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, this is the best deodorant I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just perfect, and works as advertised.</li>
            <li>These deodorants are very good.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
            <li>Great amount for the price, all the containers are sealed and it came as described.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great value for the bulk price.</li>
            <li>It also doesnt smell that great.</li>
            <li>Has a great scent and works well.</li>
            <li>I honestly fear the day Speed Stick stops making this line!</li>
            <li>good product</li>
            <li>This is an exceptional product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this exclusively for 3~4 years now, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>They smell great and go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Been using if for 5 or more years</li>
            <li>Not as easy to find as it once was, love that I can find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Works great, and does last all day.  </li>
            <li>Was pleased to find this exact product online.</li>
            <li>I have, however, found this to be the case with most antiperspirants/deodorant combos, and not a fault of this brand in particular.</li>
            <li>)It goes on smoothly and lasts a full day, regardless of how much I sweat.</li>
            <li>Keeps you completely fresh 24/7.</li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>These are exactly the same as the store bought ones, but a much better value.  </li>
            <li>Most do not last all day for me, so I will continue to use this product.  </li>
            <li>Originally I was looking for a different smell of this same product (Cool Fusion) but the cheaper priced ones were no longer available.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what was advertised and what I wanted plus the shipment was fast.</li>
            <li>This stick is purely a marketing ploy.</li>
            <li>Much easier ordering online than trying to locate in the store.</li>
            <li>Unlike so many other deodorants it does not overwhelm the wearer with a bathed in cologne type smell(looking at you Axe...</li>
            <li>No residue or irritation from daily use and works consistently.</li>
            <li>It also goes on completely clear, which Dove Clear claims to do, but actually doesn&#x27;t, and it definitely doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.</li>
            <li>It was what I expected and I highly recommend</li>

            <li> I have trouble finding this in local stores near me.  </li>
            <li> The only minor gripe I have is that it can stain your clothing if you&#x27;re sweating heavily and it comes in direct contact with a dress shirt for a prolonged period of time.</li>

            <li> Completely ruined, I&#x27;m so pissed about this, but at least I can tell you all to avoid, avoid, avoid this product.</li>
            <li> No real reflection on the seller nor Amazon, I just didn&#x27;t pay close attention when reading the product details.</li>
            <li> Other Mennen products and other brands irritate and burn me.</li>
            <li> However I was naive as just the presence of Aluminum Zirconium (which causes yellow stains) should have been the warning.  </li>
            <li> leave black stains on shirts - greasy or something</li>
            <li> It does have too much perfume like other deodorants that drive me crazy, and it completely takes away the sweating and the bad smells.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of custom shirts, so when they were all dirty I sent them to the dry cleaner.</li>
            <li> I used to have dove and secret deodorants.</li>
            <li> Sad they discontinued.</li>
            <li> Unable to find anymore in stores/drugstores/groceries.</li>
            <li> Dove and secret are really bad at that.</li>
            <li> After ruining 4 shirts, I am very disappointed.</li>

            <li> This stick is purely a marketing ploy. I used it thinking it will help pit stains away and keep the sweat at bay. However I was naive as just the presence of Aluminum Zirconium (which causes yellow stains) should have been the warning.  I can&#x27;t believe they would sell this product as something it isn&#x27;t. After ruining 4 shirts, I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Sad they discontinued. good product</li>
            <li> These deodorants are very good.  They smell great and go on smoothly.  I don&#x27;t feel that they last quite as long as I&#x27;d like.  Originally I was looking for a different smell of this same product (Cool Fusion) but the cheaper priced ones were no longer available.  These were my 2nd choice and I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
            <li> Great amount for the price, all the containers are sealed and it came as described. This is a great way to save money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I like the scent and how it works. Not as easy to find as it once was, love that I can find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The product probably does work, however, I&#x27;m not a fan of this type of deodorant.  By the end of the day clothing has powder residue on it from the stick.  I&#x27;ve tried this version of the Speed Stick before but didn&#x27;t like it.  I returned this item because I thought I was ordering the Gel version.  No real reflection on the seller nor Amazon, I just didn&#x27;t pay close attention when reading the product details.</li>
            <li> It is the ONLY deodorant we use in this household and for some reason I could not find it for three weeks in any local store, thank you amazon for stocking this  this product!</li>
            <li> Great product. No residue or irritation from daily use and works consistently. Great value for the bulk price.</li>
            <li> After doing some research, I found that by ordering a pack of 6 of these Speed Sticks, I would save over a dollar per stick compared to buying single ones from the grocery store on an as needed basis.  These are exactly the same as the store bought ones, but a much better value.  I will continue buying them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not to keen on this product.</li>
            <li> Was pleased to find this exact product online. Unable to find anymore in stores/drugstores/groceries. Other Mennen products and other brands irritate and burn me. Don&#x27;t know why but they do. Don&#x27;t know if Mennen has decided to discontinue or why it is unavailable retail.&lt;br /&gt;Product was as described and arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding this in local stores near me.  Works great, and does last all day.  Most do not last all day for me, so I will continue to use this product.  Been using if for 5 or more years</li>
            <li> I used to have dove and secret deodorants. Then, they were giving out samples of these at my university one day and I decided to try it. I&#x27;m a girl so thankfully the guy smell does not leave my underarms unless someone actually lifts my arm and smells it. Nevertheless, this is the best deodorant I have ever tried. It does have too much perfume like other deodorants that drive me crazy, and it completely takes away the sweating and the bad smells. It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or clump and cake on my underarm. Dove and secret are really bad at that. It also goes on completely clear, which Dove Clear claims to do, but actually doesn&#x27;t, and it definitely doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes. It&#x27;s just perfect, and works as advertised. Keeps you completely fresh 24/7.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to say that from my experience with other deodorants that claim to last 24/7, this one did not. It also doesnt smell that great. The price was right but I guess I will not use this product if I am working.</li>
            <li> So I got this deodorant. Then I used it for a while. I have a lot of custom shirts, so when they were all dirty I sent them to the dry cleaner. They came back with BLACK armpits. Completely ruined, I&#x27;m so pissed about this, but at least I can tell you all to avoid, avoid, avoid this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this exclusively for 3~4 years now, and I absolutely love it! Unlike so many other deodorants it does not overwhelm the wearer with a bathed in cologne type smell(looking at you Axe...)It goes on smoothly and lasts a full day, regardless of how much I sweat. The only minor gripe I have is that it can stain your clothing if you&#x27;re sweating heavily and it comes in direct contact with a dress shirt for a prolonged period of time. I have, however, found this to be the case with most antiperspirants/deodorant combos, and not a fault of this brand in particular. I honestly fear the day Speed Stick stops making this line!</li>
            <li> It was what I expected and I highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional product. It is exactly what was advertised and what I wanted plus the shipment was fast. Much easier ordering online than trying to locate in the store. I will be a return customer.</li>
            <li> leave black stains on shirts - greasy or something</li>
            <li> Has a great scent and works well. Except for the staining of shirts in the underarm area. With that said its still my fav deodorant</li>
