            <li>They don&#x27;t feel cheap at all.</li>
            <li>i used this item to make lip balm cases for christmas gifts for my family members , as stocking stuffers worked out great for this and was well pleased for the price and was easy to open for older family members.</li>
            <li>What makes them even better is that they are very sturdy, and re-useable!  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used these for the original idea, but instead for samples.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was quick and product was quality.  </li>
            <li>If you want quality and quick shipping...</li>
            <li>The lid stays on tight and is great to carry around in your purse.  </li>
            <li>I got these to hold sample size baggies of loose eyeshadow from indie makeup companies, and they&#x27;re perfect.  </li>

            <li>They aren&#x27;t super high quality jars, but that&#x27;s not what I need, or paid for.  </li>
            <li>I love these mini professional looking containers, it&#x27;s handy, compact and smell proof, I even drilled a tiny hole in some of &#x27;em for the fuse and made tiny cracker-bombs which looked professional and so cool and actually VERY LOUD!!!</li>
            <li>I have dropped them on cement, rock, and grass from pretty high up</li>

            <li>Overall containers are tough and good.</li>
            <li>Clear</li>
            <li>We had been using white jars but the clear allows for a visual of the product color.</li>

            <li> The only downfall was in the packaging as one came broken.</li>
            <li> not huge</li>
            <li> The containers are on the small side but worked well for my purpose.</li>
            <li> Weather you want to hand out sample of your homemade creations or you want to store eye shadow or even small seed beads, these containers are for you!  </li>
            <li> I bought these with the purpose of traveling with them, instead I ended up with waste of my expensive foundation which spilled all over my makeup bag, makeup tools and extended products.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased these to put in smaller quantities of make-up and similiar type products and these work well.  They are pretty small so keep that in mind if ordering.</li>
            <li> I love these containers! They come in handy for any and everything I need. I always keep them handy. What makes them even better is that they are very sturdy, and re-useable!  Fast, cheap, and awesome.</li>
            <li> Packaged well and great little containers.  Very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the item sent did not meet the size quoted on the product originally.  I use these jars all the time for lip balm and would have loved to keep them but could not.</li>
            <li> These little pots are as described, they arrived quickly, they are a good price.  I&#x27;m using them for lip balms, working great!</li>
            <li> BHO, erl, 710, shatter..... an ok container for such a treat.&lt;br /&gt;The price is right, I haven&#x27;t broken one yet</li>
            <li> I use this product was a sample or for my make up powder.  I have so many sample, this was great to use.</li>
            <li> I use these containers to make llip gloss with my girls and they were perfect!!! I would definitely order these again!</li>
            <li> I made some lip balm for my friends for Christmas, and these containers were perfect for what I needed.  I received lots of compliments on the &amp;#34;cuteness&amp;#34; of the containers.  I ordered two sets, so I had plenty to go around.  I still have enough left to give out to friends.  I recommend these to anyone who wants to make lip balm.  The lid stays on tight and is great to carry around in your purse.  These would be really great to use for lotions, make-up or even toothpaste, if you don&#x27;t want to take the whole tube with you.</li>
            <li> I got these to hold sample size baggies of loose eyeshadow from indie makeup companies, and they&#x27;re perfect.  I also use them to store lip gloss that I mix myself.  They aren&#x27;t super high quality jars, but that&#x27;s not what I need, or paid for.  The reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5 is the tops can unscrew themselves if they aren&#x27;t being stored flat.  I used to store them in a hanging makeup bag, so they&#x27;d get tossed around a bit.  While none of them spilled open, I did have to check and re-tighten them once in a while.  For this reason I don&#x27;t recommend using them for any sort of travel.  But for storing them flat, they&#x27;re just fine.  I will buy these again if and when I need more.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used these for the original idea, but instead for samples.  They work out great for that as I am sure the will for the make up.  Packed and shipped well.</li>
            <li> loved the price for how many u get keep in mind there not huge it store enough colored mixed powder acrylic for 3 different(30 individule)sets of nails when filled to the top amazing closed tight no leaks loved it</li>
            <li> Ad said each container came with a black ringlike magnet. Containers came with a tiny makeup sample. Overall containers are tough and good.</li>
            <li> Weather you want to hand out sample of your homemade creations or you want to store eye shadow or even small seed beads, these containers are for you!  Clear so y can see right inside to what is being stored.  So versatile!</li>
            <li> Will be perfect for distributing my sample cosmetics.  I will be using them to distribute sample creams, pastes and powders.</li>
            <li> I used these to hold lip balm that I made with my students.  The containers are on the small side but worked well for my purpose.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described. The jars closed well and don&#x27;t leak. We had been using white jars but the clear allows for a visual of the product color.</li>
            <li> The product met all my expectations. We have already ordered a second set. The only downfall was in the packaging as one came broken.</li>
            <li> I know it probably my fault for not checking the size info closely enough. The jars are really tiny and I don&#x27;t think they could hold anything at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this for an activity I as doing. A DIY lip gloss activity. They were great. Most of my girls still have their lip gloss and still use it! They shipped super fast as well. These containers were beyond perfection.</li>
            <li> These are very easy to fill and use.  I would have loved to have labels that came with it instead of having to create my own.</li>
            <li> i used this item to make lip balm cases for christmas gifts for my family members , as stocking stuffers worked out great for this and was well pleased for the price and was easy to open for older family members. will reorder again .</li>
            <li> Thought it was great! It was a great price and I got it before I needed them! Thanks! A great buy</li>
            <li> Perfect size for lip balm</li>
            <li> Perfect for make up powders. The packaging was a little less orthodox, usps envelopes taped together with all the containers inside.</li>
            <li> These containers work well if you DO NOT INTEND TO TRAVEL WITH THEM.  I bought these with the purpose of traveling with them, instead I ended up with waste of my expensive foundation which spilled all over my makeup bag, makeup tools and extended products.  If they will sit still on a counter - then i recommend them, if not -- - - I DO NOT RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> I love these mini professional looking containers, it&#x27;s handy, compact and smell proof, I even drilled a tiny hole in some of &#x27;em for the fuse and made tiny cracker-bombs which looked professional and so cool and actually VERY LOUD!!!</li>
            <li> These are a perfect size to keep lotions, etc. I do not recommend keeping straight liquid - they will leak.  But for creams, etc, they are great.  They are remarkably durable - I have dropped them on cement, rock, and grass from pretty high up and they haven&#x27;t cracked.  They screw on and off easily.  If they could hold liquid I&#x27;d say they were absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> I make homemade lip balm and these containers perfectly fit my needs for quality, size and price. Excellent deal!! Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my purchase.. These turned out to be the perfect size for what I wanted to do with them.&lt;br /&gt;I also used these jars to store my homemade lipsticks!!!</li>
            <li> The shipping was super quick and the little containers are sooo cute! They don&#x27;t feel cheap at all. The lids screw on nicely. I was hesitant about buying these at first because there were no reviews but I love these! I shall be making lipstick pots with these :) They are also lovely little containers if you want to put some Tylenol or moisturizer in on the go instead of grabbing the huge bottle.</li>
            <li> With the TSA restrictions, these are ideal!!  I totally LOVE these.  The shipping was quick and product was quality.  If you want quality and quick shipping...THIS is the one to buy.</li>
