    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product for break outs!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month and I absolutely love this cleanser! It is not overly drying and does not strip my skin. I use it twice daily, by itself in the morning and with my clarisonic at night. I also have been using the purifying toner and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and this is the only face wash that removes my make up and keeps my skin clear. I recommend using this face wash with the Skin Medica toner.</li>
            <li> the skin medica purifying foaming wash, this is a product that helps keep the skin clean, purified, is easy to use, and the results are quickly</li>
            <li> Dr. recommended this wash to my wife to treat her adult acne and now I&#x27;m stuck with this bill.</li>
            <li> AFTER USING THIS MY SKIN FEELS SO SKIN. IT IS THE ONLY WASH I CAN USE THAT DOES NOT IRRITATE MY FACE.</li>
            <li> I used proactiv for years but it had stopped working.  After seeing a dermatologist for occasional breakouts he recommended this product (I was skeptical as his office sold it and I figured it was for his financial gains he recommended it - which could be true as well) and nothing else (no meds, etc..).  For the past year I have had amazing success with the face wash, toner and moisturizing lotion.  Finally something I love.</li>
            <li> I love all things Skin Medica, and this did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Great! Love this item. shipping was fast. great item</li>
            <li> Is nice for oily skin...</li>
            <li> Great cleanser. It really works. I been using it for 2 months already and all my acne is almost gone just few acne scars left, but i have notice a huge difference on my skin. I totally recommend this product to all those people with severe acne and that have try everything and nothing have work out.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Been using for years. Happy that I have the ability to order on Amazon because it makes it so convenient.</li>
            <li> works great for acne problems</li>
            <li> I like this product and love the Amazon price! I will be back for more! it&#x27;s less expensive than the doctor&#x27;s office!</li>
            <li> I love the way this cleans my skin without stripping it!!!</li>
            <li> as described shipped fast no problems would ude again good good good good good good good good good good good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the last year, and it is a bit pricey, however, a bottle will last me a good 6 months.  I use one pump per wash, and that does the trick.  I&#x27;ve used some cheaper foaming face washes, and this one just feels thicker and more &#x27;expensive&#x27;.  It&#x27;s done wonders for my middle-aged acne, and I can say that my skin has never looked better!  Worth the premium price, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Skin Medica foaming face wash and the entire acne care system is the best. I have tried several things, so many. You have to stick with it, but it absolutely works!</li>
            <li> The Skin Medica Purifying Foaming Face Wash is GREAT! I get occasional break outs that have been dramatically reduced since I started using this was about two months ago. If you have combo skin and sometimes get breakouts I recommend this wash.</li>
            <li> I love skin medica!!! The products are great and not over drying. I no longer have to see a dermatologist or use any prescription medications. It has been amazing!</li>
            <li> I will purchase this item again when I run out. It immediately cleared up my skin and I love it.</li>
            <li> I like it but unfortunately it dried my skin out a lot. Maybe it has something to do with the cold weather, but I can&#x27;t use it at as much now.</li>
            <li> My father works for a dermatologist, so I get a lot of Skin Medica products from there. But I highly recommend this brand. I have used their toner, wash, and retinols and my skin is the best it&#x27;s been. Super great product. You sort of have to commit to the &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; (wash, toner, exfoliatant, treatment) but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Best face wash I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Seem to be clearing some of my acne but also made my skin very dry and tight after use. Skin is flaking now too. Think I probably can&#x27;t use it daily.</li>
            <li> Love this facial wash!!</li>
