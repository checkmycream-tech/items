            <li>nice product and</li>
            <li>Not as foamy as I would like, but the product is NOT drying so it is nice to use.  </li>
            <li>I have t-zone and this is by far the best cleanser I have used.  </li>
            <li>and very cheap.</li>
            <li>I love this face wash...using it for 6 years...</li>
            <li>I love this face wash.</li>
            <li>This product is supposed to be for oily skin, which I do have, but it&#x27;s made my skin even more oily</li>
            <li>What made her glad was that even her eye liner was removed without leaving any telltales.</li>
            <li>I love Olay and</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best face wash I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>I love at the end of the day it removes all the makeup from your face.</li>
            <li>Seems to keep my face nice and clean without drying my skin out.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh clean smell, lathers perfectly, and has a great thick creamy texture.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was easy to find in stores.</li>
            <li>I love Olay, and this product is my new favorite!</li>
            <li>worked fine on her skin.</li>
            <li>This item arrived super fast and in good condtion.  </li>
            <li>This played a HUGE part in solving my acne.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for facial cleaning in the shower.  </li>
            <li>and 2) is it oil free?</li>
            <li>cheap, truly cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great quality product, gentle on skin, cleanses the face nicely and you get a lot for what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I have even used it to clean makeup brushes and it works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it will leave your face refreshingly clean.</li>
            <li>It removes all my makeup and has my face feeling so clean.</li>
            <li>but i like a clean face to.</li>
            <li>I have very stubborn skin and its very sensitive but this stuff makes my face clear and wonderful!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t notice anything special about it.  </li>
            <li>Have noticed the difference in my skin use as a basic nightly face wash and have good results.</li>
            <li>It was priced reasonably that i couldnt help myself from ordering more..</li>
            <li>Good enough</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of like a creamy texture which I don&#x27;t like much as a face wash.</li>
            <li>What really brought acne to its knees was my realization that it&#x27;s an infection, just like so many of the ailments of our body.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice creamy feeling, and lathers quite nicely with just a little bit of water.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and this leaves my face looking and feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Ive used this same face soap for more than 5 years now, nothing works better?</li>
            <li>I got the product quickly</li>
            <li>Lucky, this one works well for me</li>
            <li>I have been using it for many months now and is definitely the most effective face wash I have personally used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so gentle on my skin as well, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fresh and the smell lingers in my room all night.</li>
            <li>Most importantly - stay vigilant, there is no one solution, our faces are all different.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to have an issue with it drying out my skin, which is something that happens fairly often with other face washes I have used.</li>
            <li>this product is something which won my heart right away.</li>
            <li>This is powerful yet gentle Olay cleanser and washes away impurities, and leaves skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>Also, the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Clean &amp; Clear Anti-Shine is much better and worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve started to break out all over for the first time in over a decade.</li>
            <li>I have to do a 2 step cleansing, first with an exfoliating face wipe, then washing with this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I like it, despite the fact this is more a women&#x27;s facial product.  </li>
            <li>so it can&#x27;t spread consistently.  </li>
            <li>It is refreshing to not have to worry about acne because I&#x27;ve finally found the product that works.  </li>
            <li>This product works really well for me!</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and have tried cleansers and scrubs from St. Ives, Clean &amp; Clear, Neutrogena,</li>
            <li>I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 only because it is not so good at getting eye make-up off that regular soap wouldn&#x27;t have too much difficulty with.</li>
            <li>This cleanser really removes all dirt, oil, and makeup with just one wash.</li>
            <li>I have oily combination skin and really like this product have been using for some time now.</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s because this product takes so much moisture out because this is for oily skin and</li>
            <li>Two things I focus on when considering face wash are 1) is it gentle on my face?</li>
            <li>These were very reasonnably priced.  </li>
            <li>very economic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Its gentle on my skin, clears up makeup well, and my husband has faith that it cleared up his skin (though I doubt this, considering its not meant for that and hasn&#x27;t done anything for my flaws).</li>
            <li>The reason I didn&#x27;t like it that much is my fascination for gel face washes.</li>
            <li>Good for in the shower, only problem is that to me it smells a little funny.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because I feel like there are other better cleansers out there for oily combo</li>
            <li>For the price, there is no complaint!</li>
            <li>but this new batch I received is the same as it used to be, very nice foam and less oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On its own, it&#x27;s not very effective at dissolving make up.</li>
            <li>It was the only thing that got my face clean without overdrying and it helped with my acne.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very mild soap, won&#x27;t dry out your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works well very soapy leaves face dry and smooth.</li>
            <li>Generates enough lather with slight application and feels refreshing and clean after each application.</li>
            <li>this is the only face wash so far that is cheap that really clears my skin .....</li>
            <li>Cleanses effectively and despite the fact that I have combination skin, but it does not make my skin very dry, although I do require a moisturizer later.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth and does not make it dry.</li>
            <li>I still had some of the older product and ordered this one.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but I have started using Cetaphil now because of high sensitivity.</li>
            <li>First, it takes very little at a time to wash my entire face and neck, which is nice as you get a lot for your money that way.</li>
            <li>My wife always longed for a face wash that not only cleanses her face but also keeps her fresh.</li>
            <li>just a normal face wash.</li>
            <li>I was a bit leary on the new look, but got it anyway.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous face washes to achieve the foamy effect, first of all.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that this is only a cleanser, so your zits and dark spots won&#x27;t magically disappear.</li>
            <li>I have used another Olay face fash in past and they were far better.</li>
            <li>Either way, I won&#x27;t say it has done something better for me, but it definitely hasn&#x27;t done anything negative like many other cleansers have.</li>
            <li>I used it on my face and it started to burn whereas the old one does not burn at all</li>
            <li>Cannot use sensitive skin makes me break out and does not have witch hazel in it either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s foamy and very efficient at removing facial oil.</li>
            <li>no issue with it, I have use nothing else for this brand, and have used about 4 of them so far.</li>
            <li>I use this in the shower nearly every day.</li>
            <li>If this stuff goes near your eyes, you are a goner.  </li>
            <li>It removes make up; brightens skin and that clean hydrated feeling even in worst winters is incredible.</li>
            <li>I uses this product when I took a  shower everyday to clean my oily face.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling clean without the dried out feeling.</li>
            <li>Ever since I bought this casually on a deal, though I initially thought this would just sit in the bathroom rarely used, I am actually washing my face more often after returning home from sultry outside weather.</li>
            <li>and it was much cheaper than all the other options.</li>
            <li>Though I didn&#x27;t like this face wash quite as much as I like other Olay products, I would still rate it as 4 because of</li>
            <li>It does not leave any residue on the face, but does not dry out your skin either.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my face after use.</li>
            <li>This one from Olay doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive areas but still cleans the oily parts of my face.</li>
            <li>A little of it cleans all the oil from the face and it makes your skin look dry and fresh again.</li>
            <li>I have trouble with large pores on my nose.  </li>
            <li>The product is now less foamy, less scented and feels more oily than the previous version.</li>

            <li> I still had some of the older product and ordered this one.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> but I have started using Cetaphil now because of high sensitivity.</li>
            <li> First, it takes very little at a time to wash my entire face and neck, which is nice as you get a lot for your money that way.</li>
            <li> My wife always longed for a face wash that not only cleanses her face but also keeps her fresh.</li>
            <li> just a normal face wash.</li>
            <li> I was a bit leary on the new look, but got it anyway.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous face washes to achieve the foamy effect, first of all.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that this is only a cleanser, so your zits and dark spots won&#x27;t magically disappear.</li>
            <li> I have used another Olay face fash in past and they were far better.</li>
            <li> Either way, I won&#x27;t say it has done something better for me, but it definitely hasn&#x27;t done anything negative like many other cleansers have.</li>
            <li> I used it on my face and it started to burn whereas the old one does not burn at all</li>
            <li> Cannot use sensitive skin makes me break out and does not have witch hazel in it either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s foamy and very efficient at removing facial oil.</li>
            <li> no issue with it, I have use nothing else for this brand, and have used about 4 of them so far.</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower nearly every day.</li>
            <li> If this stuff goes near your eyes, you are a goner.  </li>
            <li> It removes make up; brightens skin and that clean hydrated feeling even in worst winters is incredible.</li>
            <li> I uses this product when I took a  shower everyday to clean my oily face.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling clean without the dried out feeling.</li>
            <li> Ever since I bought this casually on a deal, though I initially thought this would just sit in the bathroom rarely used, I am actually washing my face more often after returning home from sultry outside weather.</li>
            <li> and it was much cheaper than all the other options.</li>
            <li> Though I didn&#x27;t like this face wash quite as much as I like other Olay products, I would still rate it as 4 because of</li>
            <li> It does not leave any residue on the face, but does not dry out your skin either.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my face after use.</li>
            <li> This one from Olay doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive areas but still cleans the oily parts of my face.</li>
            <li> A little of it cleans all the oil from the face and it makes your skin look dry and fresh again.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with large pores on my nose.  </li>
            <li> The product is now less foamy, less scented and feels more oily than the previous version.</li>
            <li> I am a 24-year old active male and this is my daily face wash that I use while showering.</li>
            <li> I noticed that washing with this face wash doesn&#x27;t completely break down my foundation.</li>
            <li> This is the only face wash that cleans my skin and doesn&#x27;t over dry.  </li>
            <li> Not only does this dry skin out but after washing your face with this product it feels like something is coating your face.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and this face wash works well, especially on the dry spots.  </li>
            <li> given how long the first one lasted, I will still be using this one for at least another</li>
            <li> I think everyone with acne tries different things and everyone does something different.  </li>
            <li> The package came earlier than i expected considering i was deployed when i ordered this product.</li>
            <li> You need to treat spot infections and bring those down to a level where there is not enough open territory for it to spread.  </li>
            <li> The ziana targets the infection and kills the bacteria that cause acne and the cleanser cleans the surface of facial debris and other bacteria</li>
            <li> The two pack lasts me a very long time and the price cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> I won&#x60;t use it as a face wash, since my skin is really dry.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling moist and not oily or dry.  </li>
            <li> But a lot of them leave my cheeks dry and even flaky.</li>
            <li> She has dry skin and the oily foaming face wash</li>
            <li> Be prepared to use moisturizer after washing your face as the cleanser will leave your face extremely dry as it is a face wash for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Skin isn&#x27;t dry at the end of the day and it doesn&#x27;t leave film.  </li>
            <li> I started using this face wash as a teenager when my skin was ultra sensitive and full of painful acne.  </li>
            <li> This is the only face wash that works for me, leaves me a little dry but no break outs.  </li>
            <li> I will stick with my usual cleanser which is Biore Combination Skin Balancing cleanser which does NOT dry out skin!</li>
            <li> Within half an hour of using it, tiny little drops of oil could be seen leaking from my pores.</li>
            <li> Others leave face feeling tight and dry, this one doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I have had to wash my face up to three times before my makeup fully came off with other cleansers.</li>
            <li> I remedied this on subsequent uses by dusting my face with powder immediately after my shower, but my face still turns into an oil slick after a couple hours.</li>
            <li> This is too bad because I really did like the product before and cannot find it in  any stores all they sell is the sensitive skin one.  </li>
            <li> This product seems to help keep them cleaner and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> and it is less than 4 bucks</li>
            <li> Edit - 10/8/12: I don&#x27;t know if the previous batch was faulty or what</li>
            <li> Awful smell, also because of the blue /flesh packaging design, i expected to feel some cool or mint in this face wash.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday.</li>
            <li> Try it for a few weeks and see if it works at clearing your acne.  </li>
            <li> Bought this product a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for years and find it hard to come by.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this Olay Product!!</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t react badly with my acne topical medications.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product at a local store because I was having a bad month</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a fake product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne prone skin for the longest time, and it was bad - into my early 20&#x27;s bad.  </li>
            <li> Too bad they don&#x27;t sell this in stores commonly now!</li>
            <li> It is so painful!  </li>
            <li> Really awful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Ive used this same face soap for more than 5 years now, nothing works better? I got the product quickly</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 7yrs or so.  I still had some of the older product and ordered this one.  I was a bit leary on the new look, but got it anyway.  I used it on my face and it started to burn whereas the old one does not burn at all, I think they changed the product with the look.  This is too bad because I really did like the product before and cannot find it in  any stores all they sell is the sensitive skin one.  Cannot use sensitive skin makes me break out and does not have witch hazel in it either.</li>
            <li> Best face wash EVER!!!!! I wish it was easy to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash...using it for 6 years...</li>
            <li> I used so many face cleansers and even quite expensive ones also. this product is something which won my heart right away. It removes make up; brightens skin and that clean hydrated feeling even in worst winters is incredible. I definitely recommend this if u need all in one cleanser.</li>
            <li> This cleanser really removes all dirt, oil, and makeup with just one wash. It does not leave any residue on the face, but does not dry out your skin either. I have had to wash my face up to three times before my makeup fully came off with other cleansers. I have even used it to clean makeup brushes and it works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this Olay cleanser for anyone searching for one that removes all impurities with one wash.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Cleanses effectively and despite the fact that I have combination skin, but it does not make my skin very dry, although I do require a moisturizer later. Nevertheless, its a great for the price you pay!</li>
            <li> I have trouble with large pores on my nose.  This product seems to help keep them cleaner and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I started using this face wash as a teenager when my skin was ultra sensitive and full of painful acne.  It was the only thing that got my face clean without overdrying and it helped with my acne.  It also didn&#x27;t react badly with my acne topical medications.  I&#x27;m 30 now and just get the occasional pimple, and I still use this wash daily.  The tiniest amount gets rid of all my make up, dirt, and, well basically it takes the entire day off my face.  It has a fresh clean smell, lathers perfectly, and has a great thick creamy texture.  You&#x27;ll get a great wash whether you use it with your hands, a brush or a washcloth.  It&#x27;s just perfection in a bottle.  I hope Olay never gets rid of this face wash.  I can see myself using it  now, in my 40s, 50s, 60s and hopefully beyond!</li>
            <li> Good for in the shower, only problem is that to me it smells a little funny. But it might just be me and the smell goes away shortly after rinsing.</li>
            <li> This product is great for facial cleaning in the shower.  It&#x27;s a very mild soap, won&#x27;t dry out your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subscribe and save is a must for this product.  I used it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for years and find it hard to come by.  This is the only face wash that works for me, leaves me a little dry but no break outs.  Glad to find it here in a 2-pack!</li>
            <li> I won&#x60;t use it as a face wash, since my skin is really dry. But this soap liked cleaner is perfect for my body clean.</li>
            <li> I have oily combination skin and really like this product have been using for some time now. Have noticed the difference in my skin use as a basic nightly face wash and have good results.</li>
            <li> The package came earlier than i expected considering i was deployed when i ordered this product. It was priced reasonably that i couldnt help myself from ordering more.. kudos to the company..</li>
            <li> This is the only face wash that cleans my skin and doesn&#x27;t over dry.  It feels so nice and creamy &amp; foamy on my face.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I wanted to try it out and realized my mistake soon after! Not only does this dry skin out but after washing your face with this product it feels like something is coating your face. Maybe that&#x27;s because this product takes so much moisture out because this is for oily skin and the product is suppose to get rid of oil! I would not buy this product again or recommend this to anyone! I will stick with my usual cleanser which is Biore Combination Skin Balancing cleanser which does NOT dry out skin! That product I do recommend! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this Olay Product!! F++++++++++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biore Combination Skin Balancing cleanser&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I am a 24-year old active male and this is my daily face wash that I use while showering. Two things I focus on when considering face wash are 1) is it gentle on my face? and 2) is it oil free? This Olay face satisfies both. I have been using it for many months now and is definitely the most effective face wash I have personally used. I have yet to have an issue with it drying out my skin, which is something that happens fairly often with other face washes I have used.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling moist and not oily or dry.  Been using this for 2 years and leaves me feeling refreshed every time.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. It does not dry out my face after use. I would recommend this product to anyone who has combo skin.</li>
            <li> this is the only face wash so far that is cheap that really clears my skin .....witch hazel is also an added bonus</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a local store because I was having a bad month and it was much cheaper than all the other options. What a mistake. This product is supposed to be for oily skin, which I do have, but it&#x27;s made my skin even more oily and I&#x27;ve started to break out all over for the first time in over a decade. Within half an hour of using it, tiny little drops of oil could be seen leaking from my pores. I remedied this on subsequent uses by dusting my face with powder immediately after my shower, but my face still turns into an oil slick after a couple hours. Really awful! Clean &amp; Clear Anti-Shine is much better and worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and this face wash works well, especially on the dry spots.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> nice product and it cleans my face good.  If you clip the coupon and it is less than 4 bucks, its a good deal</li>
            <li> This is the Best face wash ever that I have used. A little of it cleans all the oil from the face and it makes your skin look dry and fresh again. You won&#x27;t regret...Go for it!!!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and have tried cleansers and scrubs from St. Ives, Clean &amp; Clear, Neutrogena, you name it. But a lot of them leave my cheeks dry and even flaky. This one from Olay doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive areas but still cleans the oily parts of my face. Keep in mind that this is only a cleanser, so your zits and dark spots won&#x27;t magically disappear. But it will leave your face refreshingly clean.</li>
            <li> My wife always longed for a face wash that not only cleanses her face but also keeps her fresh. I discovered this Olay face wash and order one for my wife.  The face wash is just the one for my wife. She has dry skin and the oily foaming face wash worked fine on her skin. It removed the last tint of her makeup, she tell s me. What made her glad was that even her eye liner was removed without leaving any telltales. The price is affordable and she uses the face wash twice every day. It is a must for her before she goes to bed. The fragrance is fresh and the smell lingers in my room all night.</li>
            <li> Oil-free. This is powerful yet gentle Olay cleanser and washes away impurities, and leaves skin feeling fresh. I uses this product when I took a  shower everyday to clean my oily face.</li>
            <li> This item arrived super fast and in good condtion.  This face wash is great and removes all my makeup. I will definitely order again. Also, the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> These were very reasonnably priced.  I love Olay and this product is great. Leaves my face feeling clean without the dried out feeling.</li>
            <li> cheap, truly cheap. Awful smell, also because of the blue /flesh packaging design, i expected to feel some cool or mint in this face wash. Nope. just a normal face wash. That&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> It cleans the face but I don&#x27;t notice anything special about it.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because I feel like there are other better cleansers out there for oily combo faces in helping with oil control.</li>
            <li> It did help with oily-ness, also it smells great. I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 only because it is not so good at getting eye make-up off that regular soap wouldn&#x27;t have too much difficulty with. Be prepared to use moisturizer after washing your face as the cleanser will leave your face extremely dry as it is a face wash for oily skin.</li>
            <li> it is a nice face wash with good price, I like olay all the time. have nothing to say yet. is this enough?</li>
            <li> I did not like the product.  I did not feel like it is cleaning.. I have used another Olay face fash in past and they were far better. Not sure if I got a fake product.</li>
            <li> I like using this foaming face wash. It removes all my makeup and has my face feeling so clean. I also use the Olay face moisturizer after cleaning.</li>
            <li> very very good. and very cheap. I use it every day. i like it. I will buy it again. ha</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s foamy and very efficient at removing facial oil. For the price, there is no complaint! I would definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I have t-zone and this is by far the best cleanser I have used.  Others leave face feeling tight and dry, this one doesn&#x27;t.  Pleasant scent as well.</li>
            <li> Im very happy with this product. Is perfect for me and&lt;br /&gt;its very economic.&lt;br /&gt;I hope received others sales like this.&lt;br /&gt;Ana Delfa Garcia</li>
            <li> I love this face wash! First, it takes very little at a time to wash my entire face and neck, which is nice as you get a lot for your money that way. It&#x27;s so gentle on my skin as well, which is a huge plus. It has a nice creamy feeling, and lathers quite nicely with just a little bit of water. I bought a two pack of these in July 2012 and am still using the last container of it...given how long the first one lasted, I will still be using this one for at least another month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great quality product, gentle on skin, cleanses the face nicely and you get a lot for what you pay for. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Good enough but I have started using Cetaphil now because of high sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I noticed that washing with this face wash doesn&#x27;t completely break down my foundation. I use Revlon Colorstay foundation and even after using this foaming wash, I see left over foundation when wiping my face. I have to do a 2 step cleansing, first with an exfoliating face wipe, then washing with this cleanser. On its own, it&#x27;s not very effective at dissolving make up.</li>
            <li> Edit - 10/8/12: I don&#x27;t know if the previous batch was faulty or what but this new batch I received is the same as it used to be, very nice foam and less oily.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years. I think recently the formula has been changed. The product is now less foamy, less scented and feels more oily than the previous version. However, it&#x27;s still good for my skin so I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best face wash I&#x27;ve come across. I&#x27;ve tried numerous face washes to achieve the foamy effect, first of all. This gives the perfect amount. Its gentle on my skin, clears up makeup well, and my husband has faith that it cleared up his skin (though I doubt this, considering its not meant for that and hasn&#x27;t done anything for my flaws). Either way, I won&#x27;t say it has done something better for me, but it definitely hasn&#x27;t done anything negative like many other cleansers have. Too bad they don&#x27;t sell this in stores commonly now!</li>
            <li> I like it, despite the fact this is more a women&#x27;s facial product.  I receive many complements that my skin looks great, no issue with it, I have use nothing else for this brand, and have used about 4 of them so far.</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower nearly every day. Seems to keep my face nice and clean without drying my skin out. The two pack lasts me a very long time and the price cannot be beat. Probably will not look elsewhere unless the product changes.</li>
            <li> Ever since I bought this casually on a deal, though I initially thought this would just sit in the bathroom rarely used, I am actually washing my face more often after returning home from sultry outside weather. Generates enough lather with slight application and feels refreshing and clean after each application. Buy a pack of two since you can keep in two bathrooms.</li>
            <li> Olay products are always good. Very nice face wash. Leaves skin smooth and does not make it dry. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this a try, but will not buy again.  If this stuff goes near your eyes, you are a goner.  It is so painful!  Ugh!  Great otherwise....</li>
            <li> I use this face wash daily in the morning along with a facial scrub. I have oily skin and this leaves my face looking and feeling fresh and clean. I love at the end of the day it removes all the makeup from your face. It is not overly drying either. I love Olay, and this product is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> Though I didn&#x27;t like this face wash quite as much as I like other Olay products, I would still rate it as 4 because of it&#x27;s genuinely good quality. The reason I didn&#x27;t like it that much is my fascination for gel face washes. It&#x27;s more of like a creamy texture which I don&#x27;t like much as a face wash. But it serves well all the purposes a face wash should do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne prone skin for the longest time, and it was bad - into my early 20&#x27;s bad.  I can&#x27;t say this is a miracle product.  I think everyone with acne tries different things and everyone does something different.  This played a HUGE part in solving my acne.  What really brought acne to its knees was my realization that it&#x27;s an infection, just like so many of the ailments of our body.  You need to treat spot infections and bring those down to a level where there is not enough open territory for it to spread.  My dermatologist gave me a facial antibiotic called &amp;#34;Ziana&amp;#34; to use at night on infections and I used this to rinse during showers and mornings and nights.  It cleared me up within weeks.  The ziana targets the infection and kills the bacteria that cause acne and the cleanser cleans the surface of facial debris and other bacteria so it can&#x27;t spread consistently.  Once in a while it dries my face out, but I&#x27;d say 95% of the time, my face is in equilibrium - some oil, but not pizza face oil.  It is refreshing to not have to worry about acne because I&#x27;ve finally found the product that works.  Most importantly - stay vigilant, there is no one solution, our faces are all different.  Try it for a few weeks and see if it works at clearing your acne.  Lucky, this one works well for me - I hope it helps some others as well!</li>
            <li> Bought this stuff for my wife but i like a clean face to. Works well very soapy leaves face dry and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Skin isn&#x27;t dry at the end of the day and it doesn&#x27;t leave film.  Skin is clearing up too!</li>
            <li> Not as foamy as I would like, but the product is NOT drying so it is nice to use.  Cleans skin well.</li>
            <li> Bought this product a few months ago. Satisfied with this product and one cannot go wrong with Olay. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I have very stubborn skin and its very sensitive but this stuff makes my face clear and wonderful! This product works really well for me!</li>
