            <li>well, masks are inexpensive and ok for DIY masks.</li>
            <li>These mask are excellent for use during a specialty facial.</li>
            <li>It works VERY well for applying a lotion mask and the fabric is perfect with ZERO smell that I&#x27;m very sensitive to.  </li>
            <li>I need a strong 100%  sterile cotton mask to occlude my face with and</li>
            <li>These are definitely so much more economical than prepackaged masks.</li>
            <li>they are strong and good enough for 3-4 applications.</li>

            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>These are plain facial mask sheets to be used to add your own skincare essence or DIY mask product to.</li>
            <li>Not very thick so it doesn&#x27;t hold/absorb oils too well and falls of the face in a matter of seconds.</li>

            <li>I opened the package and they&#x27;re so soft.</li>
            <li>Once dried on the face, you can easily remove the facial mask sheet.</li>
            <li>Especially when using natural homemade facials!</li>
            <li>so far the only thing I&#x27;ve seen that might work is a painters head cover worn backwards.</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re using Chizu Saeki&#x27;s morning lotion mask method (wet some cotton, add an Asian style hydrating toner then let sit on the skin for three minutes before applying moisturizer, etc.)</li>
            <li> The facial sheets are about 9 inches wide and 7-8 inches</li>
            <li> I have a small face, and it is big enough for me.</li>
            <li> But I bet it will be hard for most of the people, but the shape is weird..</li>
            <li> I got these to wet and put over my face when i had a face masque on and needed to keep it moist on the skin during an at home treatment.</li>
            <li> Waste of money big time.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I spent money on them.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want buy this mask again, it&#x27;s not pure cotton at all</li>
            <li> kind of disappointed, low quality, not good for lotion mask use</li>
            <li> So I used 3 at once layered over each other.</li>
            <li> The other problem was the delay in receiving this product...</li>
            <li> I suggest you also purchase the Daiso Silicon Face Sheet from Amazon ( http://www.amazon.com/Daiso-Japan-Reusable-Silicon-Cover/dp/B00JIN8BTW/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1429839436&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;silicon+face+sheet ) which will allow your mask to retain moisture and also let you do other things instead of laying reclined while your mask is on!</li>
            <li> They are to thin to hold your toner or other low viscosity mask formula.</li>
            <li> not to flimsy but not to heavy</li>
            <li> so you have to waste product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was coming from another country and took a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Although its messy since it doesn&#x27;t hold oils/liquids</li>
            <li> A bit small for some faces, but works well in my skin care business.</li>
            <li> A bit small but functionsl</li>
            <li> If anyone has tried an Asian skincare mask, this is the same, except it&#x27;s the base sheet without the essence/mask liquid on it.</li>
            <li> Just put whatever goopy skin stuff you like (smooshed avacado, thick moisturizer.....</li>
            <li> It is a little bit weird shape...</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> so I am plenty annoyed that the amount is not correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t hold water well at all and are SUUPER thin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very bad product, I will never order again</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> kind of disappointed, low quality, not good for lotion mask use</li>
            <li> This is what I call a practical thing. If you like me are a home made masks then use this . I have to cut around a bit because  I have a&lt;br /&gt;small face just  prepare your mask deep mask sheet in it and apply then just trow away. And you get  50 so just mask every day.</li>
            <li> Great amount for the price. Everyone loves a custom mask, you can let these soak in your favorite product &amp; then apply!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price but the open weave texture makes them dry out pretty quickly. If you&#x27;re using Chizu Saeki&#x27;s morning lotion mask method (wet some cotton, add an Asian style hydrating toner then let sit on the skin for three minutes before applying moisturizer, etc.) this is perfect but if you&#x27;re wanting a more traditional sheet mask you&#x27;ll have to constantly re-wet it.</li>
            <li> Very nice. A bit small for some faces, but works well in my skin care business.</li>
            <li> Makes facials so much easier! Especially when using natural homemade facials!</li>
            <li> A bit small but functionsl</li>
            <li> Good value for the price</li>
            <li> Very soft. Works well will the egg facial</li>
            <li> Good product. Thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I&#x27;m following  Ms. Chizu Saeki&#x27;s advice about applying a moisture mask day &amp; night. The cotton mask is easier &amp; faster that having to deal with multiple pieces of cotton. I re-use them. they are strong and good enough for 3-4 applications. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> not any better then the other ones I bought. I need a strong 100%  sterile cotton mask to occlude my face with and so far the only thing I&#x27;ve seen that might work is a painters head cover worn backwards. if anyone knows where to get something more durable id love to know.</li>
            <li> To begin, I received two packages of these face masks. This listing claims 50- but each package had 20. So I only received 40 (and yes, I did count them all). So buyer beware, and take that into account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great for my purposes, I just expected to get 50 so I am plenty annoyed that the amount is not correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to performance I&#x27;ve only used one but it was more absorbent than I thought it would be. If you worry about them evaporating too quickly I suggest you also purchase the Daiso Silicon Face Sheet from Amazon ( http://www.amazon.com/Daiso-Japan-Reusable-Silicon-Cover/dp/B00JIN8BTW/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1429839436&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;silicon+face+sheet ) which will allow your mask to retain moisture and also let you do other things instead of laying reclined while your mask is on!</li>
            <li> I just received these and they work great!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want buy this mask again, it&#x27;s not pure cotton at all and I even don&#x27;t want to give a one star.</li>
            <li> Very Easy to use, and they have a bit of a thickness to them, which is good because it doesnt leave any product residue on the clients face. I love these, and will definitely be purchasing these again!</li>
            <li> Great! not to flimsy but not to heavy so you have to waste product.</li>
            <li> These are plain facial mask sheets to be used to add your own skincare essence or DIY mask product to. There&#x27;s 50 facial mask sheets, and 50 separate ear-shaped sheets. The packaging claims this is 100% cotton. The facial sheets are about 9 inches wide and 7-8 inches long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It soaks up liquid well, and stays on the face well. Once dried on the face, you can easily remove the facial mask sheet. If anyone has tried an Asian skincare mask, this is the same, except it&#x27;s the base sheet without the essence/mask liquid on it. I recommend bunching the mask sheet into a ball into the shot glass with the liquid. Then just pull it out and chill with it on your face for 15-20 minutes; throw sheet away afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this from &amp;#34;Panda,&amp;#34; which ships from Hong Kong so expect longer shipping time.</li>
            <li> good quality disposable facial cotton.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit we&#x27;ll and not soft.</li>
            <li> I got these to wet and put over my face when i had a face masque on and needed to keep it moist on the skin during an at home treatment. These don&#x27;t hold water well at all and are SUUPER thin. So I used 3 at once layered over each other. They run big and don&#x27;t stick well to face unless you have a sticky masque on your face. Overall ok.</li>
            <li> Really like this product! Facial routine, I found in a magazine creamy feel clean, perfect, and I used my client, the face is very moist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very bad product, I will never order again</li>
            <li> These are great! I was surprised to see they included under eye masks a well. I opened the package and they&#x27;re so soft. These are definitely so much more economical than prepackaged masks. I&#x27;m excited to make my first mask!</li>
            <li> They are to thin to hold your toner or other low viscosity mask formula. They also dry out easily because of the insufficient thickness.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit weird shape...I have a small face, and it is big enough for me. But I bet it will be hard for most of the people, but the shape is weird..but the materials is good.</li>
            <li> These are just the right thickness....that is, they are very thin and perfect for making your own mask. Just put whatever goopy skin stuff you like (smooshed avacado, thick moisturizer.....whatever your skin likes) then put this sheet over your face and rest for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Not good. They do not work. Do not buy them. Waste of money big time. Can&#x27;t believe I spent money on them.</li>
            <li> I like these for lotion masks however, the neck doesn&#x27;t get any treatment.  I&#x27;ll be using squares for the neck.  The other problem was the delay in receiving this product...I didn&#x27;t realize it was coming from another country and took a few weeks.  The product itself is very nice though and worth the wait.  It works VERY well for applying a lotion mask and the fabric is perfect with ZERO smell that I&#x27;m very sensitive to.  There are a TON of these in the package too!  :~)  I like them.</li>
            <li> Not very thick so it doesn&#x27;t hold/absorb oils too well and falls of the face in a matter of seconds. Although its messy since it doesn&#x27;t hold oils/liquids well, masks are inexpensive and ok for DIY masks.</li>
            <li> These mask are excellent for use during a specialty facial. They allow you to infuse serums into the skin using a microcurrent or galvanic device.</li>
