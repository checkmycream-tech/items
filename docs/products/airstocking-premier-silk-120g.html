            <li>the three, offer best color selection (5 shades vs. 3)&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Best spray on stocking for nighttime.</li>
            <li>It hides cellulite and it gives a really beautiful tone.</li>
            <li>Great .</li>
            <li>This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>my opinion, all three offer great coverage.</li>
            <li>The air stocking color is great and there is no smell.  </li>
            <li>Great product - a must have for the summer</li>
            <li>It hides the flaws &amp; feels good.  </li>
            <li>love this makes me feel really good!</li>
            <li>Perfect, just like expected&lt;br /&gt;no more sweat panties in summer time, perfect for your beautiful manicured toes in open shoes</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied</li>
            <li>Great stuff -- goes on beautifully and is a great match for me (cannot find so good a match with any other leg spray brand).</li>
            <li>gives a nice subdued sheen to the leg and covers up what has to be covered</li>
            <li>-Nice</li>
            <li>No streaking and looks nice on your legs - almost like you are wearing hose.  </li>
            <li>Colors seem to have more of a pinkish tone, this is great if you have cool coloring.</li>
            <li>It really will blend beautifully.</li>
            <li>i love the coverage and that is waterproof, my complexion is like halle berry and</li>
            <li>product is perfect for shorts &amp; short sleeves.</li>
            <li>it disappeared from pharmacy many years ago</li>
            <li>More colors, better odds of finding one that matches your skin color without mixing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That ileaves more like a tanning effect while this product gives you color but also a stocking effect.</li>
            <li>Love this product ..</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I thought it might work, but I wasn&#x27;t sure, and now I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>-Color transfer, of the three the most easily rubbed</li>
            <li>Love the natural sun kissed rosy tan color of Bronze, especially because it looks great on my very fair skin.</li>
            <li>&gt;  -Easy</li>
            <li>-Easy application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it transfers so easily.  </li>
            <li>The product is fine if you don&#x27;t spill any liquid on your legs.</li>
            <li>-I am a light skinned hispanic and I am closer to neutral tones.</li>
            <li>Downright impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001R2IGEC Sally Hansen Airbrush Leg Light Glow]] :&lt;br</li>
            <li>-Ive used their Nude Glow, Light Glow and even Medium Glow depending on the color of my legs.</li>
            <li>-I prefer the colors of the Sally Hansen because they seem more natural, although a tad more on the yellow/orange side, and they have a better color selection.</li>
            <li>, I prefer to use the Airstockings and Nyce Instant Nylons to get the color I want, its a happy medium for me.  </li>
            <li>If you find Nyce Colors too yellow, neutralize, lighten or darken with Airstockings and you, too, will find your happy medium.  </li>

            <li>If you find Nyce Colors too yellow, neutralize, lighten or darken with Airstockings and you, too, will find your happy medium.  </li>
            <li>I always spray on, then smooth in with my hand.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth it because of the matt coverage and none of the orange undertones!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t all rub off like makeup but, of the three, it rubs off the most and if you are sitting in your car on a hot day or just by sliding out, you will see some on your car seat...and your clothes.  </li>
            <li>Tub/shower still requires elbow grease to clean off the overspray.  </li>
            <li>This product is really cool.</li>
            <li>I just used it for my leg for once, then I cleaned it up quickly.</li>
            <li>and if you do not like wearing hose when it is hot!</li>
            <li>However, loved the way it stays on better than any other similar product and goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>but I am rarely that tan.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>-This isn&#x27;t as good as the other two when it comes to transfer.  </li>
            <li>(sounds about right..).  </li>
            <li>(sounds about right..).  </li>
            <li>Given the limited amount of product shades available versus the abundance of different skin colors that vary from person to person, and even vary in one individual due to sun exposure or tanning products, its a safe bet that most will not find their perfect color in one bottle.</li>
            <li>Right now I use the nude and this is pretty close to my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Right now I use the nude and this is pretty close to my skin tone.</li>
            <li>(I am sure this is normal, I hope this is normal..</li>
            <li>When my legs are tanner, I&#x27;ve mixed the Nude Glow with the Light Glow and even the Light Glow with the Medium Glow</li>
            <li>Fantastic, brilliant, nothing works better, using ONLY this one and sad</li>
            <li>Although the lack of transfer is impressive, I&#x27;d still be wary and wouldn&#x27;t push my luck.  </li>
            <li>if I figure out how to add a picture, I&#x27;ll add a picture of a sample of each on my leg to see the color differences.itting in your car on a hot day or just by sliding out, you will see some on your car seat...and your clothes.  </li>
            <li>Although the lack of transfer is impressive, I&#x27;d still be wary and wouldn&#x27;t push my luck.  </li>
            <li>It holds on through sweat pretty well, just make sure to let it dry well before you put your clothes on.</li>
            <li>By the way, if it does get on your white towels, etc., it washes out easily.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>&gt;  -Very</li>
            <li>-Dries very</li>
            <li>but when I am out of the either the Airstockings or Nyce, I will and just be more careful with transfer.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Right now, being winter, my legs are pretty white and the closest match is the Nude Glow.</li>

            <li> Great . Takes the place of pantyhose which I try to avoid in summer.  gives a nice subdued sheen to the leg and covers up what has to be covered</li>
            <li> I apply it while I&#x27;m in the tub or shower coz I don&#x27;t want the overspray to get all over the bathroom.  Tub/shower still requires elbow grease to clean off the overspray.  But it&#x27;s worth it because of the matt coverage and none of the orange undertones!  And freedom from pantyhose!</li>
            <li> i love the coverage and that is waterproof, my complexion is like halle berry and this is way too dark and i accidentally ordered 2 :(</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell badly like the sunless tanners.  It hides the flaws &amp; feels good.  The draw back is the overspray that seems to fall on the ground or whatever is around the area.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I use this year round.&lt;br /&gt;Living in Florida it is important to have color but not great to bake in the sun to keep the color.&lt;br /&gt;This product is perfect for shorts &amp; short sleeves.</li>
            <li> Since no one seems to wear hosiery anymore I have to cover up the freckles and age spots.....This does the trick!  Can&#x27;t use self tanners because it will just make the freckles darker.  This is a make-up for your legs and arms.  You just have to let it fully dry before dressing.  It will not rub off on your clothes.  Will only come off with soap and water.  By the way, if it does get on your white towels, etc., it washes out easily.</li>
            <li> Only problem is it was a little dark for me  Next time will order lighter color.  However, loved the way it stays on better than any other similar product and goes on easily.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Fantastic, brilliant, nothing works better, using ONLY this one and sad it disappeared from pharmacy many years ago, I can buy it only online, can&#x27;t imagine summer without this product (and not only summer)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.  I really like this product.  Your legs look like you have hosiery on.</li>
            <li> -I am a light skinned hispanic and I am closer to neutral tones. Sometimes my legs look down right pasty, sometimes I have a tan, (occasionally from the sun, usually from sunless tanning sprays) so my color changes and I&#x27;ve also noticed my arms are always darker than my legs. (I am sure this is normal, I hope this is normal..)&lt;br /&gt;-In my opinion, all three offer great coverage. Given the limited amount of product shades available versus the abundance of different skin colors that vary from person to person, and even vary in one individual due to sun exposure or tanning products, its a safe bet that most will not find their perfect color in one bottle. If you want the closest match, you will have to do some color mixing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AIRSTOCKINGS:&lt;br /&gt;  PROS:&lt;br /&gt;  -Very little to no transfer:&lt;br /&gt;  CONS:&lt;br /&gt;  -Color doesn&#x27;t seem natural to me. Too pink.&lt;br /&gt;  SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;  -If it wasn&#x27;t for the color issue, it would be my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;COLOR:&lt;br /&gt;  -They offer three colors. Listed from light to dark: Natural, Terra Cotta and Bronze.&lt;br /&gt;  -I&#x27;ve used all three. Colors seem to have more of a pinkish tone, this is great if you have cool coloring. Right now the natural is the closest of these that match and its a little too dark, just a tad, but when blended in, its not THAT obvious.  When I am darker, I mix the terra cotta in a little. Its harder to mix because it dries faster (like the Nyce Instant Nylons) so you have to work fast.&lt;br /&gt;  -Their colors are my least favorite, they just don&#x27;t look natural on me.  The Natural shade by itself makes my legs look pink from afar and the shade is too different from the color of my arms.&lt;br /&gt;APPLICATION:&lt;br /&gt;  -Says to spray on legs then use your hands to blend it in and they advise you let set for 1-2 minutes. I guess it has the potential to rub off in that time.  Regardless of how long it takes to \\&quot;set\\&quot;, it dries pretty fast and to mix the colors you have to work fast.&lt;br /&gt;TRANSFERABILITY:&lt;br /&gt;  -Beats the Sally Hansen hands down. I&#x27;ve sat on black leather seats on a hot day, resulting in my legs sweating and saw no transfer. Downright impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001R2IGEC Sally Hansen Airbrush Leg Light Glow]] :&lt;br /&gt;  PROS:&lt;br /&gt;  -Nice colors (a little on yellow side)&lt;br /&gt;  -Of the three, offer best color selection (5 shades vs. 3)&lt;br /&gt;  -Easy to mix colors.&lt;br /&gt;  -Easy application.&lt;br /&gt;  CONS:&lt;br /&gt;  -Color transfer, of the three the most easily rubbed off.&lt;br /&gt;  SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;  -Nice colors but don&#x27;t like that it transfers so easily.  I used it for a long time but after trying the Nyce and Airstockings, my expectations have been raised.&lt;br /&gt;COLOR&lt;br /&gt;  -They have five colors. Listed from light to dark: Nude Glow, Light Glow, Medium Glow, Tan Glow and Deep Glow.&lt;br /&gt;  -Ive used their Nude Glow, Light Glow and even Medium Glow depending on the color of my legs. Right now, being winter, my legs are pretty white and the closest match is the Nude Glow. The Light Glow is too dark and looks too orange on my skin. When my legs are tanner, I&#x27;ve mixed the Nude Glow with the Light Glow and even the Light Glow with the Medium Glow but I am rarely that tan.&lt;br /&gt;  -I prefer the colors of the Sally Hansen because they seem more natural, although a tad more on the yellow/orange side, and they have a better color selection. More colors, better odds of finding one that matches your skin color without mixing.&lt;br /&gt;APPLICATION:&lt;br /&gt;  -Directions say to spray on hands, then apply to legs and blend, then let set 60 seconds. I&#x27;ve done it both ways. Sprayed on hands, sprayed on legs. I end up blending the color on my legs either way so the results are the same but I guess there is less product getting everywhere if you do it directly on hands.  This brand has been the easiest to mix colors with.&lt;br /&gt;TRANSFERABILITY:&lt;br /&gt;  -This isn&#x27;t as good as the other two when it comes to transfer.  It doesn&#x27;t all rub off like makeup but, of the three, it rubs off the most and if you are sitting in your car on a hot day or just by sliding out, you will see some on your car seat...and your clothes.  If you have black leather seats, sit on a towel or something you don&#x27;t mind getting dirty....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002EJ8TFS Nyce Legs Spray On Instant Nylons Nail Treatment Products]]&lt;br /&gt;  PROS:&lt;br /&gt;  -Little to no transfer:&lt;br /&gt;  -Neutral colors (It leans towards yellowish but, to me, more of an in between of the Airstockings pink tones and Sally Hansen yellow tones)&lt;br /&gt;  CONS:&lt;br /&gt;  -Bottles clog.&lt;br /&gt;  -Dries very fast.&lt;br /&gt;  SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;  -if it wasn&#x27;t for the clogged bottle issue, it would be my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;COLOR:&lt;br /&gt;  -Offers three colors as well. Listed from light to dark: Nude, Medium Beige and Dark Beige.&lt;br /&gt;  -I&#x27;ve tried the Nude and Medium Beige. Right now I use the nude and this is pretty close to my skin tone. I find that its not too orange and not too pink, it sits somewhere in the middle. When I am darker, I mix it in with the Medium Beige.  This brand is harder to mix colors because of the fast dry time.&lt;br /&gt;APPLICATION:&lt;br /&gt;  -Says to spray on legs and dries in 10 seconds (sounds about right..).  This is what makes it harder to mix, you have to work fast (faster than 10 seconds....)&lt;br /&gt;  -The one thing I did not like was that the three bottles i&#x27;ve purchased have clogged at one point or another before I was finished with them. Two I managed to salvage. Once they clogged the first time, it became a repetitive issue, I keep having to clean the caps. I do this by dunking them in a mixture of water and facial cleanser, let it soak then use an old toothbrush to brush it clean. (I just got an ultrasonic jewelry cleaner so I am going to try dunking it in that next.)  Sometimes i have to clean it during application which is very inconvenient, especially when I am mixing colors.&lt;br /&gt;TRANSFERABILITY:&lt;br /&gt;  -Comparable to Airstockings, I saw little to no transfer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MIXING COLORS:&lt;br /&gt;-Mixing Nyce and Airstockings still gives a nice color with very little to no transfer.&lt;br /&gt;-Mixing the Airstockings with Sally Hansen gives the nicest color (for me) and yields less transfer but there is still transfer nonetheless so I avoid using but when I am out of the either the Airstockings or Nyce, I will and just be more careful with transfer.&lt;br /&gt;-I usually do a 50/50 mix just because its easier to spray them on my legs at the same time and can get consistent color through out, then blend them in quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL THOUGHTS&lt;br /&gt;-Overall, I prefer to use the Airstockings and Nyce Instant Nylons to get the color I want, its a happy medium for me.  If you find airstockings to pink, neutralize it, lighten or darken it with Nyce colors.  If you find Nyce Colors too yellow, neutralize, lighten or darken with Airstockings and you, too, will find your happy medium.  Although the lack of transfer is impressive, I&#x27;d still be wary and wouldn&#x27;t push my luck.  I have had some rub off on clothes but not sure if its because I didn&#x27;t give it enough time to dry.  Because I mixed them, I can&#x27;t pin point which one it was. I have all the colors I mentioned I&#x27;ve tried except for the Sally Hansen Airbrush Legs Nude Glow, if I figure out how to add a picture, I&#x27;ll add a picture of a sample of each on my leg to see the color differences.itting in your car on a hot day or just by sliding out, you will see some on your car seat...and your clothes.

            <li> I was introduced to this product at a bridesmaid gathering, and use it all summer long. Hides imperfections while giving a natural looking tan.  I always spray on, then smooth in with my hand.</li>
            <li> The product was fine until I accidentally spilled some water down my leg.  This was hours after I applied the product and followed the directions.  The product is fine if you don&#x27;t spill any liquid on your legs.</li>
            <li> I have bought this in the past too. I won&#x27;t go to the office without it when wearing a dress or skirt. I go outside to apply. It&#x27;s like make up for my legs, evening out skin tone. It does not rub off. I used the same can for years tho I don&#x27;t recommend that.</li>
            <li> Not work at all. I hate the color. I just used it for my leg for once, then I cleaned it up quickly. Unfortunately i can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> Best spray on stocking for nighttime. Haven&#x27;t bought stockings for years because of this product. I use the Bronze. The trick is to spray a little bit and rub it thoroughly all over your legs. It is all in the way you continually spread it over your legs. It really will blend beautifully. For daytime Ilike on the beach I prefer Sally Hansen&#x27;s product and the one that comes in a tube. That ileaves more like a tanning effect while this product gives you color but also a stocking effect.</li>
            <li> Great stuff -- goes on beautifully and is a great match for me (cannot find so good a match with any other leg spray brand).</li>
            <li> Not the shade I expected</li>
            <li> Love this product .. The delivery was so fast....I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> love this makes me feel really good!</li>
            <li> Been getting this product for years. Love it.</li>
            <li> This rubbed off on all of my clothes and actually will ruin some fabric. I did not like it and have numerous cans left.</li>
            <li> It makes my legs look pasty! It is not for women of color. I thought it might work, but I wasn&#x27;t sure, and now I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> color shade is not what I expected. did not blend well with my dark complexion, and was not easy to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> The air stocking color is great and there is no smell.  No streaking and looks nice on your legs - almost like you are wearing hose.  Great product - a must have for the summer and if you do not like wearing hose when it is hot!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend to cover spider veins,stretch marks ect.. I don&#x27;t recommend it for women of darker color, it is chalky &amp; ashy. Once i applied the product it looked as if i just got out of a pool &amp; needed lotion..I then waited for it to dry &amp; applied lotion (didn&#x27;t know if i was supposed to or not) but it made it look a little better. I was only applying it to the back of my legs were the spider veins are at BUT you can clearly see the line of demarkation even with rubbing the product in. I don&#x27;t think i will be using this not unless i plan to spray my entire leg.</li>
            <li> This product is really cool. It hides cellulite and it gives a really beautiful tone. The key is to apply it even and if it is not, use a thick face makeup brush to distribute it well on your legs. It holds on through sweat pretty well, just make sure to let it dry well before you put your clothes on. When you apply it make sure you are in a surface that is dark.</li>
            <li> Perfect, just like expected&lt;br /&gt;no more sweat panties in summer time, perfect for your beautiful manicured toes in open shoes</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be without this in the summer! I prefer it over tanning lotion since it doesn&#x27;t smell or stain. Love the natural sun kissed rosy tan color of Bronze, especially because it looks great on my very fair skin.</li>
