            <li>It&#x27;s weightless and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>The product smells great and leaves hair shiny and smooth....</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice shine</li>
            <li>Now,m loving my hair.</li>
            <li>I got compliments that my hair color is nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>This product is nice..</li>
            <li>I also couldn&#x27;t find any list of ingredients for this product anywhere on the internet including on their own web page.  </li>
            <li>the kind I tried said it adds shine.</li>
            <li>But still, I would say it was effective as a heat protectant as well.  </li>
            <li>Because I have a lot of frizz problems, I follow up with a leave in conditioner, and so far this is my best anti-frizz regime.  </li>
            <li>This is just what I needed; cheap and good quality.</li>
            <li>I love love love this product!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very light, absorbs well</li>
            <li>It reminds me of a very light baby powder scent.</li>
            <li>smells amazing and can easily be used as a lotion.....</li>
            <li>Tried this for the first time and i love it!!</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my permed hair feel...</li>
            <li>I tried this product on my hair and it looked and felt lovely.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Will order more when this bottle is gone (0:</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been great, has def made my hair much softer.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for the last 2 weeks and it is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more of a conditioning spray.  </li>
            <li>I used the Argan oil while it was still damp, and I noticed my hair was silkier and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>amazing oil with cheap price.</li>
            <li>it make your hair looks healthy and softy.</li>
            <li>I will buy more after.</li>
            <li>great company to order from...quality product and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Arganesque for about 3 weeks now and love the way it has helped rehabilitate my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is much more supple and once again shiny.  </li>
            <li>I love how it feels</li>
            <li>I love this oil</li>
            <li>I apply it to mostly the ends and not the roots.  </li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I am fully satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>so I gave it a try although it didn&#x27;t have many reviews yet.</li>
            <li>This item was okay.</li>
            <li>I could have put more in if I wanted.</li>
            <li>and I prefer this one since it is more lightweight.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair a brilliant shine, and leaving it feeling like no other Argan oil that I have used before.</li>
            <li>If it does work for you, then that is great, but don&#x27;t get your hopes up too high.</li>
            <li>and it smells so good that the first night I used it</li>
            <li>Also the top comes off, which made it easier to add to my conditioner and would make it easy to refill if by any chance they sold bulk sizes of the oil.</li>
            <li>Overall a very good product.</li>
            <li>After a couple weeks of use as directed, my hair is easy to manage, looks great, very soft.</li>
            <li>It looked soft, shiny, and was behaving great.  </li>
            <li>Really strong customer service from the seller.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with the results</li>
            <li>Honestly, all the oils (I was currently using love potion9 by a you tuber) I have use haven&#x27;t moisturize my hair to this level, this is a keeper!</li>
            <li>and I have to admit that it&#x27;s a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I used maybe a dime size on my palm, rubbed my hands together and spread it lightly over a section, then repeated as needed.  </li>
            <li>and I really enjoy the fragrance of the Arganesque.</li>
            <li>I never had a product that feels so silky smooth and</li>
            <li>so it really looked nice.  </li>
            <li>This oil is extremely light.</li>
            <li>Received my bottle about a week ago and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I compared it to another brand, which has great reviews - the HSI, since I have that flat iron.</li>
            <li>Whether I use a flat iron or just style with my hairdryer and a brush, the results are great.</li>
            <li>First off, I have to say that I love this pump bottle.</li>
            <li>My hair is damaged for over processing and this stuff works great to help so it doesn&#x27;t look dry.</li>
            <li>Okay, I have baby fine, stick straight hair that gets greasy REALLY fast, I can&#x27;t go more than a day without a shower.  </li>
            <li>price is right and delivery very quick.</li>
            <li>super great, my dyed blonde straw-dry hair started feeling softer right away.</li>
            <li>Overall I think this is a really good Moroccan Argan oil.</li>
            <li>While my friends really love the smell which is very noticeable when you use the oil.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and is not heavy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be better than too much at once.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used everything from olive oils, oil sheen to good ole fashioned \\&quot;hair grease\\&quot; and have never receive even close to the same results.</li>
            <li>and it made it soooooo soft and still full of body and a nice shine.</li>
            <li>It absorbs in quickly, so</li>
            <li>I have used several different brands of Argan oil and until ArganEsque Moroccan Argan Oil did not realize the difference once you have the best.</li>
            <li>It does smell good and the bottle has gone this long, but I would not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li>finally, a great hair serum that works: detangles my past shoulder-length wavy hair, gives shine and luster without weighing it down, and smells good!</li>
            <li>The serum is easy to apply, leaves my hair super soft and frizzie free and does not feel greasy or oily.</li>
            <li>I have dry hair and have been searching for a good hair oil product.  </li>
            <li>I also love how it&#x27;s not heavy or too oily!</li>
            <li>I really recommend you buy this!!</li>
            <li>It took a little experimenting to figure out the amount that will work, but once you get that figured out, it is a great product.  </li>
            <li>I have relaxed hair and its not too heavy, or oily and not to mention it smells great.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and silky and healthy looking too.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair more manageable, shiny, and soft.</li>
            <li>worth seem like just the right amount</li>
            <li>This ArganEsque Moroccan Argan Oil have cheap price and high quality made.</li>
            <li>My heels are very cracked and dry, this products left my heel looking great its not cracked and dry anymore, it look and fells great.</li>
            <li>I think this one&#x27;s even less, and you get a good size for the money.</li>
            <li>Was happy that this brand worked so well, since I was switching from a quality product that is more expensive that this one..</li>
            <li>It looked good and cost about $12 bucks less</li>
            <li>This oil is excellent for dry hair, my daughter and grand daughter were complaining of dry unhealthy looking hair, I bought this for them and they are extremely pleased with the result!</li>
            <li>so I figured it was a good time to try oils, since I could hide at home and wash it out if I had to and not be stuck at school with a mess of oily hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair will look good for 2 or 3 days with just a quick application of the oil treatment, brush it and use the flat iron if necessary.  </li>
            <li>but I really like this stuff!</li>
            <li>This morning I put just a tiny bit more on the ends and boy is my hair shiny.</li>
            <li>and i could definitely say i am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this hair treatment, I was amazed how my hair styled just like I wanted.</li>
            <li>Obviously, I don&#x27;t overdo it, but I still use more than I&#x27;d think I could get by with.</li>
            <li>My sister bragged on my hair yesterday when I used it, and I didn&#x27;t use the conditioning spray first.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this product!</li>
            <li>I added it to my deep conditioner and that made it better and even created a different and better smell for the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I would experiment with it the first couple times.  </li>
            <li>Nothing has been able to treat the damage enough to hide it until I used ArganEsque.</li>
            <li>Finally, a product that does all and more than what it promotes.</li>
            <li>I like this oil because its not too oily, my hair is still very manageable after using it!</li>
            <li>I will most definitely order it again.</li>
            <li>At first I was using it as a leave in before styling</li>
            <li>This was my first time bying this product for my very soft, but super curly hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an amazing product and it seems to help keep my hair from being static-y, but we&#x27;ll put it to the true test next week when school is back in.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have to use my flat iron on most days...</li>
            <li>Since the first day I really noticed the changed in it.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a great treat for the hair, and the price is low when compared to what you pay for other oils.  </li>
            <li>If you are using too much, your hair will feel and look slightly greasy, but with the right amount it absorbed nicely and leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I bought another bottle that claimed it was 100% pure argan oil after I researched that product.  </li>
            <li>The Glass bottle is very luxurious and nice, but with little ones running around my house I would have preferred a plastic bottle</li>
            <li>I applied the oil to my hair both while damp and in 2, 3, &amp; 4 day hair and even in 4 day hair it still worked very well</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t have any real issues to start</li>
            <li>I really like the smell and the texture of the oil itself</li>
            <li>this item come with very safety package.</li>
            <li>Works very well....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happen with this product.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil,  </li>
            <li>much easier to brush.  </li>
            <li>I have ALOT of hair and applied way to much....</li>
            <li>and we both really like it.</li>
            <li>The oil gives my hair a slightly better shine than I&#x27;ve gotten with other Moroccan oils I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>My hair is able to absorb and retain all the other products that I use, which reduces the amount of products that I use in my hair.  </li>
            <li>And the price is so much better then some other brands</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for some other more pricey brand.</li>
            <li>my hair was dried,  let my hair down it was nice and silky, applied one more pump of the oil</li>
            <li>The oil is very light and didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all like others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>There is a vanilla scent to this, so be aware of that, if you are sensitive to scents.  </li>
            <li>has checked up on me 2 times to make sure I like the product mo other company has done that for me!</li>
            <li>my hair gain its silkness and become live after dying it which truly made so upset, but now with this products and other products of Argan I am so pleased about my hair condition</li>
            <li>I was skeptical of the great reviews, as I have tried a couple of other Argan Oil-infused products before and they were just okay.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mainly been putting it on on damp hair out of the shower</li>
            <li>I paid so much more for a much smaller bottle of HSI Argan Oil last year.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend ArganEsque Moroccan Argan Oil for hair treatment.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and this company.</li>
            <li>and so far its working for me!!</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to scents and it didn&#x27;t bother me a whole lot.  </li>
            <li>so now I am mostly using it as a gloss after I am done styling, and occasionally I will use it when I let my hair air dry</li>
            <li>I was so surprised at how beautiful the bottle was compared to other Argan oil brands that I&#x27;ve used before in the past.</li>
            <li>Used a small amount in my hair (natural hair) &amp; it was very, very smooth and also blended in very well.  </li>
            <li>and it looked nice and by pulling my hair back it was straightened a little</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li>As I only need a couple of pumps when I apply it to my hair, I wish there was a smaller size available</li>
            <li>Well, WOW!  </li>
            <li>But it does make you have soft curls!</li>
            <li>I received this as a promotion (rather unexpectedly, too!)</li>
            <li>No other brand from now on!!!  </li>
            <li>I have superfine and little</li>
            <li>This product really worked on my naturally frizzy and coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Would totally recommend this even for someone who maybe isn&#x27;t in need of any hair repair but just wants softer, healthier hair.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a hair oil to use on my natural hair which will leave it soft and manageable and this product does that.  </li>
            <li>hair has NEVER been soft like this before.  </li>
            <li>My feet feel soft now</li>
            <li>and now,as I approach 50, it has gotten very dry,even though I only wash it once a week.</li>
            <li>Now, that problem has completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>Not heavy at all</li>
            <li>It smoothes the ends, adds shine, and leaves it unbelievably soft without adding weight or greasiness.</li>
            <li>It simply doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me.  </li>
            <li>ArganEsque leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after reading some reviews and am I pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>The oil is not heavy and it smells well.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my son and my daughter who have natural hair.  </li>
            <li>It makes my (dry) hair shiny, silky, and i like it very much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t shampoo every day, because I have long hair and don&#x27;t want to dry it out any more than necessary.  </li>
            <li>it smells pretty decent as well and was bigger than i expected</li>
            <li>To me it seems to work just the same, leaving my newly permed hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Usually they come in a cheap plastic type of bottle.</li>
            <li>This one wins hands down - can&#x27;t believe the difference.  </li>
            <li>The oil is good but not great for very dry hair, it gave my hair a shine but did not hydrate my hair</li>
            <li>like I used to because after only two little drops my hair feels so smooth and untangled that I have no problem to brush it.</li>
            <li>and I really do feel like my hair dries faster when I let it air dry.  </li>
            <li>I have natural hair and have been natural for about 4 years never once finding a product that can provide enough moisture to get through the day.</li>
            <li>freak)..A decent blow dryer goes a long way...</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and puts such a shine on it...</li>
            <li>I actually like the smell of the other brand a little better</li>
            <li>Okay, I have thick, dry, color treated, frizzy hair (</li>
            <li>Since receiving Arganesque, and using it daily with my hair dry, and putting a little in the  shampoo and conditioner, my hair has improved tremendously!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American very soft long hair, I roller set my hair every week.</li>
            <li>old daughter&#x27;s long blonde hair for a silkiness and shine.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and less mess!</li>
            <li>It does no take very much at all and a little goes a long way.  </li>

            <li> The product smells great and leaves hair shiny and smooth....</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice shine</li>
            <li> Now,m loving my hair.</li>
            <li> I got compliments that my hair color is nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> This product is nice..</li>
            <li> I also couldn&#x27;t find any list of ingredients for this product anywhere on the internet including on their own web page.  </li>
            <li> the kind I tried said it adds shine.</li>
            <li> But still, I would say it was effective as a heat protectant as well.  </li>
            <li> Because I have a lot of frizz problems, I follow up with a leave in conditioner, and so far this is my best anti-frizz regime.  </li>
            <li> This is just what I needed; cheap and good quality.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very light, absorbs well</li>
            <li> It reminds me of a very light baby powder scent.</li>
            <li> smells amazing and can easily be used as a lotion.....</li>
            <li> Tried this for the first time and i love it!!</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my permed hair feel...</li>
            <li> I tried this product on my hair and it looked and felt lovely.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Will order more when this bottle is gone (0:</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been great, has def made my hair much softer.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last 2 weeks and it is wonderful!  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s more of a conditioning spray.  </li>
            <li> I used the Argan oil while it was still damp, and I noticed my hair was silkier and more manageable.  </li>
            <li> amazing oil with cheap price.</li>
            <li> it make your hair looks healthy and softy.</li>
            <li> I will buy more after.</li>
            <li> great company to order from...quality product and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Arganesque for about 3 weeks now and love the way it has helped rehabilitate my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is much more supple and once again shiny.  </li>
            <li> I love how it feels</li>
            <li> I love this oil</li>
            <li> I apply it to mostly the ends and not the roots.  </li>
            <li> I love the product.  </li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I am fully satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> so I gave it a try although it didn&#x27;t have many reviews yet.</li>
            <li> This item was okay.</li>
            <li> I could have put more in if I wanted.</li>
            <li> and I prefer this one since it is more lightweight.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair a brilliant shine, and leaving it feeling like no other Argan oil that I have used before.</li>
            <li> If it does work for you, then that is great, but don&#x27;t get your hopes up too high.</li>
            <li> and it smells so good that the first night I used it</li>
            <li> Also the top comes off, which made it easier to add to my conditioner and would make it easy to refill if by any chance they sold bulk sizes of the oil.</li>
            <li> Overall a very good product.</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks of use as directed, my hair is easy to manage, looks great, very soft.</li>
            <li> It looked soft, shiny, and was behaving great.  </li>
            <li> Really strong customer service from the seller.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with the results</li>
            <li> Honestly, all the oils (I was currently using love potion9 by a you tuber) I have use haven&#x27;t moisturize my hair to this level, this is a keeper!</li>
            <li> and I have to admit that it&#x27;s a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I used maybe a dime size on my palm, rubbed my hands together and spread it lightly over a section, then repeated as needed.  </li>
            <li> and I really enjoy the fragrance of the Arganesque.</li>
            <li> I never had a product that feels so silky smooth and</li>
            <li> so it really looked nice.  </li>
            <li> This oil is extremely light.</li>
            <li> Received my bottle about a week ago and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I compared it to another brand, which has great reviews - the HSI, since I have that flat iron.</li>
            <li> Whether I use a flat iron or just style with my hairdryer and a brush, the results are great.</li>
            <li> First off, I have to say that I love this pump bottle.</li>
            <li> My hair is damaged for over processing and this stuff works great to help so it doesn&#x27;t look dry.</li>
            <li> Okay, I have baby fine, stick straight hair that gets greasy REALLY fast, I can&#x27;t go more than a day without a shower.  </li>
            <li> price is right and delivery very quick.</li>
            <li> super great, my dyed blonde straw-dry hair started feeling softer right away.</li>
            <li> Overall I think this is a really good Moroccan Argan oil.</li>
            <li> While my friends really love the smell which is very noticeable when you use the oil.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and is not heavy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be better than too much at once.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used everything from olive oils, oil sheen to good ole fashioned \\&quot;hair grease\\&quot; and have never receive even close to the same results.</li>
            <li> and it made it soooooo soft and still full of body and a nice shine.</li>
            <li> It absorbs in quickly, so</li>
            <li> I have used several different brands of Argan oil and until ArganEsque Moroccan Argan Oil did not realize the difference once you have the best.</li>
            <li> It does smell good and the bottle has gone this long, but I would not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> finally, a great hair serum that works: detangles my past shoulder-length wavy hair, gives shine and luster without weighing it down, and smells good!</li>
            <li> The serum is easy to apply, leaves my hair super soft and frizzie free and does not feel greasy or oily.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and have been searching for a good hair oil product.  </li>
            <li> I also love how it&#x27;s not heavy or too oily!</li>
            <li> I really recommend you buy this!!</li>
            <li> It took a little experimenting to figure out the amount that will work, but once you get that figured out, it is a great product.  </li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and its not too heavy, or oily and not to mention it smells great.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and silky and healthy looking too.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair more manageable, shiny, and soft.</li>
            <li> worth seem like just the right amount</li>
            <li> This ArganEsque Moroccan Argan Oil have cheap price and high quality made.</li>
            <li> My heels are very cracked and dry, this products left my heel looking great its not cracked and dry anymore, it look and fells great.</li>
            <li> I think this one&#x27;s even less, and you get a good size for the money.</li>
            <li> Was happy that this brand worked so well, since I was switching from a quality product that is more expensive that this one..</li>
            <li> It looked good and cost about $12 bucks less</li>
            <li> This oil is excellent for dry hair, my daughter and grand daughter were complaining of dry unhealthy looking hair, I bought this for them and they are extremely pleased with the result!</li>
            <li> so I figured it was a good time to try oils, since I could hide at home and wash it out if I had to and not be stuck at school with a mess of oily hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair will look good for 2 or 3 days with just a quick application of the oil treatment, brush it and use the flat iron if necessary.  </li>
            <li> but I really like this stuff!</li>
            <li> This morning I put just a tiny bit more on the ends and boy is my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> and i could definitely say i am in love with this product.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this hair treatment, I was amazed how my hair styled just like I wanted.</li>
            <li> Obviously, I don&#x27;t overdo it, but I still use more than I&#x27;d think I could get by with.</li>
            <li> My sister bragged on my hair yesterday when I used it, and I didn&#x27;t use the conditioning spray first.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this product!</li>
            <li> I added it to my deep conditioner and that made it better and even created a different and better smell for the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I would experiment with it the first couple times.  </li>
            <li> Nothing has been able to treat the damage enough to hide it until I used ArganEsque.</li>
            <li> Finally, a product that does all and more than what it promotes.</li>
            <li> I like this oil because its not too oily, my hair is still very manageable after using it!</li>
            <li> I will most definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> At first I was using it as a leave in before styling</li>
            <li> This was my first time bying this product for my very soft, but super curly hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an amazing product and it seems to help keep my hair from being static-y, but we&#x27;ll put it to the true test next week when school is back in.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have to use my flat iron on most days...</li>
            <li> Since the first day I really noticed the changed in it.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a great treat for the hair, and the price is low when compared to what you pay for other oils.  </li>
            <li> If you are using too much, your hair will feel and look slightly greasy, but with the right amount it absorbed nicely and leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I bought another bottle that claimed it was 100% pure argan oil after I researched that product.  </li>
            <li> The Glass bottle is very luxurious and nice, but with little ones running around my house I would have preferred a plastic bottle</li>
            <li> I applied the oil to my hair both while damp and in 2, 3, &amp; 4 day hair and even in 4 day hair it still worked very well</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t have any real issues to start</li>
            <li> I really like the smell and the texture of the oil itself</li>
            <li> this item come with very safety package.</li>
            <li> Works very well....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happen with this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil,  </li>
            <li> much easier to brush.  </li>
            <li> I have ALOT of hair and applied way to much....</li>
            <li> and we both really like it.</li>
            <li> The oil gives my hair a slightly better shine than I&#x27;ve gotten with other Moroccan oils I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> My hair is able to absorb and retain all the other products that I use, which reduces the amount of products that I use in my hair.  </li>
            <li> And the price is so much better then some other brands</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for some other more pricey brand.</li>
            <li> my hair was dried,  let my hair down it was nice and silky, applied one more pump of the oil</li>
            <li> The oil is very light and didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all like others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> There is a vanilla scent to this, so be aware of that, if you are sensitive to scents.  </li>
            <li> has checked up on me 2 times to make sure I like the product mo other company has done that for me!</li>
            <li> my hair gain its silkness and become live after dying it which truly made so upset, but now with this products and other products of Argan I am so pleased about my hair condition</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the great reviews, as I have tried a couple of other Argan Oil-infused products before and they were just okay.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mainly been putting it on on damp hair out of the shower</li>
            <li> I paid so much more for a much smaller bottle of HSI Argan Oil last year.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend ArganEsque Moroccan Argan Oil for hair treatment.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and this company.</li>
            <li> and so far its working for me!!</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to scents and it didn&#x27;t bother me a whole lot.  </li>
            <li> so now I am mostly using it as a gloss after I am done styling, and occasionally I will use it when I let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> I was so surprised at how beautiful the bottle was compared to other Argan oil brands that I&#x27;ve used before in the past.</li>
            <li> Used a small amount in my hair (natural hair) &amp; it was very, very smooth and also blended in very well.  </li>
            <li> and it looked nice and by pulling my hair back it was straightened a little</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li> As I only need a couple of pumps when I apply it to my hair, I wish there was a smaller size available</li>
            <li> Well, WOW!  </li>
            <li> But it does make you have soft curls!</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotion (rather unexpectedly, too!)</li>
            <li> No other brand from now on!!!  </li>
            <li> I have superfine and little</li>
            <li> This product really worked on my naturally frizzy and coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Would totally recommend this even for someone who maybe isn&#x27;t in need of any hair repair but just wants softer, healthier hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a hair oil to use on my natural hair which will leave it soft and manageable and this product does that.  </li>
            <li> hair has NEVER been soft like this before.  </li>
            <li> My feet feel soft now</li>
            <li> and now,as I approach 50, it has gotten very dry,even though I only wash it once a week.</li>
            <li> Now, that problem has completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> Not heavy at all</li>
            <li> It smoothes the ends, adds shine, and leaves it unbelievably soft without adding weight or greasiness.</li>
            <li> It simply doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me.  </li>
            <li> ArganEsque leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading some reviews and am I pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The oil is not heavy and it smells well.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my son and my daughter who have natural hair.  </li>
            <li> It makes my (dry) hair shiny, silky, and i like it very much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shampoo every day, because I have long hair and don&#x27;t want to dry it out any more than necessary.  </li>
            <li> it smells pretty decent as well and was bigger than i expected</li>
            <li> To me it seems to work just the same, leaving my newly permed hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> Usually they come in a cheap plastic type of bottle.</li>
            <li> This one wins hands down - can&#x27;t believe the difference.  </li>
            <li> The oil is good but not great for very dry hair, it gave my hair a shine but did not hydrate my hair</li>
            <li> like I used to because after only two little drops my hair feels so smooth and untangled that I have no problem to brush it.</li>
            <li> and I really do feel like my hair dries faster when I let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> I have natural hair and have been natural for about 4 years never once finding a product that can provide enough moisture to get through the day.</li>
            <li> freak)..A decent blow dryer goes a long way...</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and puts such a shine on it...</li>
            <li> I actually like the smell of the other brand a little better</li>
            <li> Okay, I have thick, dry, color treated, frizzy hair (</li>
            <li> Since receiving Arganesque, and using it daily with my hair dry, and putting a little in the  shampoo and conditioner, my hair has improved tremendously!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American very soft long hair, I roller set my hair every week.</li>
            <li> old daughter&#x27;s long blonde hair for a silkiness and shine.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and less mess!</li>
            <li> It does no take very much at all and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> When I first applied the product my result was VERY HEAVY and oily hair.  </li>
            <li> The pump design helps to limit waste of the oil and helps to distribute a decent amount.</li>
            <li> so this bottle will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> so I think this bottle should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need hair spray anymore and don&#x27;t need to use a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I took a chance and used it this morning on dry hair, since the bottom half looked a little dry, and the top had a few strands sticking up.  </li>
            <li> Last night  I washed my hair and let it air dry then put a dime sized amount in.</li>
            <li> If my hair gets dry again before the next washing</li>
            <li> I have natural, black, 4B hair.</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t work for me, everyone&#x27;s hair type is different, so there is a chance it might work for you, but if you do decide to give it a try, do not be surprised if you discover it&#x27;s a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Just a small amount seemed to breathe new life into my hair!  </li>
            <li> I actually was buying this for a friend who has very dry hair but thought I&#x27;d get one for me too</li>
            <li> Just a little applied after shower or swimming and my hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I blow dry and flat iron</li>
            <li> /&gt;It shipped way earlier than I expected too</li>
            <li> I used my Argan oil night before last and even went to bed with it wet.</li>
            <li> Until recently my hair was down to my knees, and rather dry for the last foot, and this argan oil saved my hair from being straw.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this and other similar products off and on over the years</li>
            <li> Same as other oils I have used and am using.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair with split ends</li>
            <li> But I am always looking for something that works for my dry, frizzy, &amp;#34;fly-away&amp;#34; hair.  </li>
            <li> (I still use a thermal spray after it&#x27;s dry, before I flat-iron.)  </li>
            <li> Immediately,  I saw and felt improvement in the texture of my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I apply it on dry hair when I sleep and on damp hair before I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 49-year-old woman with thyroid disease and dry brittle over processed hair.  </li>
            <li> My friend introduce me to this product after hearing me complain about my hair and how dry and frizzy it is, my hair was thinning out on the sides also.</li>
            <li> The oil conditions it enough that a round brush and a blow dryer are the only styling tools I need.  </li>
            <li> I have stray away from using cones on my natural tightly coil hair but this product absorbs in my hair like nothing other.</li>
            <li> I use this product (5 drops) after shampooing with the Redken all soft and utilizing Pantene intensive hair conditioner and no more dry, frizzy hair...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s blonde, and it has gotten drier through the years, but I don&#x27;t want to weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> I was really tentative to try any kind of oil for my hair, but I live in Salt Lake City, and in the cold air, my hair gets static-y like crazy and I needed something to help tame it in the winter months.  </li>
            <li> also tried it on my dry feet based on another review, and I like it for that purpose too!  </li>
            <li> Wash the hair apply wet or dry</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works, and you only need a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I decided to go back to an argan oil product (having previously been a Moroccan oil user).</li>
            <li> and I use this on wet hair and also on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is always unmanageable, very dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> After applying this to my hair once every couple of days, I noticed visible improvement to my hair - rather than being very dry, my hair is now softer and shinier.  </li>
            <li> my long, dry hair is now shinier, less fly-away, and softer.</li>
            <li> It is not earth-shaking, but it is all I expected of it.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to a few friends of mine already and will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> It amazes me that I can even reapply to dry hair when needed, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> before i use this, i use anther oil is more expensive, but not good.</li>
            <li> so I have to remember that a little still goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as oily as other ones I&#x27;ve tried even though I realize it is in fact an oil.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually out of control looking the next morning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dying my hair to blond and it doesn&#x27;t affect my color on other side</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried well over a dozen other hair moisturizers and argan hair oils</li>
            <li> but I felt it was a little too much for my really thin and greasy hair.</li>
            <li> I put three pumps on wet hair, and let it air dry like i usually do.  </li>
            <li> It did just what I wanted - added a little shine and made it look less dry before I touched it up.  </li>
            <li> (My hair is a dark brown.)</li>
            <li> if sparsely used wont weight your hair down or make it too greasy-</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t look greasy AT ALL, nor is it weighed down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since cut it due to life changes!  </li>
            <li> just was well as other products but doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy</li>
            <li> I have extremely damaged, thick, and dry hair.</li>
            <li> Previously used Moroccan Oil and prefer it</li>
            <li> bottle is actually quite big, so it&#x27;s not that expensive per use.  </li>
            <li> After shampoo/condition I sprayed my Miracle 10 for blondes underneath and on the bottom half of my hair to the ends.  </li>
            <li> and I no longer use a wig, as I previously did on occasions.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use even dry shampoo because it just makes my hair sticky and dull looking (my hair is glassy shiny,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been so dry lately</li>
            <li> I have thick, lots of curly long hair, I washed my hair and  towel dried it, used like 5 pumps of the oil and pulled my hair in a pony tail, went to work and by the time i went home</li>
            <li> When I got this, I saw how thick it was and scared me a little, but I have dry hair from using accutane, so I just put it on the mid-part to ends, and my hair is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> little after</li>
            <li> I have long hair, every time i just put very small among to the hair.</li>
            <li> My hair when straightened is a little passed collar bone length.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised but there are a few things that I think could be improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t waste time rubbing it in like I had to with the lotion I was using before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer now.  </li>
            <li> humidity in NJ is harsh)...</li>
            <li> putting it in towel dried hair, i had a lot fewer tangles...</li>
            <li> Not too heavy like grease or pomade.</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil worked well to tame the frizz in my wavy hair, and also added some shine.  </li>
            <li> I would usually think an oil would be too heavy for my hair.  </li>
            <li> and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down in the least.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look bad straight out of bed, but I flat-ironed it as usual.  </li>
            <li> I used my Coppola Keratin shampoo and conditioner as usual.  </li>
            <li> SO in the afro form, I usually use 4 to 5 pumps and just try to distribute it evenly throughout my head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try argan oil for a while, but a lot of it is SO expensive for a tiny bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s there, but it isn&#x27;t overbearing, at least not to</li>
            <li> That said, it doesn&#x27;t have any negative effects either.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and unruly.  </li>
            <li> Hair still very dry very expensive not to work</li>
            <li> ( I started having to color it  in my late 20&#x27;s!)</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS VERY THICK, AND</li>
            <li> , I think I&#x27;m addicted</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the fragrance in it is one I&#x27;m allergic to.</li>
            <li> , it sounds weird to say</li>
            <li> Made it look dull and dirty!)</li>
            <li> so I was afraid it was building up in my hair.</li>
            <li> I hate coconut smell and go out of my way to avoid any products with that smell or oil in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was attracted to the great packaging -- this product was surprisingly velvety smooth and not oily/greasy.  Used a small amount in my hair (natural hair) &amp; it was very, very smooth and also blended in very well.  Smells great too!  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my permed hair feel...it took about a week for me to see results but I really like this stuff! Smells nice too!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from someone and I have to admit that it&#x27;s a fantastic product. I was so surprised at how beautiful the bottle was compared to other Argan oil brands that I&#x27;ve used before in the past. Usually they come in a cheap plastic type of bottle. Aside from the fact that the bottle is gorgeous, this Moroccan oil is wonderful. It gives my hair a brilliant shine, and leaving it feeling like no other Argan oil that I have used before. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I NEED A PRODUCT LIKE THIS DAILY.  MY HAIR IS VERY THICK, AND UNRULY.&lt;br /&gt;THIS TAMES IT DOWN.&lt;br /&gt;THIS OIL  IS NOT STICKY, OR GREASY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; GOOD PRICE FOR THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product! Last night  I washed my hair and let it air dry then put a dime sized amount in. The oil instantly smoothed and tamed strands. This morning I put just a tiny bit more on the ends and boy is my hair shiny. It&#x27;s weightless and smells amazing. Definitely worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;It shipped way earlier than I expected too, I am a  very impressed customer!</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and unruly.  A few drops of ArganEsque Moroccan Argan Oil and my hair is much easier to manage.  Leaves a nice shine</li>
            <li> I recently received this Moroccan Argan Oil Hair Treatment and i could definitely say i am in love with this product.It comes with a great packagaing and the bottle looks so luxurious.I have dry hair with split ends and i am using this twice a week as hair treatment..Now,m loving my hair.It does have very beautiful smell.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on my hair and it looked and felt lovely. Unfortunately, the fragrance in it is one I&#x27;m allergic to. Fortunately, it made a wonderful gift for my sister-in-law.</li>
            <li> Received product when promised.  Previously used Moroccan Oil and prefer it but this product is still good.  Great for fine hair.  Puts life back into your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best product that I have ever used for the hair. Since the first day I really noticed the changed in it. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m African American very soft long hair, I roller set my hair every week. It&#x27;s been so dry lately but I like the body so didn&#x27;t bother me. I put some of this on before the rollers and  little after and it made it soooooo soft and still full of body and a nice shine. It smells good and the bottle is great. I will continue this with my weekly pamper. Wash the hair apply wet or dry it&#x27;s great. Will order more when this bottle is gone (0:</li>
            <li> Overall I think this is a really good Moroccan Argan oil. It works as advertised but there are a few things that I think could be improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;1. I could instantly feel my hair get softer after applying the oil and it made my hair easier to comb through&lt;br /&gt;2. The oil is very light and didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all like others I&#x27;ve tried&lt;br /&gt;3. I applied the oil to my hair both while damp and in 2, 3, &amp; 4 day hair and even in 4 day hair it still worked very well&lt;br /&gt;4. The oil gives my hair a slightly better shine than I&#x27;ve gotten with other Moroccan oils I&#x27;ve tried&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;1. While my friends really love the smell which is very noticeable when you use the oil. I would have preferred that the oil be scent-free&lt;br /&gt;2. The Glass bottle is very luxurious and nice, but with little ones running around my house I would have preferred a plastic bottle&lt;br /&gt;3. As I only need a couple of pumps when I apply it to my hair, I wish there was a smaller size available</li>
            <li> I won this in a give away and man am I sure glad I did, this oil is AMAZING!!! I kid you not. It makes your hair feel so soft and manageable. The is oil and not at all greasy. MY HAIR FEELS LIKE BUTTERRRRRR!!! Definitely worth the price. This product is now a staple in my hair regime.</li>
            <li> Have been using this daily for about a week now and I&#x27;m in love with it!  I actually was buying this for a friend who has very dry hair but thought I&#x27;d get one for me too and it&#x27;s been great, has def made my hair much softer. My hair didn&#x27;t have any real issues to start so I&#x27;ll have to make another comment on how my friend likes it once she&#x27;s been using it for a bit. I really like the smell and the texture of the oil itself, it sounds weird to say but it&#x27;s not as oily as other ones I&#x27;ve tried even though I realize it is in fact an oil.  I&#x27;ve mainly been putting it on on damp hair out of the shower and I really do feel like my hair dries faster when I let it air dry.  I&#x27;ve got mid-back length hair and 2 pumps worth seem like just the right amount so this bottle will last me a long time. After I put it through my hair my hands don&#x27;t have any oily residue so it&#x27;s very light, absorbs well and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down in the least.  Would totally recommend this even for someone who maybe isn&#x27;t in need of any hair repair but just wants softer, healthier hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a hair oil to use on my natural hair which will leave it soft and manageable and this product does that.  My hair is able to absorb and retain all the other products that I use, which reduces the amount of products that I use in my hair.  Hope my response does not confuse would be buyers.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It smells nice and is not heavy. I saw an instant improvement in my hair.  I highly recommend ArganEsque Moroccan Argan Oil for hair treatment.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of the great reviews, as I have tried a couple of other Argan Oil-infused products before and they were just okay.  But I am always looking for something that works for my dry, frizzy, &amp;#34;fly-away&amp;#34; hair.  Well, WOW!  This stuff actually works, and you only need a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;I have started mixing one pump (about a pea-sized amount) with my conditioner, and then using another pump on my damp hair before styling.  If my hair gets dry again before the next washing 2 or 3 days later, I use another pump just on the ends to re-soften.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has NEVER been soft like this before.  And believe me, I&#x27;ve tried everything over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it on my dry feet based on another review, and I like it for that purpose too!  It absorbs in quickly, so I don&#x27;t waste time rubbing it in like I had to with the lotion I was using before.  My feet feel soft now too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is actually quite big, so it&#x27;s not that expensive per use.  I will definitely continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last 2 weeks and it is wonderful!  I have color treated hair with blonde hi-lites and it was starting to look frizzy.  My hair texture is changing as I am turning gray. The first time I used this hair treatment, I was amazed how my hair styled just like I wanted. It is soft,shiny and no frizz. The smell is awesome!  My hair will look good for 2 or 3 days with just a quick application of the oil treatment, brush it and use the flat iron if necessary.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. I love it!</li>
            <li> I would usually think an oil would be too heavy for my hair.  It&#x27;s blonde, and it has gotten drier through the years, but I don&#x27;t want to weigh it down.  After shampoo/condition I sprayed my Miracle 10 for blondes underneath and on the bottom half of my hair to the ends.  That&#x27;s more of a conditioning spray.  I have to use something else to avoid flyaways.  I used the Argan oil while it was still damp, and I noticed my hair was silkier and more manageable.  I took a chance and used it this morning on dry hair, since the bottom half looked a little dry, and the top had a few strands sticking up.  I don&#x27;t shampoo every day, because I have long hair and don&#x27;t want to dry it out any more than necessary.  It did just what I wanted - added a little shine and made it look less dry before I touched it up.  I used maybe a dime size on my palm, rubbed my hands together and spread it lightly over a section, then repeated as needed.  I probably did that three times in all, different areas.  I thought it would be better than too much at once.  This is a keeper!  I&#x27;d order again.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I went out of town without it.  I used my Coppola Keratin shampoo and conditioner as usual.  My hair did NOT do as well!!!!  I used my Argan oil night before last and even went to bed with it wet. It&#x27;s usually out of control looking the next morning.  It didn&#x27;t look bad straight out of bed, but I flat-ironed it as usual.  The next morning I almost didn&#x27;t have to do anything to it!!  It looked soft, shiny, and was behaving great.  I have almost zero frizziness when using the Argan oil.  I&#x27;m a firm believer now.  It amazes me that I can even reapply to dry hair when needed, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  Obviously, I don&#x27;t overdo it, but I still use more than I&#x27;d think I could get by with. I compared it to another brand, which has great reviews - the HSI, since I have that flat iron. I used the HSI brand twice to give it a chance, then went back to this one. This one wins hands down - can&#x27;t believe the difference.  My sister bragged on my hair yesterday when I used it, and I didn&#x27;t use the conditioning spray first. (I still use a thermal spray after it&#x27;s dry, before I flat-iron.)  No other brand from now on!!!  I think this one&#x27;s even less, and you get a good size for the money.</li>
            <li> I bought ArganEsque oil based on the reviews on Amazon.com.  I like the smell, shine, and feel of it on my hair.  I also like that it isn&#x27;t greasy on my hands.</li>
            <li> I must say my hair without it is horror! . my hair gain its silkness and become live after dying it which truly made so upset, but now with this products and other products of Argan I am so pleased about my hair condition</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.  Did not work on my hair at all  Hair still very dry very expensive not to work</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil worked well to tame the frizz in my wavy hair, and also added some shine.  Really strong customer service from the seller.</li>
            <li> amazing oil with cheap price. this item come with very safety package.I have long hair, every time i just put very small among to the hair. it make your hair looks healthy and softy. before i use this, i use anther oil is more expensive, but not good. This ArganEsque Moroccan Argan Oil have cheap price and high quality made.I will buy more after.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Works very well....great company to order from...quality product and fast shipping.  Will definitely order again.  Was happy that this brand worked so well, since I was switching from a quality product that is more expensive that this one..</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that I&#x27;ve been controlling with John Frieda Frizz Ease Serum and Aquage, both work great but use silicone&#x27;s to control frizz so I was afraid it was building up in my hair. I decided to go back to an argan oil product (having previously been a Moroccan oil user). This actually holds my curls just was well as other products but doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy and it smells so good that the first night I used it my husband commented on how good my hair smelled. I have yet to see if this tames the frizzy ends that occur in my layers when I straighten my hair but I have no doubt that it will. I totally recommend this!</li>
            <li> I purchased this Argan Oil treatment after my moroccan friend was recomending me the argan oil for hair and I was so happy I found this product.It has a very pleasant scent and I don&#x27;t have to use any conditioners after wash like I used to because after only two little drops my hair feels so smooth and untangled that I have no problem to brush it.I&#x27;m dying my hair to blond and it doesn&#x27;t affect my color on other side I got compliments that my hair color is nice and shiny.Sofar I am very satisfied with this product and I will definitely buy it again in my future.</li>
            <li> I have been using Arganesque for about 3 weeks now and love the way it has helped rehabilitate my hair.  I have to color treat my hair because a majority of it is gray ( I started having to color it  in my late 20&#x27;s!) and now,as I approach 50, it has gotten very dry,even though I only wash it once a week. Since receiving Arganesque, and using it daily with my hair dry, and putting a little in the  shampoo and conditioner, my hair has improved tremendously! It is much more supple and once again shiny.  (My hair is a dark brown.) I love how it feels and I really enjoy the fragrance of the Arganesque. I have been very happy with this product and I love my hair again!</li>
            <li> I love this oil and I use this on wet hair and also on dry hair.  It does no take very much at all and a little goes a long way.  I apply it to mostly the ends and not the roots.  It has a very nice bottle and the smell is divine.  This is definitely a great treat for the hair, and the price is low when compared to what you pay for other oils.  This is equal to the Moroccan brand.  Hope this answers any concerns.</li>
            <li> I never had a product that feels so silky smooth and the  absortion is AWESOME! I have stray away from using cones on my natural tightly coil hair but this product absorbs in my hair like nothing other. The shine that it leaves my hair is  Awesome! Honestly, all the oils (I was currently using love potion9 by a you tuber) I have use haven&#x27;t moisturize my hair to this level, this is a keeper! And the smell is Awesome too! Arganesque oil does have cones in it but my hair is Awesome! My hair has shine to the 20th power!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used several different brands of Argan oil and until ArganEsque Moroccan Argan Oil did not realize the difference once you have the best. Great product!</li>
            <li> Thanks for this product! I swim 4 times a week and argan oil has saved my hair. My hair was getting brittle and I couldn&#x27;t get a comb thro it.  Now, that problem has completely disappeared. Just a little applied after shower or swimming and my hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I had used the more expensive Moroccan hair oil and decided to try this instead.  To me it seems to work just the same, leaving my newly permed hair soft and manageable.  It just takes a tiny bit for my hair so I think this bottle should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Okay, I have thick, dry, color treated, frizzy hair (humidity in NJ is harsh)...I use this product (5 drops) after shampooing with the Redken all soft and utilizing Pantene intensive hair conditioner and no more dry, frizzy hair...&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to use my flat iron on most days...&lt;br /&gt;I also use a Rusk blower dryer (speed freak)..A decent blow dryer goes a long way...&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, it is a great product!!!!!</li>
            <li> This hair treatment is wonderful...Makes my hair soft and puts such a shine on it...Also it has a wonderful smell.. I&#x27;m very happen with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells great too! Leaves hair soft and silky and healthy looking too. Overall a very good product. Loved it.</li>
            <li> Immediately,  I saw and felt improvement in the texture of my dry hair.  Just a small amount seemed to breathe new life into my hair!  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this oil,  I have thick, lots of curly long hair, I washed my hair and  towel dried it, used like 5 pumps of the oil and pulled my hair in a pony tail, went to work and by the time i went home my hair was dried,  let my hair down it was nice and silky, applied one more pump of the oil and it looked nice and by pulling my hair back it was straightened a little so it really looked nice.  Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  The Argan Oil is great!  I can use it on my hair and in my lotion also.</li>
            <li> I have superfine and little hair- this product- if sparsely used wont weight your hair down or make it too greasy- love it! And the price is so much better then some other brands</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with the results and I&#x27;ve only used it for a week now. The serum is easy to apply, leaves my hair super soft and frizzie free and does not feel greasy or oily. The scent is AMAZING!! I cannot describe the scent, but it is heady and alluring and several people have remarked on the scent and how shiny my hair is now. I highly recommend this product and this company. The customer service has been outstanding!</li>
            <li> It took a little experimenting to figure out the amount that will work, but once you get that figured out, it is a great product.  I have curly, medium length hair and use four squirts, or about a dime sized dollop, and work it through damp hair.  Because I have a lot of frizz problems, I follow up with a leave in conditioner, and so far this is my best anti-frizz regime.  If you are using too much, your hair will feel and look slightly greasy, but with the right amount it absorbed nicely and leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair is damaged for over processing and this stuff works great to help so it doesn&#x27;t look dry.</li>
            <li> This product is nice..it does what it professes to do.  It is not earth-shaking, but it is all I expected of it.</li>
            <li> This product really worked on my naturally frizzy and coarse hair.  After I used it, my hair was smooth and beautiful and did not look or feel oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  This product did end up leaving my hair feeling greasy not always but sometimes.  I also couldn&#x27;t find any list of ingredients for this product anywhere on the internet including on their own web page.  It is made in china and for that reason I am assuming that the amount of argan oil in this product is negligible.  Every time I open it I am assaulted by the coconut smell.  I hate coconut smell and go out of my way to avoid any products with that smell or oil in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought another bottle that claimed it was 100% pure argan oil after I researched that product.  And LO and BEHOLD!!!!!  No coconut smell at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a case of Buyer Beware!!  And furthermore, I challenge this product to post it&#x27;s ingredient list with it&#x27;s posting on Amazon.</li>
            <li> super great, my dyed blonde straw-dry hair started feeling softer right away. it smells pretty decent as well and was bigger than i expected</li>
            <li> this is good stuff!  my long, dry hair is now shinier, less fly-away, and softer. a really good moisturizer. putting it in towel dried hair, i had a lot fewer tangles...much easier to brush.  will definitely buy this again.  price is right and delivery very quick. love it.</li>
            <li> finally, a great hair serum that works: detangles my past shoulder-length wavy hair, gives shine and luster without weighing it down, and smells good! I don&#x27;t even wear my perfume anymore to work because the glorious scent complements the way it makes my hair feel and look. Defnitely will recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> I am using every morning after shower.Works as it describe.I also use couple of drops with shaving cream in morning and work great as well.I am fully satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> This oil is extremely light. Not heavy at all so I have to remember that a little still goes a long way. It makes my hair more manageable, shiny, and soft. It smells great by default. I added it to my deep conditioner and that made it better and even created a different and better smell for the conditioner. The bottle is very attractive and so is the packaging. The pump design helps to limit waste of the oil and helps to distribute a decent amount. I have natural, black, 4B hair. My hair when straightened is a little passed collar bone length. SO in the afro form, I usually use 4 to 5 pumps and just try to distribute it evenly throughout my head. It is something I try not to overdo. Also the top comes off, which made it easier to add to my conditioner and would make it easy to refill if by any chance they sold bulk sizes of the oil. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was recommended by my stylus to purchase this product.  When I first applied the product my result was VERY HEAVY and oily hair.  I would experiment with it the first couple times.  I have ALOT of hair and applied way to much....But it does make you have soft curls!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for some other more pricey brand. This is just what I needed; cheap and good quality.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;I have applied it just twice up till now and can easily feel the difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value for money. I wish it was even more affordable!</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotion (rather unexpectedly, too!) and I will be purchasing it again.  I love this stuff.  My hair loves it too.  Until recently my hair was down to my knees, and rather dry for the last foot, and this argan oil saved my hair from being straw.  I&#x27;ve since cut it due to life changes!  But I still use the argan oil, because it makes my hair feel &amp; look so healthy and shiny, and smells wonderful too.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This oil is excellent for dry hair, my daughter and grand daughter were complaining of dry unhealthy looking hair, I bought this for them and they are extremely pleased with the result!</li>
            <li> The oil is good but not great for very dry hair, it gave my hair a shine but did not hydrate my hair so I use it with olive oil to get the best of both worlds. I would buy it again at lower price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried well over a dozen other hair moisturizers and argan hair oils and this is the only one that truly works. I blow dry and flat iron so my hair takes a beating. The ends are noticeably split and damaged. Nothing has been able to treat the damage enough to hide it until I used ArganEsque. It&#x27;s miraculous. I apply it on dry hair when I sleep and on damp hair before I blow dry it. I can&#x27;t live without it now. It smoothes the ends, adds shine, and leaves it unbelievably soft without adding weight or greasiness. LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Okay, I have baby fine, stick straight hair that gets greasy REALLY fast, I can&#x27;t go more than a day without a shower.  I was really tentative to try any kind of oil for my hair, but I live in Salt Lake City, and in the cold air, my hair gets static-y like crazy and I needed something to help tame it in the winter months.  I am on Fall break this week so I figured it was a good time to try oils, since I could hide at home and wash it out if I had to and not be stuck at school with a mess of oily hair.  I put three pumps on wet hair, and let it air dry like i usually do.  And it doesn&#x27;t look greasy AT ALL, nor is it weighed down.  There is a vanilla scent to this, so be aware of that, if you are sensitive to scents.  I am sensitive to scents and it didn&#x27;t bother me a whole lot.  It&#x27;s there, but it isn&#x27;t overbearing, at least not to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing product and it seems to help keep my hair from being static-y, but we&#x27;ll put it to the true test next week when school is back in.  But I was really impressed with this and how it didn&#x27;t make even my hair which looks greasy with any products in it, look greasy.  I can&#x27;t use even dry shampoo because it just makes my hair sticky and dull looking (my hair is glassy shiny, the kind I tried said it adds shine. NOPE. Made it look dull and dirty!) But, this stuff seems to be a miracle product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 49-year-old woman with thyroid disease and dry brittle over processed hair.  I put a couple pumps in my short hair before blow drying it.  It feels great and still has volume.  I can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through it during the day.  I don&#x27;t need hair spray anymore and don&#x27;t need to use a flat iron.  The oil conditions it enough that a round brush and a blow dryer are the only styling tools I need.  COULD NOT BE HAPPIER!  It smells great too.  My husband talks about how good my hair smells and feels.  I feel like a teenager again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this and other similar products off and on over the years and I have noticed no effect on my hair. If there is any at all, it is negligible.  That said, it doesn&#x27;t have any negative effects either. It simply doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me.  While it doesn&#x27;t work for me, everyone&#x27;s hair type is different, so there is a chance it might work for you, but if you do decide to give it a try, do not be surprised if you discover it&#x27;s a waste of money.  If it does work for you, then that is great, but don&#x27;t get your hopes up too high.</li>
            <li> First off, I have to say that I love this pump bottle. Easy to use and less mess! ArganEsque leaves my hair soft and shiny. I apply it while my hair is still damp from the roots to the ends. Whether I use a flat iron or just style with my hairdryer and a brush, the results are great. I&#x27;ve also been using this in my 5 yr. old daughter&#x27;s long blonde hair for a silkiness and shine. The smell is also a plus. It reminds me of a very light baby powder scent. The price is great for 3.4 fl. oz. I paid so much more for a much smaller bottle of HSI Argan Oil last year. Won&#x27;t so that again. ArganEsque is a keeper!</li>
            <li> Received my bottle about a week ago and so far so good. I use it after haircuts and I like the way it makes my hair feel. Not too heavy like grease or pomade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks and I absolutely love it! I have natural hair and have been natural for about 4 years never once finding a product that can provide enough moisture to get through the day. I&#x27;ve used everything from olive oils to keratin treatments but have not recieve even close to the same results. I also love how it&#x27;s not heavy or too oily! I WILL be ordering another bottle soon, I think I&#x27;m addicted LOL!</li>
            <li> I really recommend you buy this!! I put in on 30 min before I shower then rinse it off and so far its working for me!!</li>
            <li> This was my first time bying this product for my very soft, but super curly hair. (II&#x27;m biracial). Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Finally, a product that does all and more than what it promotes. My hair is always unmanageable, very dry and brittle. I purchased this product after reading some reviews and am I pleasantly surprised. After a couple weeks of use as directed, my hair is easy to manage, looks great, very soft. This is one product you can count on to do what is states.</li>
            <li> It makes my (dry) hair shiny, silky, and i like it very much. The oil is not heavy and it smells well. Thank you for this product and for the best service, Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Tried this for the first time and i love it!! The product smells great and leaves hair shiny and smooth....im thinking i should have stocked up</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and have been searching for a good hair oil product.  Came across this product as I was doing research on Amazon and saw good reviews.  Ordered it and and the shipment arrived on time.  After applying this to my hair once every couple of days, I noticed visible improvement to my hair - rather than being very dry, my hair is now softer and shinier.  It looks a lot nicer and I no longer use a wig, as I previously did on occasions.  I have recommended this product to a few friends of mine already and will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I like this oil because its not too oily, my hair is still very manageable after using it! I will most definitely order it again. Plus the company ArganEsque I purchased it from has checked up on me 2 times to make sure I like the product mo other company has done that for me!</li>
            <li> I actually found this product while looking for another argan oil brand. It looked good and cost about $12 bucks less so I gave it a try although it didn&#x27;t have many reviews yet. Both my daughter and I have been using it and we both really like it. It provides a really nice shine and has a very good smell. I actually like the smell of the other brand a little better but this one smells really good too. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This item was okay. I don&#x27;t feel that it lived up to all the raves it had. Same as other oils I have used and am using.</li>
            <li> I have extremely damaged, thick, and dry hair. I purchased the argan oil hoping it would help me in any way based on the reviews I read. I can&#x27;t say it has done anything for me. I have been using it for a year, and haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in the quality of my hair. It does smell good and the bottle has gone this long, but I would not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> My friend introduce me to this product after hearing me complain about my hair and how dry and frizzy it is, my hair was thinning out on the sides also. I started using this product and in about 2 weeks I started noticing the difference in my hair, I am very, very happy with the results. I also started using it on the back of my heels. My heels are very cracked and dry, this products left my heel looking great its not cracked and dry anymore, it look and fells great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try argan oil for a while, but a lot of it is SO expensive for a tiny bottle. When I got this, I saw how thick it was and scared me a little, but I have dry hair from using accutane, so I just put it on the mid-part to ends, and my hair is not greasy at all. Plus, this smells sooooo good! I could have put more in if I wanted. Better than BioSilk!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine introduced me to ArganEsque and lets see ...I&#x27;ve been using this product in my house now for about 2 weeks &amp; I freakin love it!!! I have relaxed hair and its not too heavy, or oily and not to mention it smells great.  I also use it on my son and my daughter who have natural hair.  I have been looking for one product that we all could use and I&#x27;ve finally found it. This is an oil that has provided enough moisture to get us through the day. I&#x27;ve used everything from olive oils, oil sheen to good ole fashioned \\&quot;hair grease\\&quot; and have never receive even close to the same results. and like i said before I FREAKIN LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Best thing I have ever tried. I use it for my hair and it leaves it feeling really healthy and it smells wonderful. At first I was using it as a leave in before styling but then my mom bought me some leave in cream with extra heat protection so now I am mostly using it as a gloss after I am done styling, and occasionally I will use it when I let my hair air dry so it has some shine to it. But still, I would say it was effective as a heat protectant as well.  I also have to mention that I did try the chi argan oil as well and I prefer this one since it is more lightweight. The chi was good but I felt it was a little too much for my really thin and greasy hair.</li>
            <li> smells amazing and can easily be used as a lotion..... one of my favorites</li>
