            <li>so glad I found  again</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Old spice makes great bodywashes.</li>
            <li>and although it&#x27;s available in stores, Amazon had a better deal.</li>
            <li>I like the strong smell</li>
            <li>The three pack is great for my current situation being that I am using one of two showers depending on roommate situation</li>
            <li>Helps me smell good and the 3 pack is a better deal than the individual bottles.</li>
            <li>It smells great and the smell lasts long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; body wash, it&#x27;s the next thing to use on top of dish soap, honestly the stuff that&#x27;s in this body wash</li>
            <li>My wife really likes the way I smell when I use this stuff in the shower, and her opinion counts for a lot. :-)</li>
            <li>Smell is not as strong as on most of the old spice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Using the Old Spice body wash is a great way to get a little more of the scent that girls seem to love.</li>
            <li>Product was as described and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Decent smelling liquid soap, but doesn&#x27;t lather as well as others, like Dove&#x27;s product, so you need to use more.</li>
            <li>Love the old spice body wash family.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and at the very least I feel clean and fresh after using it.</li>
            <li>It was a great price and he has enough to last for quite some time now.</li>
            <li>The scent is pretty nice and goes normal after half an hour.</li>
            <li>Expected it to provide better deodorant protection.</li>
            <li>They arrived fast and 3 to a box.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real person, Leo, NY</li>
            <li>Instead, I bought the original and the pure sport version of the same product but nothing compares with the playmaker scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>another great product from old spice, great aroma and lasts quite long too bad they have decided to discontinue this scent</li>
            <li>This is a body wash and was a decent price on Prime</li>
            <li>A classic.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend bought this one for me not realizing I like high endurance.</li>
            <li>but I prefer the high endurance.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t soap up as easily and last as long as others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an old product that does</li>
            <li>In my opinion, Old Spice is some of the best-smelling body wash out there for men.  </li>
            <li>If you like Old Spice, this is 3x the Old Spice.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like Old Spice, move along.</li>
            <li>Always have been a fan of Old Spice.</li>
            <li>I like the Old Spice brand and fragrance.</li>
            <li>I bought this because i use Old Spice deodorant</li>
            <li>I use fresh a lot, when compared to that playmaker is not good as fresh.</li>
            <li>It apparently lathers, and the bathroom smells a LOT after my kid takes a shower.  </li>
            <li>My husband will only use this Old Spice.</li>
            <li>After stores around where I live quit selling this, we went as far as 60 miles to other stores for this..</li>
            <li>May be due to older age?</li>

Just because I can&#x27;t smell how awesome I smell doesn&#x27;t mean other people around me can&#x27;t!

            <li> This smells good but irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> Best smelling Old Spice. I wish they still carried the line up in stores. Will be surely missed when they run out.</li>
            <li> It apparently lathers, and the bathroom smells a LOT after my kid takes a shower.  I think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s supposed to happen.</li>
            <li> This is a body wash and was a decent price on Prime so I got it.  Smells pleasant and is not overdone like some AXE body wash scents do.  Recommend</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped purchasing this body wash from retail stores due to the already marked up price. This 3-pack is shrink wrapped and sealed. 18 Fl oz goes a long way and I have purchased this pack several times now. I don&#x27;t see a reason to not grab this product again and again.</li>

            <li> A classic. My husband will only use this Old Spice. The light, but pleasant smell lasts all day. The three pack lasts 3 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body wash for several years now and the new (at least to me) Playmaker version is the best yet. Lathers up well with a great scent and rinses off clean.</li>

            <li> Works good good cleaner.  Smell is not as strong as on most of the old spice.  Why I gave it 4 stars.  I like the strong smell</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on my old spice deodorant (sounds random but women always think i&#x27;m wearing cologne when it&#x27;s just the old spice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the Old Spice body wash is a great way to get a little more of the scent that girls seem to love. It works well as soap obviously - i&#x27;m on a horse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; body wash, it&#x27;s the next thing to use on top of dish soap, honestly the stuff that&#x27;s in this body wash is TERRIFYING, ur really not doing your skin any good. I recommend kyoku for men or Molton brown</li>
            <li> If you like Old Spice, this is 3x the Old Spice. 1/3 the shopping? Ok, internet, you win. If you don&#x27;t like Old Spice, move along.</li>
            <li> I used to buy it at my local store but i couldn&#x27;t find it anymore. Instead, I bought the original and the pure sport version of the same product but nothing compares with the playmaker scent.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I found  again my favorite scent at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for carrying this great product!</li>
