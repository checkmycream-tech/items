            <li>best bargain for men&#x27;s hair pomade around.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this product</li>
            <li>Works great and affordable.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome and cheap.  </li>
            <li>Works great on fine hair to hold textures in place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dozens of hair pastes over the years, and this is by far the best for creating a Fight Club messy/matte look.</li>
            <li>Very crafty.</li>
            <li>Nothing works better on holding my hair in shape.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair feeling just a tad sticky, but also allows you to be able to rework your hair throughout the day.</li>
            <li>and this stuff is like glue, and not terribly greasy either.  </li>
            <li>All my girlfriends love the smell.</li>
            <li>pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li>Washes out easily</li>
            <li>easy to work with in hair and holds all day.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend the product liked it very much</li>
            <li>For those of you who are like me, a water-soluble product is a HUGE plus.</li>
            <li>I was happy they brought this product back and just changed the packaging.</li>
            <li>Overall still a good product, but I am always looking out for a better product.</li>
            <li>These products are super easy to use and give me the desired style I want.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I used this paste all through 2012 and love that it holds my shortish, fine, wavy hair in place all day while still looking and feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try other ones but I am happy with this for the moment</li>
            <li>This is pretty close and it works fine.</li>
            <li>It smells like \\&quot;Axe\\&quot; or a strong cologne, which might be ok in a nightclub, but not so much in the professional workplace where any sort of strong fragrances are discouraged.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re done using the product, simply wash your hands with warm soap and water and it&#x27;s all gone.</li>
            <li>stuff is relatively inexpensive and it held just fine throughout the day while remaining pliable enough to give my hair some play which I liked.</li>
            <li>This is my current favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>It has just enough hold, stays put all day and makes it easy to restyle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a male (26) with straight, fine, short/medium brown</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally found a product that is cheap and works well with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very pasty unlike the gel type, which I like about.</li>
            <li>but I have to use slightly more for the same effect, and like when using the &#x27;old&#x27; product if you use too much it flakes.</li>
            <li>I have used other products that have had a strong smell, and this one has almost no smell even when you inhale right at the container.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great reworkable paste that does not dry shiny or too hard.</li>
            <li>This is just to give a comparison to the older 3 oz.</li>
            <li>I still have some of the &#x27;old&#x27; product, and comparing side by side the &#x27;new&#x27; product is much softer and does not seem to have as much hold.</li>
            <li>It does seem to look a little better</li>
            <li>I do not think either the old or the new have any noticeable odor.</li>
            <li>I got this for my 10 year old son to spike his hair in the front.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not messy or greasy.</li>
            <li>I used the &#x27;old&#x27; product for about a year.</li>
            <li>The scent is moderate and doesn&#x27;t really add or detract from the product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like so many other hair</li>
            <li>I was always trying products that would either be too heavy (thus leaving my hair very flat looking) or too light (leaving my hair either flaky with product or unstyled).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very low soft fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a good hair paste and when you finally do, they usually end up discontinuing it before too long.  </li>

            <li> This stuff is awesome and cheap.  Keeps my hair spiked but moldable.  Not greasy.  Washes out easily</li>
            <li> A dab will do you.  Works great on fine hair to hold textures in place.</li>

For those of you who are like me, a water-soluble product is a HUGE plus. Simply wash with soap and water once.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the product liked it very much</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t necessarily work for my type of hair, ended up giving it to a friend who loves the stuff though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of hair pastes over the years, and this is by far the best for creating a Fight Club messy/matte look.</li>
            <li> Very pasty unlike the gel type, which I like about. Recommend for longer hair.</li>
            <li> The paste I used Unstoppable is discontinued. This is pretty close and it works fine. I&#x27;ll try other ones but I am happy with this for the moment</li>

            <li> easy to work with in hair and holds all day.  very low soft fragrance.  I&#x27;m happy with this product</li>
            <li> My go too for hair styling! Works great and affordable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great reworkable paste that does not dry shiny or too hard. It leaves hair feeling just a tad sticky, but also allows you to be able to rework your hair throughout the day. I&#x27;ve tried other products, and this has been the reigning champ for me.</li>
            <li> This is my current favorite hair product. It has just enough hold, stays put all day and makes it easy to restyle.</li>
            <li> best bargain for men&#x27;s hair pomade around.  I have very thick hair and this stuff is like glue, and not terribly greasy either.  for the price and effectiveness, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male (26) with straight, fine, short/medium brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;When I ran out of my usual product (Aveda Grooming Clay), I rushed to the drug store to try a few other products, including this, until I could order more of my usual. I&#x27;ve also used American Crew Molding Clay, and L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s Hair Putty which aren&#x27;t so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is relatively inexpensive and it held just fine throughout the day while remaining pliable enough to give my hair some play which I liked. It gives a little texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;The shine it provides is a little too unnatural making my hair look way too greasy for my liking. The smell is extremely overpowering and it definitely doesn&#x27;t fade. It smells like \\&quot;Axe\\&quot; or a strong cologne, which might be ok in a nightclub, but not so much in the professional workplace where any sort of strong fragrances are discouraged.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a good hair paste and when you finally do, they usually end up discontinuing it before too long.  Why is that?  Anyway, I used this paste all through 2012 and love that it holds my shortish, fine, wavy hair in place all day while still looking and feeling soft and clean.  No crunchy hair here.  The scent is moderate and doesn&#x27;t really add or detract from the product.  The only thing keeping this from being 5 stars is that they used to package this as 3oz but have now reduced it to 2oz, while keeping the price the same.  Very crafty.</li>
            <li> I have been using Got2b hair products for years.  I used the palmade as well as the spiking and sculpting paste.  My hair is thick and curly and wavey.  These products are super easy to use and give me the desired style I want.</li>
            <li> I was happy they brought this product back and just changed the packaging. The bummer is it has less product. It was 3oz and is now 2oz.</li>
            <li> I had spent years looking for a product that holds my thick hair all day without feeling gross.. Either to hard or too sticky. I&#x27;ve been using this for years now. All my girlfriends love the smell. I can use it in combination with gel to get a stronger hold that lasts all day. Miss the larger containers though.</li>
            <li> Have used this hair product for a few years now, it&#x27;s more expensive through Amazon so only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I bought it once and won&#x27;t again till the price comes down.</li>
