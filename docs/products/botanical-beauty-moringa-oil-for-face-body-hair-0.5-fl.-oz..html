            <li> I plan to take this on my travels as it really gives your skin a glow when you are tired and running around a bunch.  </li>
            <li> I use just a small amount on my face and neck and it literally makes your skin like a little baby.  </li>
            <li> but I got to use a small portion</li>
            <li> It is working slowly.</li>
            <li> This brand has really bad smelling oils.</li>
            <li> The product worked for what I needed it for, but the smell was terrible.</li>

            <li> I loved to use this  on my face, especially under my eyes and my neck.  However, I have not found it to replace it.</li>
            <li> Great oil.... must have.</li>
            <li> The product worked for what I needed it for, but the smell was terrible. This brand has really bad smelling oils.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic.I loved it.It is definitely on my forever list of things to take the rest of my life.....</li>
            <li> I use moringa oil mostly as a treatment to recover dry hair. It moisturizes the scalp and fights with itching and flaking. I also massage it in the scalp and leave it for a few minutes – best source of vitamins for hair follicles and scalp. Moringa oil is known to help reduce split ends and dandruff if used on a weekly basis. Giving it 5 stars, love the feel of this oil.</li>
            <li> healped in healing dry skin</li>
            <li> Great for hair moisturizing</li>
            <li> This is a real good moisturizer for the skin and I also use it on the nails every night at bedtime.  Really good for the cuticles!</li>
            <li> Too early to know about results in the long run. It is working slowly. I will revisit for another review.</li>
            <li> It smells kind of like a bean!&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my skin at night before I sleep instead of a toner or lotion&lt;br /&gt;I like it enough and my skin absorbs it! I will buy again!</li>
            <li> I will be better able to evaluate the results from the use of the oil after 30 days of continued use. The product arrived on time and un-damaged.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating, but not as brightening as other products.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely an oil full of vitamins, but it smells exactly like freshly squeezed wheat grass.</li>
            <li> I think this oil is fantastic.  I use just a small amount on my face and neck and it literally makes your skin like a little baby.  Within a week of doing this I had people come up to me and kind of make some comment about my health.  I don&#x27;t even know these people but it&#x27;s a nice compliment.  For the price this is a a good deal for the effects it offers.  I plan to take this on my travels as it really gives your skin a glow when you are tired and running around a bunch.  It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Bought it and used it for my eczema. It it great. Wonderful product. My daughter spilled the first bottle but I got to use a small portion and it really works so this is my second bottle</li>
            <li> Moringa is one of nature&#x27;s miracles. I drink it in my tea. Now I&#x27;m going to use it on my skin. This oil is awesome. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It has been doing  very well for my skin. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this moringa oil. It&#x27;s great for the skin, I am using it for my husbands psoriasis. He has a mild case but it&#x27;s really helping. I also use it for any joint or muscle pain. Another thing I really like about it is that the scent is very mild. I definitely recommend it. God&#x27;s gift to humanity!</li>
