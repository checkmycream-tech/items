            <li> Only about 4 inches wide by 4 inches long.</li>
            <li> mascara came dry</li>
            <li> Colors are nicely pigmented some might be a tad sheer so you will need a primer or base eyeshadow as a primer.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t opened it yet, but was surprised that it was so small.  </li>
            <li> as described but not really worth the money...was much smaller than I imagined but not the fault of the seller</li>
            <li> This should only be purchased for little girls to play dress-up.  </li>
            <li> The picture does make it seem a little bit bigger</li>
            <li> Also, eye pencil does not really appear on my eye.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the makeup quality since she was only 7</li>
            <li> I wanted it to be about half the size.</li>
            <li> JUST HALF</li>
            <li> So I kept it myself and gave it to my little nieces to use whenever they&#x27;re here.</li>
            <li> The mascara was dried up and nasty, the eye pencil was more like and actual pencil for how &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; it went on, and the shadows hardly seemed to apply at all.</li>
            <li> It is flower shaped and opens up a few ways.</li>
            <li> Smaller than it looks (my bad), not enough applicators.</li>
            <li> and i like the fact that its small.</li>
            <li> not satisfied with quality</li>
            <li> I was actually pretty disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> product is delicate.</li>
            <li> As for the rest of it, I am seriously considering buying a set for myself.</li>

            <li> hate this set it  very disappointed due to....mascara came dry didn&#x27;t work on my lash ......Walgreen had a better choice</li>
            <li> Excellent seller! Transaction smooth! High recommendations. My wife and dougthers is it and they love it, their frieds ask what they are using and where tu buy it</li>
            <li> great seller, nice product</li>
            <li> Beautiful shell when closed and a nice selection of makeup.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a granddaughter for Christmas.  Haven&#x27;t opened it yet, but was surprised that it was so small.  Only about 4 inches wide by 4 inches long.</li>
            <li> My item had came early than the expected date and i like the fact that its small. i take with me where ever i go. I think it is just perfect. the colors are beautiful. the brushes suck but i dnt really care i ordered some better ones. i only bought it because of the eyeshadow colors and lip colors and the blush colors. Overall i am very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter and it was awesome and amazing she loved it, it doesn&#x27;t take up much room on her Desk. It was just what she was looking for.</li>
            <li> I purchased this makeup kit as a Christmas gift for my 15 year old niece. It came in perfect condition with no broken cakes. The presentation and color selection is nice. The quality of everything in it? I don&#x27;t know since it was a gift. I do have a set of Shany eye shadows and they are of very high quality though.</li>
            <li> Very good quality makeup for the price and the case is really cool too!</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected, however, thats what my wife wanted and she loves it. Great colors and good selections.</li>
            <li> It comes exactly as it is shown in the picture. There are so many varieties for the shadow... I especially like the sparkly ones. The lip gloss requires you to had some clear lip gloss on your lips but it turns into a beautiful finish. The only thing is that the shadow does not seem to last to long but is very pretty. Also, eye pencil does not really appear on my eye. I have to keep rubbing and applying. Overall, it&#x27;s nice, especially if you&#x27;re looking for blush and shadow. :)</li>
            <li> SHANY Makeup set - Eyeshades, blush, lip gloss, mascara. My sister loves it. I actually brought this for my use; however my sister fell in love with it and has taken full control of it. She love the variety of colors, the mascara isn&#x27;t a quality one and smudges a lot so she does not make use of it. The lip colors aren&#x27;t too bright but they are ok for lip gloss. As for the blush well I don&#x27;t use them so I can give a review on them. Good product though.</li>
            <li> as described but not really worth the money...was much smaller than I imagined but not the fault of the seller</li>
            <li> I would love to have the photographer of this kit take a picture of my house because it would increase the size of my house three-fold.  Is the picture taken with a fish-eye lens?  What appears to be a decent-sized kit actually can fit in the palm of your hand.  Kind of rinky-dink, definately small travel-sized kit.  Pigments are OK but not suited for any school or professional use.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a graduation gift for a cosmetology student and she loved it! Great gift for a great price!</li>
            <li> Much smaller than it appeared. Item looked nice but not what we wanted. Sent back.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it!</li>
            <li> This kit was bought for our four year old granddaughter who just loved it.  She had a great time playing grownup.</li>
            <li> Smaller than it looks (my bad), not enough applicators. Otherwise fine.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot but the photo made it seem bigger than it really is</li>
            <li> This item was super super tiny and it made for an embarrassing present. So I kept it myself and gave it to my little nieces to use whenever they&#x27;re here. But it would probably be great for traveling. If you can use that kind of makeup.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice makeup.It will be good to give someone for a gift.maybe it&#x27;s not as good of a quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister. I got a great deal on it during black/cyber week so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much however it was perfect and nice. My sister loved it and said it was great and everything she needs.</li>
            <li> product is delicate. expected more quality. not satisfied with quality</li>
            <li> Great set. Super value.</li>
            <li> Great present for my pre-teen niece</li>
            <li> This make up was purchased for my 13 year old daughter she was very happy with it. There is alot of colors to choose for perfect for a 13yr old.  Fast delivery</li>
            <li> I love the makeup kit I bought. it has alot of eye shadows to choose from, blush lip gloss, ect easy to pack and carry</li>
            <li> Bought as a play makeup set for my 5-year old daughter.  She loves it!  (I took out the mascara.)  I love how it all stays in one place.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my adult daughter. She loves it. The makeup is great. Vibrant colors too.</li>
            <li> My niece loved it. Good gift for kids.</li>
            <li> product received , 100 % recommended . thank you</li>
            <li> good sized mirror, good and simple colors for beginners, the lip gloss works great and all of the colors are not to dark</li>
            <li> Good gift for teenagers</li>

            <li> This kit is way smaller than the photo, but it is still great if you have a teenager or someone who is just a beginner at make up. It&#x27;ll give them all the tools they need to try things out while experiencing quality at the same time. Colors are nicely pigmented some might be a tad sheer so you will need a primer or base eyeshadow as a primer.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a travel kit, used it once and threw it out rather than pack it to bring home.  This should only be purchased for little girls to play dress-up.  The mascara was dried up and nasty, the eye pencil was more like and actual pencil for how &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; it went on, and the shadows hardly seemed to apply at all.</li>
            <li> My niece is in love with this make up set. It has just about everything you need all in a cute case.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as shown and it is well organized and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This was for my daughter for Christmas. It is exactly what I expected! I am not sure about the makeup quality since she was only 7 but she sure does enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Everything is an displayed.</li>
            <li> it was for my grand daughter and she really liked it,  you got it to her in just a couple or days, thanks</li>
            <li> My daughter recieved this for christmas. She is all about wanting make up. Great all over kit with a little of everything!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. It has EVERY color you could possibly want no matter what your skin tone, eye/hair color. I ordered it though and, as it was classed as &#x27;travel size&#x27; I wanted it to be about half the size. PLEASE CAN YOU MAKE EXACTLY THE SAME THING JUST HALF THE SIZE PLEASE? Then it would be PERFECT!</li>
            <li> Gift for someone. They liked it</li>
            <li> It is very much-so as it is described. It is very compact but so beautiful inside. It has lots of extraordinary eye shadow colors. But I like them. It has everything you need in a makeup set. I was surprised by how fast it shipped. It is a wonder packed into a box. Get it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it is perfect for my niece who is eleven. It is not that she wears makeup, but it looks like a fun play time makeup kit for a little girl. Came on time and wrapped for christmas.</li>
            <li> I love it, and use it a lot, but the colors for the lipgloss don&#x27;t match my skin. and the make up gets everywhere and it tends to get a bit dirty.i wish it had more color options for blush. the eyeshadow is very nice, it has nice color option. the real makeup is a bit darker than shown in the picture. but all together it is very good quality and is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  PS: i am using my dads acount, so don&#x27;t think my dad is wearing makeup :)</li>
            <li> It was a very nice set But the mascara was unusable.</li>
            <li> a mi madre le va a encantar para esta navidad . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> I was actually pretty disappointed in this product. Not to mention the ingredients It&#x27;s regrettably made with, but the fact that the eyeliner pencil and mascara were only about two inches long. The mascara was clumpy and wouldn&#x27;t go on properly, and the eyeliner was more of a cheap grey color. The whole thing in general was really small. I just really didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> My daughter got this at Christmas time and I must say it really is a good makeup kit. It is flower shaped and opens up a few ways. Also includes mascara and brushes!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product today and I have to say I am impressed with it!  I like the idea of having all of the makeup in one place, plus the colors are beautiful!</li>
            <li> I love this set. It has everything you need in one place. I especially love the shimmery shadows. They are so pretty!</li>
            <li> my daughter loved it! she uses it daily :) she loved the shape and it came with everything she wanted, and its very easy to apply...</li>
            <li> I love this kit!put it in your purse and go.why are so many people buying this for little girls?they don&#x27;t need makeup</li>
            <li> My teenagers absolutely loved these I gave them as a birthday present my kids loved them more than everything else.</li>
            <li> A great gift to your relatives, girlfriend or wife.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and was surprised by the vibrant color selection. Almost wanted to keep it for myself.</li>
            <li> The picture does make it seem a little bit bigger but I wanted something compact and easy to travel with for my sister in law. She LOVED it!!! It includes so much in such a compact package and looks great. Everyone was asking me where I purchased it so they can order some for themselves and as presents. I will definitely be ordering more. The size is about the palm of your hand but looks very cute and includes makeup essentials.</li>
            <li> My daughter received this as a gift. She is 7, and likes to play dress up and \\&quot;make Mommy beautiful\\&quot;. The eyeliner and mascara aren&#x27;t great (remember the days of using a lighter to apply eyeliner?), but she doesn&#x27;t use them anyway. As for the rest of it, I am seriously considering buying a set for myself. All in all, a really nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-J. Fuller</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;whoo hoo&amp;#34; of joy from my 14 year old granddaugter told me this was a hit for her age group. Has everything, and includes instructions in applying eye shadow - a bit of good advice for teenagers!</li>
            <li> Folds to a triangle but opens up to display a nice make-up set.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter.  Not as big as she thought it would be, but 10x&#x27;s bigger than the others listed.  You should make sure to compare net oz.</li>
            <li> I like the colors and all the makeup you get for ur money but I wish the set was bigger. This is good for travail or to put in your bag.</li>
