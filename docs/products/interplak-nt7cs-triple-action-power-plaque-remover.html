            <li>It gets 4 stars instead of 5 for not having the timer, but otherwise seems to be an excellent unit.</li>

            <li>Great product for a great price!</li>

            <li>it was AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>It does an excellent job of teeth cleaning, better than any of the others.  </li>
            <li>Ever since I&#x27;ve started using this toothbrush (recommendation from a friend), my dental visits get better and better!!!  </li>
            <li>Good Luck</li>
            <li>Anyway, I decided that I loved electric toothbrushes and that I&#x27;d upgrade to the Philips Sonicare Elite Toothbrush...</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve moved around, each dentist I&#x27;ve gone to has commented that there is practically nothing to do at my teeth-cleaning appointments, and that my gums are very healthy.  </li>
            <li>so you can guess that I love them!  </li>
            <li>I have been using Interplak brushes for many years and have been very happy with how well they clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>and it is just as amazing as I remember it, AND</li>
            <li>It was good to be able to zone out and let the unit tell me when it is time to stop.    </li>
            <li>This is the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used - at any price - feels like you just come from the dentist -     Highly recommended</li>
            <li>This is, by far, the best electric toothbrush around.</li>
            <li>So far, I am very happy with it</li>
            <li>But then your gums get STRONG!</li>
            <li>I think the timer is very important, and I miss it on this one.</li>
            <li>I have used the Interplak/Waterpik electric tooth brush for many years.  </li>
            <li>I had been using the Braun Oral B for many years</li>
            <li>My gums feel much better too.</li>
            <li>They also make an excellent device called a Water Pik for cleaning between the teeth that is also head and shoulders above the competing products.</li>
            <li>I attribute it to this toothbrush which was recommended by a periodontist many years ago, and I&#x27;ve used it exclusively since.  </li>
            <li>The Amazon price for this model is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>Much better.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, it&#x27;s cheaper to buy to start [</li>
            <li>I imagine 80 bucks would be considerably more, today.</li>
            <li>good cleaning action, good to travel as it holds a charge for over a weeks cleaning</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I started hunting around for this brush, and I&#x27;m SO glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I expect better from Amazon as I buy a lot from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I find more debris from between the teeth in the sink.  </li>
            <li>but my dentist always tells me to keep up the good work, so I must be doing something right.    </li>
            <li>I used to own one of these a long time ago and it was a very good unit.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean after using this.</li>
            <li>And you teeth are clean and it&#x27;s like using dental floss while brushing!</li>
            <li>1st &amp; most important</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t fit, but I fig&#x27;d surely Amazon straightened that out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad these are still available.</li>
            <li>No other electric toothbrush that I am aware of on the market today has this excellent feature.</li>
            <li>Easy on the gums and the enamel of the teeth.</li>
            <li>it cannot be easily replaced]  inexpensive    </li>
            <li>So now I do and it works fine.</li>
            <li>But if they worked perfectly in the first month they all lasted for several years.  </li>
            <li>and it says to use light pressure.</li>
            <li>My hygenist is always amazed at how free my teeth are of plaque.  </li>
            <li>Comes with a note that customers also bought a Conair Interplak Replacement Heads Bonus Pack that doesn&#x27;t fit the brush.</li>
            <li>I plugged it in but it did never charged and the light did not illuminate (The socket works).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just make sure you buy the right replacement heads.</li>
            <li>The unique design allows for cleaning in even the smallest spaces and under the gumline, too.</li>
            <li>I have used an Interplak toothbrush since they first came avaiable many years ago.</li>
            <li>It is truly unique.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this as a replacement, and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I can never get my teeth to feel as clean as when I use the interplak system.</li>
            <li>I just want something to clean my teeth and give the gums a workout.  </li>
            <li>Teeth did not feel clean after using.</li>
            <li>For a $20 investment, that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li>and I insist that all of my loved one&#x27;s do the same.  </li>
            <li>This is the best electric toothbrush available, except for the poor quality rechargeable batteries.  </li>
            <li>Gels are best, but you can use regular creamy toothpastes regularly or intermittently.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Interplak toothbrush for many many years, even back when Bausch &amp; Lomb was the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>I prefer Interplak&#x27;s brushing motion over other brands; it reaches more areas of the teeth more easily.</li>
            <li>am not a really good oral hygenist, but the Interplak more than makes up for it - my dentist is amazed at how good my teeth look - and he thinks I brush and floss more often than I do ;-).</li>
            <li>The model 12207 lasted significantly longer than my first toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Remember the more completely the battery is drained the longer</li>
            <li>Using this brush I rarely have to floss</li>
            <li>I got used to the early models of the interplak and never found anything better.  </li>
            <li>If it lasts a year, it will be well worth it.</li>
            <li>I noticed, another reviewer had a good suggestion of charging the unit, only when necessary, to prevent the memory condition that plagues most rechargeable cells.</li>
            <li>So you&#x27;ll have to charge your toothbrush more frequently, and the battery will die sooner.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why Conair doesn&#x27;t do a better job marketing this product because it is my favorite hands-down over Sonicaire and the other electric toothbrushes I have tried.</li>
            <li>You have to learn how to use it with the right amount of pressure.    </li>
            <li>The brushhead is the right size for me</li>
            <li>In fact, this item is unavailable right now.</li>
            <li>Brush is small but does a great job.</li>
            <li>I like this electric Toothbrush very much.</li>
            <li>I brush them until I am thru, thank you very much.    </li>
            <li>I was real excited to find this electric toothbrush for such a reasonable price.   </li>
            <li>I bought my first Interplak toothbrush in 1990, as recommended by my orthodontist, to help me clean around my newly installed braces.  </li>
            <li>Our family used the Interplak since it first came out at $99.  </li>
            <li>Next be sure to charge for around 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>For the most part, electric toothbrushes are a matter of personal preference.  </li>
            <li>I have owned several of these Interplak toothbrushes over many years</li>
            <li>it really hurts and feels like it will chip or crack your tooth!  </li>
            <li>The first one I bought years ago was around 80 bucks.</li>
            <li>That brush is nothing more then a standard toothbrush that vibrates and pulses.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Interplak tooth brush since they first came out.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, be aware that if you use toothpaste, your toothbrush will have to work harder, and your toothbrush&#x27;s battery will drain more quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have used this type of toothbrush since their first positive review in Consumer Reports over 15 years ago.  </li>
            <li>and it really was only touching the surfaces of my teeth.</li>
            <li>It did do a good job of polishing the outside of my teeth, despite the discomfort, but left between the teeth for floss.    </li>
            <li>The new head for model NT7CS seems just right.  </li>
            <li>Direct Plug-In Rechargeable Power Plaque Remover]] and would recommend shelling out the extra money as the DPI9R has a much stronger battery and cleans more powerfully on its high setting than the NT7CS.</li>
            <li>It cleans teeth very well, however, so I&#x27;ll keep getting them, I guess.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself works very well, been using my almost 2 years</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>(much easier at this price).</li>
            <li>It does the job very well.</li>
            <li>The reason this electric toothbrush is superior to any other on the market is simple.</li>
            <li>cannot send it back because I do not have the original packaging.</li>
            <li>I have had an older model for 3  years that has served me very well.</li>
            <li>Charge it up, and then use it over the course of several days until it runs out of power, and then give it a full charge again.</li>
            <li>The concept of the rotating tufts is excellent, but the execution is bad.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>Also be sure to use very little or no toothpaste - I use mouthwash only &amp; then follow with a quick manual brush w/ toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>She bought a new one.  </li>
            <li>On the advice of my new dentist, I purchased the Interplak NT7CS.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even bother with the warranty, they will charge you as much as a new one when you consider freight.</li>
            <li>you can just order a new one.  </li>
            <li>&amp; last, about recharging be sure to turn the less charged brush on several more times to completely drain the battery after you&#x27;ve quit using it cuz it wasn&#x27;t spinning enough to brush with.  </li>
            <li>I recall in 1990 using Interplak-brand toothpaste with the toothbrush, but only for awhile, until the first tube ran out.  </li>
            <li>When the battery eventually died in my first Interplak toothbrush, a new model had been developed, the model 12207, which I bought for my second Interplak toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>They do not last long, but they are cheap.  </li>
            <li>I use it and like the size of the brush for getting way back in the mouth, but I will most likely purchase a more expensive brush real soon.</li>
            <li>when I&#x27;m brushing w/ the newely charged 1 as it takes a few more cycles on the under powered brush to go from &#x27;cant use it cuz it stops when I put it on mt teeth&#x27; to &#x27;wont barely</li>
            <li>I like the toothbrush, it feels like it is definitely doing a better job than my previous electric toothbrush.      </li>
            <li>, also, they are soft.</li>
            <li>I ended up replacing it after two weeks with an Oral-B Professional.</li>
            <li>Each set of bristles rotates independently and it really cleans in between teeth.  </li>
            <li>The brush head is a bit smaller, and there is no 2-minute timer, but it is much quieter and the battery can be replaced (if you can find one...</li>
            <li>My first Waterpik (now Interplak)  lasted several years, though I had to send it back for repair twice.  </li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s pretty gross actually....</li>
            <li>I started looking at the other, more expensive brushes and was prepared to buy one, when I thought I&#x27;d do a search for Interplak, and I was pleasantly surprised to find it available for THIS price.    </li>
            <li>The Interplak systems wins hands down.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have had with the unit was when it was brand new.  </li>
            <li>Either way, I am out-of-pocket 24 dollars and Amazon will not take it back and exchange for a new one.</li>
            <li>But then, I think most of the other brushes are just gimmicky, and they&#x27;ll come out with another gimmick in a couple of years to keep \\&quot;improving\\&quot; their design.</li>
            <li>But it only takes a minute to clean the handle with a brush that has stiff bristles.</li>
            <li>And now several newer models have been developed.  </li>
            <li>Tooth paste is not actually necessary to get rid of plaque, it the mechanical action of a brush moving over the teeth that cleans the plaque causing bacteria to be removed.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is that they only last 18 to 24 months, but since they&#x27;re not very expensive.</li>
            <li>the right model# for this toothbrush is 12167-W, and it is expensive, with shipping 1 replacement head cost about the same price as a new toothbrush, I am switching to another brand for easier replacement brush-head, is a sham, I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Using the several ports to rinse the brush head with clear water delays this inevitable process by a factor of 10.</li>
            <li>No other toothbrush has a design that can get deep in between teeth.</li>
            <li>With 2 you can drain the 1st ones battery completely after at least 10+ 2 minute brushings &amp; just pick up the 2nd one &amp; get right back to work.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a long time Interplak user, and truly believe that no other product can come close to the thorough cleaning of Interplak.</li>

            <li> I prefer Interplak&#x27;s brushing motion over other brands; it reaches more areas of the teeth more easily.</li>
            <li> am not a really good oral hygenist, but the Interplak more than makes up for it - my dentist is amazed at how good my teeth look - and he thinks I brush and floss more often than I do ;-).</li>
            <li> The model 12207 lasted significantly longer than my first toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Remember the more completely the battery is drained the longer</li>
            <li> Using this brush I rarely have to floss</li>
            <li> I got used to the early models of the interplak and never found anything better.  </li>
            <li> If it lasts a year, it will be well worth it.</li>
            <li> I noticed, another reviewer had a good suggestion of charging the unit, only when necessary, to prevent the memory condition that plagues most rechargeable cells.</li>
            <li> So you&#x27;ll have to charge your toothbrush more frequently, and the battery will die sooner.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why Conair doesn&#x27;t do a better job marketing this product because it is my favorite hands-down over Sonicaire and the other electric toothbrushes I have tried.</li>
            <li> You have to learn how to use it with the right amount of pressure.    </li>
            <li> The brushhead is the right size for me</li>
            <li> In fact, this item is unavailable right now.</li>
            <li> Brush is small but does a great job.</li>
            <li> I like this electric Toothbrush very much.</li>
            <li> I brush them until I am thru, thank you very much.    </li>
            <li> I was real excited to find this electric toothbrush for such a reasonable price.   </li>
            <li> I bought my first Interplak toothbrush in 1990, as recommended by my orthodontist, to help me clean around my newly installed braces.  </li>
            <li> Our family used the Interplak since it first came out at $99.  </li>
            <li> Next be sure to charge for around 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> For the most part, electric toothbrushes are a matter of personal preference.  </li>
            <li> I have owned several of these Interplak toothbrushes over many years</li>
            <li> it really hurts and feels like it will chip or crack your tooth!  </li>
            <li> The first one I bought years ago was around 80 bucks.</li>
            <li> That brush is nothing more then a standard toothbrush that vibrates and pulses.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Interplak tooth brush since they first came out.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, be aware that if you use toothpaste, your toothbrush will have to work harder, and your toothbrush&#x27;s battery will drain more quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have used this type of toothbrush since their first positive review in Consumer Reports over 15 years ago.  </li>
            <li> and it really was only touching the surfaces of my teeth.</li>
            <li> It did do a good job of polishing the outside of my teeth, despite the discomfort, but left between the teeth for floss.    </li>
            <li> The new head for model NT7CS seems just right.  </li>
            <li> Direct Plug-In Rechargeable Power Plaque Remover]] and would recommend shelling out the extra money as the DPI9R has a much stronger battery and cleans more powerfully on its high setting than the NT7CS.</li>
            <li> It cleans teeth very well, however, so I&#x27;ll keep getting them, I guess.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself works very well, been using my almost 2 years</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> (much easier at this price).</li>
            <li> It does the job very well.</li>
            <li> The reason this electric toothbrush is superior to any other on the market is simple.</li>
            <li> cannot send it back because I do not have the original packaging.</li>
            <li> I have had an older model for 3  years that has served me very well.</li>
            <li> Charge it up, and then use it over the course of several days until it runs out of power, and then give it a full charge again.</li>
            <li> The concept of the rotating tufts is excellent, but the execution is bad.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> Also be sure to use very little or no toothpaste - I use mouthwash only &amp; then follow with a quick manual brush w/ toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> She bought a new one.  </li>
            <li> On the advice of my new dentist, I purchased the Interplak NT7CS.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother with the warranty, they will charge you as much as a new one when you consider freight.</li>
            <li> you can just order a new one.  </li>
            <li> &amp; last, about recharging be sure to turn the less charged brush on several more times to completely drain the battery after you&#x27;ve quit using it cuz it wasn&#x27;t spinning enough to brush with.  </li>
            <li> I recall in 1990 using Interplak-brand toothpaste with the toothbrush, but only for awhile, until the first tube ran out.  </li>
            <li> When the battery eventually died in my first Interplak toothbrush, a new model had been developed, the model 12207, which I bought for my second Interplak toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> They do not last long, but they are cheap.  </li>
            <li> I use it and like the size of the brush for getting way back in the mouth, but I will most likely purchase a more expensive brush real soon.</li>
            <li> when I&#x27;m brushing w/ the newely charged 1 as it takes a few more cycles on the under powered brush to go from &#x27;cant use it cuz it stops when I put it on mt teeth&#x27; to &#x27;wont barely</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush, it feels like it is definitely doing a better job than my previous electric toothbrush.      </li>
            <li> , also, they are soft.</li>
            <li> I ended up replacing it after two weeks with an Oral-B Professional.</li>
            <li> Each set of bristles rotates independently and it really cleans in between teeth.  </li>
            <li> The brush head is a bit smaller, and there is no 2-minute timer, but it is much quieter and the battery can be replaced (if you can find one...</li>
            <li> My first Waterpik (now Interplak)  lasted several years, though I had to send it back for repair twice.  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s pretty gross actually....</li>
            <li> I started looking at the other, more expensive brushes and was prepared to buy one, when I thought I&#x27;d do a search for Interplak, and I was pleasantly surprised to find it available for THIS price.    </li>
            <li> The Interplak systems wins hands down.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have had with the unit was when it was brand new.  </li>
            <li> Either way, I am out-of-pocket 24 dollars and Amazon will not take it back and exchange for a new one.</li>
            <li> But then, I think most of the other brushes are just gimmicky, and they&#x27;ll come out with another gimmick in a couple of years to keep \\&quot;improving\\&quot; their design.</li>
            <li> But it only takes a minute to clean the handle with a brush that has stiff bristles.</li>
            <li> And now several newer models have been developed.  </li>
            <li> Tooth paste is not actually necessary to get rid of plaque, it the mechanical action of a brush moving over the teeth that cleans the plaque causing bacteria to be removed.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that they only last 18 to 24 months, but since they&#x27;re not very expensive.</li>
            <li> the right model# for this toothbrush is 12167-W, and it is expensive, with shipping 1 replacement head cost about the same price as a new toothbrush, I am switching to another brand for easier replacement brush-head, is a sham, I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Using the several ports to rinse the brush head with clear water delays this inevitable process by a factor of 10.</li>
            <li> No other toothbrush has a design that can get deep in between teeth.</li>
            <li> With 2 you can drain the 1st ones battery completely after at least 10+ 2 minute brushings &amp; just pick up the 2nd one &amp; get right back to work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time Interplak user, and truly believe that no other product can come close to the thorough cleaning of Interplak.</li>
            <li> This also applies to all other products with Ni-Cad batteries (old cheaper rechargable technology).  </li>
            <li> Triple Action Power Plaque Remover]]and replacement brushes are cheaper than other brands.</li>
            <li> This Interplak has bristles that are different lengths and the long ones actually go between my teeth.</li>
            <li> It remains to be seen how long my model NT7CS will last.    </li>
            <li> this allows the bristles to actually get between the teeth and do a minor job of \\&quot;flossing\\&quot; .  </li>
            <li> If you have anything wrong with the toothbrush, Conair takes care of the problem easily and swiftly.  </li>
            <li> I use a slight bouncing action as I brush,  </li>
            <li> Interplak replaced them, free (except for postage in returning the failed units).  </li>
            <li> The only thing you need to be careful about with the Interplak is the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> The model 12207 had two head sizes:  one seemed a bit large, the other too small.  </li>
            <li> This is due to the fact that the bristles all turn in opposite directions, thus preventing gum damage.</li>
            <li> If I use any other brush, mechanical or regular, then use my \\&quot;Interplak\\</li>
            <li> Personally ,  I wouldn&#x27;t use any other brush for cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li> My main complaint is that the brush shaft is so large at the base that a person can&#x27;t comfortably hold their lips around it to keep the \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; in their mouth.  </li>
            <li> This is the most recent Interplak brush I have purchased and the least expensive.</li>
            <li> The main disappointment is that the vibration of the head will stop if too much pressure is placed against the teeth.    </li>
            <li> Lastly, the thing just shuts down when it has reached the scientifically determined minimum cleaning time of 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Their new vibrating model sucks and even my dentist said so too.</li>
            <li> My last one died after a year, which was a warrentee replacement for one that lasted a few months.</li>
            <li> The price is right for the brush, although the replacement brushes are too expensive, I would buy it again though.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t apply too much pressure, it makes it slow down a little.</li>
            <li> The bristles of the brush are very small and spread far apart.  </li>
            <li> gets 14-15 per charge &amp; the other 11-12.  </li>
            <li> I had read other reviews that mentioned the replacement heads that came with the pkg deal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only reviewed one product here in the past, but I had to comment on this one.</li>
            <li> It seems to me, the patent should have run out on this, which makes me wonder why other manufacturers aren&#x27;t using this design.</li>
            <li> Using this, after using other toothbrushes, you can notice the difference.</li>
            <li> I would never consider buying any other brand.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any other toothbrushes that do this.  </li>
            <li> I found this product works extremely well for removing plaque at the gum line.  </li>
            <li> By the way, use only a small dab of toothpaste if you must.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe I have had a single cavity since I started using this little jewell.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes the button is hard to push in for starting and stopping.</li>
            <li> This one has really LOW power and speed using any common toothpaste I found.  </li>
            <li> The biggest complaint in the reviews I read when I initially researched it was that over time, toothpaste residue would build up in between the ridges of the rubber handle - and it does.</li>
            <li> on/off button has to be pushed harder than is convenient    replacement brushes are not cheap (for any of the Interplak units)    </li>
            <li> A few years back it became hard to get</li>
            <li> After I streted using the 1st one, teeth cleaning timne was cut in half.  </li>
            <li> The new unit for my wife lasted just over a year and then failed to charge at all.  </li>
            <li> I really hate to give it 5 stars, because it is annoying to have to buy a new toothbrush every year when the battery gives out, but its superior cleaning ability cannot be denied.</li>
            <li> IT COSTS LESS THEN 20 PERCENT OF THE SONICARE BRUSH!    </li>
            <li> Other brushes with rotating heads can erode the enamel at the gum line if brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> I usually do this</li>
            <li> The Interplak has kept me from having a continuous stream of small fillings for years.  </li>
            <li> In addition, the Sonicaire makes a real mess as you&#x27;re brushing by flinging lots of the toothpaste all over the bathroom as you brush</li>
            <li> and it still work, but the problem is hard to find replacement brush-head</li>
            <li> The movement of the head is too subtle.    </li>
            <li> This brush has to be of the worst design of any I have used, and I have used several different brands of electric brush.  </li>
            <li> p.s.-I had a SoniCare years ago, and it was NOT good.</li>
            <li> However when I got it home and started to use it I was a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Within 6 months both failed to hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> I thought something was wrong</li>
            <li> The drawback is that in time the toothpaste tends to migrate into the gearing system causing the brush head to fail.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the battery is dying and it is not replaceable.    </li>
            <li> [wrong-</li>
            <li> WRONG!  </li>
            <li> Too bad.]    </li>

            <li> Our family used the Interplak since it first came out at $99.  A few years back it became hard to get so I tried a couple of others (Sonicare, etc), but they simply didn&#x27;t do the job the Interplak does - so I searched and found them here on Amazon and buy them here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a really good oral hygenist, but the Interplak more than makes up for it - my dentist is amazed at how good my teeth look - and he thinks I brush and floss more often than I do ;-).</li>
            <li> I have used the Interplak/Waterpik electric tooth brush for many years.  It does an excellent job of teeth cleaning, better than any of the others.  However, their quality control in the manufacturing process leave something to be desired.  My first Waterpik (now Interplak)  lasted several years, though I had to send it back for repair twice.  When it finally croaked, my wife and I purchased two of these a couple of years ago.  Within 6 months both failed to hold a charge.  Interplak replaced them, free (except for postage in returning the failed units).  The new unit for my wife lasted just over a year and then failed to charge at all.  She bought a new one.  In spite of the endurance problem, it is still the best and cheapest on the market.</li>
            <li> I was real excited to find this electric toothbrush for such a reasonable price.   However when I got it home and started to use it I was a little disappointed.  The bristles of the brush are very small and spread far apart.  The movement of the head is too subtle.    The main disappointment is that the vibration of the head will stop if too much pressure is placed against the teeth.    You have to learn how to use it with the right amount of pressure.    I use it and like the size of the brush for getting way back in the mouth, but I will most likely purchase a more expensive brush real soon.</li>
            <li> I have used these for years, but the quality of manufacture is deteriorating. My last one died after a year, which was a warrentee replacement for one that lasted a few months. It cleans teeth very well, however, so I&#x27;ll keep getting them, I guess.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I ever owned. I have it for over a year now (I wait to write my reviews) and it is awesome. When you 1st switch from a regular toothbrush you may experience some bleeding. That&#x27;s normal. But then your gums get STRONG! And you teeth are clean and it&#x27;s like using dental floss while brushing! Just make sure you buy the right replacement heads. No big deal. A++++++++++++++++++++</li>
            <li> My dentists have always recommended the Interplak electric tooth brush, since it cleans well and also stimulates gums without damaging them. This is due to the fact that the bristles all turn in opposite directions, thus preventing gum damage.</li>
            <li> On the advice of my new dentist, I purchased the Interplak NT7CS. I had been using the Braun Oral B for many years and it really was only touching the surfaces of my teeth. This Interplak has bristles that are different lengths and the long ones actually go between my teeth. This is almost like flossing my teeth! I love it!! Just don&#x27;t apply too much pressure, it makes it slow down a little. I thought something was wrong but I finally read the instructions and it says to use light pressure. So now I do and it works fine. The only thing I miss about the Braun is the 2 minute timer.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself works very well, been using my almost 2 years and it still work, but the problem is hard to find replacement brush-head, the replacement brush-head sell at amazon model#12167 doesn&#x27;t work for this toothbrush, I order twice from different vendor, 1st order 2 x 2 pack only 1 work, 2nd order 4 x 1 pack, none is working, the brush-head does not rotate, I went to interplak home to find out the right model# for this toothbrush is 12167-W, and it is expensive, with shipping 1 replacement head cost about the same price as a new toothbrush, I am switching to another brand for easier replacement brush-head, is a sham, I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> GREAT toothbrush for getting between teeth.  Needs to have L-ion battery &amp; because it has Ni-Cad here are some tips after 5+ years of practice.  1st &amp; most important BUY 2!  With 2 you can drain the 1st ones battery completely after at least 10+ 2 minute brushings &amp; just pick up the 2nd one &amp; get right back to work.  Remember the more completely the battery is drained the longer the battery will last both individual uses &amp; over the years.  This also applies to all other products with Ni-Cad batteries (old cheaper rechargable technology).  I have been using the last 2 I purchased for over 2 years with no noticeable degradation of the number of uses between charges - 1 gets 14-15 per charge &amp; the other 11-12.  Next be sure to charge for around 24 hours.  &amp; last, about recharging be sure to turn the less charged brush on several more times to completely drain the battery after you&#x27;ve quit using it cuz it wasn&#x27;t spinning enough to brush with.  I usually do this when I&#x27;m brushing w/ the newely charged 1 as it takes a few more cycles on the under powered brush to go from &#x27;cant use it cuz it stops when I put it on mt teeth&#x27; to &#x27;wont barely if at all turn on&#x27;.  Well I hope this helps.  Based on some comments I&#x27;ve read this should help w/ the longevity issues. Also be sure to use very little or no toothpaste - I use mouthwash only &amp; then follow with a quick manual brush w/ toothpaste.  Agian let me say this is a GREAT toothbrush for getting between teeth. My gums feel much better too.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used - at any price - feels like you just come from the dentist -     Highly recommended</li>
            <li> The reason this electric toothbrush is superior to any other on the market is simple. Each individual tuft in the brush head (there are 8 of them) is connected to a gearing system that lets each tuft rotate independently of the others. No other electric toothbrush that I am aware of on the market today has this excellent feature. The drawback is that in time the toothpaste tends to migrate into the gearing system causing the brush head to fail. Using the several ports to rinse the brush head with clear water delays this inevitable process by a factor of 10. I have tried a Sonicare and an Oral B to compare. The Interplak systems wins hands down. They also make an excellent device called a Water Pik for cleaning between the teeth that is also head and shoulders above the competing products. Good Luck</li>
            <li> This is the best electric toothbrush available, except for the poor quality rechargeable batteries.  The unique design allows for cleaning in even the smallest spaces and under the gumline, too. My hygenist is always amazed at how free my teeth are of plaque.  I attribute it to this toothbrush which was recommended by a periodontist many years ago, and I&#x27;ve used it exclusively since.  I really hate to give it 5 stars, because it is annoying to have to buy a new toothbrush every year when the battery gives out, but its superior cleaning ability cannot be denied.</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush, it feels like it is definitely doing a better job than my previous electric toothbrush.      I had read other reviews that mentioned the replacement heads that came with the pkg deal didn&#x27;t fit, but I fig&#x27;d surely Amazon straightened that out.  WRONG!  Having to return things is such a hassle!</li>
            <li> I have been using Interplak brushes for many years and have been very happy with how well they clean my teeth. When I go on vacation and have to use a regular brush I can never get my teeth to feel as clean as when I use the interplak system. This is the most recent Interplak brush I have purchased and the least expensive. Using this brush I rarely have to floss but my dentist always tells me to keep up the good work, so I must be doing something right.    I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> For the most part, electric toothbrushes are a matter of personal preference.  I got used to the early models of the interplak and never found anything better.  The ones that vibrate are so annoying I couldn&#x27;t use it.  I just want something to clean my teeth and give the gums a workout.  This one seems to do the trick, but I use it without toothpaste as a pre-brushing exercise.  Anyway, this one works well and is inexpensive.  It doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles of the more expensive ones, but I don&#x27;t need a timer.  If it lasts a year, it will be well worth it.</li>
            <li> Within a month, I needed to contact the manufacturer for a replacement as the switch on it broke.</li>
            <li> Shoots toothpaste and mouthwash all over the bathroom through openings located lower on the brush.  Comes with a note that customers also bought a Conair Interplak Replacement Heads Bonus Pack that doesn&#x27;t fit the brush.</li>
            <li> I have owned several of these Interplak toothbrushes over many years so you can guess that I love them!  If you have anything wrong with the toothbrush, Conair takes care of the problem easily and swiftly.  The only problem I have had with the unit was when it was brand new.  But if they worked perfectly in the first month they all lasted for several years.  To let you know, I have also owned a SONICAIRE and all I can say is, what an overpriced, overhyped piece of garbage.  The Interplak gets rid of the plaque and the Sonicaire never touches the plaque.  In addition, the Sonicaire makes a real mess as you&#x27;re brushing by flinging lots of the toothpaste all over the bathroom as you brush - it&#x27;s pretty gross actually....and if you accidentally touch the brush head to your teeth it really hurts and feels like it will chip or crack your tooth!  The only thing you need to be careful about with the Interplak is the toothpaste.  The grittier the toothpaste, the faster your brush head will wear out.  Not the bristles but the internal gears in the brush head.  Gels are best, but you can use regular creamy toothpastes regularly or intermittently.  I don&#x27;t know why Conair doesn&#x27;t do a better job marketing this product because it is my favorite hands-down over Sonicaire and the other electric toothbrushes I have tried.</li>
            <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve started using this toothbrush (recommendation from a friend), my dental visits get better and better!!!  Thank you Conair!</li>
            <li> Like the individual bristle movement. Easy on the gums and the enamel of the teeth. Other brushes with rotating heads can erode the enamel at the gum line if brushing too hard. This cleans well and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I like this electric Toothbrush very much. The brushhead is the right size for me and I like the individually rotating tufts, also, they are soft. The price is right for the brush, although the replacement brushes are too expensive, I would buy it again though.</li>
            <li> The Interplak has kept me from having a continuous stream of small fillings for years.  Works very well.  They do not last long, but they are cheap.  Don&#x27;t even bother with the warranty, they will charge you as much as a new one when you consider freight.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best electric toothbrush around. I have had Interplak (now Conair) toothbrushes for years and none of the competition -- even the more expensive brands -- come close. The Amazon price for this model is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only reviewed one product here in the past, but I had to comment on this one. I used to own one of these a long time ago and it was a very good unit. This one has really LOW power and speed using any common toothpaste I found.  The battery charge retention is way below that of competing units. The concept of the rotating tufts is excellent, but the execution is bad. I ended up replacing it after two weeks with an Oral-B Professional. Much better.</li>
            <li> I have used an Interplak toothbrush since they first came avaiable many years ago. I prefer Interplak&#x27;s brushing motion over other brands; it reaches more areas of the teeth more easily. What&#x27;s more, it&#x27;s cheaper to buy to start [[ASIN:B000A3ULII Interplak NT7CS Triple Action Power Plaque Remover]]and replacement brushes are cheaper than other brands. SJG-N.J.</li>
            <li> This used to be the epitome of electric toothbrushes. It seems to me, the patent should have run out on this, which makes me wonder why other manufacturers aren&#x27;t using this design. But then, I think most of the other brushes are just gimmicky, and they&#x27;ll come out with another gimmick in a couple of years to keep \\&quot;improving\\&quot; their design. Using this, after using other toothbrushes, you can notice the difference. You can FEEL the penetration between your teeth. And as another reviewer said, you can see the difference in the sink. I notice much smaller particles coming out. The twisting tufts can get around and in everywhere, from every angle.    What else surprises me is the price. The first one I bought years ago was around 80 bucks. I imagine 80 bucks would be considerably more, today. I&#x27;m glad these are still available. I started looking at the other, more expensive brushes and was prepared to buy one, when I thought I&#x27;d do a search for Interplak, and I was pleasantly surprised to find it available for THIS price.    I&#x27;ve had several of these. One of the reasons I had several was because the C cells do, eventually give out. I did replace the cells one time, but found that, with all the gyrations this thing does, the parts in the handle eventually wear, so you might as well throw it out when the cells die, anyway (much easier at this price). I noticed, another reviewer had a good suggestion of charging the unit, only when necessary, to prevent the memory condition that plagues most rechargeable cells.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Interplak toothbrush in 1990, as recommended by my orthodontist, to help me clean around my newly installed braces.  Worked great.  I have used an Interplak toothbrush daily since then (~18 years).    When the battery eventually died in my first Interplak toothbrush, a new model had been developed, the model 12207, which I bought for my second Interplak toothbrush.  It&#x27;s battery finally died recently.  And now several newer models have been developed.  I chose the model NT7CS as my third Interplak toothbrush.  So far, I am very happy with it (I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months).    The model 12207 had two head sizes:  one seemed a bit large, the other too small.  The new head for model NT7CS seems just right.  The model 12207 lasted significantly longer than my first toothbrush.  It remains to be seen how long my model NT7CS will last.    I recall in 1990 using Interplak-brand toothpaste with the toothbrush, but only for awhile, until the first tube ran out.  If you are a first-time user, you will probably want to use toothpaste also.  But the Interplak toothbrush does an awesome job without toothpaste.  As I&#x27;ve moved around, each dentist I&#x27;ve gone to has commented that there is practically nothing to do at my teeth-cleaning appointments, and that my gums are very healthy.  (Perhaps the hydrogen peroxide rinsing I do is partly the reason.)    Anyway, be aware that if you use toothpaste, your toothbrush will have to work harder, and your toothbrush&#x27;s battery will drain more quickly.  So you&#x27;ll have to charge your toothbrush more frequently, and the battery will die sooner.  You can keep the head \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; by pouring mouthwash over it from time to time when you finish brushing.  Also, remember not to keep it on the charger continuously.  Charge it up, and then use it over the course of several days until it runs out of power, and then give it a full charge again.</li>
            <li> good cleaning action, good to travel as it holds a charge for over a weeks cleaning</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended an earlier model of this toothbrush to me about 8 years ago and I bought it and it was AMAZING!  Each set of bristles rotates independently and it really cleans in between teeth.  It did such a thorough job that my dentist thought that I started flossing (even though I hadn&#x27;t).      Anyway, 3 years later the toothbrush stopped working.  The head got clogged and I didn&#x27;t know where to get replacement heads for it (this is before I knew about Amazon).  Anyway, I decided that I loved electric toothbrushes and that I&#x27;d upgrade to the Philips Sonicare Elite Toothbrush... WHAT A MISTAKE!  That brush is nothing more then a standard toothbrush that vibrates and pulses.  It hurt my mouth and was unbearably tickling.  It did do a good job of polishing the outside of my teeth, despite the discomfort, but left between the teeth for floss.    That&#x27;s when I started hunting around for this brush, and I&#x27;m SO glad I did.  I couldn&#x27;t find it locally at any department stores but Amazon had it and it is just as amazing as I remember it, AND IT COSTS LESS THEN 20 PERCENT OF THE SONICARE BRUSH!    It&#x27;s a great buy and I hope it remains on the market for years!</li>
            <li> This brush has to be of the worst design of any I have used, and I have used several different brands of electric brush.  My main complaint is that the brush shaft is so large at the base that a person can&#x27;t comfortably hold their lips around it to keep the \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; in their mouth.  Too, the fact that the shaft has several holes in it lets liquid squirt all over the place when one of the holes comes out of the mouth, as in brushing the front teeth.  And, the brush has only two rows of bristles.    Lastly, the thing just shuts down when it has reached the scientifically determined minimum cleaning time of 2 minutes.  Sometimes I ain&#x27;t thru yet.  I don&#x27;t need a timer.  I brush them until I am thru, thank you very much.    Based upon the sloppiness issue I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband used to have gums that bled when he brushed his teeth, so our dentist recommended that we buy this.  We did and since then, his gums have improved drastically! Great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time Interplak user, and truly believe that no other product can come close to the thorough cleaning of Interplak. My dental hygienist can tell when I&#x27;ve been using another type of tooth brush. No other toothbrush has a design that can get deep in between teeth. I had this model (NT7CS) for three years before it needed to be replaced. For a $20 investment, that&#x27;s good enough for me. The biggest complaint in the reviews I read when I initially researched it was that over time, toothpaste residue would build up in between the ridges of the rubber handle - and it does. But it only takes a minute to clean the handle with a brush that has stiff bristles. I recently replaced it with a newer model, [[ASIN:B000F4Z9NO Interplak DPI9R Direct Plug-In Rechargeable Power Plaque Remover]] and would recommend shelling out the extra money as the DPI9R has a much stronger battery and cleans more powerfully on its high setting than the NT7CS.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush  to take the place of another brand that was sent off for repair. It does the job very well. Sometimes the button is hard to push in for starting and stopping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Interplak toothbrush for many many years, even back when Bausch &amp; Lomb was the manufacturer. I always had bleeding gums every time I brushed my teeth before using the Interplak. Since using it my gums have not bled once. I would never consider buying any other brand.</li>
            <li> I received the item.  I plugged it in but it did never charged and the light did not illuminate (The socket works).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot send it back because I do not have the original packaging. I expect better from Amazon as I buy a lot from Amazon.  I dont know if it is the product or if Amazon sold me a defective one.  Either way, I am out-of-pocket 24 dollars and Amazon will not take it back and exchange for a new one.</li>
            <li> I have used this type of toothbrush since their first positive review in Consumer Reports over 15 years ago.  Each tuft of bristles in the brush head reverses directions several times a second.  I haven&#x27;t found any other toothbrushes that do this.  It is truly unique.  It allows me to only have one dental appointment per year.  I don&#x27;t believe I have had a single cavity since I started using this little jewell.  The only problem is finding replacement heads for it.  In fact, this item is unavailable right now.</li>
            <li> I have been using  INTERPLAK toothbrushes for several years.  After I streted using the 1st one, teeth cleaning timne was cut in half.  Terefore, as soon as one wears out (and eventaully they do), I prompty order another one.</li>
            <li> I found this product works extremely well for removing plaque at the gum line.  I think the brushes rotating in both directions, not just vibrating or spinning in one direction,  make the difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Interplak tooth brush since they first came out.  I use a slight bouncing action as I brush,  this allows the bristles to actually get between the teeth and do a minor job of \\&quot;flossing\\&quot; .  If I use any other brush, mechanical or regular, then use my \\&quot;Interplak\\&quot; I find more debris from between the teeth in the sink.  Personally ,  I wouldn&#x27;t use any other brush for cleaning my teeth and I insist that all of my loved one&#x27;s do the same.  They do so without resistance.  By the way, use only a small dab of toothpaste if you must.  Tooth paste is not actually necessary to get rid of plaque, it the mechanical action of a brush moving over the teeth that cleans the plaque causing bacteria to be removed.  Proof of this to you should be that one does not use tooth paste while flossing</li>
            <li> I have had an older model for 3  years that has served me very well. It has dramatically improved my visits to the dentist. Unfortunately, the battery is dying and it is not replaceable.    I purchased this as a replacement, and I am not disappointed. The brush head is a bit smaller, and there is no 2-minute timer, but it is much quieter and the battery can be replaced (if you can find one...I&#x27;ll start looking for an NiMH replacement).     [Edit 5/10/09 I was wrong about being able to replace the battery. You can get to the battery, but it is soldered in and would be difficult to replace except for someone skilled with electronics. Too bad.]    It gets 4 stars instead of 5 for not having the timer, but otherwise seems to be an excellent unit. I think the timer is very important, and I miss it on this one. It was good to be able to zone out and let the unit tell me when it is time to stop.    Pros:  quiet  battery can be removed (and possibly replaced)  [wrong- it cannot be easily replaced]  inexpensive    Cons:  no timer  on/off button has to be pushed harder than is convenient    replacement brushes are not cheap (for any of the Interplak units)    p.s.-I had a SoniCare years ago, and it was NOT good. Teeth did not feel clean after using. My teeth feel very clean after using this.</li>
            <li> I REFUSE TO BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY UNTIL THEY START MAKING THIS TOOTH BRUSH AGAIN. Their new vibrating model sucks and even my dentist said so too. My teeth reflected it too when I went to the dentist. Interplak has lost their quality.</li>
            <li> An excellent toothbrush.  Would recommend to anyone.  Brush is small but does a great job.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes work well and do a great job.  The only drawback is that they only last 18 to 24 months, but since they&#x27;re not very expensive. you can just order a new one.  We also travel with them everywhere.</li>
