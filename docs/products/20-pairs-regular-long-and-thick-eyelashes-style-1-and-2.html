            <li>My daughters loved them.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re good lashes nonetheless.</li>
            <li>Maybe good for someone who hasn&#x27;t used good quality lashes</li>
            <li>You get a lot for a good price</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t look good at all.</li>
            <li>Good price for a lot of lashes .</li>
            <li>I loved the thiner looking one.</li>
            <li>But loved these anyways.</li>
            <li>Really good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>but they are good.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>but they are defiantly a good price for 20 of them they also do not come with glue</li>
            <li>but the lashes themselves were still in good condition.</li>
            <li>Maybe they are good and are what someone else is looking for</li>
            <li>I really loved these.</li>
            <li>good price.</li>

            <li>They did take two weeks to arrive, but when they arrived they were in good condition.</li>
            <li>They are great for costumes and maybe some nice pictures.</li>
            <li>Absolutely good buy</li>

            <li>and they r awesome u do have to trim them a lil to fit but</li>
            <li>I received them in good condition not smashed.</li>
            <li>I have never put on lashes in my life so these were good to practice with.</li>
            <li>but once you get used to them they look really good.  </li>
            <li>Cheap is not always the best choice!</li>
            <li>these a good lashes, it did take forever for me to receive them.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a good value</li>
            <li>Surprisingly they are good quality.</li>
            <li>good deal for all the eyeslashes</li>

            <li>but both are good.</li>

            <li>They were good lashes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use them when I run out of the good ones.</li>

            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Item was in good condition</li>
            <li>Opt for the Duo lash glue from Sally&#x27;s or a good adhesive from Mac.</li>
            <li>the results are gorgeous</li>
            <li>Good deal, these are my cheapy lashes good for backups.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>Good deal but the glue is noticeable on these.</li>
            <li>and I thought maybe they were good because of the reviews.</li>

            <li>I think it is good</li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to cut them because they fit my eyes perfectly.</li>
            <li>Good communications</li>
            <li>Those lashes were nice had to cut the corners for them to fit my eye, but besides that they look great and the price is excellent.</li>
            <li>but once i applyed them I loved them</li>
            <li>but I guess all in all its a good bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>For the price you are paying it&#x27;s actually a good buy.</li>

            <li>If they &amp;#34;worked&amp;#34; for you I honestly have to wonder what in the world you looked like.</li>
            <li>Love these lashes good price to</li>

            <li>That is amazing customer service I have order many things and have never got an email assuring my happiness.</li>
            <li>Kindly appreciate.</li>
            <li>You do have to purchase your own glue</li>
            <li>so you get some nice milage out of them.</li>
            <li>but i still liked them because i like my eyelashes</li>
            <li>these are ok, not as good as pharmacy ones</li>
            <li>Nice quality for the price took awhile to come but for the price no issue</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll have to buy your own if you don&#x27;t already have.</li>
            <li>just didn&#x27;t like much the materials but for the price into practice is perfect</li>
            <li>and these are nice because they show up on camera.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints about the lashes they are nice.</li>
            <li>so nice and blah blah.</li>
            <li>they are still nice..</li>
            <li>Depending on the occasion and preference they are quality lashes and make a nice beauty addition.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look as nice in person either.</li>
            <li>once on, they looked nice.</li>
            <li>my Niece was absolutely thrilled with the quality of the lashes I was thrilled with the price - I would purchase again</li>
            <li>With some work, trimming and moving they do look nice.</li>
            <li>They came packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled.</li>

            <li>Awesome, need to be cut to size but awesome for a few bucks ^_^</li>
            <li>Not the kind they look in the pic....</li>
            <li>Ah well, practice makes perfect haha.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t feel like plastic, and do look nice once you get them on.  </li>
            <li>Nice shape/band,</li>
            <li>They make my eyes pop so much &amp; look beautiful!</li>

            <li>The lashes are nice.</li>
            <li>The eyelashes were in good condition though  :)</li>
            <li>: These don&#x27;t come with glue, you have to have your own.</li>
            <li>I need to get more of these, good quality</li>
            <li>it can look kind of cheap/ghetto/ratchet.</li>
            <li>Good cheap alternative and reusable!</li>
            <li>They do not look nice at all.</li>
            <li>They are nice lashes.</li>
            <li>I did take a star away because these didn&#x27;t arrive in a box of any kind.</li>
            <li>You can kind of see the band of the lash though.</li>
            <li>Would have been nice....</li>
            <li>The darker pair I can&#x27;t wear as every day use, but they will come in handy if I go to dinner or out.</li>
            <li>What can you expect when you order as much as I did lol.&lt;br /&gt;Overall these lashes are great!</li>
            <li>They are good quailty I love how they look.</li>
            <li>These eyelashes are nice, but you&#x27;ll have to cut or trim them before applying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather spend the money at a store for nice ones.</li>
            <li>They look really nice on.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look nice on your eyes at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I would&#x27;ve loved them</li>
            <li>nice lashes.  </li>
            <li>honestly, for that price its actually really nice.</li>
            <li>Could have been packaged better, but good product.</li>
            <li>I had some handy anyway.</li>
            <li>and in fact all my co workers liked them</li>
            <li>This has a nice selection.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to buy your own glue while you&#x27;re at it.</li>
            <li>nice and neat pack of eyelashes, cant wait to wear them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The thicker ones have a nice feather fringe type look and feel.</li>
            <li>I liked this, it took no time for them to arrive: all fully in tact.</li>
            <li>Stayed Nice</li>
            <li>but I thought and saw another kind of lashes becouse</li>
            <li>THEY ARE SOOOO NICE</li>
            <li>I believe this are really nice quality lashes.</li>
            <li>but on it looks really nice</li>
            <li>also you will have to buy your own glue since its not provided with the eyelashes .</li>
            <li>honestly for the price</li>
            <li>Good for the price.. actually better for the price</li>
            <li>Nice product, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>but their perfect for when you don&#x27;t feel like really applying eye make up.</li>
            <li>Nice eye lashes for use in performing and wanting to enhance the eyes.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>Shipped really fast, and look great on!  </li>
            <li>I was kind of upset.</li>
            <li>They look nice but dont work.</li>
            <li>know better that if the deal seems too good to be true...it is</li>
            <li>but I honestly would not repurchase these.</li>
            <li>I love style 1, and style 2 looks good as well.</li>
            <li>My wife loved them and said they were better than wat she use to buy thank</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t the best quality but for the price you can&#x27;t complain too much.  </li>
            <li>The lashes are nice</li>
            <li>I liked them and the way they looked on me, but the way they were organized in the box.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, I would absolutely reorder this product in the future!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Better buy from walmart lol for better quality</li>
            <li>I liked them.</li>
            <li>its good :)</li>
            <li>over all I liked my eyelashes</li>
            <li>honestly</li>
            <li>These lashes are kind of a pain to put on..</li>
            <li>They are nice lashes.</li>
            <li>you honestly get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Get them they&#x27;re nice.</li>
            <li>There nice.</li>
            <li>and if you&#x27;re use to wearing lashes you can buy your own glue (or just go to target/or any drug store or supermart that sells makeup and accessories</li>
            <li>Would have been nice if they were not messed up.</li>
            <li>I liked the amount of eyelashes for this price.</li>

            <li>Received before estimated delivery,  good quaitly had to cut to fit my eyes</li>
            <li>The lashes blend perfectly with natural lashes</li>
            <li>cheap and look really good.</li>
            <li>I love the lashes, they look amazing.</li>
            <li>The natural ones were great!</li>
            <li>Nice lasted more on others than myself.</li>
            <li>They are by far the best lashes that I have used.</li>
            <li>It was nice just being able to just replace as needed.</li>
            <li>look.&lt;br /&gt;These are cheap but still good quality</li>
            <li>Mostly I use lashes for cosplay or just a nice evening out.</li>
            <li>I feel so luxurious wearing these, and they&#x27;re good quality and an incredibly cheap price.</li>
            <li>these lashes came around 11 days early and i am so happy!  </li>
            <li>But still, great lashes and worth the price.</li>
            <li>Good for beginners but the quality is on the cheap side</li>
            <li>but the natural style lashes are awesome!</li>
            <li>but when I did I was very pleased and excited and wish id bought more!</li>
            <li>She was very satisfied specially for the price they sell it for!</li>
            <li>These are an EXCELLENT VALUE for as strong and pretty as they are and for as many pairs as you</li>
            <li>Great to customize for your eye, super cheap!</li>
            <li>They are easy to cut to fit my eyes and they look great.</li>
            <li>They were a great price and for the right amount.</li>

            <li>They are reusuable and easy to use!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with them and have more coming!</li>
            <li>Love how many I got and love the price!</li>
            <li>for practice, it worth the price!!!one pair is more than the money I pay for 20!!</li>
            <li>I you are looking or a good pair of cheap lashes then go for these or just pay more at a more popular store like Sephora or Mac.</li>
            <li>It is very nice useful stuff - It is very nice useful stuff - It is very nice useful stuff</li>
            <li>My husband loved them had lots of fun also!</li>
            <li>Good product and worth the price!</li>
            <li>Not as good as the kind you buy in the stores, but considering you get 20 pairs for the price you would pay for just one pair in the store makes it totally worth it.</li>
            <li>so if you are looking for some nice lashes that will look more believable these are not them.</li>
            <li>I am use to the lashline being more of a plastic kind of material and these are more like a string.  </li>
            <li>Might be good for a night out when you&#x27;re wearing a load of makeup but not for natural looking days, they won&#x27;t fly.</li>
            <li>The simple ones are great for on the go cuteness and the thicker ones are great for parties, church, etc.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have asked for better lashes and they are so cheap, just try them you won&#x27;t  regret it unless you aren&#x27;t good at putting on lashes</li>
            <li>Way to cheap looking and didn&#x27;t fit for my lash line or any humans lashes lol.</li>
            <li>so I used the more natural, thinner lashes and they look great!  </li>
            <li>But the natural looking ones are great!! :)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s an awesome process so far, couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything better for the price</li>
            <li>Really cute and nice looking :)</li>
            <li>Exactly as stated on here, very pleased!  </li>
            <li>very real and the variety of lashes is great.  </li>
            <li>Good for every day and special occasions</li>
            <li>There good there&#x27;s nothing special about them, there eyelashes.</li>
            <li>These lashes look great on me, I&#x27;d definitely purchase more!!</li>
            <li>You get exactly what you asked for, and I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>

            <li>I had to get them reshipped because they never came the first time I ordered, but the company was kind and courteous to resend! :)</li>

            <li>They didn&#x27;t fall apart and blended into my real lashes beautifully.</li>
            <li>other than that they&#x27;re good quality and look awesome!</li>
            <li>These lashes are actually pretty great for the price.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty happy with them...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the chance to wear then but they feel so real and are so beautiful.</li>

            <li>these are amazing and a good buy for your first time.  </li>
            <li>These eye lashes are great, and Im pretty sure the people who say they&#x27;re so flimsy to use, just don&#x27;t know how to apply eyelashes correctly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Cosmo student super good lashes to practice with...</li>
            <li>They both look really nice and are soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Luckily the eyelashes turned to be in good conditions .</li>
            <li>liked it, it was easy to practice on how to used lashes</li>
            <li>They are organized nicely which makes them easy to store.  </li>
            <li>The lashes have nice length and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>even those these are so cheap in price they should be charging more!</li>
            <li>looks great nice long eyelashes to look good every day.</li>
            <li>First I have to say they arrived right on time which is great!</li>
            <li>Super good and for a really cheap prize!</li>
            <li>I love the length and thickness, but they are very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Very cheap, You&#x27;re better off buying from a dollar store at a buck</li>
            <li>These were very cheap for 20 pairs but are nicer than most that I&#x27;ve bought in stores for $4 a piece.</li>
            <li>The more natural looking set is perfect, easy to put on, curl, and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better but for the price AND FREE SHIPPING, you get a bargain for sure!</li>
            <li>cheap and beautiful lashes with a large quanity of them too!</li>
            <li>Not much of a bad product I just wasn&#x27;t too happy with them, specially since I didn&#x27;t get the thinner ones.</li>
            <li>These were the most HIDEOUS lashes I have ever seen or used.</li>
            <li>They could do better in packing them</li>
            <li>safe for wearing</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>The thinner ones were OK</li>
            <li>Who wouldn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>i love these they are well made ....and so many :)</li>
            <li>i know she will love them :)</li>
            <li>I used two types of glue, and each time, the things straightened out so the corners became detached.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re better off getting lashes from Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>Not going to be able to use any of them.</li>
            <li>Even better price.</li>
            <li>these eyelashes are wonderful they look so natural and nobody can ever tell I like to use hair extension glue to put them on because that is cheap and stays on for about a day it doesn&#x27;t hurt when you go to take it off</li>
            <li>there are many.</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>but my daughter love them</li>

            <li>Even the more &amp;#34;dramatic&amp;#34; ones aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;too much.&amp;#34; I can wear both day or night.</li>
            <li>you shoulnt have any problems fitting them to your eye</li>
            <li>i love the lighter lashes.</li>
            <li>and she said they are okay.</li>

            <li>I love all my lashes</li>
            <li>4 $ for one pair or 2 $ for alll these options :)</li>
            <li>Lash style #2 are more noticeable for me.</li>
            <li>but once you get a hang of it they&#x27;re perfect especially for the price.</li>

            <li>Definitely enjoying my sets.</li>

            <li>they look cheap!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOOOOOOOVVVVVVEEEEEEE</li>
            <li>Theyre okay .</li>
            <li>They just take more time to adjust and fix for my eyelid .</li>
            <li>i love these falsies....</li>
            <li>but when you get use to it the lashes are fabulous!</li>
            <li>and i love them</li>
            <li>OK these were a bargain price-definitely get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>Love these, love the price.</li>
            <li>I suppose 20 pairs for the price is an okay deal</li>
            <li>I fell in love instantaneously.</li>
            <li>I love the Ardell eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Ordering more.</li>
            <li>All the best styles and sized in one big box.  </li>
            <li>They go on cute, I just wish they didn&#x27;t feel so plastic.</li>
            <li>and how many you get.</li>
            <li>These are lovely, sturdy, I even find them reusable.</li>
            <li>You can get by with cheaper lashes but buy a good adhesive because you&#x27;re worth it. :)</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>&gt; Love these  </li>
            <li>like the thinner ones better, they look more natural.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>I have not worn them yet,but I will keep you posted on how well they do on Halloween,but they are better looking than pictured.</li>
            <li>They are cute for the money.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these lashes.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>the lashes I purchase from the beauty supply store are more curved so they are easier to put on.</li>
            <li>but it did have to go through a lot to get to me and even better just because the packaging was a lil bent</li>
            <li>Not so pleased.  </li>
            <li>but most of them would look like a furry worm stuck on your eye lid.  </li>
            <li>As for the lashes, I&#x27;m pleased with the quality and quantity for the price.</li>
            <li>They where ok.</li>
            <li>Best part is that they&#x27;re totally reusable.</li>
            <li>but they look ok</li>
            <li>:) i like them</li>
            <li>and then there&#x27;s the more jazzy ones</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>Most of them are not even and the lashes are bunched up.</li>
            <li>The price was to die for and the product is even better.</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments on my lashes which I do myself.</li>
            <li>The eyelashes FOR SURE need to be cut before wearing.</li>
            <li>I love these lashes.</li>
            <li>I would buy more again and again</li>
            <li>&amp; ive never had so many problems trying to put on eye lashes before.</li>
            <li>These lashes are fantastic!</li>
            <li>I bought these to try them out and they are okay but</li>
            <li>Oh i love, i love.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine these fitting anyone&#x27;s eyes</li>
            <li>I love these lashes.</li>
            <li>Love them will be ordering again</li>
            <li>The laahes are ok...</li>
            <li>Maybe it stated that &amp; I should&#x27;ve read more about them.</li>
            <li>I guess I shoulda read more in debt in these.</li>
            <li>but they work ok.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t worry about if I don&#x27;t get as many uses out of 1 pair as I do with others</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t fit and wouldn&#x27;t stay on!</li>
            <li>Might buy more.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, I love them.</li>
            <li>Love it even though I haven&#x27;t tried using it yet.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery, great product.</li>
            <li>I would most definately will buy again once i run out.</li>
            <li>Color is appealing.</li>
            <li>They are ok.</li>
            <li>:) I was pleased</li>
            <li>Over they are ok.</li>

            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>MORE TO GET HERE</li>
            <li>I WAS ABLE TO PLAY WITH THEM AND MAKE IT WORK...</li>
            <li>WHEN I USE MORE ATTENTION TO DETAIL WITH MY MAKE UP</li>
            <li>What I find most appealing is that I can trim and curl them to make them appear more natural.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>These are okay.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that there are so many of them</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to worry about buying any more for awhile.</li>
            <li>love the lightweight lashes.</li>
            <li>These are some \\&quot;I love NY\\&quot; lashes.</li>
            <li>I could pull maybe 5-7 times with the lashes or more</li>
            <li>Plan on ordering more can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
            <li>i can get 1 more out of them and</li>
            <li>i can get more</li>
            <li>but thay are just enuff for every day i love them .</li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t wear them more than twice.</li>
            <li>Most of them couldn&#x27;t be used.  </li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I originally only got them because of the price, but they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>I love the thicker ones..</li>
            <li>Thank you :)</li>
            <li>If you take part in a play in which people see you from many feet away, or you wear Halloween costumes and want to dramatize your eyes a lot, you may like it.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have to re order more for quite sometime.</li>
            <li>I had to order them to see if the price would be fitting to the quality</li>

            <li>My favorite eyelashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was definitely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that stacking two of the thinner lashes give them a better look than wear one by itself.</li>
            <li>I love these eye lashes</li>
            <li>I got them and love useing them.</li>

            <li>didn&#x27;t like how I wasn&#x27;t able to track my order</li>

            <li>and i was sure i wasnt going to like them because of the quality</li>
            <li>but overall they look wonderful.</li>

            <li>These lashes are perfect for anyone starting out (like me.)</li>
            <li>After returning home my family gave me so many compliments and my Grandma</li>
            <li>I love them and hope they never go away.</li>
            <li>:)))))</li>
            <li>Worth the price, just get some good glue.</li>
            <li>This is lovely</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>Most of the lashes are still untouched</li>
            <li>For Many weeks!I Would buy them again once i need more.</li>
            <li>An il probably buy more</li>
            <li>I love these lashes.</li>
            <li>It comes in 2 separate storage boxes which i love.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok..</li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE</li>
            <li>The thicker ones are mostly for dressing up customes.  </li>
            <li>If you can get over all of that &amp; just trim them to your eye size, not terrible.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>So cheap they&#x27;re literally unwearable !</li>
            <li>My fault for buying cheap lashes!</li>
            <li>I suppose for stage use or costume they are ok.</li>
            <li>Cheap plasticky eyelashes!</li>
            <li>i love the product</li>
            <li>I absolutely Love wearing these lashes.  </li>
            <li>it was okay for the price</li>
            <li>I guess the thicker ones would be better for night time when going out.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t pleased.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so cheap!  </li>
            <li>Love It</li>
            <li>I love the darker, more thicker ones.  </li>
            <li>and I love them</li>
            <li>Glue was not included but, that was okay.</li>
            <li>but i love em. :3</li>
            <li>These lashes were okay</li>
            <li>Do not recommend unless you don&#x27;t want to spend a bit more on some more real-looking ones.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love the stiffness of the material.</li>
            <li>but they did give my eyes more definition</li>
            <li>I love my eyelashes, I did have tO wait a while for them</li>
            <li>Love the item and the quality and price.</li>
            <li>Will shop again. :-)</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>My opinion hope it works for you if you decided to buy them :)</li>
            <li>but they look okay</li>
            <li>i love these lashes.</li>
            <li>Thanks- Have a great one.</li>
            <li>They were okay.</li>
            <li>for the price I can&#x27;t complain, but the lashes look more like plastic.</li>
            <li>I have been using these for about 2 years now, every couple of months i order another box :)</li>
            <li>like i said WOULD BUY AGAIN :)</li>
            <li>The lashes DO NOT fall apart !! :)</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay....</li>
            <li>I love these and will never buy from a store again.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t even have to order more of these for a loooong time because there are so many.</li>
            <li>it would rather pay more for better quality</li>
            <li>Go to Wal-Mart or Sally&#x27;s and buy some from there, they are better than these.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this product.  </li>
            <li>I love these lashes.</li>
            <li>I get soo many complements.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I love the lightweight lashes.</li>
            <li>Not so satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Should have made it more flexible.</li>
            <li>better than i was expecting.</li>
            <li>love these</li>
            <li>The texture of the lashes are light weight and enhance your look nicely these are my go to lashes and</li>
            <li>the best thing is you can reuse them up to 4 times if you want to make them last longer.</li>
            <li>love these lashes</li>
            <li>so you get what you paid for, but they are ok.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I love my lashes, &amp; yes I will buy more.</li>
            <li>Love it will order again</li>
            <li>I really love these lashes.</li>
            <li>Awesome prices, only a couple of bucks for 20 pairs!!</li>
            <li>were as you&#x27;ll pay 7 or more dollars at drug stores or makeup stores.</li>
            <li>That is the only reason for 4 stars otherwise they are perfect!!!</li>
            <li>Yes you get what you pay for and i should haave paid more.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more once I run out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll order more for my clients</li>
            <li>They did get to me on the first day estimated so that was pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>I will buy more again</li>
            <li>A much better investment.</li>
            <li>I will keep buying these for sure.</li>
            <li>so I mostly used style #1.</li>
            <li>I got 5 or 6 uses out of them before I couldn&#x27;t wear them any more</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I would love them to.</li>
            <li>but if you wear eyelashes im sure u can work with it.</li>
            <li>With the proper adhesive these are the best for your money and</li>
            <li>Could have been packaged a lot better...</li>
            <li>so w.e, i do love the product though</li>
            <li>Best deal I&#x27;ve found on Amazon, and I will definitely but more.</li>
            <li>but anyways i love them</li>
            <li>I will definatly order more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I love it :)</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>I was able to keep 16 pairs and give 4 pairs to my mother.</li>
            <li>P.S I love how they&#x27;re two types of lashes to chose from for under $2</li>
            <li>Thank you, sincerely, Juanita Wilson...</li>
            <li>I found that flexing them a bit before applying the glue and putting them on works much better in fitting the curve of your eyelid.</li>
            <li>Love the eyelashes.</li>
            <li>They give you a sexy, exotic look.</li>
            <li>Now I can wear them more often and hopefully get better at the application.</li>
            <li>:) I read a couple reviews saying that theirs were smashed but mine were neat &amp; perfect!!&lt;br /&gt;-Leah</li>
            <li>Love the way they look and you cant beat the price.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic for the price!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more for my cousin who is a make up artiest.</li>
            <li>i love these lashes.</li>
            <li>Im satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied with the seller.</li>
            <li>These are ok.  </li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>so i guess it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>and you may have to adjust to fit your own eyes.</li>
            <li>Omg I love these lashes</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>I get so many complements on them......:-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>I love the option of thickness and the darkness.</li>
            <li>like the different kinds of lashes in this product both are very beautiful on and they are both sturdy</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be too satisfied, and I wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I tried them again to make sure &amp; again they itched.</li>
            <li>Even after I removed them, the itching &amp; eyelid sensitivity lasted a couple more days.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE SIZE OF LASH</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these.</li>
            <li>These have lasted me ages and look fantastic!</li>
            <li>As eyelashes they were ok but they don&#x27;t stay on your eyes</li>
            <li>they are okay</li>
            <li>its OK</li>
            <li>but they surely don&#x27;t go with mine</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>They are as they say and for cheap too!</li>
            <li>so make sure you order some or pick it up somewhere.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and ive gotten SOOO MANY COMPLIMENTS.</li>
            <li>so it mixes better.</li>
            <li>But I LOVE them</li>
            <li>They are so cheap too!</li>
            <li>favorite way to wear these lashes are combining the thinner ones and then layer it with the thicker ones as a demi-lash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love these</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more</li>
            <li>The most I would do is wear them for a costume party or festival or halloween.</li>
            <li>Love love love!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more of these lashes!!!!</li>
            <li>I just wish their were more choices.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these lashes</li>

            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>They are so ghetto looking, looks even more plastic</li>
            <li>Love buying these in bulk as I never like to rewear them</li>
            <li>i love them.</li>
            <li>they r the easiest i have ever been able to apply..</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried them out yet, but they are more plastic</li>
            <li>so just try them for yourself :)</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t come in the most protected cases.</li>
            <li>I just ordered two more.</li>
            <li>and it gives you a nice look.&lt;br /&gt;In closing, if you are looking for extravagant, fabulous quality package of eyelashes, these are NOT for you.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT STILL WEARING THEM ABOUT</li>

            <li>I am so in love with these lashes and so glad I bought them.</li>
            <li>I wish they&#x27;d come up with more styles because I&#x27;d buy them all.</li>
            <li>so I thought what better price to pay to have 20 pairs to play with.</li>
            <li>Better than that 10 sets of each</li>
            <li>There are more some practice lashes.</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied .................</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure</li>
            <li>I gave these lashes 3 stars because the regular eyelashes were OK....not the best lashes in the world</li>
            <li>Maybe I just need more practice</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t worry about if I don&#x27;t get as many uses out of 1 pair as I do with others</li>
            <li>These are great products, really do recommend them.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>Received these and love them.</li>
            <li>Overall great buy!</li>
            <li>Looks plastics but once you have them on there ok if you like a fill look</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay .</li>

            <li>i love the product, make my eyes sparkle</li>
            <li>No wonder they cost so cheap!</li>
            <li>You do have to cut them, of course, but they are awesome, especially for the price!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s nice to not have to go to the store to buy eyelashes when I&#x27;m going somewhere important.</li>
            <li>something you need lashes for but cannot afford to spend more money.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Its ok i love it because it is affordable</li>
            <li>it is not my favorite eyelashes</li>
            <li>but for this price.. it was okay to give a try</li>
            <li>style 2 is my favorite</li>
            <li>The service is so great I wasnt expecting to get the lashes for about 30 days since they were shipping from Hong Kong, but I got i lashes today a week after my order, super fast was very pleased with that.</li>

            <li>Looks very nice like real.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how beautiful these eyelashes looked.</li>
            <li>Very nice, fast shipping</li>

            <li>was very excited to wear these.</li>
            <li>They look beautiful and natural!  </li>
            <li>My daughter has her own unique look.</li>
            <li>If you want beautiful lashes for a more natural look.</li>
            <li>This seems to be the best method for full, natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li>I love them because they make my eyes look so beautiful and natural.</li>
            <li>The main thing is that they look great</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best for beginners..and the shipping was pretty fast</li>
            <li>great product and super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>very cheap, low quality, but good for emergencies when you run out of the good ones</li>
            <li>Super cute !</li>
            <li>I wish you the udachnkh of sales of warm responses from buyers and happiness in new year.</li>
            <li>if you know how to apply eyelashes they are super easy and they are very comfortable on and not to mention, stunning!</li>
            <li>they are super versatile and sturdy the natural ones are perfect for every day.</li>
            <li>the price is great but the product is so so...not so easy to apply...doesn&#x27;t really curve to stay put on your eyes</li>
            <li>well I was not disappointed I am wearing them to a very special event and can&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made and dont apply easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the wait because the price is cheap :) They are good to play around with.</li>
            <li>Pretty eyelashes and good product</li>
            <li>These are pretty good.</li>
            <li>They are pretty good considering the price.</li>
            <li>Pretty good for choosing just the ones you need for any occasion.</li>
            <li>They got to me fast and they were packaged nicely!  </li>
            <li>Also DUO Eyelash Adhesive is the best glue for long wear.</li>
            <li>Nice and full though.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty good quallity.</li>
            <li>These are my first lashes I&#x27;ve ever wore they feel good</li>
            <li>My eyelashes came in a pretty fair amount of time and although the package looked damaged the eyelashes were unharmed.</li>
            <li>Got Them Early (: Beautiful Eyelashes ♡</li>
            <li>/&gt;thick, beautiful, natural.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t  look like shiny plastic and feel pretty good when on.</li>
            <li>You do want to use a good amount of glue on the edges where lashes tend to lift first.</li>
            <li>However, they are pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>They turned out to be pretty good  </li>
            <li>The eye lashes are natural and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re not in a hurry a pretty good buy for the amount you receive.</li>
            <li>I am not the greatest at applying them of keeping them a long time.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good quality considering the price</li>
            <li>but they are pretty good</li>
            <li>the long eyelashes are beautiful!</li>
            <li>These eye lashes are soft and beautiful on.</li>
            <li>Good for first time lash users as well.</li>
            <li>This would&#x27;ve been fine by me, since they were still very cheap and pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>These are OK - kind of stiff feel - doesn&#x27;t apply the best.</li>
            <li>Cheap and easy to put on!</li>
            <li>it just took them forever to get here but the product was good and they give you so many at a decent price!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really fun!!</li>
            <li>Variety of dark and light lashes is always awesome and you cant ask for much more for the price!</li>
            <li>I ordered these and was so excited!</li>
            <li>Worth it all!!</li>
            <li>, they work fine and were very cheap.</li>

            <li>I love the thinner lashes, they glue on easy and blend in nicely!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>you are frugal like me and don&#x27;t really want to pay 10 bucks for five pairs at the store, and also mind working with them to make them look a bit more &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I love these lashes, I enjoy wearing them and there comfortable!</li>
            <li>it was a cheap quality item, and I&#x27;d rather pay more and in return recieve a much better quality item.  </li>
            <li>These lashes are priced extremely good, they aren&#x27;t the kind of lashes professional makeup artists might use for a pop singer&#x27;s music video or anything</li>
            <li>I know this product wasn&#x27;t going to be the absolute best because of where it shipped from, however, I really do like this product.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything to make them curve more to better fit the curvature of my eyelid (including pinning the ends together and let them sit for 48 hours.)</li>
            <li>Better quality than I expected for an awesome price.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the thinner lashes they look so natural but make my lashes look great.</li>
            <li>Their sooooo freakin cheap but actually work awesome.</li>
            <li>Looking at the low price, I honestly thought the quality wouldn&#x27;t be that great</li>
            <li>The lighter ones are very natural feeling, and look great.  </li>
            <li>u just need a good glue for lashes and they will be fine but there good cheap looking natural eye lashes</li>
            <li>You have to be able to put eyelashes on pretty near perfect.</li>

            <li>it sticks on to her pretty effectively.</li>
            <li>I liked the first set and it took 2weeks to get here /-\</li>
            <li>they are kind of doll like but curl them first or while you have them on</li>
            <li>They look pretty nice</li>
            <li>My fav is style 2 but style 1 is pretty nice as well.</li>

            <li>I like the way they fit on me and easy to put on</li>
            <li>but they go on just fine.</li>

            <li>These do not come with glue as stated, but that&#x27;s just fine with me since I like to know where the glue is coming from.</li>
            <li>but all in all for the coast there great pretty much</li>

            <li>I love the lashes, the box came crushed but the lashes are in great condition.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, I like the length of the lashes which was a huge consideration when I chose them.</li>
            <li>, you&#x27;ll learn it&#x27;s a huge bonus!&lt;br</li>
            <li>CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP.</li>

            <li>plus they were so cheap.</li>
            <li>If you spend on cheap lashes, you are going to get cheap looking lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They wouldn&#x27;t bend to fit the shape of my eyes, so they didn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li>Thicker ones for parties and the thinner ones are awesome for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>also they are to heavy for the best lash adhesives.</li>
            <li>i know they are cheap</li>
            <li>Eye lashes are not shaped to fit to eyelid.</li>
            <li>There is a reason why they are so cheap...</li>
            <li>I love them, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>but i try everyday and they look awesome!</li>
            <li>Bought these last year, they&#x27;re great</li>
            <li>they feel so comfortable.</li>
            <li>But they cheap though but not for me</li>
            <li>so were fabulous together</li>
            <li>Overall, this was great for this price.</li>
            <li>How can they sell these for practically free?</li>
            <li>you can cut them to fit..</li>
            <li>The lashes look cheap, and unatractive.  </li>
            <li>Rey are fantastic</li>
            <li>so they fit my eyes, but that was it</li>
            <li>Not to mention the price is insanely cheap.</li>

            <li>Best quality for such a small price, it comes with the exact picture, before you put them on, cut the ends off and they are perfect.!</li>
            <li>I bought these because of the price and free shipping.</li>
            <li>so u&#x27;ll need to cut them in order for them to fit.</li>
            <li>Made from cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>cheap and must have for all lash lovers</li>
            <li>You do have to trim the threads off the end and bend to fit your eye.  </li>
            <li>Anyone complaining they don&#x27;t fit - cut them to size.</li>
            <li>But they are cheap</li>
            <li>And the width of them you have to cut to fit your eyes, which I&#x27;ve never had to do before with my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>so essentially i have 40 pairs and its great.</li>
            <li>i cant find anyone who will even take them for free.</li>
            <li>I realy do enjoy them</li>
            <li>Great lashes especially for the price.</li>
            <li>lashes are so worth more.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different lashes but these are by far the best</li>
            <li>But they were cheap</li>
            <li>definitely worth the price. :)</li>
            <li>These were cheap</li>
            <li>they are so cheap.</li>

            <li>These lashes are most definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>They do not look cheap in my opinion.</li>
            <li>SO CHEAP looking</li>
            <li>As with all lashes, I had to trim them to fit my eyes.</li>
            <li>Because they are cheap</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li>Great price, the only thing you have to do is cut the edges that is holding them in place when they arrive.</li>
            <li>Cheap manmade material.</li>
            <li>They are absolutely perfect for everyday wear in my opinion.</li>
            <li>They fit just right.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Too happy actually to wait until I&#x27;ve tried them to write a review, I just couldn&#x27;t help it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic lashes</li>
            <li>Cheap in quality</li>
            <li>cheap.</li>
            <li>no matter what type of glue you use, these can only be used for 1 time then you must throw away great for things like show choir, dance recitals, cheer-leading competitions ect</li>
            <li>I love this product, cheap and useful in any occasion.</li>
            <li>I loved the thicker lashes and seemed better than some of the human hair lashes I wear.</li>
            <li>My husband and my son both have those long beautiful lashes that us women are always so jealous of and now with these lashes I can keep up in our family battle of the lashes</li>
            <li>but i love the thick one :D</li>
            <li>these lashes won&#x27;t bend, they don&#x27;t look good, I wanted them to look naturally.</li>
            <li>The natural ones look good on any girl looking for something to amp up on.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for a natural kind of lash, these aren&#x27;t for you, but if you feel like being adventurous, you could give it a try.</li>
            <li>they where so good better than expected :)</li>
            <li>I really like these better than any of the ones I have gotten at the store that cost way more for just one pair.</li>
            <li>But I do love the natural lashes, they&#x27;re so nice.</li>
            <li>but so far really good</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>so impressed like holy cow!!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re learning or don&#x27;t care about it not being extremely realistic, get them for sure!</li>
            <li>The bases are a bit stiff, so they require a good bit of flexing before application, but all in all, a good value for the money.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with how fast and quickly they were delivered to my house.</li>
            <li>Love these &amp; price is just right.</li>
            <li>I love how you can cut them to the right fit&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The lashes don&#x27;t come with adhesive so you will have to buy your own, the lashes are kind of flat</li>
            <li>Arrived whole weeks in advance!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks again!!!</li>
            <li>I am ADORING these lashes!!!</li>

            <li>This item arrived early, I am very pleased with the outcome they don&#x27;t feel cheap or look cheap</li>
            <li>These would be really good for a beginner that wants lots of practice or for the Pro that knows exactly what to do.</li>
            <li>They look like my real lashes and they&#x27;re very easy to apply and to remove.</li>
            <li>And the stripes that holds the lashes tend to come off very easily when taking off the old flue to clean them, other than that they&#x27;re perfect !!</li>
            <li>they look good and they seem real enough, just a bit shiny, but thats easily fixable</li>
            <li>And the are super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Product came very early and I love the item and the card it came with is so cute.</li>
            <li>VERY VERY NATURAL LOOKING, I RECEIVED MANY MANY COMPLIMENTS ON THEM.</li>
            <li>This is such an amazing price for 20 pairs of eyelashes!</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd time buying these eyelashes and they are amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;m excited to try them</li>
            <li>To long for me but its a great buy</li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;m excited to try them</li>
            <li>Although the shipping took too long the lashes are great.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>i was so excited about these.</li>
            <li>I am excited to try them on.</li>
            <li>Not bad for cheap lashes</li>
            <li>The first shipment I never got, but they sent me more</li>
            <li>i would probably order these again, just be aware that you might be waiting more than a month for them to reach you.</li>
            <li>These are great if you like having long eye lashes.</li>
            <li>and I think it is totally worth it for the price !</li>
            <li>Really excited to use them.</li>
            <li>This was definitely the great buy especially if you don&#x27;t mind the fair quality.  </li>
            <li>Overall a pretty good deal, though!</li>
            <li>I was so excited</li>
            <li>they are fun to play around in though!</li>
            <li>I originally rated it one star, but now that the product has arrived and I can see the quality, I would change my rating to three stars.</li>
            <li>, their reusable if you treat them well.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended &amp; worth the wait!</li>
            <li>In all fairness, they did arrive fairly quickly so the seller did his part and quickly to boot !</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the try!</li>
            <li>I love the texture of the lash,,, really pretty</li>
            <li>These lashes were well worth it!</li>
            <li>But I like mines full and fabulous baby.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s OK the eyelashes are made poorly but 20 pairs of eyeleyelashes are good and for the price good</li>
            <li>Most of them broke with first application.</li>
            <li>so I enjoy having the option of full or sparse.</li>
            <li>I occasionally wear lashes and this was a bargain for the quantity and quality, better than most retail store brands Love the product</li>
            <li>They are big and full beautiful lashes, totally worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with them ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s alright for some faces</li>
            <li>it was worth the wait!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great lashes!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how many eyelashes you can get at such a wonderful price...have finally gotten the hang of it--</li>
            <li>i was supper excited.</li>
            <li>love them they are exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li>I recommend them I love the first style</li>
            <li>These are sturdy and fun!  </li>
            <li>they are super inexpensive, so they are not as flexible as you may need them to be, but I needed them for a costume, so they worked out fine.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my eyelashes asking me what I use to make my eyelashes look so good and full and long.</li>
            <li>I got them really fast and they are so easy to wear!</li>
            <li>My daughter wanted them because she was not blessed with long eyelashes and this came at a great time because she is graduating 8th grade and wanted a lil extra eyelash when she dresses for her graduation, not to mention they look full and beautiful, cannot wait till we use them and trust me, they can last more than a year with the set that comes together!  </li>
            <li>These are not even wearable they feel like plastic super cheap material.</li>
            <li>I love how natural but sexy and brighter they make my eyes look.</li>
            <li>Such a great deal for so many lashes, they are not only accurate for anime cosplay, but comfortable too!</li>
            <li>The shipping takes close to a month since it&#x27;s coming from China but definitely worth the money, they are easy to apply you just have to trim off the ends,</li>
            <li>liked the product, I am being satisfied,liked the product, I am being satisfied, it was sent by me in a gift i hope so act set for the one to which a present was given as</li>
            <li>they feel super cheap but are workable</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was quick but they are what you pay for, they are stiffer and resemble those cheap lashes you get at Halloween stores.</li>
            <li>if i clean the glue off i thank</li>
            <li>They look a lot better (read: more natural) than when they&#x27;re sitting in the box.</li>
            <li>feel like I&#x27;ll get more use out of the more natural pair</li>
            <li>take them off with makeup remover and clean after wearing.</li>
            <li>Quality isn&#x27;t that great, but with 10 of each pair, its worth it if you just want to wear them occasionally</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m really enjoying those , the thinner ones are also nice especially if you&#x27;re  someone who just likes</li>
            <li>they aren&#x27;t super comfortable</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re super cheap</li>
            <li>However, you can buy so many for a cheap price that it doesn&#x27;t really affect you.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat the price and to get this many sets all at once is a huge bargain.</li>
            <li>luckily they were cheap or i would be livid they look nothing like the picture</li>
            <li>Price is good for the quantity, obviously, but they&#x27;re annoyingly cheap.</li>
            <li>the more natural lashes were ok</li>
            <li>They have a nice curl to them as well, and can be definitely used more than once.</li>
            <li>It was nice, but the package was kind of crushed.</li>
            <li>i havent tried the lashes on yet,but they look nice and lush and easy to work with, and twenty pairs for about two dollars and free shipping is worth the wait.</li>
            <li>It was fast, had really good quality to the product, and it came in a reasonable time frame.</li>
            <li>With a little clipping and bending to shape them you can get them on pretty nicely and the results are great.</li>
            <li>The heavy lashes are perfect when you want to make an impact - Like - drag queen impact.  :P</li>
            <li>The natural looking ones are my favorite!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived and have since ordered 4 more sets!</li>
            <li>Aside from the super long shipping, I was happy w/ my purchase</li>
            <li>These lashes are pretty flimsy, but they don&#x27;t look cheap and are easy to put on with weave glue.</li>
            <li>very light weight and shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like them there very cheaply made but</li>
            <li>this product is great cheap got my moneys worth along with long eye lashes !  </li>
            <li>The eyelashes are great, and it&#x27;s much better having all these sets than constantly having to go buy new ones.</li>
            <li>Long and just how they looked for a great price also pretty strong</li>
            <li>These are nice, cheap enough to use &amp; toss, can easily be trimmed to size.</li>
            <li>I paid $1.87 for these 40 lashes and I absolutely got more than my $$ worth!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m waiting for a special occasion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m waiting for a special occasion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wear mine to special events and always receive compliments.</li>
            <li>Just for special occasions</li>
            <li>I use them for competitions and special occasions .</li>
            <li>I use these lashes when I&#x27;m going out for special occasions.</li>
            <li>Got them right on time!</li>
            <li>By hey ya get what you pay for right!</li>
            <li>but they arrived right now!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just living them right now!</li>
            <li>i had orderd and when it came in the mail some of the lashes where messed up lashes wernt attached right and lashes where in pieces!</li>
            <li>I love them add mascara looks very natural :) definitely will order again very satisfied</li>
            <li>What a great price for such a large supply!</li>
            <li>They are not thick and plasticky I am sure they will go on just fine</li>
            <li>and apply very smooth lol.. not bad for a few dollars!</li>
            <li>Super excited.</li>
            <li>when I received it I was super excited</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great for the price even if you dont like them there not much of a loss.</li>
            <li>They are long so that you can trim them to fit your eyes which is good</li>
            <li>:) I really liked how long they are also.</li>
            <li>considering how far they had to travel, with heavier packages!&lt;br /&gt;Product itself is amazing, don&#x27;t be intimidated by the exess threads on the sides</li>
            <li>The price was great but the box in the mail was crushed and the eyelashes were misshapen</li>
            <li>The lashes came in on July 11 and were expected to come in on July 20, so I was happy about that.  </li>
            <li>And there not really that attractive.</li>
            <li>I figured with the numerous good reviews</li>
            <li>but all in all good purchase 3rd box ordered</li>
            <li>My 10 full lashes were all sitting at the bottom of the package with what looked like glue already attached to them.</li>
            <li>LOVE THEM, they look really real.</li>
            <li>There are a few styles to choose from, depending on what you&#x27;re looking for, and if the color matches then you have an ideal</li>
            <li>Hopefully it last but good thou</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gotta say it was SUCH A GOOD IDEA to buy these together instead of separate.</li>
            <li>I dont have anything negative to say except the shipping, over all there awesome lashes for the price</li>
            <li>These turned out way better than expected and for such a wonderful price!</li>
            <li>The look cool for evening wear.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re basically disposable, which is good, because I don&#x27;t have the patience to take care of my lashes, but if you remember to store them, each pair can last up to a week.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gotta say it was SUCH A GOOD IDEA to buy these together instead of separate.</li>
            <li>i love it so much, makes my lashes longer and fuller</li>
            <li>it saves me so much on lashes - most</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t mind trimming overall good product saved me money</li>
            <li>Got these lashes early which was nice..</li>
            <li>Good texture, and lot of different sizes,</li>
            <li>they dnt cost much but will get more</li>
            <li>and I think that some of the reviews were not reflective of the true quality of the product.</li>
            <li>That was really annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the lashes are okay.</li>
            <li>they are cool</li>
            <li>ONLY GOOD FOR PRACTICE PURPOSES NOT GOING OUT</li>
            <li>I really like how they look on me too :)</li>
            <li>nothing i cant fix)&lt;br /&gt;it would be helpful if they came with glue, but they came early and for the price they were there really nice</li>
            <li>If this is true for you, then order this product.</li>
            <li>but they look a lot better on the picture than in real life</li>
            <li>yea and the full ones make u look like u have nicki minaj eyes</li>
            <li>The picture is a true likeness of what the lashes look like.</li>
            <li>: The natural lashes look nice and stay on well</li>
            <li>but i like how full they are.</li>
            <li>Oh I just love this product sooooooooo much.  </li>
            <li>They are cute but they don&#x27;t really have a weft to put the glue on</li>
            <li>but when I open, it is DEFINATELY like it is in the picture, DEFINATELY a good buy.</li>
            <li>but overall they are good eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Overall it was a good buy.</li>
            <li>Cheap so worth it</li>
            <li>Outside of that they are a good buy.</li>
            <li>Cheap and worth the money...had no issues wearing/applying either.</li>
            <li>I received them earlier and in good conditions.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li>I love these eyelashes, I really like the thicker ones</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t human hair, which isn&#x27;t surprising.</li>
            <li>last about 4 wears depending how good you are to them.</li>
            <li>I love them so much</li>
            <li>Full makeup review with pictures can be found here:</li>
            <li>The package was neat and simple, good for putting away after using a pair .</li>
            <li>Style 1 look glamourous and style 2 look natural but really nice.</li>
            <li>overall a good deal for 2 bucks</li>
            <li>If you look good in big eyelashes</li>
            <li>they hurt only good thing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried on the really thick ones for my cosplay and they look great!</li>
            <li>The darker ones are the ones I like, and they look real when I use it I am satisfied</li>
            <li>a thick density are perfect for embellishing.</li>
            <li>Love them so much</li>
            <li>Good thing I only paid about 3 bucks including shipping.</li>
            <li>so many compliments AND THOUGHT THEY WHERE REAL</li>
            <li>Its Packed With Full eyelashes</li>
            <li>i would def buy these again, these are def ones you cant re use over and over.they are one use only they look good on.</li>
            <li>They were okay , they both look very plasticky but they were 2$</li>
            <li>so natural people think that they&#x27;re my own</li>
            <li>many so if i messed up i wouldnt really care.</li>
            <li>but once they&#x27;re applied they actually look good.</li>
            <li>Good if you starting out with falesie</li>
            <li>I do a living doll dress up at least twice a week, and these are perfect.</li>
            <li>I love them so much</li>
            <li>These hold up much better than t Sally&#x27;s lashes because of what my daughter wants them for.</li>
            <li>Take good care of them if you want to get multiple wears out of each pair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very inexpensive you get 20 pairs for so cheap!</li>
            <li>good product at low price</li>
            <li>Everything was good only thing was shopping took forever</li>
            <li>Not a bad product.</li>
            <li>She loves them and the quality is not bad</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price, wish they came with glue.</li>
            <li>Not bad for cost, either.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product</li>
            <li>Not a bad buy.</li>
            <li>And these eyelashes are not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>not bad.</li>
            <li>Price was not bad</li>
            <li>They are very comfortable and I would recommend these lashes especially since they are very cheap</li>
            <li>The regular lashes are perfect and easy to blend in with your natural ones to make them look real.</li>
            <li>The thinner ones look great when I cut the m in half :)  too much for every day for me!</li>
            <li>Awesome lashes easy to use and long lasting.</li>
            <li>very nice, good quality lashes---- came MUCH later than expected, though.</li>
            <li>liked these especially the thinner ones for day they were also easy for me to apply.</li>
            <li>They are nice looking lashes but were a little to lengthy- very easy to cut and shorten to fit my eyes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually do reviews, but these lashes were an amazing deal!!</li>
            <li>You cannot expect the best lashes at such a low price, so I&#x27;m not totally disappointed.</li>
            <li>love these falsies :) it&#x27;s easier to work with than other eyelashes for some reason :)</li>
            <li>Looks and feels cheap right away.</li>
            <li>the big full lashes 5 out of 5!!!</li>
            <li>They are easy to place and this was the first time I used eyelashes</li>
            <li>They go on pretty easily</li>
            <li>but I think that the thicker set will be awesome for costumes, parties, special events or for fun in general for when I want an extra oomph to my eyes.</li>
            <li>He only reason they got two stars is because you get so many of them for a very cheap price.</li>
            <li>The only reason it got two stars was because there are so many of them for very cheap.</li>
            <li>Big user of lashes and these are great if you are needing a large amount for a cheer or dance team.</li>
            <li>Other than that its a great christmas gift for my friend.</li>
            <li>Amazing hot priced deals will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>You have to cut to adjust, but other then that, great lashes.</li>
            <li>I received only the natural ones but nice quality 4 the price ! :-)</li>
            <li>Other than that its a great christmas gift for my friend.</li>
            <li>but for someone experienced in false lashes, I think these would be pretty good.</li>
            <li>hmmm, maybe for Christmas or New Years Eve! :)</li>
            <li>So obviously, your buying in bulk for really really cheap, meaning one or two eyelashes occasionally in the box may be stiffer, or not in place when your package arrives, but overall for the price you cant complain, they are easy to bend to the shape of your eye, and re-usable which is even more great!</li>
            <li>I would recommend investing in something quality worthy.</li>
            <li>I love them and will order more in the future!</li>
            <li>Received  them quickly.</li>
            <li>they dont fit ur eye you got to cut them to  adjust to ur eye lids took 3weeks to come in supper fast from china material was cheap</li>
            <li>Lashes shipped quickly</li>
            <li>Curling these with a lash curler and applying mascara makes them look more realistic.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me I already had glue for them.</li>
            <li>It should however be mentioned in bold caps for those anticipating delivery sooner.</li>
            <li>They are super durable and go on like a dream.</li>
            <li>they are so cute the big ones are kinda cute</li>
            <li>Whether it&#x27;s a bold look or not.</li>
            <li>They are quiet cheap and the lashes aren&#x27;t as nice as I thought.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t expect anything super fancy...</li>
            <li>, I can always get more and I will be getting more of these in the future.</li>
            <li>The product shipped and arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the thinner ones but for the price they serve a quick purpose...</li>
            <li>They are super flexible.  </li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t believe is how quickly they arrived.</li>
            <li>So to update my last post, I finally tried on the thicker ones and they are SO PERFECT.</li>
            <li>Lift up quickly on the eyelid, I feel like I need to super glue them</li>
            <li>Style number two looked more realistic to me than style one.</li>
            <li>The lashes were super plastic.</li>
            <li>Style 2 is definitely so natural looking and feel so real and look good.</li>
            <li>I can MAYBE use 2/20 pairs if I am lucky.</li>
            <li>Delivered quick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>They clean off easily and apply without much hassle.</li>
            <li>I got these and was super disapointed.  </li>
            <li>These lashes came in 2 weeks from asia to US which is really quick to me.</li>
            <li>The thinner ones on the photo give a much more realistic style, and the thicker ones are probably ones I&#x27;d wear on Halloween or something.</li>
            <li>Luckily, the eyelashes weren&#x27;t squished or ruined.</li>
            <li>When you pull them out of the container, the end parts have no lashes and are longer so you just do a quick trim of the ends, then put your glue on and apply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Super , SUPER lightweight.  </li>
            <li>I love these eye lashes definitely buying more</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>When I run out I most definitely will get more from them.  </li>
            <li>But delivery was quick</li>
            <li>really think these are great, and they arrived way earlier then the &amp;#34;estimated time&amp;#34; and they arrived in tact.</li>
            <li>AMAZING PRODUCT FOR SUCH A CHEAP PRICE.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly as well.</li>
            <li>, I can always get more and I will be getting more of these in the future.</li>
            <li>Ok for the price definitely not human hair they are man made but still ok for the price I still got to use them.</li>
            <li>Quick email replies.</li>
            <li>I love both styles of lashes, but I can&#x27;t try them on yet because I have to buy glue, but other than that I am very excited to get to try these on!</li>
            <li>Super cheap, fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t wear these daily because they are very costumey, instead I&#x27;ll be ok on Halloween lashes for the rest of my life!!</li>
            <li>Love the Price, Love the Natural looking lashes they blend easily with my natural lashes.</li>
            <li>If you clean and store them right</li>
            <li>I tried the natural looking lashes the other day, and they were perfect!</li>
            <li>These are perfect to use over and over again not just once love the thick ones and the other ones I wear on a daily basis good job!</li>
            <li>I tried the natural looking lashes the other day, and they were perfect!</li>
            <li>Very Pretty.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very pretty.</li>
            <li>It was nice to receive so many for a low price plus it was fast delivery</li>
            <li>They look very pretty.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in a dark bar they look great.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy again and very happy with the lashes even if you can only use them once they are worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victoria</li>
            <li>some kind of fun party but for everyday style 2 is amazing.</li>
            <li>not what i am use to, and sure as hell do not stick on with normal eyelash glue.</li>
            <li>Although they are very pretty lashes.</li>
            <li>Beware: very very longggg!</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re pretty comfortable</li>
            <li>, more natural lashes (Style 2) are my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>Very pretty</li>
            <li>Thank you soooo very much! (:</li>
            <li>with all that the price is really good and the shipping did not take that long.</li>
            <li>I chose rating because delivery took long price was good</li>
            <li>The price was low and it seemed too good to be true at first, but when I received them they met my expectations beyond.</li>
            <li>The actual product is not bad, it has pretty good quality</li>
            <li>they are not hard and i love the quality.</li>
            <li>Super quick delivery and for the price worth buying</li>
            <li>I use DUO LASH GLUE which is very good glue, but not very good with these type lashes.</li>
            <li>This was the second order I brought because I loved it very much.</li>
            <li>Perfect combo of lush lashes for elegant affairs and simple lashes for regular nights out</li>
            <li>Lasts me for a very long time and very easy to apply!  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m not mad</li>
            <li>and so much cheaper then one pair !!</li>
            <li>i really don&#x27;t know why i did!!</li>
            <li>Also, since I&#x27;m asian and my lashes are pretty puny, these are a great item to really enhance your eyes.</li>
            <li>Really pretty!</li>
            <li>The only thing I do wish is that they could have a bit more flexibility in them (they seem to want to retain their bowed shape and not bend easily to the shape of your eyelid).</li>
            <li>but I kinda wasn&#x27;t surprised they were very cheap</li>
            <li>They are very light and not heavy like the plastic band lashes</li>
            <li>I love them and how super cheap they are, I just wish I knew how to put them on properly!</li>
            <li>I was really surprised to get these lashes, they are full and lush and so many for such a great price.</li>
            <li>Very good quality , now I can wear lashes everyday without spending so much $.</li>
            <li>In love with these falses, style 2 blends nicely with your natural lashes and style 1 gives you just the right amount of bold for your night out, I always come back for these lashes</li>
            <li>They are beautiful and look amazing on the eye with out being too over dramatic! ♡</li>
            <li>They can be hard to get up to your lash line but tweezers come in handy for that kind of stuff.</li>
            <li>but that wasn&#x27;t a big deal because I have an amazing lash glue.</li>
            <li>you have to really  work with them to make them fit the curve of your eye</li>
            <li>Great for everyday or a girls night out</li>
            <li>I think they are really light which doesn&#x27;t bother me because then you don&#x27;t feel them as much.</li>
            <li>Thank you just got it a few days ago, looks great</li>
            <li>but I can honestly say I will be making more in the near future.</li>
            <li>I would rather pay up to ten dollars on a really amazing set of lashes</li>
            <li>Fast shipping but the lashes are not design correctly to fit almond eyes.</li>
            <li>so i wanted to buy cheap, cuz i really dont wear them often.</li>
            <li>I really liked the regular ones since they look more natural.</li>
            <li>the lashes were boxed up, but the box was smashed in shipping, this didn&#x27;t stop the lashes from still being amazing though, especially for the price...</li>
            <li>It came about a few days before the date it was suppose to rang to come from, which was great because I had forgotten</li>
            <li>Some lashes have an uneven stitch, but besides that this was a great purchase.</li>
            <li>Cheap ass eyelashes very plastic</li>
            <li>Amazing, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>, they feel very plastic like and are itchy if not trimmed to tailor fit to your eye shape.</li>
            <li>I was nervous because of the price, but these actually turned out better then expected, great for the price and reusable</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the &amp;#34;Style 2&amp;#34; lashes and they work amazing.</li>
            <li>Fun for dress up cosplay stuff.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the wait on shipping.</li>
            <li>Worth it for the money</li>
            <li>they are the same length of my own lashes.</li>
            <li>well worth the money...will buy again if needed.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>They came earlier than expected which was awesome.</li>
            <li>but so worth the wait.</li>
            <li>The price was worth it.</li>
            <li>but it was worth it</li>
            <li>Definetly worth price!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased several sets and my daughters are loving theirs as well.</li>
            <li>You will most likely have to trip these so that they fit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;#1 is kind of big</li>
            <li>They are more natural.</li>
            <li>Have to cut them to size, but for this price, worth it.</li>
            <li>I love love love them, so for the price it was worth at least seeing what style 2 looked like.  </li>
            <li>Fun to use as play makeup, or in a costume, or just for that every day look, lots of them tool</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say its worth the buy.</li>
            <li>At first you have to train them in order to fit your eyes exact shape.</li>
            <li>Ok not quit sure what I expected</li>
            <li>But not horrible, and they can pass as natural.</li>
            <li>Anybody who&#x27;s a make up artist and cosmetology expert like me will know that these lashes are too cheap, not even human hair and can&#x27;t even wear more than 2 times.</li>
            <li>all there worth the price and wait .</li>
            <li>I love them, theres really natural looking ones</li>
            <li>they are worth your money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>But they are worth keeping around to have.</li>
            <li>this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love the natural lashed.</li>
            <li>They looked natural :) every time I wear them I get complemented.</li>
            <li>so far i haven&#x27;t been able to wear these lashes.</li>
            <li>Although it takes about 3 weeks to receive, its worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>it was worth the buy</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>They are worth the value.</li>
            <li>I liked them , you get 40 in total for around 5 bucks</li>
            <li>Not real, however good for a night out.  </li>
            <li>Better when scene from a distance, I wouldn&#x27;t use for professional makeup.</li>
            <li>I got them - came in handy at the last dance competition!</li>
            <li>its worth the price</li>
            <li>I love the natural eyelashes..</li>
            <li>They feel soft and pliable which, I am sure, will facilitate ease when I put them on.</li>
            <li>So, if you don&#x27;t mind waiting 3-4 weeks for delivery, I think the price/quality combination is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Took a while to get them but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>SOOO WORTH</li>
            <li>and I got my monies worth.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you are going for a more natural look</li>
            <li>The thin lashes are the best..</li>
            <li>they aren&#x27;t worth the investment</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re definitely not the kind you buy at a beauty supply store</li>
            <li>Really long across and cheaply made and don&#x27;t stick well even with glue that normally sticks good with my walmart falsies.</li>
            <li>worth the money were for five day and replace them</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li>They are so fun to wear.</li>
            <li>totally worth buying.</li>
            <li>so i guess it was worth it.</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;re fun.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>, I love what I see so far</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of time for them to arrive but, it&#x27;s was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Definitely a great item to add to my personal &amp; professional makeup kits.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not worth the price they advertise</li>
            <li>But the natural lashes are okay.</li>
            <li>Shopping took some time but was well worth the wait for the price.</li>
            <li>worth the wait</li>
            <li>with that said they are worth what you pay honestly.&lt;br /&gt;(good</li>
            <li>The more natural looking lashes were the ones I preferred over the thicker ones.</li>
            <li>I only needed to trim the ends where it&#x27;s held in place in the box and kind of \\&quot;wave\\</li>
            <li>Style one would be fun to wear for pictures or halloween or</li>
            <li>They are worth the cost.</li>
            <li>but again worth the price.</li>
            <li>They will definitely will come in handy.  </li>
            <li>its worth the wait</li>
            <li>These lashes are fun to play with.</li>
            <li>u must believe me it worth it</li>
            <li>It was worth it.</li>
            <li>good only if you want add on dolls,because if you actually wear,make sure to look like a fool.</li>
            <li>There were diffedently a lot of eyelashes in the box, but one thing that&#x27;s kind of essential is the glue which is not included.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re fun to wear.</li>
            <li>and they look more natural.</li>
            <li>but I have many to practice with for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>but it was well worth the wait..</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I found it useful because you can use one for the day and the ticker ones for night.</li>
            <li>than that, they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li>Took forever to come but worth it</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re worth it</li>
            <li>I figured it was worth waiting for.</li>
            <li>Worth it</li>
            <li>and I think they will be fun to use.  </li>
            <li>Go more natural and get reg.</li>
            <li>The eyelashes came sooner than expected and my sister loved them (and she&#x27;s picky about lashes)</li>
            <li>but for the price it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>Now me and my friends have lashes when we decide to Cleopatra ourselves up on fun girls nights.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are a good deal if you have time to mess with them but by no means are they user friendly.</li>
            <li>So worth every penny i paid for them</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>But for the price they were pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Would purchase again for fun my boyfriend like them</li>
            <li>but overall they were fun nice price.</li>
            <li>they didn&#x27;t work as good as expected.</li>
            <li>It depends on a person&#x27;s personal preference, if anything try em&#x27; and you&#x27;ll end up loving them.</li>
            <li>so worth the $$.</li>
            <li>but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>For the price of $3 it&#x27;s really worth it for the 20 pairs.</li>
            <li>so they look a bit more natural.</li>
            <li>so they were worth that $$.</li>
            <li>I NEED A DIFFERENT KIND OF GLUE,OR</li>
            <li>I expected for the price, that these lashes would not be good.</li>
            <li>but it was worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>For the price, they&#x27;re definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>they looked better when I put on mascara and almost natural.</li>
            <li>well maybe it might not be worth it to get it</li>
            <li>I like the more natural looking ones.</li>
            <li>It was still worth it though</li>
            <li>The lashes are nice ans shiny and they last.  </li>
            <li>but I almost like them more than the natural set.</li>
            <li>but it wad worth the wait.</li>
            <li>but so worth the price</li>
            <li>I love these lashes, my only complaint would be is that you have to make them for your eye, they aren&#x27;t shaped already for your eye...other than that they are a great deal and reusable!</li>
            <li>I love both of them, especially for the cheap price.</li>
            <li>but well worth the $3.00.</li>
            <li>I used the darker ones and they look natural and are really cute  </li>
            <li>For the price, I think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product so far.</li>
            <li>It was worth the wait fir the lashes.</li>
            <li>YOURSELF CAN BE WORTH IT.  </li>
            <li>Not bad, first time buying these things.</li>
            <li>There cheap so you can&#x27;t expect super high quality eyelashes</li>
            <li>I love my lashes one thing wish naturals were a little fuller thick ones r vere nice good price too!</li>
            <li>Product came in a little over two weeks, they are very nice.</li>
            <li>they last long, you can reuse them, they are easy to put on, looks great.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t natural looking and take some getting used to the plastic band feel but other than that it is great to have a bulk of do able lashes ready for you at hand</li>
            <li>I surprising liked the more dramatic looking lashes over the natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li>Got the lashes sooner than expected the packaging was fine despite the long journey the lashes fit great  </li>
            <li>They are very easy to put on, but make sure you snip the ends since there are little pieces on each side to make them stay in the cases they are in.</li>
            <li>Shipping was the only problem i had with this product i still gave it 5 stars because for the low price you pay to receive 2 packs of lashes is a really good deal!</li>
            <li>Considering they were coming from overseas, shipping was pretty quick...</li>
            <li>For being shipped from China, this got to me pretty quickly too.</li>
            <li>Came pretty quick, I wish it came with adhesive.</li>
            <li>They shipped pretty quick.</li>
            <li>Shipped pretty quickly considering they came all the way from China.</li>
            <li>If you want you can cut the darker set of lashes into different styles of lashes to make it look more unique and they&#x27;re reusable if you take care of them right.</li>
            <li>r super easy to lift and doesnt look natural</li>
            <li>Super easy to apply and so natural looking.</li>
            <li>, I use them to perfection will ask nothing other good brands.</li>
            <li>Other then that I loved them.</li>
            <li>They look and feel just as good as any other brand I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Other wise I like them.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get these since you really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>Other wise product works likebit should.</li>
            <li>Look relatively real, and definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind if they&#x27;re too long because I can always cut them, and have plenty more to use!</li>
            <li>When we go to the store she gets a lot of good compliments and a lot of stares and whispers from other people.</li>
            <li>But other than that, It was a good buy, I got 20 eyelashes for $3.</li>
            <li>The quality is really good they can be worn just like other lashes.</li>
            <li>everyone was right on the shipping my box was so cramped in the envelope</li>
            <li>1-5 day use each if u use them right</li>
            <li>The price was right for the amount of lashes received, not gonna complain there.</li>
            <li>However, with the right glue, and application process anyone can make these work.</li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Right now I will give it 4 stars for the packaging.</li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re plastic and just don&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li>I just wish they got my order right.</li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>The glue slid right off.</li>
            <li>The picture on the right is NOT what came in the mail...</li>
            <li>If you position it right, it can be the curve for eye liner.</li>
            <li>The price is right and the lashes are reusable.  </li>
            <li>Almost seems like they are all made for the right eye.</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>the price is definitely right</li>
            <li>the right look too fake/plastic to even bother with)</li>
            <li>product is manageable and can be flattering when used the right way.</li>
            <li>You also need to cut off the long ends, but most makeup artists clip the lashes to fit their client&#x27;s eyes, so</li>
            <li>the dramatic sets,they r perfect</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve also trimmed them to fit my particular desires for the day&#x27;s look.</li>
            <li>I wanted something dramatic so these were perfect.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look to dramatic they look good.!!!</li>
            <li>The dramatic lashes is perfect for nighttime.  </li>
            <li>Love the mi could go full out dramatic,or girl next door.</li>
            <li>These are sooo pretty and much more natural looking than they are in the photos.</li>
            <li>One thing I did notice (not a bad thing) is that, if you look closely, the lashes on the &#x27;upper tier&#x27; of the boxes appear to be just a tad shorter than the ones on the &#x27;lower tier&#x27;-- when you hold the boxes with the 3 rows at the top and the 2 rows below the writing on the bottom.</li>
            <li>What is good, it is too long, with you very uncomfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Loved them but took too long to get here but thanks(;</li>
            <li>They were very easy to clean, and I figure I can get at least two or three more uses out the the pair I used.</li>
            <li>They were very easy to clean, and I figure I can get at least two or three more uses out the the pair I used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love they came early and there is so many different choices in sizes was worth the money.</li>
            <li>They also aren&#x27;t natural human hair which is ok, but they look too &#x27;CHEAP&#x27; REALLY REALLY CHEAP.  </li>
            <li>they are so cute and the natural ones look great, and i am definitely using the larger ones for parties and events&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>They are cute and come in a large enough size that they can fit my eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The thicker ones are a little thick to me, but it&#x27;s great for parties and also great for demi-lashes if you cut them in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With enough glue and black eyeliner,  they look great!</li>
            <li>I always cut my eyelashes in half and just where them on the edges of my eves, so I am now stalked forever with such great quality lashes!</li>
            <li>Easily trimmed to your eye shape, and so cheap, you can buy multiple packs and not worry about having to reuse lashes.</li>
            <li>I only paid less than $4.00 for these lashes which it great!</li>
            <li>I love dat BIG BOLD GLAM LOOK.YASSSS GOD.</li>
            <li>Since they&#x27;re so cheap, I don&#x27;t really have the time to clean them to reuse, I just use a new one each time.  </li>
            <li>These are a great buy if you want to learn how to apply false lashes, they&#x27;re very inexpensive and you can practice many times without feeling wasteful.</li>
            <li>I am loving having so many lash changes for such a low price!  </li>
            <li>So fun and pretty to wear.  </li>
            <li>I was a newcomer to lashes and was curious about these, so when I recieved them in the mail i was very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Given the price, i guess thats exactly what they are worth.</li>
            <li>I loved them and got here earlier than I expected them to I love</li>
            <li>The crowd favorite is the second, more natural style.</li>
            <li>but i at least expected to be able to wear them even if they weren&#x27;t of the best material.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love these lashes, I&#x27;m a makeup artist, and honestly these are better than some of the expensive lashes I&#x27;ve had to buy.</li>
            <li>Got a lot of lashes for a small price, Great deal.</li>
            <li>The thinner lashes were nice but the thicker ones were way too long.</li>
            <li>They are kind of long.</li>
            <li>They blend well with my own eyelashes because I already have long curly eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Other than that they stay on pretty good.</li>
            <li>These eye lashes were decent for both a natural or more bold look.</li>
            <li>They both are equally long and the quality is nice for what you pay for.</li>
            <li>These are great, arrive quickly from China via USPS, very full, and I&#x27;ll never buy retail for fake lashes again.</li>
            <li>They do need to be bent a little bit before putting them on to fit the curve of your eyelid other than that they&#x27;re awesome!</li>
            <li>They did the job , I&#x27;m new to using eye lashes but my fiance liked the look of them and he usually doesn&#x27;t like this kind of stuff .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to just spend a little bit more  $$$ and get quality lashes</li>
            <li>so I use those for a little thickening on days when I need to look more uppity but the style 1 set is my favorite.</li>
            <li>They are the perfect size and have a little bit left at the edges</li>
            <li>recommend spending a little more and getting a better product.</li>
            <li>First off these were extremly afffordable got here earlier than they said i love them and they look so natural i willbe rdering like alot more of these like 10 for like 11 bucks</li>
            <li>The thicker lashes work really well for photos or events, whereas the more natural ones are suitable for daily wear.</li>
            <li>very fast service nice quality extremely long though</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, they are a little thicker than I&#x27;d like but still very easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the more natural style and they were super pretty and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>thick ones sit funny but are ok the lighter ones i love!</li>
            <li>I have always had to trim lashes and I never get them on right the first time</li>
            <li>GOOD QUALITY FOR THE PRICE PLUS FAST SHIPPING ARRIVED BEFORE I EXPECTED</li>
            <li>really like the more natural looking ones ..</li>
            <li>and you only have these left to use lol.</li>
            <li>Soft to touch and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>These eyeborws look wondeful online, but when you get them in your hand forget it.&lt;br /&gt;You want an eyelash that is going to blend in with the natural hairs of your eyelashes, not plastic on top of real hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I waited forever for these lashes but it was worth the wait, i personally like the thicker ones better tho</li>
            <li>Great for theatrical use as well as daily wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not the most comfortable eye lashes, but should be expected considering the price.</li>
            <li>came a whole month early, i love these.</li>
            <li>Just lke they look in da pic.they or soft &amp; supa easy to apply ad take off as well .they</li>
            <li>Great quality, cuter than the more expensive ones that i find in stores.</li>
            <li>I really order these for myself as i like to create artistic looks with makeup.</li>
            <li>the more natural looking ones really make your lashes look fuller</li>
            <li>If you want a more natural look, then go for the thinner eyelashes, but if you want some very voluminous lashes.....</li>
            <li>I easily make these work because I use professional glue.</li>
            <li>Not what I expected, BETTER!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with such a savings seeing that in my local beauty supply store, just one pair is 2.99 when I got 20 pairs for 2.09 to be exact.</li>
            <li>If yours are more so straight when you put them on, just take a eyelash curler to them and they look pretty even though they don&#x27;t look as natural</li>
            <li>i love the long lashes and the natural lashes are ok.</li>
            <li>They feel really stiff and cheap and wouldn&#x27;t stick on my lids with any kind of glue that I tried to use.</li>
            <li>Definitely going to come back and purchase more!!</li>
            <li>when I got them I expected better but after applying a few coats of mascara they look spectacular :)</li>
            <li>Lastly, the spaces and thickness of the darker lashes is very cheap looking on your eyes.</li>
            <li>But like them very much</li>
            <li>So shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Very very cheap, obviously</li>
            <li>I have yet to try the thick ones, but the regular ones were perfect for a more natural makeup look.</li>
            <li>very much Looking forward to cooperate</li>
            <li>The shipment was very fast too.</li>
            <li>I loved them very flexible and easy to put on even when they were thick</li>
            <li>so u need to be good and play a little</li>
            <li>they look real on me &amp; they are pretty!</li>
            <li>However, they were good quality just needed to be trimmed a little bit.</li>
            <li>they come without glue, and are too long, so you have to cut them a bit to fit your eyes besides that their fine.</li>
            <li>The less dense ones are great, very natural looking.</li>
            <li>The full more dramatic lashes are amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great just a little harder to put on in my opinion without the sticky residue that already come on most lashes.</li>
            <li>so getting so much for so cheap when i use them almost daily is a huge plus</li>
            <li>Exactly as I saw it on the Internet. ..</li>
            <li>No its not human hair but they cute.</li>
            <li>If you have been to the store to buy eyelashes than you know that they are pretty pricey.</li>
            <li>They also can be worn more than once because they do last</li>
            <li>u use them , still like it but to much work !</li>
            <li>hassle at first</li>
            <li>there are so many mixed reviews about these lashes but if you are a pro like me these are helpful</li>
            <li>The make my eyes and make up really pop out!</li>
            <li>They are more of plastic then actual hair</li>
            <li>Definitely buying more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally ordering more.</li>
            <li>Had to cut them short because they were long, but they are great.</li>
            <li>The first box arrived smooshed so some of the eyelashes were out of shape and</li>
            <li>The thinner set look so real!</li>
            <li>I have purchased all brands, katy perry, elf , ardell etc and most lashes are the same thing.!!</li>
            <li>It was my first time purchasing eyelashes and the first Time I put them on me.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I am overall pleased with these lashes.</li>
            <li>they are not difficult to apply.</li>
            <li>At First,</li>
            <li>I guess I thought they&#x27;d be more like human lashes</li>
            <li>I was worried about these at first but they&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li>I have received better lashes for the same price.</li>
            <li>They did their job and made me pretty</li>
            <li>definitely continue purchasing more from now on.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>but over all they work pretty well</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH!</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY REPURCHASING!!! :)</li>
            <li>I really did not like these lashes!</li>
            <li>Love them and they will last me for a while</li>
            <li>When I first opened they look beutiful</li>
            <li>This is a first time purchase for me</li>
            <li>They go on great and last a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad these were only a couple bucks.</li>
            <li>They come looking exactly like the picture.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted for the price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought a lot of fake eyelashes and these are some of the best and cheapest.</li>
            <li>I bought these at first</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s an ok purchased</li>
            <li>but at that price it should&#x27;ve been expected order at ur own risk</li>
            <li>I can choose simple or flirty:)</li>
            <li>They stay on pretty well.</li>
            <li>I also gave it a three because it took a long time to arrive and it vexed me a great deal that my cell phone number was on the outside of the package underneath my address.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t look that natural, but they were cheap and somewhat did the job.</li>
            <li>We both love them and would definitely would buy them again.</li>
            <li>First of all, I ordered these lashes September 25 because I wanted them for Halloween.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like these!</li>
            <li>I love that they are two different one two pick from.</li>
            <li>They look exactly like they do in the picture.  </li>
            <li>They are working pretty well.</li>
            <li>Most definitely going to stock up on these!!</li>
            <li>Definitely going to reorder some more.</li>
            <li>They came exactly as shown in the photo.</li>
            <li>It however didn&#x27;t affect the lashes and I&#x27;m overall pleased.</li>
            <li>I would purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>FIRST OF ALL THESE EYELASHES COST</li>
            <li>BECAUSE MOST LIKELY THEY ARE BENT WHEN I GET UP</li>
            <li>imagine they would looks somewhat ok, if she was to indeed actually put them on.</li>
            <li>Have to cut the extra stem , but still love them 😎</li>
            <li>First off let me say these lashes are soooo pretty.</li>
            <li>Also, taking glue off after I use them is an absolute challenge!</li>
            <li>I was pleased to receive package earlier than promised.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and look fabulous.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what the seller said they would be</li>
            <li>GOT MANY COMPLIMENTS WOULD DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN.  </li>
            <li>You get exactly what they say you will get.</li>
            <li>I am always pleased and have ordered about 4 different packs of these now.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t exactly look like the pictures.</li>
            <li>but they look pretty and make your eyes stand out</li>
            <li>so be aware shipping could take awhile.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more of the thinner ones .</li>
            <li>Came exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>If these were excellent fake lashes, I would not complain.  </li>
            <li>i wish i did not buy them in the first place.</li>
            <li>I hope to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>I always receive them earlier than it claims on the item, so satisfied with that as well.</li>
            <li>you should be able to re-use for several days.</li>
            <li>Overall i am pleased with my service.</li>
            <li>but they are exactly like the ones in the picture.</li>
            <li>I really like the thicker ones!</li>
            <li>They look cheap and are to long, they don&#x27;t fit across your lash line.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>so the boxes were kind of crushed</li>
            <li>Makes your eyes really pop out !</li>
            <li>;) *</li>
            <li>I always buy more when I run low</li>
            <li>the thinner ones look nice when you wear them with minimal makeup.</li>
            <li>First off, the eye lashes came in a squished up box and some of them were damaged and un-useable.</li>
            <li>Absolute re-buy!</li>
            <li>And you also see in the picture exactly what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li>Thanks, again!</li>
            <li>They should blend in, otherwise you&#x27;d be looking pretty ratchet.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind the wait for the product , they are exactly what i was expecting .</li>
            <li>i first used them during a dance recital that i had to do, and then, i also used them on my one sister that does modeling.</li>
            <li>the most loveliest lashes this will be the only one I get now on.</li>
            <li>It is pretty tricky getting them on, but probably easier with practice.</li>
            <li>You get exactly what you see.</li>
            <li>These were great quality &amp; arrived earlier than expected; definitely worth ordering</li>
            <li>I really need to buy another set!</li>
            <li>Mine came exactly as pictured; one set of the thicker and one of the thinner ones.</li>
            <li>I love the lite ones, it looks close to human lashes.</li>
            <li>Came before expected time so that&#x27;s always nice.</li>
            <li>The thinner-looking ones make you look like you just have naturally long-looking eyelashes, and the bolder ones make you look fabulous.</li>
            <li>The box was kind of crushed inside the bubble envelope, but the products weren&#x27;t ruined.</li>
            <li>They are exactly how they look in the picture.</li>
            <li>These came a lot earlier than expected and were so beautiful when I got them.</li>
            <li>My first time buying eyelashes.</li>
            <li>First off it took a month to get here</li>
            <li>Definitely recommended on if you&#x27;re looking to save money and look fabulous!</li>
            <li>but, if I did I would probably choose something of a higher quality.</li>
            <li>although they are pretty lashes it just wasnt anything that i suspected</li>
            <li>Exactly like the picture.  </li>
            <li>but i defintley going to order more when i get low .</li>
            <li>Item came on time, you can create many looks with the different thickness of the eyelashes,ease to applying the eyelashes once you have gotten the hang of it,</li>
            <li>if it your first application</li>
            <li>Love them, been using them for a while and can&#x27;t get enough of them.</li>
            <li>Will more than likely buy from them again.</li>
            <li>Came exactly as pictured, but packing is flimsy</li>
            <li>I love to have both styles and make things different.</li>
            <li>get.&lt;br /&gt;The persons who are wearing them are pleased and still have several to wear and last for many months to go.</li>
            <li>what im used to but look forward to using them on a hot date night</li>
            <li>but they are very plasticky feeling!</li>
            <li>I also love how there are two different kinds of eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Spend a couple extra bucks and get a better quality one.  </li>
            <li>I was able to reuse these several times.</li>
            <li>I could have went to local beauty supply store for a better pair.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but I love that they are solid</li>
            <li>is my first time using lashes</li>
            <li>Wore them for the first time today</li>
            <li>gave a 3 stars because the package arrive pretty squashed up making some of the lashes bent out of shape.</li>
            <li>I wish I could just buy style #2 because those are my personal favorite</li>
            <li>so when i came across this product i figured I try them out at first</li>
            <li>im sure since there only 2 $</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty goid too coming from overseas</li>
            <li>but they are pretty and reusable.</li>
            <li>and they are cheap and look natural</li>
            <li>Thank u! ;-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only $29 and is so much better than falsies, plus its 100%natural &amp; hypoallergenic</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m thinking to combine 2 of the simpler one in order to bring up the volume.&lt;br /&gt;you can go and find something nicer, if you wanna have a higher quality.</li>
            <li>I have even been able to reuse them several times without issues.</li>
            <li>u will look funny when wearing them</li>
            <li>If you often wear fake eyelashes this is perfect.</li>
            <li>Only wish they were a bit more bendy.</li>
            <li>So pretty for the nights you just want to doll up.</li>
            <li>I bet that&#x27;s why the price is able to stay low.</li>
            <li>I really like them!</li>
            <li>My first day wearin them, they fell off and wouldn&#x27;t stick.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>the title is pretty self explanatory.</li>
            <li>Definitely buying more.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what you would expect them to be.</li>
            <li>2-3 pairs for the play that I was in but for daily street wear they are ok</li>
            <li>, the lashes are made more out of  plasticky material rather than actual hair.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first but very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and when i tried to cut the excess it was not cutting very well dont recommend theses</li>
            <li>these were my first lashes to ever buy and try to wear</li>
            <li>A friend of mine recommend these lashes to me because she knows I&#x27;m starting to get more females asking me to do their makeup.</li>
            <li>I love them, and I will definitely be buying them again.</li>
            <li>And they are very itchy!</li>
            <li>but I still have many of them left.</li>
            <li>They fit well and look natural</li>
            <li>I use both on a daily basis and am ordering more.</li>
            <li>All the same wish had more of a variety</li>
            <li>However with time they last and held their form..I will reorder them for sure.</li>
            <li>but if you wrap the lashes around a pencil and hold them like that for several seconds then the shape becomes more rounded, and you will have to cut off the ends with scissors.</li>
            <li>Well first of all, the lashes look so plastic.</li>
            <li>but dont plan on ordering any more of these in the future</li>
            <li>I would purchase them again most definitely</li>
            <li>Just make sure to glue them well and possibly bring your glue with you to prevent them from falling off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once we received the first shipment and she me</li>
            <li>it looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend if you want tons of lashes for different make up styles and looks to pull off for a cheap price get them!</li>
            <li>I really like them a lot!</li>
            <li>They are very well made!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy this product again. :)</li>
            <li>I will keep them in my lash stash but won&#x27;t be my first pick.</li>
            <li>; the thinner lash set looks pretty natural&lt;</li>
            <li>will definitely be purchasing again :)</li>
            <li>at first I didn&#x27;t think I would like them</li>
            <li>i finally got these, and i love these.</li>
            <li>When i first read the reviews i thought</li>
            <li>Just exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>first I was worried about buying the thicker pairs</li>
            <li>Very plastic look until you put mascara on them!</li>
            <li>Stil have my first pair on</li>
            <li>Glad I got two different styles.</li>
            <li>all smiles when opening my package and it was exactly how it was described.</li>
            <li>I actually forgot I had them on...love them and the price I love the length of time</li>
            <li>but overall I do love these lashes</li>
            <li>really pretty .</li>
            <li>Good if you want to wear a costume, not for everyday.</li>
            <li>but I trashed few pairs learning to put them on but they are really good for the price..</li>
            <li>Weight wise though it seems like they are a bit heavy on my eyes</li>
            <li>even i have really good glue they dont stick because they are firm and doesnt shape..</li>
            <li>well i dont even have to wear eyeliner with these one they look clean an not messy !</li>
            <li>Took long to come but the lashes are nice and super soft</li>
            <li>the only reason i&#x27;m giving 2 stars is because you get 20 for super cheap.</li>
            <li>I received these in less than two weeks, and in great condition!&lt;br /&gt;They are soft.</li>
            <li>They have no flare, and are not super reusable, but they&#x27;re cute and cheap.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really going for super quality as much as I needed plenty of pairs to practice learning how to apply them correctly to my eyes.  </li>
            <li>the only thing is that theyre long and basically identical on both sides , so make sure you put the right eyelash on the right eye, and trim them right to fit.</li>
            <li>The more subtle lashes are pretty nice and blend in really well.</li>
            <li>The more natural looking set are really beautiful and wearable, both for parties and regular days when you feel like looking a little bit luxurious!</li>
            <li>These lashes would probably work if I have right glue, and another thing is I cannot get these to blend in with my real lashes.</li>
            <li>Too stiff and do not feel good on your eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that I can reuse the lashes a few times if I clean them properly.  </li>
            <li>CVS now stocks ARDELL, YUP, ARDELL, which is the only kind this professional will use from here on out!</li>
            <li>Had great variety on whether I wanted a natural look or more dramatic.  </li>
            <li>They definitely look super great , if you know how to apply them on , gives you a super fimenen look , specially for trans girls or anygirl , they loook really great inloveeeee , if you wanna go for a natural.look use the thin ones , if you wanna go for a smokey eye or to just get dolled up use thick ;)</li>
            <li>love the fact that there are so many of them and there are large ones and small ones to choose from</li>
            <li>I really love the new eyelashes, I love to mess around with makeup</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re pretty good lashes overall, the only issue with mine was that a couple of the lashes were pretty messed up and unusable.</li>
            <li>The styles are a bit dramatic for me, but they&#x27;re very good quality and the price is a steal.</li>
            <li>but other then that they wer amazing</li>
            <li>I purchased these a little while ago, got them early so thats great.</li>
            <li>Yes they are plastic and cheap but they come in cute little boxes.</li>
            <li>so am in love with the #1028 eyelashes and i will reccomend them to the people who love smokey eyes as well , the other pair which is #118 i will be using for like school days , day at a park , mall , places where you want a have more like a natural long eyelash look .</li>
            <li>The package was a bit smooshed in places, but I kind of expected that as it was shipped all the way from Hong Kong!</li>
            <li>The other ones look nice</li>
            <li>but other than that they were nice c:</li>
            <li>I cut up Style 2 because its a little much for me, but  I ordered this product twice because I loved the price.  </li>
            <li>When they come out of package , there straight lol  no curve , kinda hard to put on</li>
            <li>Very cheap, not natural, took forever to arrive.</li>
            <li>I love them, if you that kind of person that loooove being notice then wear the tick ones, i use them almost everyday, and i use the natural ones when i only wear eyeliner, they are handmade &amp; free shipping.</li>
            <li>Really it just depends on the glue you are using I guess.&lt;br /&gt;The natural ones are really light weight</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so experienced with fake lashes, but I bought these because they were cheap and there is alot</li>
            <li>They do need trimmed but they look great and arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>I got these in Style 2, which is the regular long ones and I must say THEY ARE AMAZING!</li>
            <li>One of the best values thus far for false lashes.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the heavy looking one but love the light one.</li>
            <li>so I will definitely be ordering some more real soon.</li>
            <li>I purchased both the regular and thick eyelashes and both were perfect.</li>
            <li>the only thing is if you get the free shipping it takes quite a while to get them but they are so worth it</li>
            <li>am so tickeled with this purchase, I simply can NOT say enough good things.  </li>
            <li>I get about 5 uses for each pair, only if take really good care of them, especially when your taking them off.</li>
            <li>So first, the product was delivered pretty fast considering the fact that it ships from China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also good to reuse for a little while also!</li>
            <li>When I first got them I was kind of let down.  </li>
            <li>but it doesnt make a difference :) on my picture, my left eye has the larger lashes, and my right eye has the more natural ones</li>
            <li>they are perfect either for everyday wear or the &amp;#34;dramatic&amp;#34; look, the only thing is you have to trim the sides to fit because they have long edges.</li>
            <li>I got most of my lashes bent, and they werent long enough to cover the whole eye like most do.</li>
            <li>These here also have the more full look that are thick and the thinner more natural look.</li>
            <li>The item was a little damaged but other than that it was perfect</li>
            <li>Super soft and wear well!</li>
            <li>They look nice but the part u glue on is little bigger then most</li>
            <li>These are super long so you will have to cut them to fit your eyes just like any pair of lashes.</li>
            <li>The thick eyelashes kind of came a little bend but just kind of curl them by bending and they will be fine.</li>
            <li>These are really sturdy and pretty.  </li>
            <li>They came pretty fast too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more for costume wear not classy events.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re very pretty and look natural!</li>
            <li>and when you first glimpse the eyelashes in the box they look really synthetic.</li>
            <li>and they barely bend to fit your eye.</li>
            <li>Arrived pretty fast.</li>
            <li>one set are cute ,long and simple.which</li>
            <li>They look really fake and cheap to be honest but they are cheap</li>
            <li>/&gt;they come off pretty straight</li>
            <li>Other than needing to adjust for my left eye they are great.</li>
            <li>this product is pretty much plastic.</li>
            <li>They come exactly like in the picture in 2 boxes and they were packaged very well.</li>
            <li>I still have them nd will be a long time until I buy more</li>
            <li>I love the different lengths on the lashes much like how I get them designed at the spa very flattering</li>
            <li>When you first see the lashes they look very cheap ( kinda expected based on the price)</li>
            <li>It comes with a pack of regular every day lashes and a pack of lashes for when you&#x27;re going for a night out on the town or special occasion!</li>
            <li>I will still use them because they are nice but just not very comfortable.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re into dramatic lashes and you are looking for some cheap ones, these are a good option for you.</li>
            <li>They were a decent quality and a very very low price considering one pair or slightly better quality ones can run anywhere from $4-$25 a pair.</li>
            <li>They are very shiny and pretty large</li>
            <li>Super dramatic lashes great for people who love that they are so wide you have to cut both ends</li>
            <li>I just love these lashes they arrived very quick and there are so many of them, natural, dramatic and fullness.</li>
            <li>The thicker lashes are very dramatic and perfect for an ultra glamorous night on the town.</li>
            <li>For them to be less than $5 they are amazing.</li>
            <li>the bigger lashes are a bit bulky but cute and the lighter lashes are fine just as long as you cut them to size</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t expect them to look super natural..</li>
            <li>This will be my first time considering I use red cherry eyelashes , I bought these because they were cheap .</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to apply and last all day.</li>
            <li>They were easy to use,I just snipped the extra strips on the side,applied the glue,and then the lashes.</li>
            <li>a nice line of eyeliner and black adhesive and pop them on.  </li>
            <li>I love love love the thick long ones, and the thin ones are nice to just more natural.</li>
            <li>I definitely like the way the lashes are made and how easy they are to work with.</li>
            <li>and they are very realistic.</li>
            <li>but u do have to buy your own adhesive which I&#x27;d suggest getting black</li>
            <li>they look super natural on and i can wear them to family events</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how quickly my order was shipped.  </li>
            <li>The thin ones are nice because you can coat them with mascara for a more realistic look.  </li>
            <li>these are pretty good lashes, for what i usd them for at least.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;d be better off getting a single pair with the self adhesive.</li>
            <li>CVS HAS ARDELL IN A LARGE ASSORTMENT.</li>
            <li>I would certainly order this item again from amazon.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this it is plastic pure plastic</li>
            <li>Will certainly buy again</li>
            <li>But yeah, I certainly got what I paid for here.</li>
            <li>They are pure plastic.</li>
            <li>Although they are of good quality and are plenty long enough even for the largest eyes the way that are packaged leaves them straight as a board when you remove them from the box.  </li>
            <li>So beautiful lasted me a long time and came in a little earlier highly recommend them going to buy more</li>
            <li>They are okay, but they really just don&#x27;t want to stay on for very long.</li>
            <li>the less obnoxious ones are nice haha.</li>
            <li>when I first got them, I thought there was absolutely no way that these lashes would blend with my own, but I was happily proved wrong.</li>
            <li>I love my new lashes!I can go heavy for an evening look or light for day</li>
            <li>fine/look fine in person if you cover the band well enough.</li>
            <li>These are surprisingly decent quality!</li>
            <li>So a decent product!</li>
            <li>The eyelashes were pretty decent considering the price for it, PLUS</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t feel very high quality</li>
            <li>I also love that the smaller lashes are actually very natural looking and if applied correctly you can&#x27;t tell whether they&#x27;re real or not.</li>
            <li>These last all day dont look super fake and are great quality but probably have to be trimmed to fit.</li>
            <li>My glue sucks, so I haven&#x27;t been able to wear them out yet, but I think with some quality glue these would be fine.</li>
            <li>They are a little more fake looking (as far realistic looking falsies go) than the higher dollar ones but great customer service, fast shipping and very comfortable</li>
            <li>, they lay flat when you take them off the board, they dont stay curved for easy application&lt;</li>
            <li>and you barely feel them, I do like them specially for the price and quantity</li>
            <li>The more natural looking ones on the right are the only ones i&#x27;ve tried so far (Which is today) and my lashes look uh-may-zinggg!</li>
            <li>Also, make sure to carry/have scissors (specially when traveling) because they require that you cut off the ends before applying them; Not because they are too long, but because they have an extra piece on each side where they are attached to the box.</li>
            <li>The lighter ones are perfect for everyday wear as they don&#x27;t feel heavy .</li>
            <li>I love them they look nice not too expensive.</li>
            <li>Really I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much from them</li>
            <li>Dont cost much anyways why not buy it?</li>
            <li>I got 20 pairs for 3 bucks, so I can&#x27;t really say much.</li>
            <li>They are absolute junk</li>
            <li>I like the fact i didnt had to paid so much and got i lot for what i pay for thank you.</li>
            <li>but i really like them</li>
            <li>They work really well</li>
            <li>Really brings out the face.</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>fast shipping though</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t take too much longer to put on, but its not helpful if these start falling off within an hour or two.</li>
            <li>The eyelashes don&#x27;t even appear close to looking really.</li>
            <li>They look very plastic.</li>
            <li>They were very flimsy.</li>
            <li>Very cheap,too long,does not stay on,I rather get them done at the salon or stick to the name brands</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter how much its being sold for wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>Very plastic-y feeling, made my eyes itch</li>
            <li>Do not be scared to buy this eyelashes they will save you  so much  money</li>
            <li>These lashes are so cheap and aren&#x27;t even made of human hair.</li>
            <li>Incognito much?</li>
            <li>so much cheaper than buying them from Sally&#x27;s and walmart.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to the shorter, thicker ones but they look really tacky.</li>
            <li>They arrived at my house very damaged.</li>
            <li>and you get a lot for such a cheap price</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t really use them.</li>
            <li>the item came in well pack and fast..</li>
            <li>Very affordable .</li>
            <li>For the price you can&#x27;t complain hahaha.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really love them to drag queen for me</li>
            <li>They look very anime-ish.</li>
            <li>I did not like so much.</li>
            <li>obviously they are cheap</li>
            <li>Got them fast considering they are from china...</li>
            <li>Not made of real hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them whole</li>
            <li>The eyelashes are plastic , I preffer paying the 5$ for a pair because they are so much easier to put on and stay on longer.</li>
            <li>but they really aren&#x27;t usable</li>
            <li>very plastic looking and feeling and don&#x27;t stay on too well.</li>
            <li>It really looks like your real lashes.  </li>
            <li>It has been almost a whole month</li>
            <li>Very plastic looking and feeling</li>
            <li>I apply eyelash glue to them (do not use real glue, and also the eyelash glue does not come in the set - so that will need to be purchased separate).</li>
            <li>I am used to a much thinner band.</li>
            <li>These eyelashes really suck....</li>
            <li>They are more for Halloween or drag queens.  </li>
            <li>i didnt like these they were to plastic feeling and dont work very well.</li>
            <li>they are too much in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I didnt use them much so</li>
            <li>I really like the Style 2</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like that you have to cut those extension things off</li>
            <li>I really like both sets of eye lashes but they are not reusable, I tried to wash them off but it damaged them</li>
            <li>It really depends on my mood.</li>
            <li>is very sparse there is a substantial amount of space in between the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If not, they are just too much.</li>
            <li>they are straight.</li>
            <li>I like to wear eyelashes that are almost like real hair.</li>
            <li>but I preference is real hair.</li>
            <li>They are made from plastic,  but when you have them on,  nobody could really tell.  </li>
            <li>Plus they don&#x27;t really stay on correctly.</li>
            <li>but the thin lashes are great.  </li>
            <li>TOOO much info for all to see.</li>
            <li>theyre straight.</li>
            <li>I had received this product extremely fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see any reason for these Lashes to take 49 days to ship.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that they don&#x27;t look very plastic</li>
            <li>lashes were synthetic and very unnatural looking.</li>
            <li>I really these eyelashes it even though I was a bit scared to purchase them because i didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li>i really like them&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re not even real hair</li>
            <li>The lashes themselves feel very plastic, which wasn&#x27;t an issue to me, but it might be someone else.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very enthused to have received these eyelashes today.</li>
            <li>so I go through lashes fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch</li>
            <li>Also,  this item will be very helpful for you.</li>
            <li>They are plastic and not at all like real hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather buy real hair ones at Walmart any day.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely ♡ these eyelashes.</li>
            <li>And the heavier ones aren&#x27;t too much if you&#x27;re going out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product..</li>
            <li>but over all i really like it..</li>
            <li>They dont even look real at all .</li>
            <li>I really wish they would stay on for longer periods of time, but that might just be the glue I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be straight deff purchase again</li>
            <li>Lashes have the feel of real hair.</li>
            <li>Some have too much glue that you can see it</li>
            <li>Too much shine.</li>
            <li>they came really fast considering they came from hong kong or something...</li>
            <li>I recommend this to any girl who wants to save some money who also wear lashes alot.</li>
            <li>These come straight from China</li>
            <li>These are very affordable and sizable.  </li>
            <li>Really dont buy</li>
            <li>and they came fast.</li>
            <li>AND Yes this is a real person.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping..</li>
            <li>Lets just say they went straight to the trash.</li>
            <li>but they are a bit much..</li>
            <li>ALTHOUGH I DONT HAVE MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH EYELASHES</li>
            <li>These eyelashes really make my eyes pop</li>
            <li>Of course, if you know what you&#x27;re doing, you can cover the band up some without much problem.&lt;br /&gt;Dramatic</li>
            <li>Expected more but like price</li>
            <li>I really really really like these eyelashes  </li>
            <li>the eyelashes arent made with real hair or anything like they feel very plastic</li>
            <li>You have to curve the lashes to fit your eye prior to putting on this lash.  </li>
            <li>but she ended up liking them because she can gently wash and reuse them</li>
            <li>They take FOREVER to adhere to my eyes because they are heavier then real hair eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I imagine it&#x27;s much easier when they&#x27;re sharper.</li>
            <li>It will help them apply much easier.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The thinner looking ones (Style 2) really doesn&#x27;t do much unless you just don&#x27;t have eye lashes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look or feel like real lashes.  </li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve observed, they will give a really &amp;#34;dolly&amp;#34; effect.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only giving a 4 star because I have not used the light lashes yet.</li>
            <li>&amp; they really have no curve to them .</li>
            <li>without having to spend so much money to get</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>They look very costume-y.</li>
            <li>The eyelashes work really well</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re too straight.</li>
            <li>Like them a lot and very cheep</li>
            <li>doesnt look real,.</li>
            <li>When they arrived I was very please with the quality .</li>
            <li>Someone came up to me and asked me if they were real.</li>
            <li>Did not look real at all.</li>
            <li>Very hard/stiff lashes.</li>
            <li>But if you can keep them bent, maybe tie them around a ping pong ball or something until you&#x27;re ready to use them..</li>
            <li>/&gt;SO REAL, I RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>thank you soo much for letting me buy these.</li>
            <li>Just wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting they looked really really cheap,I won&#x27;t be buying agin but thank you..</li>
            <li>I really wish I didn&#x27;t buy these.</li>
            <li>I personally do not like the lashes because the quality seems cheap</li>
            <li>And also feel like straight plastic.</li>
            <li>up to 3 times!Shipping was fast and there was no damage to the product or packaging when it arrived.</li>
            <li>The section that attaches to the eye, is very stuff.</li>
            <li>Such a cheap quality I still haven&#x27;t used them.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really work well though because they aren&#x27;t fitted to the curved eye shape.</li>
            <li>but otherwise they&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li>Very plastic looking when you apply them</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>But I will have to see just how dramtic the look really is.</li>
            <li>It was also a really fast shipping i received them wihtin a week.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with the product received, there just was not much indication when it was ordered that product was being sent from china.  </li>
            <li>I really wish they would stay on for longer periods of time, but that might just be the glue I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was really fast, recieved a week</li>
            <li>The thin lashes are great</li>
            <li>They are very plastic, but that&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li>They do feel much more &amp;#34;plastic-y&amp;#34; than the lashes I am used to, but that&#x27;s to be expected for this price.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Band is too thin but for a price this is surely a win..</li>
            <li>They looked like my real eyelashes.</li>
            <li>And you get a whole bunch.  </li>
            <li>The box was really squished, and not all of they eyelashes were in their designated spots.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t even for real eyes.</li>
            <li>but I just don&#x27;t like the fact that the hair isn&#x27;t real hair.</li>
            <li>Real hair is my prefrence though.</li>
            <li>Also They weren&#x27;t real eyelashes</li>
            <li>Way better than expected.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care too much for the thinner ones, which I am going to give to my sister, since she doesn&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; look for eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>they aren&#x27;t real hair</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>fast thank you</li>
            <li>Also, my eyes are almond shape and these do not bend to shape your eye very well.</li>
            <li>they weren&#x27;t really curly</li>
            <li>Arrived crushed, but everything was still ok.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t real of course.</li>
            <li>Very noticeable.</li>
            <li>These lashes are a really affordable purchase.</li>
            <li>I really like the thicker ones.</li>
            <li>I find they&#x27;re much easier to put on.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really use them much</li>
            <li>They are very lightweight which I like</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>and of course you have to cut them to fit your eye seeing as no one has the same shape eye.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my daughter as she is a freelance makeup artist and these make her life much easier.</li>
            <li>The lashes are completely straight.  </li>
            <li>Went straight in the trash</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Came on time and packaged very well</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t tried out style #2 that much</li>
            <li>for the price you really cannot beat it..</li>
            <li>I really like these lashes for the price.</li>
            <li>HAHA.</li>
            <li>I really recommend.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>They are really shift&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Delivered fast too.  </li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>Just a few dollars more you are able to get lashes that actually glue onto your eye lids.</li>
            <li>I really didnt like the plastic material.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had this problem and its very upsetting.</li>
            <li>Threw them straight into the trash.</li>
            <li>Oh goodness why did I buy these haha.</li>
            <li>Cannot really get these to glue or stay on...</li>
            <li>they straight and no flexibly bend</li>
            <li>Really wish I didn&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li>FOR REAL</li>
            <li>The price and delivery rate were better than expected.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t really &amp;#34;ready to wear.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the texture of this product, but hey you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li>Im just used to falsies that have real hair</li>
            <li>but i really don&#x27;t care cause they weren&#x27;t for me</li>
            <li>They came just as shown in the picture, depending on how big your eyes are you will probably have to trim off some of the lashes to fit your eyes.</li>
            <li>2 see that the shipping would takea month, also when I got them they looked really plastic. .</li>
            <li>The lashes feel very plastic and flimsy and do not retain their shape at all.</li>
            <li>or how much glue i used.</li>
            <li>You really get what you pay for, for these lashes.</li>
            <li>They are absolutely tacky</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for eyelashes that look completely real then these are not for you.</li>
            <li>how much she likes them</li>
            <li>because she goes through them so much.</li>
            <li>and they look so real.</li>
            <li>i would highly reccommend!</li>
            <li>I really like them</li>
            <li>but their really well made and quality.</li>
            <li>arrived and ready to use them</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really like how the lash line where you glue was really think so</li>
            <li>I do this gently because the eyelashes are handmade</li>
            <li>They are very affordable.</li>
            <li>However they just look sooo real once you put them on.</li>
            <li>shipped fast and as described</li>
            <li>They both suit me depending on how much make up</li>
            <li>I was very pleases with the lashes.</li>
            <li>much eyeliner</li>
            <li>Not gna complain too much considering the price, so I&#x27;ll just say two stars bc</li>
            <li>They won&#x27;t really pass in day to day life.  </li>
            <li>the are straight and not eye conformed</li>
            <li>who can really complain about it.</li>
            <li>but for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>, very straight&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>AND NOW SHE HAS A WHOLE COLLECTION</li>
            <li>I really thought they came with a glue or something</li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars because I would of liked the eyelashes to not be so heavy.</li>
            <li>yes i will recomend this product because have different kind of eyelashes for use in different events, conclusión</li>
            <li>The thinner ones are nice for everyday evening wear.</li>
            <li>I have always had trouble putting them on but nice quantity for the price.</li>
            <li>They move a lot better with my natural shape rather than what a big name company thinks eye shape should be.  </li>
            <li>I WEAR THEM EVERYDAY TO ENHANCE MY OWN LASHES</li>
            <li>I will be getting more in the near future.</li>
            <li>and I love how they&#x27;re short near the corner or the eye and towards the outer part</li>
            <li>Great for begginers looking to learn how to apply false</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to wear a pair once and throw them away and not feel like Ive wasted a bunch of money.</li>
            <li>I prefer using more natural eyelashes for daily use or a night out.</li>
            <li>I bought these on a whim and figured if they weren&#x27;t good at least I didn&#x27;t lose much $.</li>
            <li>the way, I love natural neutral make up so the lashes totally go with it.</li>
            <li>I plan to order more in the near future.  </li>
            <li>the full ones aren&#x27;t so full that you look like a drag queen either.</li>
            <li>They take forever to arrive, but they are really great false eyelashes.</li>
            <li>could of asked for more i love the false lashes .</li>
            <li>gave the thick ones to a friend who loved them.  </li>
            <li>I have only used 1 pair of the 20 pairs of false eyelashes, but it was perfect.</li>
            <li>I loved the thick styled one.</li>
            <li>Slow shipping but really good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>They are a little stiff, but they are perfect for costume wear, cosplay or even just playing around.  </li>
            <li>I found it very easy to apply when I cut them in half.</li>
            <li>The black paint also rubs off very easily.</li>
            <li>great lashes but there a tad to shiny when worn and youd also have to cut them down to the size of your lash line because there to long</li>
            <li>/&gt;Those were the main problems I was seeing in the lower reviews, but other than these small issues, these lashes are great!</li>
            <li>OR IF YOU ARE ONLY FAMILIAR WITH A CERTAIN TYPE OF LASH BAND</li>
            <li>oh my gosh i was so surprised when i got these!!!</li>
            <li>thinner ones look perfect and natural for everyday use and the thicker ones are more dramatic, I&#x27;m not a very over the top person</li>
            <li>they are okay , worth the price they are very thin on the top</li>
            <li>They have to be modified a bit, and the lash line is thick, but other wise, good steal, especially if you wear falsies a lot and don&#x27;t re-use them</li>
            <li>I mean I&#x27;ve worn Style 1 and they look gorgeous and all</li>
            <li>I actually wore a few of the thinner lashes and they worked very nicely.</li>
            <li>They are kind of stiff</li>
            <li>Before applying the lashes be sure and hold them up to your eyelid and see how they fit to make sure you don&#x27;t need to cut the ends shorter or anything, i usually have to cut a little off the ends.</li>
            <li>and I got mine in less 15 days, which is great because I&#x27;m super impatient.</li>
            <li>I really liked the dramatic eyelashes better than the natural looking ones.</li>
            <li>but u get what u pay for it , this lashes are long and stife not for easy aplication</li>
            <li>these are not natural looking lashes at all, i use them for stage makeup, but they are cheap and pretty decent quality</li>
            <li>They look super fake and I use the 99¢store kind they look super platicy</li>
            <li>they are really shiny, they don&#x27;t really look too realistic ,and they also don&#x27;t bend very well ,i wont be buying these lashes again .</li>
            <li>They are very straight so you will need to spend a little bit of time bending them to adhere better to your eye shape.</li>
            <li>They fit my eye perfectly fine but for really small eyes , youll want to trim them &amp; they dont come with glue</li>
            <li>I bought these mainly for practicing and they were such a cheap price,  they did take awhile to come...</li>
            <li>Not sure why so many complaints on these no problems here!</li>
            <li>these are lot more stiffer than other eyelashes</li>
            <li>I love using them on myself and on other people.</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t disform on my face other than that they are ok to have in case of an eye lash emergency</li>
            <li>Other than that i would buy more.</li>
            <li>I originally bought these for cosplay, but I&#x27;ve found myself wearing them even on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>they are a lil hatd to bend the other ones are ok</li>
            <li>I also find they&#x27;re more reusable than other lashes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It took for forever to ship but other than that theyre ok ..</li>
            <li>i was so excited when they finally came.</li>
            <li>I ordered two sets for my teen daughter, and she was so excited to have them.</li>
            <li>But you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>A little long, but great if you go out a lot.</li>
            <li>Other than that i love these lashes.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I totally love them</li>
            <li>and I feel them falling off my eyelids pretty early into the evening!</li>
            <li>I originally bought these for cosplay, but I&#x27;ve found myself wearing them even on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I love these due to quantity and style of lashes</li>
            <li>Other than that I was pleased.</li>
            <li>not best quality but for a beginner who is learning to use them like me they are good!</li>
            <li>I have to trim mine a little to get it to fit my eye, but they are easy to put on, feel and look natural.</li>
            <li>If you want a dramatic look these are great.</li>
            <li>sometimes to dramatic but there great.</li>
            <li>As long as you cut the &amp;#34;stringy&amp;#34; ends off, they work just fine.</li>
            <li>I cut them in half and use them just on my outer because they definitely don&#x27;t look good whole.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They feel super soft and are apparently made with real hair!</li>
            <li>and I clean them and place them back</li>
            <li>But the thin ones are beautiful for a natural sort of look.</li>
            <li>The band is pretty thick and they stay nicely on my lashes.</li>
            <li>The nice thing about these is that they make them long enough for personalization.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to get much use out of the mega super thick ones</li>
            <li>It was cheaply made the bold lashes are a little bolder than my taste.</li>
            <li>They give you two different types of false lashes for a pretty good price!.</li>
            <li>Work them a little before proceeding so they are a little more pliable as they are pretty stiff out of the package, trim them to fit you, &amp; use a good glue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed having two different options in the style: thicker and darker for a night on the town, or a thinner, more natural look for everyday use.</li>
            <li>The thick ones are performance perfect and the thin ones make a great everyday eye enhancement.</li>
            <li>the thin ones aren&#x27;t that great but in love with the thick ones always a fun time</li>
            <li>SO I HAD BOTH 20 PAIRS OF REGULAR AND THINK LASHES TO JUST MY RIGHT EYE!</li>
            <li>It is the same thing of the picture right there!</li>
            <li>all your have to do is cut the extra string that&#x27;s on the ends and put them right on!</li>
            <li>THEY WERENT AS GREAT AS THE PREVIOUS BRAND IM USED TO, AND IF YOUR ROUGH ON LASHES LIKE ME</li>
            <li>These lashes shipped out super fast to me from HK and arrived about a week or two, almost three weeks earlier than what was estimated.</li>
            <li>Came super fast, the thicker lashes are way to shiny and plastic looking for me personally.</li>
            <li>The strip is long which can be trimmed to fit any size eyelid.</li>
            <li>You do need to trim them to fit your eye though as they are a bit long.</li>
            <li>really cheap plastic material and really long.</li>
            <li>Came over a week earlier than expected &amp; the eyelashes are absolutely lovely!</li>
            <li>First of the lashes were delivered a week early so that was a plus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried the natural ones, which are great for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>Not sure what I ordered the picture makes the eyelashes look really nice and</li>
            <li>They look exactly like my natural lashes without mascara.</li>
            <li>I use the natural looking ones  more often, but if you&#x27;re daring than the thicker false lashes are a must have :)</li>
            <li>but as soon as I saw the first box, (the natural side)</li>
            <li>The thinner ones look pretty natural in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This was sapposed to be a cool Christmas present</li>
            <li>I have been told to hold off on buying any more for the time being, I think she&#x27;s running over with these lashes, but she still loves them all, and they are not all the same type, I think that part was a big hit also, Thanks.</li>
            <li>These are not bad at all and especially for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>Decent for the price, lash band is really thin, lashes are straight; but you can bend them to fit more to your eye shape.</li>
            <li>But, if you want it to be soft right away, I suggest to kind of bend the lining a little bit or use eyelash curler softly so that it&#x27;s a little bit more flexible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I would really order them they are not hard at all</li>
            <li>I am pretty good at applying false eyelashes as I wear them daily, and these wouldn&#x27;t stay put very well, it took a lot of coaxing to get them to stick in the right spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i love this variety of lashes and sometimes I can even reuse the lash up to three- four times, durable, extremely complimenting!</li>
            <li>Good product good-quality wish they were packaged differently have to make them shaped my eyes a little bit</li>
            <li>the product came in seperate boxes in an envelope, so the boxes were a little banged up, but did a good enough job of protecting whats inside.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s thick band, however it does make the lashes look more full and shorter than the other more natural looking ones.</li>
            <li>The thinner, lighter ones are a little more malleable and I really like them</li>
            <li>Style 1 are very Doll looking very full and not long enough for my taste.</li>
            <li>but each pair is really only good for one wear whereas I normally get about three from more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>I know I shouldn&#x27;t be picky or have a hight expectatio on the quality being that I did pay such a cheap amount, but i have ordered other lashes this cheap</li>
            <li>Much lighter and more natural than other lashes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>When I messaged the seller they were very polite though and reshipped a new set.</li>
            <li>I could barely blink right.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if you bend and play with the plastic to make it less rigid then it will feel better.</li>
            <li>However it may just be me because I have black hair, and if you have any lighter color hair the lashes may look more notiable.</li>
            <li>I love these lashes the work like ones u would buy in the store half the price</li>
            <li>The dramatic ones look extremely cheap, I used the natural ones and they looked nice.</li>
            <li>These are decent eye lashes.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t even hold mascara to make look realistic.</li>
            <li>My only complaints are that these lashes are synthetic looking, which is ok if you are wearing them as part of a costume but not for daily use.</li>
            <li>they look fake for sure... but isn&#x27;t that what most people wanted to wear them for?&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>The thick ones are ones I used for a few cosplays I did and they worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Need a steady hand to cut to the size of someone&#x27;s eyes.</li>
            <li>and I got those in a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>They are super low quality.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase and will DEFINITELY purchase these again in the future !</li>
            <li>Over all it&#x27;s a decent deal for what you pay for.</li>
            <li>The thick eyelashes would be great for Halloween or to possibly look like a Jersey Shore member....</li>
            <li>You get what you see, and they are decent in quality.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, there is nothing wring with these, but they are cheap looking and being plastic makes it harder to get them to flow with your real lashes.  </li>
            <li>definitely will order more later!</li>
            <li>I actually get about 40 pairs and even better if stored properly they can be worn</li>
            <li>but i was in love with how thin and light they were on my eyes...</li>
            <li>The thick lashes can get heavy (so if you&#x27;re looking for desu manga &amp;#34;come hither&amp;#34; bedroom eyes they are perfect).</li>
            <li>more for smaller eyes, I have big eyes</li>
            <li>however the only issue I had was the line to apply the glue was super slim.</li>
            <li>I plan on using the bold ones for my boyfriend&#x27;s 21st birthday bash.</li>
            <li>They are ok the thin ones but they are cheap</li>
            <li>Takes away from the realistic look</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t realistic at all</li>
            <li>decent eyelashes</li>
            <li>but overall i really love them especially the fuller lashes.</li>
            <li>Not what I was expecting but still decent.</li>
            <li>I love the quantity &amp; quality for such a low price.</li>
            <li>All it really took was a good eyelash curler and a thin coat of mascara and</li>
            <li>the material is not very good they are made of some kind of plastic and it can be bothersome to my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have bought more expensive ones in the past and I like them better than this, BUT considering the price was super cheap</li>
            <li>Very soft and glamorous!</li>
            <li>Looks very natural when u put them on!</li>
            <li>They are very soft to the touch, for this price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li>If you want better, high quality eyelashes you pretty much have to pay at least $5.</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply, but you probably need to trim them a little at the lash line to fit if you have smaller eyes.</li>
            <li>They were very stiff though so kind of a pain to get on.</li>
            <li>The packaging could have been better too, sent in a tight, non padded envelope, which allowed one side of the box to get smashed and ruined a couple sets of lashes.</li>
            <li>The band of the lashes is very stiff feeling and kind of feels like a wire.</li>
            <li>but they do not feel good on my eyes and are very hard to put on because of the plastic material</li>
            <li>I loved the styles of them both, but the bands were very hard to bend over my eyelid to make them stick.</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t waste your money very cheap lashes feel like plastic</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>When I want to splurge then I will get the high end lashes and &amp;#34;professional application&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these lashes for the price.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product to be purchased by consumers</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li>If your looking for high quality lashes these are not it.</li>
            <li>Why pay high prices in store</li>
            <li>I received this product with high hopes.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting high quality lashes</li>
            <li>and I did used a high quality lash glue.</li>
            <li>You might get what you want, but there&#x27;s a high chance you won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Although the ones from the store (Andrea and Ardell Brand) are more expensive, they feel much nicer, are easier to apply and look more natural.</li>
            <li>Wish they came a little more curled, but curled them with an eyelash curler and it worked decent.</li>
            <li>Not only are these fantastic, but no other way to go for a beginner!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Problem: lashes are hard to care for and clean (I bought a case for lashes since these lashes came in huge box) and the shipping was well...</li>
            <li>The don&#x27;t feel as nice as more expensive ones but for this price I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something that looks natural these lashes aren&#x27;t the best, even the less thick ones.</li>
            <li>the other one style two is what i wear since it gives it a more natural look</li>
            <li>These were fine, and there&#x27;s not much to say about eyelashes.</li>
            <li>The large ones aren&#x27;t natural looking</li>
            <li>they are a little flimsy but my daughter bought better glue</li>
            <li>I suggest paying a little more for lashes at Walmart, etc.</li>
            <li>You pay a little more</li>
            <li>Over all they were shipped on time and arrived in ok condition, the boxes were a little smashed</li>
            <li>Even if I don&#x27;t get all the glue out, I could do a little something to make it better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try another brand and spend a little more.</li>
            <li>Sure, I got a lot for a little, but I got a lot of GARBAGE.</li>
            <li>Wow what a deal !!</li>
            <li>Not as natural as I wanted them to look!!</li>
            <li>I totally messed up my make up trying to use it for the first time!</li>
            <li>Great for a natural look as well as a dramatic look.</li>
            <li>down side of ordering these, is that it took a good month and a half for me to get them, but for free shipping and only 2 dollars, I think that&#x27;s a steal!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got them for show choir because the thick black ones look great on stage, but i wore the more natural ones on a daily basis!</li>
            <li>Other than that the lashes are usable and fairly easy to put on.</li>
            <li>so theyre kind of hard to put on.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to work with for beginners.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve done a trial and they can definitely look beautiful, you just have to trim them to fit your eyes better and maybe thin it out if it&#x27;s too dramatic.</li>
            <li>I love these eyelashes hands down!</li>
            <li>i love for day to day wear but the other ones!!</li>
            <li>Very great price and the shipping time wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li>Not the best quality of lashes, but they definetly don&#x27;t look bad.</li>
            <li>I expected them to be cheap at the price I paid.</li>
            <li>I got these to practice wearing fake eyelashes and was a great idea.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these for my grand-daughter, who is 16 years old and had hinted that she wanted them,  and she really loves them.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re still comfortable, so I have no real complaints about the product.</li>
            <li>When I wear them they look natural and everyone believes they&#x27;re my real eyelashes.</li>
            <li>The lashes are very plastic feeling and melt when you get near anything hotter then summer temps.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really tell but if you curl them and put mascara they look so natural.</li>
            <li>But instead of getting the two styles (I really just wanted the natural looking ones, but I couldn&#x27;t just order one,)</li>
            <li>they look cheap and some of them were crushed because they were delivered in a envelope.</li>
            <li>I really like the natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li>It fit exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li>Not what i expected.. too cheap .. save your money..</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with how fast they came in the mail (within a couple of days) and</li>
            <li>These are not thick.</li>
            <li>Sorry they didn&#x27;t work so great</li>
            <li>it looks so fake lol.</li>
            <li>And they last for a long time:)</li>
            <li>Love them and they are not at all heavy.</li>
            <li>but i like adding that full look to my long lashes.</li>
            <li>I love that I get everyday and going out lashes and for the price</li>
            <li>I love the heavy lashes.</li>
            <li>well worth it, especially since she loves wearing them.</li>
            <li>I like how long and full they are and it the eyelashes are ever \\&quot;too much\\&quot;, just cut them in halfs or thirds</li>
            <li>Well worth the money since overall</li>
            <li>The heavy ones, don&#x27;t bend well and pops off more frenquently.  </li>
            <li>Ive worn these a few times and I love them.</li>
            <li>Im gonna purchase a few more boxes..</li>
            <li>Because some of these ladies are getting the ghetto fab, vs appropriate heavy.</li>
            <li>yes they are not perfect but for the money i paid for them there pretty good i will buy from them</li>
            <li>The only con I have found to these lashes is that the band is kind of thick and doesn&#x27;t really like to bend as well as the higher priced lashes on the market.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>definitely they are a good quality for the small fee.  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t able to wear for everyday lashes</li>
            <li>Only to have fun in one time use</li>
            <li>They do take a while to come in, so I normally order in advance before my others are too used.</li>
            <li>and I am not a person that normally wears eyelashes</li>
            <li>Will last a long time, am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>They are long and full.</li>
            <li>The ends do tend to lift after a few hours with the first couple wears and cheap glue.</li>
            <li>I love the regular long lashes.</li>
            <li>I think of these of more as a clubbing/party lashes than everyday use lashes.</li>
            <li>They were way over the top nothing that you can wear everyday.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s normal but they don&#x27;t hold well with the lash glue(not included).</li>
            <li>Extra long and form fitting</li>
            <li>Not for everyday use, better for costumes.</li>
            <li>The day look is equivalent to my normal lashes...</li>
            <li>Just spend a few more dollars and go to the drug store.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this item if your a big fan of long lashes greatly satisfied</li>
            <li>and I can totally recommend it to my friends but the packaging was not so good they came back wet</li>
            <li>They do the job when I can&#x27;t make it to the beauty supply store to purchase my normal brand lashes.</li>
            <li>The lighter ones can be for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;Please expect lashes to be delivered in more than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>The thinner onea didn&#x27;t look normal.</li>
            <li>Mine came up on the sides after a few hours &amp; I had to add more glue.</li>
            <li>These are great false lashes.. for the price (and in general).</li>
            <li>I will be buying a few more sets of these.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of cheap lashes and thus buying only from sephora, but I must say I was amazed at how good these are.</li>
            <li>The darker, thicker ones are pretty much of no use to me, unless I cut them in have and use the halves on the outer corner of my lashes for extra fullness.</li>
            <li>Thin lashes were good not thick</li>
            <li>i guess, I&#x27;ll use them for more everyday style than anything.</li>
            <li>honestly i just got them but my first time trying a pair on not too long ago, they had trouble sticking</li>
            <li>it is nice , and i like it ,,,....,,,beutiful , ,,,,,,......,,, and it&#x27; thick</li>
            <li>/&gt;You have to know how to apply false lashes to make them look good.</li>
            <li>Everyone complaining about these are right they are a little stiff, to help that you need to flex them first (grab them by both ends and kind of keep bending/rolling them side to side to stretch them)</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, wear them all the time, great for decorating with glitter or rhinestones, the only downside it the lashes are a little stiff and stick together</li>
            <li>if you dont clip the edges right they may poke into youe eye skin but its all good there a little but to like stiff</li>
            <li>More than half of them bent from shipping to the point you can&#x27;t use them!</li>
            <li>(This is not hard to do.</li>
            <li>Took a very long time to ship, overall satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that they are super synthetic so they don&#x27;t look as natural</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Make sure while you&#x27;re waiting the 15 seconds for the adhesive to dry, grab the lashes by both ends &amp; wiggle them back &amp; forth into a U-shape.</li>
            <li>it looks just as good as any other expensive lashes :)</li>
            <li>BOTH ITEMS CAME TO THE RIGHT EYE ONLY!!!</li>
            <li>I wish it was a lil more stiff</li>
            <li>Eyelashes were for right eye only .</li>
            <li>So if you don&#x27;t put the inner corner of the lashes on right, it&#x27;s going to bother you a lot.</li>
            <li>I completely love the look, the band is stiff  </li>
            <li>They were very stiff and wouldn&#x27;t bend with my eye shape very easily.</li>
            <li>All in all, I would buy this again considering how cheap they are but be more likely to only purchase the regular long lashes.</li>
            <li>but they took a long time to arrive other than that they were nice</li>
            <li>If you are looking for long and bold lashes i would get these.</li>
            <li>They are okay if you want something cheap in money and quality, but I would not recommend them for serious or daily use.</li>
            <li>but i thought to my self, well $5 isnt much to loose, specially when one pair of eyelashes cost about $4.</li>
            <li>Product came earlier than expected but very cheap material.</li>
            <li>I use the thinner lashes when I&#x27;m looking for a more natural look but the thick ones looks pretty normal for me.</li>
            <li>They look good, my only complaint is that when they were packed, the send put the two boxes ontop of each other crushing a few of the top lashes and making them deformed.</li>
            <li>Overall, pretty worth it for the low cost and for needing them for photoshoots for clients!</li>
            <li>Took longer than expected but so worth the wait!</li>
            <li>I wish the thicker ones were a little more natural looking, also</li>
            <li>I thought they would look a little more natural but not.</li>
            <li>I use false lashes a lot and these are pretty good especially for they&#x27;re price.</li>
            <li>Just ordered a new set.</li>
            <li>going to find a new glue to try out.</li>
            <li>and I live in the U.S.,</li>
            <li>Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new..</li>
            <li>I like them just need to buy new glue</li>
            <li>I live in chicago soo</li>
            <li>So I bought the eyelashes to try something new</li>
            <li>These eyelashes are a lil hard to put on since it is more straight than angled to match your eye</li>
            <li>they are super long and awsome!</li>
            <li>The weft is really soft and pliable so it takes a steady hand to apply them.</li>
            <li>It cames much more earlier that I expected and becouse of this</li>
            <li>Arrived a lot earlier than expected &amp; in love with these lashes.</li>
            <li>i got the same thing for both... -.- not even worth the time to return it; I wanted the natural ones too, but never happened</li>
            <li>However, everything was okay, none of the lashes were damaged, though, they were flattened, so it made it harder to glue them on without extensive bending.</li>
            <li>I got these earlier than I expected, I love them😄</li>
            <li>the thick ones were just too much on m face the thinner ones were okay</li>
            <li>I waited for 6 weeks for these and when they finally arrived they couldn&#x27;t curve to fit properly on my lash and the edges of each lash</li>
            <li>They look kind of ridiculous if you don&#x27;t cut them.</li>
            <li>They were such a low price I was expecting a cheap product</li>
            <li>The lashes are so soft and realistic.</li>
            <li>With careful care i was able to reuse lashes a 2nd time .I</li>
            <li>These are just the most cheap, uncomfortable, unnatural lashes ever.  </li>
            <li>Seriously I do not have sensitive skin or eyes</li>
            <li>I love false eye lashes, so it was convent to buy a set of 40 natural and bold lashes.  </li>
            <li>The thicker ones are a bit hard to put on, but with a little bit of work, they look good for a night out!</li>
            <li>You can trim them down, and they work just fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;#2 is VERY natural looking.</li>
            <li>I donated to my old high school.</li>
            <li>but they look very natural.  </li>
            <li>Style 2 is very natural looking</li>
            <li>Looks very NATURAL .Its</li>
            <li>Very natural looking...</li>
            <li>they are very natural looking</li>
            <li>The thick lashes were very soft and pretty, and the thin ones were more separate, but still nice.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a natural look but lengthy lashes, this is a pretty good buy just for the ten thin lashes.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m super glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly small eyes and the lashes are very long (across the eye)</li>
            <li>Great one-use eyelashes for dramatic effect, use with glue and they stay on all day!</li>
            <li>Great for dramatic length!</li>
            <li>They came a little late but the price is good so no worries!</li>
            <li>These lashes seem of pretty decent quality, especially for the price which is vital for me being a makeup artist.</li>
            <li>They are big enough for anyone that I know and have done their makeup, they are good to take down to size, I just went to walmart and got some clear adhesive.</li>
            <li>The price was right for this product but, not for me in the near future</li>
            <li>LOVE the thin style; they gave me just the right &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The rubbery texture does make it a little harder to mold to the shape of the eye but overall great deal.</li>
            <li>these lashes they are easy to apply they last long and they can be reused.if you take care of them..</li>
            <li>I attempted to use 6 pairs overall (3 natural, 3 full) and never really got them to look right.</li>
            <li>Overall, they are very nice false eyelashes.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!</li>
            <li>Just make sure they are completely dried and affixed before heading out!</li>
            <li>They look exactly the same as in the picture.</li>
            <li>They arrived early!</li>
            <li>Cut to perfection as they are professional that they need to be trimmed to perfection!</li>
            <li>For this small price, I get to have many looks to choose from when getting dolled up.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Even for how cheap these were, I&#x27;d rather spend the extra money next time and not waste my time.</li>
            <li>I usually wear more than one pair of eyelashes</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and they were only willing to send a repeat order.</li>
            <li>first it only took about 1 week</li>
            <li>I am disappointed because every review that said this was a great product is a LIE!</li>
            <li>Just got them today &amp; they came almost two weeks early!</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>Pretty standard quality for falsies.</li>
            <li>Wow !</li>
            <li>These are so cheap and not worth a penny.</li>
            <li>Everything was really wonderful except that I have no clue how I am going to manage getting them on, cutting them to size and gluing them by myself!</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I am a pretty simple gal.</li>
            <li>They are thin, flimsy , and look very cheap!</li>
            <li>I ordered these for my 18 year old granddaughter and she loves them!</li>
            <li>I love the natural lashes but the thick ones....not so much.</li>
            <li>They may be good for Halloween but other than that they are a waste.</li>
            <li>really easy to use just have to cut ends a little bit</li>
            <li>Murray for very natural or very dramatic looks, I find the quality to be great for the price.</li>
            <li>I bought these and honestly every one said the dramatic was to much</li>
            <li>These are extremely cheap and when I recieved them the box was all bent up with the eyelashes everywhere (NOT HELD DOWN).</li>
            <li>When I cut them down to fit</li>
            <li>so you have to cut them down to fit your eye</li>
            <li>Very soft and they look strong got them in a few hours ago.</li>
            <li>style 1 lashes looked to thick and fake to me but style 2 looks way more natural and looks great</li>
            <li>At first they were hard to put on because they are not pre-curved to fit your eyelid.</li>
            <li>I believe that all the negative comments come from girls who do not know how to apply lashes, first of all your suppose to trim them down to fit your liner line, then after the lashes feel comfortable</li>
            <li>I have worn them a few times already and haven&#x27;t experienced the same issues as other lashes</li>
            <li>was the actual quality would be at such a low price, but I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>These are great for if you want a dramatic look one day, and then natural the next.</li>
            <li>I also like that they are long enough (width from end to end) which will enable me to cut them to fit the width of my eyelids.</li>
            <li>Reusable and long lasting and so cheap</li>
            <li>Pretty cheap synthetic with a thick strip.</li>
            <li>and you can trim then and apply in small portions to give a more natural look.</li>
            <li>but I think I am good enough too figure out that these are not good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how to insert pics for the review...but the regular lashes look pretty natural...</li>
            <li>I had to wait nearly a month for these lashes, and after reading all the other reviews I was so excited to get them.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t do a higher rating was because they are sent in a water proof bag and soft boxes.</li>
            <li>I am used to buying individual specialy lashes so these were alot different but not bad.</li>
            <li>They are plush, soft and very natural looking.</li>
            <li>They are beautiful on, but the &amp;#34;lash line&amp;#34; is very thick when put on, making them seem more fake, than you want them to be.</li>
            <li>In the past, other companies lashes weren&#x27;t long enough, but these are perfect.</li>
            <li>Came sooner then what I thought everything was fine the boxes where a little bent but</li>
            <li>I received my lashes on the very first expected delivery date</li>
            <li>there pretty but style 1 looks really shiny and does make it look even more fake.</li>
            <li>I had a little problem with the sipping at first but the company fixed it right up</li>
            <li>The came a week and a half early which is good, but my package was a little bent up.</li>
            <li>I have only worn the thinner lashes so far and will most likely save the thicker/fuller lashes for a night out as they are more dramatic.</li>
            <li>out of place soft ,black, wispy light.</li>
            <li>Only able to use half of them.</li>
            <li>They only lasted about half the day but thats what to expect for cheap eyelashes!</li>
            <li>I used eyelash glue, glued them on, held it and waited for it to dry, and then they would just pop right off.</li>
            <li>The natural looking ones do look very natural on my eyes and the thick ones are great for a little drama.</li>
            <li>These eyelashes are simple and easy to use, They are plastic feeling then the more expensive brands so you will have to bend them and work with them a bit before you apply them</li>
            <li>These lashes are as they are described in that they are not stiff or having a plastic appearance.</li>
            <li>&quot; it (so that it&#x27;s not stiff) before applying it.</li>
            <li>You may have to cut the ends a little to get them to fit with your eyelids.</li>
            <li>The casing is a little cheap</li>
            <li>Just a little cheap.</li>
            <li>Had to cut a little to fit but</li>
            <li>/&gt;Given that I&#x27;ve spent more on a single pair, I think it&#x27;s worth it even if one set might need to be handed to someone who is performing a drag show.  </li>
            <li>Great deal, the long ones are so dramatic.</li>
            <li>The first style looks dramatic, but it looks lovely on the eye.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I expected, and for the price, it is of decent quality.</li>
            <li>I like to wear the normal ones but the dramatic ones are nice to depending on the occasion.</li>
            <li>Was really excited to see that twenty pairs of eyelashes would cost me less than five dollars.</li>
            <li>Was really excited to get these and after waiting 2 weeks for them to arrive, half of them were not in the box.</li>
            <li>ur nail and run it along the connection hard part to curve n make them stick better if needed) and trim ends evenly to avoid scratching</li>
            <li>They were hard to put on and didn&#x27;t stay for more than 5 minutes</li>
            <li>I have used all of the other lashes except the bold ones.</li>
            <li>The eyelashes when received in the mail were a little crushed because they were in an envelope, if you&#x27;re looking for more real textured eyelashes</li>
            <li>Other than the fact that these did NOT come with any glue or some kind of adhesive, and some of the eyelashes were messed up (and hidden).</li>
            <li>At first I was a little upset due to the fact that due to the packaging some were squished but overall they are great.</li>
            <li>Only bad thing was took awhile to get but still great buy for the price!</li>
            <li>but they look extra fake, but when u put em on they look great</li>
            <li>i bought the clear lash glue seperately and</li>
            <li>They are adorable but the fit is awkward</li>
            <li>When they find out that they are false eyelashes they are in complete shock, they say that they are amazing.</li>
            <li>First off they are way too long in length and in width.</li>
            <li>My 10 natural lashes were all ripped up and cut up.</li>
            <li>how natural they look</li>
            <li>I also wouldn&#x27;t suggest these lashes to a beginner as I was, however they did make it a lot easier to use natural eye lashes.</li>
            <li>the eye lashes are set up to give you the natural curves of your eye..</li>
            <li>My young daughter could not believe what I paid for 20 pairs.</li>
            <li>I really like this lashes because I can cut them to my size and wear only once and then dispose</li>
            <li>I received these 2 weeks early.</li>
            <li>Received the lashes early.</li>
            <li>I love my lashes I&#x27;ve been using them a lot lately</li>
            <li>Only downside is they come mostly straight</li>
            <li>One downfall style 1, not everyday glam lashes...</li>
            <li>If you are wanting natural these are not for you.</li>
            <li>I would use only for photo shoots (look real dragqueenish)</li>
            <li>Ordered lashes on 10/1/13, received it on 10/23/13; nearly 1 month.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s something that can be fixed .Over</li>
            <li>Wow what can I say?</li>
            <li>These lashes do not look natural.</li>
            <li>I will buy the natural oned again tho.</li>
            <li>Not as natural as I would prefer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s waaaaaay to &amp;#34;theatrical&amp;#34; if you&#x27;re looking for a natural apperance.</li>
            <li>Only received 10, the lashes were too straight</li>
            <li>Arrived early .</li>
            <li>Cost to much to send them back so threw them in the trash.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They went directly into the garbage.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look natural at all.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for natural looking lashes then these are not what you want.  </li>
            <li>but the natural ones I wore all day</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the quality and sturdiness of the lashes.</li>
            <li>and I am a professional make-up artist.</li>
            <li>if you are sensitive these might cause some problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>NATURAL.</li>
            <li>i dont like the bigger ones you can really tell thay</li>
            <li>The only con would be the hair isn&#x27;t real</li>
            <li>they lookd so natural</li>
            <li>Be advised you may damage your natural eyelashes if you ARE NOT A PRO.</li>
            <li>the lashes 2 had to different styles very lite  </li>
            <li>TIP before applying the lashes bend them in a natural curve for about 30 seconds with glue on, this should help it become easier when applying .</li>
            <li>They are packaged efficiently and secure enough for me, nothing fancy, but basic enough for protecting the shape.</li>
            <li>The natural ones ARE just that...not too noticable.</li>
            <li>early than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>your looking for a natural look, they aren&#x27;t natural looking.</li>
            <li>they dont look as natural as i&#x27;d like</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m all for natural looking lashes</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look natural at all but for $2 I shouldve known.</li>
            <li>They make me feel classy when I have them on.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a price.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect them to be completely unusable.</li>
            <li>The eyelashes don&#x27;t look natural like you would want them to look.</li>
            <li>I like so much with low price</li>
            <li>near the amount you get here.</li>
            <li>:) i got them so late though.</li>
            <li>I like how they look natural</li>
            <li>so I cut mine to where they looked natural.</li>
            <li>These are plastic and not fiber material.did not have a natural look to them at all.</li>
            <li>so I just use the natural ones.</li>
            <li>As I don&#x27;t really know how to apply these eyelashes without the proper tools, I must say that I must wait to utilize them</li>
            <li>I am very picky when it comes to eyelashes, I decided to try these because of the low price,</li>
            <li>They look natural and for the price...perfect.  </li>
            <li>Utter garbage don&#x27;t look real.</li>
            <li>The picture and the product don&#x27;t match the eyelashes look like the ones children get from a 99 cent store or like a old rusty baby doll .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Even when I go natural with just the lashes, I still get tons of compliments.</li>
            <li>They do not look natural at all .</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money or time.</li>
            <li>AND CHEAP I WASTED MY TIME AND MONEY&lt;</li>
            <li>and I am far from professional at getting them on,</li>
            <li>My selections arrived early and look just like the pictures I chose from.</li>
            <li>At first i thought it was strange because the part that you put glue on is made out of thread</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>wore these once so far, and had no issue.</li>
            <li>Very efficient considering the handling time plus the time to ship internationally.</li>
            <li>These lashes are so soft.</li>
            <li>So far I havn&#x27;t tried then on</li>
            <li>but they feel like natural lashes.</li>
            <li>Natural....</li>
            <li>The thinner ones look so natural</li>
            <li>all i can say is WOW.</li>
            <li>I like the natural looking ones but</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a natural is she or isn&#x27;t she wearing them</li>
            <li>so it blends in with your natural lashes.</li>
            <li>Looks natural.</li>
            <li>These are by far the hardest lashes to put on in my experience.</li>
            <li>I personally like the much fuller lashes, Style 1</li>
            <li>It actually shipped fast too.</li>
            <li>but once I got these I tried to put them on to see how natural they may look but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had issues putting on lashes but these were the easiest by far.</li>
            <li>I only really had 2</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time or your money.</li>
            <li>The inner corners were coming off and after 10-15 minutes they started to stand out straight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These lashes are so soft when you brush your fingertip over them.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>iveonly worn one pair so far, of the thicker ones</li>
            <li>nearly 24/7</li>
            <li>THAT MAKES THEM COMPLETELY UNWEARABLE.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t a natural shape.</li>
            <li>They are very durable,  you can wear them several times.</li>
            <li>Not everyday ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to the &amp;#34;Handmade Natural soft falsies&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>but I was very pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li>(which you should be doing these things anyhow to prevent damage/trauma to natural lash)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not heavy like the ones I&#x27;ve bought from stores.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money..</li>
            <li>rather of got 20 pair of the natural ones then have 10 that I am going to throw away.</li>
            <li>cheap, dont waste your money.</li>
            <li>They seem to want to spring back into an almost straight line.</li>
            <li>I was surprised on how well the lashes hold and look.</li>
            <li>I got two pair of them you can put 10 pairs handmade natural soft eyelashes</li>
            <li>Not for any type of natural look.</li>
            <li>LOOK NATURAL</li>
            <li>These are so cheap, and a waste of your money.</li>
            <li>It should have been sold with a glue to complete the package.</li>
            <li>Do Not Waste Your Money......</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t natural at all.</li>
            <li>cause even though it&#x27;s cheap, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li>These are cheap and the same material as the more expensive Ardell lashes.</li>
            <li>One set of the lashes have a very unattractive white band.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend them to people who frequently use lashes.</li>
            <li>I wear these on an almost daily basis since these are so much easier to apply rather than layering on coats of mascara.</li>
            <li>The 20 pair of the natural lashes have lasted me for months when I use them as demi lashes.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for a professional finished look</li>
            <li>You have to shape them with your finger for a few seconds before and cut them so they fit your eyes.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how natural the thicker lashes looked.</li>
            <li>I was surprised and when I saw them I was even happier.</li>
            <li>They didnt look natural at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used one pair of each so far in the two weeks</li>
            <li>the natural lashe&#x27;s look really natural</li>
            <li>Fast shipping for international.</li>
            <li>Spend a few more dollars and buy red cherry or ardell.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been able to reuse the same pair a few times.</li>
            <li>Thick ones for night and lighter more natural ones for day.</li>
            <li>The thick ones are ok.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves &#x27;em, but isn&#x27;t sure about the thick set I have.</li>
            <li>It would have been better if you could order just the thinner ones and not the thick ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the thinner ones I use for a neutral look and my thick ones I use for a more night out</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves &#x27;em, but isn&#x27;t sure about the thick set I have.</li>
            <li>It is a good product for someone who likes obviously fake lashes.</li>
            <li>The thick ones were cute</li>
            <li>these eyelashes are just as good as the expensive ones.</li>
            <li>i think if your good at putting them on then they shouldn&#x27;t look that fake..</li>
            <li>Love the thick lashes they really complete the look.</li>
            <li>The thick ones are perfect for parties and clubbing nights, but the thin ones arent my favorites because thery</li>
            <li>You actually get 20 pair of eyelashes, thick and natural with a nice arch.</li>
            <li>The thick set looks more like eye brows.</li>
            <li>I love that they came in 20 pairs and varies from natural to thick.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall they are a good quality fake eyelash.</li>
            <li>I thought they would have been okay with the thick bands</li>
            <li>The thick would look pretty cool during Halloween???</li>
            <li>Some girls want the thick looking ones and others like the more natural look</li>
            <li>If i was into false lashes i may have liked them.</li>
            <li>A little bit long but just cut the edges and cut them in half when applying to make sure you get them on your lash line accurately.</li>
            <li>not very particular about the shape on thicker lashes..but price very reasonable...</li>
            <li>Usually other lashes get gross after I wear them once, but these are fine.</li>
            <li>so I was actually able to cut each individual lash in half and use it as a pair, therefore doubling the use on each set!</li>
            <li>I am giving it three stars only because they were cheap, but I found them completely useless due to the corners not being flexible and not sticking, making it seam as your eyelashes are about to fly off your face.&lt;br /&gt;For a one time party use, will definitely do.</li>
            <li>The thing that make these lashes just ok, is the fact that it&#x27;s just too stiff and not flexible enough when you want  to apply it to your eyes.</li>
            <li>I thought it would come the same time as my other orders but came a week later over all I love the lashes</li>
            <li>I mean the lashes were cute and all.</li>
            <li>it makes the eye just pop out more than usual... ouuuuuuu and try using it for your bottom lashes too!</li>
            <li>I mean its okay for the price that I purchase it</li>
            <li>To me, it looks very thin and quite short, but it is great for bottom lashes or layering!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re stiff and seem to be made of cheap plastic, like something you&#x27;d get out of a gumball machine.</li>
            <li>they add such a powerful look to the eyes (can be dramatic or innocent)</li>
            <li>I liked them for just everyday use and use my other lashes for another time.</li>
            <li>The pairs that are less full look and feel like plastic</li>
            <li>The lashes are fairly flexible and for the price you absolutely CANNOT GO WRONG!</li>
            <li>The package was pretty much smashed up a little.</li>
            <li>I normally wear mascara over my fake eyelashes to make them blend better with my real ones...</li>
            <li>Love the lashes , they&#x27;re a little to long for me .</li>
            <li>I have worn lashes with a higher quality and I have worn expensive individual lashes that have taken my own lashes out.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is totally worth the buy, but if you can&#x27;t wait I would suggest getting some at the store while you wait for these.</li>
            <li>so I always cut a little from both sides of the lash strip to make them the right size!</li>
            <li>The darker ones right now seem to dramatic for me but who knows in time and still you cant even beat the price ( I paid 3.50 with free shipping) for 10 pair, even if I end up not using the darker ones all of the time.</li>
            <li>but they work splendidly, the thicker ones look a bit fake more fake</li>
            <li>Though I usually don&#x27;t wear eyelashes and am quite inexperienced with them, these were pretty easy to apply.</li>
            <li>These were not worth the money, they are cheap and obvious.  </li>
            <li>if you are looking for realistic, spend the extra money.</li>
            <li>I was not happy about the purchase at first glance they look stringy and cheap looking</li>
            <li>Overall though they are decent quality lashes for the price.</li>
            <li>They apply easier than the human remy brand I usually use they&#x27;re definitely a better brand of synthetic fibers.</li>
            <li>, however I had to go personally pick it up from the post office because it had to be signed for.&lt;br /&gt;Overall decent product.</li>
            <li>cheaply made too plastic-y feeling dont look natural not really satisfied with this purchase at all. . . . . .</li>
            <li>they actually look decent.</li>
            <li>You can trim all but a few hairs off the ends and create your own single lashes from the entire band.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They were sealed nice and tight, the boxes inside were fragile so they were a little rough, but none of the eyelashes were harmed, and a little rough is great</li>
            <li>Other than that it arrived right when it said it would.</li>
            <li>20 pairs for about a buck fifty when in the store it can be as high as 10 dollars for one pair, Yes, they are plastic but that just means you can reuse them, there&#x27;s enough pairs to wear as is, or you can experiment with them and make demi lashes or can cut them shorter.</li>
            <li>They are high quality and last me</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to anyone, don&#x27;t get pulled in by the low price and high quantity &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
            <li>Product was worth the purchase price and the quality was good enough, although I was not impressed when I received in the mailbox crushed.  </li>
            <li>I can cut them to fit properly and they last a very long time!</li>
            <li>Just have to cut a very little off to fit.</li>
            <li>Only received HALF of my order,  and these eyelashes are for someone with huge eyes.</li>
            <li>They were easy to apply but I did have to do some cutting to make them fit.</li>
            <li>The skinnies work really well for me as bottom lashes after a quick trim over thick liner.</li>
            <li>The packaging was cheap, and although this purchase was very inexpensive, I had to toss half due to damage.</li>
            <li>I love both sets, natural and thick, natural for every day use and the thick for a night out or a special event.</li>
            <li>When my order finally arrived, my sis took a quick look at them and said they look so cheap, fakeish and dramatic.</li>
            <li>I know they are a cheap price but definitely a waste of money!</li>
            <li>WHEN YOU GET READY TO PUT THEM ON YOU WILL HAVE TO CUT BOTH SIDES OF THE LASHES, BECAUSE THERE ARE LONG STRINGS ON THE SIDE.</li>
            <li>They are like plastic, freakishly long and way too much space in between each lash.</li>
            <li>They barely bend around the natural shape of the eye before the ends pop out again.  </li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t load them with too much mascara each</li>
            <li>The eye lashes are not natural or real looking at all.</li>
            <li>the lashes are way too long, very unatural looking</li>
            <li>you still need to cut a small section at the end in order to fit with your eyeline.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m prbly just gonna switch to using these from now on because they are soooo cheap and still do the job, if not better.</li>
            <li>My natural lashes are pretty long and similar in length to the style 2 set</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not really my style although the thicker ones looked pretty once they were on</li>
            <li>They arrived early and they are really cheaply made but considering your only paying a few dollars</li>
            <li>I normally buy from a retail store and they are S10.00 for 10 pairs of lashes , here they are WAY cheaper plus you get double!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>but I wore them for stage and not for normal daily wear.  </li>
            <li>arrived way before expected looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>So I bought these on recommendation and was pretty nervous about it at first since I don&#x27;t have too much lash experience other than a few dollarstore pairs as a test</li>
            <li>the only problem that I had is that it took so long to send, I&#x27;m very impatient person, but again it&#x27;s 2 dollars, highly recommend them, easy to put on if you have put eyelashes before, I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>They were full and thick plus looked realistic, but i wish they would&#x27;ve come with eyelash glue.</li>
            <li>The natural type is thin, but long and the backbone of the lash isnt hard but molds to your eye perfectly.</li>
            <li>Personally, on the set of lashes that are less full, I have gotten nothing but compliments from friends on how NATURAL they look.</li>
            <li>I can alter these to fit my eyes, but they lay flat, and it&#x27;s hard to get them to stay put because they aren&#x27;t very flexible.</li>
            <li>It is fun and different feeling, especially with the darker shade ones; they feel really heavy on my eyes, it was my first time.</li>
            <li>These are my emergency lashes now, in the event I dont have time to buy new ones or have time to apply the individual lashes.</li>
            <li>would have put 5 stars but the only reason why i didnt is because they took about almost 3 weeks to get to where i live</li>
            <li>/&gt; If you remove them VERY carefully and remove any mascara with a mild oil or make up remover, you will get several uses out of them.  </li>
            <li>I use them as demi lashes on the corners of my eyes, so I&#x27;ll cut the bands in half (or even 1/3 of the length of the band, for a more natural look) and use each half for each eye.</li>
            <li>Instead of using one lash for each eye, I also found it useful to cut each lash itself in half to use as demi lashes.</li>
            <li>Came pretty fast considering where it came from usually</li>
            <li>Thinner lashes look almost spiky and are very short, I personally like but someone else may not (look like real lashes loaded with mascara).</li>
            <li>a few of them are smashed and they can not be used, but for this price more than I was expected.</li>
            <li>I am pretty much not satisfied of this product ｡･ﾟ･(ﾉД&#x60;)･ﾟ･｡</li>
            <li>They are actually quite soft and do not irritate the eyes the hairs are soft and give the eye the \\&quot;gyaru\\&quot; look or dolly eyes .</li>
            <li>They are pretty long so you may need to adjust them if you have smaller eyes.</li>
            <li>:) they dont look fake but they dont look real</li>
            <li>As for Style 2 they are also dramatically long and not as full you also have to be careful on how you trim them, if you do.</li>
            <li>I am gonna have to admit they do when I took a glance at them too, but when I tried them on they look so natural they totally blended with my natural lashes.</li>
            <li>The only thing is they are straight to begin with, not curved to your eye like store bought lashes, which is no biggie, they still go on the same.</li>
            <li>when I got these in the mail, I thought they would be more fluttery than they actually were, and the band on the fuller ones was really thick.</li>
            <li>and i love the way it compliments me although the band is really thing and can be difficult to put on it</li>
            <li>Slow shipping though,but other then that I love it !</li>
            <li>Just as good as the expensive ones I got from Sephora for $15.&lt;br /&gt;I would totally get these if:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not expect any false eyelash to be able to look natural at this price but they do.</li>
            <li>I even tried trimming them down but it didn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li>The thick ones are kind of hard to master at first</li>
            <li>These lashes came in two small cheap boxes they were all smashed up the bands are huge and thick even the hair feels plastic. .</li>
            <li>The other eyelashes look exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>Always stick the middle to your eye FIRST, then the back, &amp; then the inner tear</li>
            <li>was a little smooshed but other than that the eyelashes are okay for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>Unless you glue them to the middle of your lid or natural lash!  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with the thick ones!</li>
            <li>I love the thick eyelashes !</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the thick ones!</li>
            <li>These are more stiff than lashes I&#x27;ve tried before &amp; therefore harder to put on, as well as stay on.</li>
            <li>These look very fake, but that&#x27;s what you get for buying super cheap eyelashes!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to buy them in the beauty supply store because these are very hard .</li>
            <li>i enjoy the two different options for a more or less dramatic effect.</li>
            <li>very cheap poor quality.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look real at all, complete plastic and thick, better for cosplay or costume instead of everyday life.</li>
            <li>They are very basic as far as style goes, and cheap much along the line of thin shredded plastic.</li>
            <li>Love them I actually like the thick ones better than the thin ones but gave them to a co worker and she loves them ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to trimmed them down a little, but other than that they are good for about two uses each.</li>
            <li>but i was able to wear the thin ones on a daily basis and they looked natural!</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t even worth the little amount of money that I paid for them.</li>
            <li>They were pretty Good fake eyelashes, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that they were a little hard to shape other than that nice product..</li>
            <li>This is totally cute if you&#x27;re going for the &#x27;dramatic&#x27; or &#x27;natural look.&#x27;</li>
            <li>I have the choice for dramatic or more natural looking.  </li>
            <li>The thinner pair is more natural, while the thicker pair is dramatic and luxurious.</li>
            <li>They look really nice, big and dramatic for a night out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it takes a little while to get here, but for a little over a buck I&#x27;d strongly recommend buying these lashes!</li>
            <li>They are very pretty, just a bit stiff.</li>
            <li>neither but.way better than what i expected for so little money!</li>
            <li>they are a little long to fit my eyelids</li>
            <li>Cheap, flimsy, but I shouldve known that since I didn&#x27;t pay hardly anything for it.</li>
            <li>They make your eyes look cheap and they are hard to glue on.</li>
            <li>hard to cut the lashes to fit your size</li>
            <li>They look cheap, and have a hard time shaping correctly around the eyelid.</li>
            <li>I found these hard to put on because they come pretty straight</li>
            <li>They are plastic, and they are very long, you will have to cut them to fit your personal needs but other thab</li>
            <li>These lashes are cute, as natural as false lashes are, flexible, more for an everyday look with a little glam.</li>
            <li>only &#x27;con&#x27; is that it took a very long time to arrive, I live New York, but I was told it would take about 15-20 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thick lashes are very long and full-looking but still very light.</li>
            <li>Lol I knew it was going to be of bad quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They feel amazing, the lashes are firm but feel like they are made out of small slivers of satin not plastic.</li>
            <li>I have re-used the same ones for over a month just adding clear glue and pealing them off.</li>
            <li>The lashes are way too straight which makes applying harder.</li>
            <li>will be buying again in the near future!</li>
            <li>It came much sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase in the near future.</li>
            <li>Also, they&#x27;re not very curly which kind of defeats the purpose of fake lashes since they stick straight out</li>
            <li>i bought these thinking they were actually going to look natural.</li>
            <li>Wish the natural lashes were a bit longer but overall I like them.</li>
            <li>There are to kinds sent... tarantula and barely anything.</li>
            <li>Wow, for ladies who never have enough eyelashes!</li>
            <li>I know these eyelashes are UBER cheap, but I would definitely recommend spending the extra few dollars and just going to Walgreens or CVS or</li>
            <li>I got the lashes in the mail, the box was all crumbled and smashed, and slightly wet because it had been raining for a week straight.</li>
            <li>That also is fixed with the extra glue coats.</li>
            <li>so I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much</li>
            <li>have only used one pair so far, when i ordered them i was i</li>
            <li>So I only wear the sort of natural ones for length.</li>
            <li>i have not wore them them simply because they do not look natural</li>
            <li>I only used 1 pair so far.</li>
            <li>These were shipped much faster than I expected them to be to begin with.</li>
            <li>They look natural and I constantly get compliments.</li>
            <li>I wear the thin ones and my daughter wear the thick ones, we&#x27;re happy so far.</li>
            <li>I love my lashes, they are not too long or thick.</li>
            <li>Not terrible, but not great.</li>
            <li>These lashes are made of fairly thick plastic, it looks rather cheap.  </li>
            <li>I selected this brand of eyelashes, because I love thick and long eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I will never order these kind again unfortunately</li>
            <li>is so sad that being selling this kind of quality product...</li>
            <li>You know kind of fake because of the price....</li>
            <li>the thicker ones are much better the the thin ones cant see them</li>
            <li>I do like the thin lashes better.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t need fake eye lashes since my eye lashes are so long, and because of that I was worried the natural looking lashes weren&#x27;t going to make much of a difference, but they actually give it a nice hime-sama</li>
            <li>Not bad for .45 cents, but not the style I would usually wear.  </li>
            <li>I love these false eyelashes</li>
            <li>Just to see if they like to have false lashes on before I put the better ones on them.</li>
            <li>I just love false eyelashes...</li>
            <li>At first i was nervous on getting them due to all the negative reviews but they are fine , totally recommend them.</li>
            <li>All I recommend is that you bend them up back and forth with your fingertips a little before application because they can be a little stiff, other than that they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
            <li>has a plasticy feel at first but with extended wear the shine goes down and the shape relaxes to your eye.</li>
            <li>This lashes are synthetic, and if you are not used too falsies, this product (especially the thick lashes) are INTENSE, BOLD, TOTALLY GLAMOUROUS, but can over whelm some people.</li>
            <li>The less thick and dressy looked natural, and the big black were great for costumes or dressing up.  </li>
            <li>The thick ones are a bit too dramatic, the small ones are great as long as you curl them with a pencil and trim them appropriately.</li>
            <li>They wear comfortably and as long as you put the glue on the lash band correctly and place them well, they&#x27;ll wear just as well and just as long as any other brand of lashes.</li>
            <li>I mean it costs cheap.</li>
            <li>cause they are just too dramatic for me, the normal ones are ok but kinda too long</li>
            <li>First off I received my eyelashes in less than two weeks.</li>
            <li>but Im close to the warehouse and usually get every thing quick.</li>
            <li>Okay so I love to have really dramatic false lashes</li>
            <li>This product took a very long time to get to me and the packaging was a little damaged but the actual product is fine and was what was needed.</li>
            <li>So anybody thinking about not buying these because of reading bad reviews, DON&amp;#34;T LISTEN, give them a try, you&#x27;ll love them!!</li>
            <li>I didnt like the lashes because they dont bend like the other brands and the hair felt very &amp;#34;plasticy&amp;#34; i never got to wear them</li>
            <li>Her clothes are her own personality and her makeup is a little too edgy for some people.</li>
            <li>The naturals give my own lashes just a little boost, and the thick ones give my eyes a va-va-voom needed for nights out on the town and costuming.</li>
            <li>The naturals give my own lashes just a little boost, and the thick ones give my eyes a va-va-voom needed for nights out on the town and costuming.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like these, they aren&#x27;t like real eyelashes, they are hard plastic pieces.</li>
            <li>For like $2 I get 20 pairs of natural AND thick lashes, and they are just as good if not better than store bought $6 single pair lashes.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic and you  get ten sets of day lashes and ten sets of night lashes all for less than $5.00!!  </li>
            <li>These are beautiful and I have used them and get complicated on them!!</li>
            <li>but they work and don&#x27;t look bad specially great for ppl that is starting</li>
            <li>They were Huge in length and looked extremely ridiculous.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m waiting for mine can&#x27;t wait , love dramatic lashes , and I&#x27;ll wear my natrual ones w. Mascara</li>
            <li>Im in love with the dramatic lashes</li>
            <li>i always glued 2 of the thinner lashes together for a more dramatic look..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more of a dramatic eyelashes fan</li>
            <li>style1 is a more dramatic look for night out etc.</li>
            <li>The thicker ones are definitely more dramatic you would need to cut them</li>
            <li>Enjoy those fake lashes they really bring me out</li>
            <li>The only two negatives that gave it a 4 instead of 5 is that the lashes didn&#x27;t have &#x27;&#x27;pairs&#x27;&#x27; that were the same length (easily fixed with mascara)</li>
            <li>Plastic not human hair as I expected, the don&#x27;t stick to eyelashes very well</li>
            <li>though the price is cheap do not buy these invest in some better ones I hate mine</li>
            <li>i thought these would look more natural looking judging from the picture, but i was wrong.</li>
            <li>The thick lashes are great but the thin ones are like synthetic.</li>
            <li>Their slightly better looking than natural looking fake lashes which is sometimes all I want.</li>
            <li>but they are actually almost like a plastic which was kind of weird.</li>
            <li>but they are actually almost like a plastic which was kind of weird.</li>
            <li>They look like they&#x27;d be super thick, but they actually look quite natural.</li>
            <li>I noticed they were a little stiff even with me bending them and wrapping them around a pencil but its ok.</li>
            <li>Not so pleased with how stiff they are!you need to apply a lot of glue in order for them to stick,and you have to wait a little longer for the glue to become tacky.</li>
            <li>The dramatic ones are very nice but the subtle ones are a bit too natural can barely tell there on</li>
            <li>But for evey day wear you can tell very easily they are fake</li>
            <li>they are long and heavy and the other is ok for an every day look</li>
            <li>They are made out of plastic not actual hair like most false lashes in the us...and they do not come lined with the little sticky strip of light adhesive that other eyelashes sometimes come with...</li>
            <li>Very dramatic and sexy!</li>
            <li>Disliked very much</li>
            <li>I love this because you have a natural long look or dramatic lashes.</li>
            <li>The thick ones were way too dramatic for me, maybe good for Halloween buy not on a normal day.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s so hard to apply the lashes because maybe it&#x27;s just cause I&#x27;m amature but not bad</li>
            <li>They were alright the small ones are great size, but the large ones are a little to dramatic for my taste.</li>
            <li>I had to apply eyeliner around them to make them look at least a little more natural.</li>
            <li>Good product besides the little white strip on the thin lashes</li>
            <li>Only giving it three stars because the more dramatic eyelashes don&#x27;t really stick on &amp; aren&#x27;t super dramatic when their on.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be disappointed if they aren&#x27;t what you like, they were a great deal at $2</li>
            <li>Not worth the $5 I paid haha.</li>
            <li>I like these so much cause they really last me a long time, they&#x27;re long for my eyes</li>
            <li>not so much the second for me but other than that it&#x27;s a five</li>
            <li>The thins lashes make your eyes look long and natural</li>
            <li>I naturally have long eye lashes and have never worn falsies before</li>
            <li>and I need some longer lashes for my first few cosplays.</li>
            <li>I used small scizzors to taper the thicker set and they looked fun for a night out.</li>
            <li>If you treat them with the same hands most woman Ive personally known, treat their false eye lashes with...</li>
            <li>Very fake looking but good for the price.</li>
            <li>She has had to cut a few down to size, but that is pretty much with any of them.</li>
            <li>They look nice online but are very hard to put on and a plastic, not worth</li>
            <li>Depending on how dramatic you want a look, the thick lashes would be great for a night out to go clubbing.</li>
            <li>They cut down to size very well.</li>
            <li>They look like horse lashes that grow straight down</li>
            <li>These were shipped exactly on time and the only issue I have with the shipping is that the boxes containing the lashes were stuffed into an envelope and arrived a little smushed (hence the subtraction of one star).</li>
            <li>These were shipped exactly on time and the only issue I have with the shipping is that the boxes containing the lashes were stuffed into an envelope and arrived a little smushed (hence the subtraction of one star).</li>
            <li>They seem a little big at first</li>
            <li>Shipping took a little long but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>I got these a little then what the seller said, but I actually like these lashes at first when it opened them</li>
            <li>Super hard to apply.</li>
            <li>Not to mention they&#x27;re not very long.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I had was that they could have been packaged a bit better, the boxes were crushed!</li>
            <li>These are too stiff, but they are pretty.</li>
            <li>they are pretty stiff.</li>
            <li>It came on time the Shipping was just right, was not sure when I got it</li>
            <li>Flimsy cheap and hard to put on!</li>
            <li>The thicker ones don&#x27;t last anywhere near as long as the thinner ones do.</li>
            <li>I was not pleased but jot worth sending back.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth the actual product.</li>
            <li>The thicker ones are more dramatic but the thinner ones look more fake.</li>
            <li>While they did take awhile to ship, I knew how long it would take when I ordered them and for the crazy good price</li>
            <li>style 1 is SUPER THICK</li>
            <li>I know this may sound dumb</li>
            <li>Style 2 was not long lashes they were very short.</li>
            <li>plus fo me they are jus not long enough like I want.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t like these if you&#x27;re used to lashes that feel natural and comfortable on your eyes, these ones are quite long and inflexible.</li>
            <li>They are not stuck to plastic like normal falsies that you get from Walmart, or other beauty departments.</li>
            <li>the thin eyelashes made my eyelashes long better thicker and longer especially for what I paid for them like 2.00 and some change!</li>
            <li>If your doing a fashion show or going to a event then get it, but a everyday look which i was looking for not good unless u cut it and make sure it blends with your natural eyelashes.</li>
            <li>The thick eyelashes  are perfect for going out and the thin ones you could wear everyday!</li>
            <li>Bad quality, super cheap.</li>
            <li>ok for the price, but not very easy to attach kinda thick plastic to eyelids</li>
            <li>But the band is definitely an..almost paper-y plastic that is not totally black (and not totally clear).</li>
            <li>the thick lashes i personally think they are to bold for me</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap and very hard to bend to the shape of your eyes.</li>
            <li>I love the thick full eyelashes , the only problem with these eye lashes is that they feel so fake</li>
            <li>The less dramatic ones are my favorite!</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s exactly how I expected it to be .</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re full and not as choppy looking as some other sets I have.</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t anything special; personally I would never wear them for anything serious or formal.</li>
            <li>The light ones for a regular natural day and the thick ones for a night out !!💁</li>
            <li>A little hard to get out, but the packaging was safe that it came in.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t have much to say but bad quality and very cheap.</li>
            <li>Not good for more than one use, unless you are very careful with them.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;natural\\&quot; pair were a little too much for me still.</li>
            <li>I just got two packs of thick ones, which I didn&#x27;t even want in the first place!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used one set so far, looks natural, didn&#x27;t stay on long, but that could be due to me not applying them correctly to my eye lid.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Who can really deny all these lashes for such little cost?</li>
            <li>Have fun and play hard.</li>
            <li>I hardly ever write reviews but these were worth the couple bucks</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t know what all the bad reviews are about, saying these are hard and plastic-y and poke your eyes, these are freaking awesome!</li>
            <li>I usually put glue on the whole lash then apply outside-in, this way the outside of the eyelash dries a little bit first before I apply the inside of it, making them look very equal and proportioned.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice a difference in these and other drug store lashes that cost three times as much for a single set.</li>
            <li>On the bright side there are multiples so 3 bent ones isn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li>These r great after reading some of the bad reviews i didnt know what to expect but they arrived weeks before expected</li>
            <li>So, I Read The Reviews, Some Good - Some Bad | Blah Blah.</li>
            <li>They just came and the only thing bad I have to say is that the boxes were piled and stuffed into the package, but the good thing is that didn&#x27;t effect the lashes so...</li>

            <li> Perfect for the &amp;#34;budget&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These were perfect.</li>
            <li> these are perfect for you.</li>
            <li> perfect!</li>
            <li> am a very happy costumer &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I believe they are great!</li>
            <li> I shared these with my coworkers on halloween and we all looked awesome</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re getting an awesome deal.</li>
            <li> Because theyer Awesome!</li>
            <li> Was not too impressed with these lashes!</li>
            <li> best price.</li>
            <li> but once I get them, they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
            <li> Just received the lashes today and they look great!</li>
            <li> Took a while to come but there perfect !</li>
            <li> so that was the best for me because I was so scared it wouldn&#x27;t come until 12/2 because it was being shipped from China to Arizona.</li>
            <li> and they will still look awesome.  </li>
            <li> I loved them!!!</li>
            <li> they PERFECT!!!</li>
            <li> very happy with product.</li>
            <li> but once you  put them on with eye shadow and all that glamourous make up you will be good to go !!</li>
            <li> I thought these lashes were incredible!</li>
            <li> Awesome !</li>

            <li> but they are good.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> but they are defiantly a good price for 20 of them they also do not come with glue</li>
            <li> but the lashes themselves were still in good condition.</li>
            <li> Maybe they are good and are what someone else is looking for</li>
            <li> I really loved these.</li>
            <li> good price.</li>

            <li> They are good foor a beginner like me who is just learning how to apply lashes.  </li>
            <li> and they r awesome u do have to trim them a lil to fit but</li>

            <li> I have never put on lashes in my life so these were good to practice with.</li>
            <li> but once you get used to them they look really good.  </li>

            <li> Received item within a good amount of time.</li>

            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Item was in good condition</li>
            <li> Opt for the Duo lash glue from Sally&#x27;s or a good adhesive from Mac.</li>

            <li> Good deal, these are my cheapy lashes good for backups.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to cut them because they fit my eyes perfectly.</li>
            <li> Good communications</li>
            <li> Those lashes were nice had to cut the corners for them to fit my eye, but besides that they look great and the price is excellent.</li>
            <li> but once i applyed them I loved them</li>
            <li> but I guess all in all its a good bang for your buck.</li>

            <li> Love these lashes good price to</li>
            <li> took quite awhile to arrive, but theyre good lashes at a better price</li>
            <li> n honestly</li>
            <li> keeps them nice and neat.</li>
            <li> They arrived fast and n perfect condition.</li>
            <li> They look really nice tho</li>
            <li> It came really fast too, excellent service.</li>
            <li> but I still really liked this product.</li>
            <li> If you are just learning how to apply lashes you will notice that this come in handy.</li>
            <li> Would recommend duo glue with this product which allows you to rewear them many times if you take good care of them.</li>
            <li> The lashes are really nice.</li>
            <li> THEY APPLY NICELY</li>
            <li> For as many as you get, it&#x27;s seriously a good deal.</li>
            <li> these eyelashes are nice.</li>

            <li> That is amazing customer service I have order many things and have never got an email assuring my happiness.</li>
            <li> Kindly appreciate.</li>
            <li> You do have to purchase your own glue</li>
            <li> so you get some nice milage out of them.</li>
            <li> but i still liked them because i like my eyelashes</li>
            <li> these are ok, not as good as pharmacy ones</li>
            <li> Nice quality for the price took awhile to come but for the price no issue</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;ll have to buy your own if you don&#x27;t already have.</li>
            <li> just didn&#x27;t like much the materials but for the price into practice is perfect</li>
            <li> and these are nice because they show up on camera.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about the lashes they are nice.</li>
            <li> so nice and blah blah.</li>
            <li> they are still nice..</li>
            <li> Depending on the occasion and preference they are quality lashes and make a nice beauty addition.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look as nice in person either.</li>
            <li> once on, they looked nice.</li>
            <li> my Niece was absolutely thrilled with the quality of the lashes I was thrilled with the price - I would purchase again</li>
            <li> With some work, trimming and moving they do look nice.</li>
            <li> They came packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> i atually liked this lashes</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ordering more now because the weather getting warmer and I gotta look cute with my lashes lol</li>
            <li> Awesome, need to be cut to size but awesome for a few bucks ^_^</li>
            <li> Not the kind they look in the pic....</li>
            <li> Ah well, practice makes perfect haha.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t feel like plastic, and do look nice once you get them on.  </li>
            <li> Nice shape/band,</li>
            <li> They make my eyes pop so much &amp; look beautiful!</li>
            <li> These worked great - great price and surprisingly fast</li>
            <li> my daughter liked these eyelashes on her.</li>
            <li> The lashes are nice.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes were in good condition though  :)</li>
            <li> : These don&#x27;t come with glue, you have to have your own.</li>
            <li> I need to get more of these, good quality</li>
            <li> it can look kind of cheap/ghetto/ratchet.</li>
            <li> Good cheap alternative and reusable!</li>
            <li> They do not look nice at all.</li>
            <li> They are nice lashes.</li>
            <li> I did take a star away because these didn&#x27;t arrive in a box of any kind.</li>
            <li> You can kind of see the band of the lash though.</li>
            <li> Would have been nice....</li>
            <li> The darker pair I can&#x27;t wear as every day use, but they will come in handy if I go to dinner or out.</li>
            <li> What can you expect when you order as much as I did lol.&lt;br /&gt;Overall these lashes are great!</li>
            <li> They are good quailty I love how they look.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are nice, but you&#x27;ll have to cut or trim them before applying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather spend the money at a store for nice ones.</li>
            <li> They look really nice on.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look nice on your eyes at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I would&#x27;ve loved them</li>
            <li> nice lashes.  </li>
            <li> honestly, for that price its actually really nice.</li>
            <li> Could have been packaged better, but good product.</li>
            <li> I had some handy anyway.</li>
            <li> and in fact all my co workers liked them</li>
            <li> This has a nice selection.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to buy your own glue while you&#x27;re at it.</li>
            <li> nice and neat pack of eyelashes, cant wait to wear them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The thicker ones have a nice feather fringe type look and feel.</li>
            <li> I liked this, it took no time for them to arrive: all fully in tact.</li>
            <li> Stayed Nice</li>
            <li> but I thought and saw another kind of lashes becouse</li>
            <li> THEY ARE SOOOO NICE</li>
            <li> I believe this are really nice quality lashes.</li>
            <li> but on it looks really nice</li>
            <li> also you will have to buy your own glue since its not provided with the eyelashes .</li>
            <li> honestly for the price</li>
            <li> Good for the price.. actually better for the price</li>
            <li> Nice product, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> but their perfect for when you don&#x27;t feel like really applying eye make up.</li>
            <li> Nice eye lashes for use in performing and wanting to enhance the eyes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Shipped really fast, and look great on!  </li>
            <li> I was kind of upset.</li>
            <li> They look nice but dont work.</li>
            <li> know better that if the deal seems too good to be true...it is</li>
            <li> but I honestly would not repurchase these.</li>
            <li> I love style 1, and style 2 looks good as well.</li>
            <li> My wife loved them and said they were better than wat she use to buy thank</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t the best quality but for the price you can&#x27;t complain too much.  </li>
            <li> The lashes are nice</li>
            <li> I liked them and the way they looked on me, but the way they were organized in the box.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, I would absolutely reorder this product in the future!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Better buy from walmart lol for better quality</li>
            <li> I liked them.</li>

            <li> over all I liked my eyelashes</li>
            <li> honestly</li>
            <li> These lashes are kind of a pain to put on..</li>
            <li> They are nice lashes.</li>

            <li> Would have been nice if they were not messed up.</li>

            <li> Good for beginners but the quality is on the cheap side</li>

            <li> My husband loved them had lots of fun also!</li>
            <li> Good product and worth the price!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the kind you buy in the stores, but considering you get 20 pairs for the price you would pay for just one pair in the store makes it totally worth it.</li>
            <li> so if you are looking for some nice lashes that will look more believable these are not them.</li>
            <li> I am use to the lashline being more of a plastic kind of material and these are more like a string.  </li>
            <li> Might be good for a night out when you&#x27;re wearing a load of makeup but not for natural looking days, they won&#x27;t fly.</li>
            <li> The simple ones are great for on the go cuteness and the thicker ones are great for parties, church, etc.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have asked for better lashes and they are so cheap, just try them you won&#x27;t  regret it unless you aren&#x27;t good at putting on lashes</li>
            <li> Way to cheap looking and didn&#x27;t fit for my lash line or any humans lashes lol.</li>
            <li> so I used the more natural, thinner lashes and they look great!  </li>
            <li> But the natural looking ones are great!! :)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s an awesome process so far, couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything better for the price</li>
            <li> Really cute and nice looking :)</li>
            <li> Exactly as stated on here, very pleased!  </li>
            <li> very real and the variety of lashes is great.  </li>
            <li> Good for every day and special occasions</li>
            <li> There good there&#x27;s nothing special about them, there eyelashes.</li>
            <li> These lashes look great on me, I&#x27;d definitely purchase more!!</li>
            <li> You get exactly what you asked for, and I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty great price for lashes.</li>
            <li> I had to get them reshipped because they never came the first time I ordered, but the company was kind and courteous to resend! :)</li>
            <li> They look so beautiful and so real.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re pretty great...</li>
            <li> u aren&#x27;t much longer than my lashes beautiful</li>
            <li> These were my first falsies, and I think they themselves are great.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t fall apart and blended into my real lashes beautifully.</li>
            <li> other than that they&#x27;re good quality and look awesome!</li>
            <li> These lashes are actually pretty great for the price.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty happy with them...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the chance to wear then but they feel so real and are so beautiful.</li>

            <li> look very cheap on</li>
            <li> the price is very affordable, but you do get what you pay for in a way, awesome for special makeup.</li>
            <li> these are amazing and a good buy for your first time.  </li>
            <li> These eye lashes are great, and Im pretty sure the people who say they&#x27;re so flimsy to use, just don&#x27;t know how to apply eyelashes correctly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Cosmo student super good lashes to practice with...</li>
            <li> They both look really nice and are soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Luckily the eyelashes turned to be in good conditions .</li>
            <li> liked it, it was easy to practice on how to used lashes</li>
            <li> They are organized nicely which makes them easy to store.  </li>
            <li> The lashes have nice length and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> even those these are so cheap in price they should be charging more!</li>
            <li> looks great nice long eyelashes to look good every day.</li>
            <li> First I have to say they arrived right on time which is great!</li>
            <li> Super good and for a really cheap prize!</li>
            <li> I love the length and thickness, but they are very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Very cheap, You&#x27;re better off buying from a dollar store at a buck</li>
            <li> These were very cheap for 20 pairs but are nicer than most that I&#x27;ve bought in stores for $4 a piece.</li>
            <li> The more natural looking set is perfect, easy to put on, curl, and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better but for the price AND FREE SHIPPING, you get a bargain for sure!</li>
            <li> cheap and beautiful lashes with a large quanity of them too!</li>
            <li> Not much of a bad product I just wasn&#x27;t too happy with them, specially since I didn&#x27;t get the thinner ones.</li>
            <li> These were the most HIDEOUS lashes I have ever seen or used.</li>
            <li> They could do better in packing them</li>
            <li> safe for wearing</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> The thinner ones were OK</li>
            <li> Who wouldn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> i love these they are well made ....and so many :)</li>
            <li> i know she will love them :)</li>
            <li> I used two types of glue, and each time, the things straightened out so the corners became detached.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re better off getting lashes from Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> Not going to be able to use any of them.</li>
            <li> Even better price.</li>
            <li> these eyelashes are wonderful they look so natural and nobody can ever tell I like to use hair extension glue to put them on because that is cheap and stays on for about a day it doesn&#x27;t hurt when you go to take it off</li>
            <li> there are many.</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> but my daughter love them</li>
            <li> I would advise you to buy the ones from walmart, even the dollar store has better ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing lashes for more than 5 years now, so I consider myself an expert.  </li>
            <li> Love these lashes my faves are the thicker ones</li>
            <li> I just need more practice putting them on..</li>
            <li> Bought them more than 1 year ago still have some...</li>

            <li> Love the look and</li>

            <li> Even the more &amp;#34;dramatic&amp;#34; ones aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;too much.&amp;#34; I can wear both day or night.</li>
            <li> you shoulnt have any problems fitting them to your eye</li>
            <li> i love the lighter lashes.</li>
            <li> and she said they are okay.</li>
            <li> Please do better</li>
            <li> I love all my lashes</li>
            <li> 4 $ for one pair or 2 $ for alll these options :)</li>
            <li> Lash style #2 are more noticeable for me.</li>
            <li> but once you get a hang of it they&#x27;re perfect especially for the price.</li>
            <li> but I may have gotten a good batch good lashes as far as I&#x27;m concerned</li>

            <li> Theyre okay .</li>
            <li> They just take more time to adjust and fix for my eyelid .</li>
            <li> i love these falsies....</li>
            <li> but when you get use to it the lashes are fabulous!</li>
            <li> and i love them</li>

            <li> I fell in love instantaneously.</li>
            <li> I love the Ardell eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Ordering more.</li>
            <li> All the best styles and sized in one big box.  </li>
            <li> They go on cute, I just wish they didn&#x27;t feel so plastic.</li>
            <li> and how many you get.</li>
            <li> These are lovely, sturdy, I even find them reusable.</li>
            <li> You can get by with cheaper lashes but buy a good adhesive because you&#x27;re worth it. :)</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> &gt; Love these  </li>
            <li> like the thinner ones better, they look more natural.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> I have not worn them yet,but I will keep you posted on how well they do on Halloween,but they are better looking than pictured.</li>
            <li> They are cute for the money.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these lashes.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> the lashes I purchase from the beauty supply store are more curved so they are easier to put on.</li>
            <li> but it did have to go through a lot to get to me and even better just because the packaging was a lil bent</li>
            <li> Not so pleased.  </li>
            <li> but most of them would look like a furry worm stuck on your eye lid.  </li>
            <li> As for the lashes, I&#x27;m pleased with the quality and quantity for the price.</li>
            <li> They where ok.</li>
            <li> Best part is that they&#x27;re totally reusable.</li>
            <li> but they look ok</li>
            <li> :) i like them</li>
            <li> and then there&#x27;s the more jazzy ones</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> Most of them are not even and the lashes are bunched up.</li>
            <li> The price was to die for and the product is even better.</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> I have gotten many compliments on my lashes which I do myself.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes FOR SURE need to be cut before wearing.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes.</li>
            <li> I would buy more again and again</li>
            <li> &amp; ive never had so many problems trying to put on eye lashes before.</li>
            <li> These lashes are fantastic!</li>
            <li> I bought these to try them out and they are okay but</li>
            <li> Oh i love, i love.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine these fitting anyone&#x27;s eyes</li>
            <li> I love these lashes.</li>
            <li> Love them will be ordering again</li>
            <li> The laahes are ok...</li>
            <li> Maybe it stated that &amp; I should&#x27;ve read more about them.</li>
            <li> I guess I shoulda read more in debt in these.</li>
            <li> but they work ok.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t worry about if I don&#x27;t get as many uses out of 1 pair as I do with others</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t fit and wouldn&#x27;t stay on!</li>
            <li> Might buy more.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, I love them.</li>

            <li> I WAS ABLE TO PLAY WITH THEM AND MAKE IT WORK...</li>
            <li> WHEN I USE MORE ATTENTION TO DETAIL WITH MY MAKE UP</li>
            <li> What I find most appealing is that I can trim and curl them to make them appear more natural.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> These are okay.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that there are so many of them</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about buying any more for awhile.</li>
            <li> love the lightweight lashes.</li>
            <li> These are some \\&quot;I love NY\\&quot; lashes.</li>
            <li> I could pull maybe 5-7 times with the lashes or more</li>
            <li> Plan on ordering more can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
            <li> i can get 1 more out of them and</li>

            <li> but thay are just enuff for every day i love them .</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t wear them more than twice.</li>
            <li> Most of them couldn&#x27;t be used.  </li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I originally only got them because of the price, but they&#x27;re great!</li>

            <li> I was definitely pleased with this product.</li>

            <li> didn&#x27;t like how I wasn&#x27;t able to track my order</li>

            <li> roll them in your fingers to make them more flexible.  </li>
            <li> Tried many times could not even get them to stay on so had to take them off and throw them away.. Would not recommend.</li>

            <li> The packaging was okay.</li>
            <li> They are very sturdy and are a great length to cut to the appropriate size.</li>
            <li> and i was sure i wasnt going to like them because of the quality</li>
            <li> but overall they look wonderful.</li>
            <li> Get more compliments on the thicker pair than the too-perfect skimpier pair.</li>
            <li> My friends complement the effect the eyelashes brought out. :)</li>

            <li> and you&#x27;ll see why) and having to buy more because they really are great.</li>
            <li> I guess they would be great for Halloween or just to practice for the real deal.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> They had more of a \\&quot;spider lash\\&quot; effect..</li>

            <li> I LOVE THESE</li>
            <li> The thicker ones are mostly for dressing up customes.  </li>
            <li> If you can get over all of that &amp; just trim them to your eye size, not terrible.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> So cheap they&#x27;re literally unwearable !</li>
            <li> My fault for buying cheap lashes!</li>

            <li> i love the product</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love wearing these lashes.  </li>
            <li> it was okay for the price</li>
            <li> I guess the thicker ones would be better for night time when going out.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t pleased.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so cheap!  </li>

            <li> but i love em. :3</li>
            <li> These lashes were okay</li>
            <li> Do not recommend unless you don&#x27;t want to spend a bit more on some more real-looking ones.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t love the stiffness of the material.</li>
            <li> but they did give my eyes more definition</li>

            <li> Thanks- Have a great one.</li>
            <li> They were okay.</li>
            <li> for the price I can&#x27;t complain, but the lashes look more like plastic.</li>

            <li> I won&#x27;t even have to order more of these for a loooong time because there are so many.</li>
            <li> it would rather pay more for better quality</li>
            <li> Go to Wal-Mart or Sally&#x27;s and buy some from there, they are better than these.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product.  </li>
            <li> I love these lashes.</li>
            <li> I get soo many complements.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> I love the lightweight lashes.</li>
            <li> Not so satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Should have made it more flexible.</li>
            <li> better than i was expecting.</li>
            <li> love these</li>
            <li> The texture of the lashes are light weight and enhance your look nicely these are my go to lashes and</li>
            <li> the best thing is you can reuse them up to 4 times if you want to make them last longer.</li>
            <li> love these lashes</li>
            <li> so you get what you paid for, but they are ok.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I love my lashes, &amp; yes I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Love it will order again</li>
            <li> I really love these lashes.</li>
            <li> Awesome prices, only a couple of bucks for 20 pairs!!</li>
            <li> were as you&#x27;ll pay 7 or more dollars at drug stores or makeup stores.</li>
            <li> That is the only reason for 4 stars otherwise they are perfect!!!</li>
            <li> Yes you get what you pay for and i should haave paid more.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more once I run out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll order more for my clients</li>
            <li> They did get to me on the first day estimated so that was pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> I will buy more again</li>
            <li> A much better investment.</li>
            <li> I will keep buying these for sure.</li>
            <li> so I mostly used style #1.</li>
            <li> I got 5 or 6 uses out of them before I couldn&#x27;t wear them any more</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure I would love them to.</li>
            <li> but if you wear eyelashes im sure u can work with it.</li>
            <li> With the proper adhesive these are the best for your money and</li>
            <li> Could have been packaged a lot better...</li>
            <li> so w.e, i do love the product though</li>
            <li> Best deal I&#x27;ve found on Amazon, and I will definitely but more.</li>
            <li> but anyways i love them</li>
            <li> I will definatly order more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I love it :)</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> I was able to keep 16 pairs and give 4 pairs to my mother.</li>
            <li> P.S I love how they&#x27;re two types of lashes to chose from for under $2</li>
            <li> Thank you, sincerely, Juanita Wilson...</li>
            <li> I found that flexing them a bit before applying the glue and putting them on works much better in fitting the curve of your eyelid.</li>
            <li> Love the eyelashes.</li>
            <li> They give you a sexy, exotic look.</li>
            <li> Now I can wear them more often and hopefully get better at the application.</li>
            <li> :) I read a couple reviews saying that theirs were smashed but mine were neat &amp; perfect!!&lt;br /&gt;-Leah</li>
            <li> Love the way they look and you cant beat the price.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic for the price!</li>
            <li> I will be buying more for my cousin who is a make up artiest.</li>
            <li> i love these lashes.</li>
            <li> Im satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m satisfied with the seller.</li>
            <li> These are ok.  </li>
            <li> I love these</li>
            <li> so i guess it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> and you may have to adjust to fit your own eyes.</li>
            <li> Omg I love these lashes</li>
            <li> Love these.  </li>
            <li> I get so many complements on them......:-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> I love the option of thickness and the darkness.</li>
            <li> like the different kinds of lashes in this product both are very beautiful on and they are both sturdy</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be too satisfied, and I wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I tried them again to make sure &amp; again they itched.</li>
            <li> Even after I removed them, the itching &amp; eyelid sensitivity lasted a couple more days.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE SIZE OF LASH</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these.</li>
            <li> These have lasted me ages and look fantastic!</li>
            <li> As eyelashes they were ok but they don&#x27;t stay on your eyes</li>
            <li> they are okay</li>
            <li> its OK</li>
            <li> but they surely don&#x27;t go with mine</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> They are as they say and for cheap too!</li>
            <li> so make sure you order some or pick it up somewhere.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and ive gotten SOOO MANY COMPLIMENTS.</li>
            <li> so it mixes better.</li>
            <li> But I LOVE them</li>
            <li> They are so cheap too!</li>
            <li> favorite way to wear these lashes are combining the thinner ones and then layer it with the thicker ones as a demi-lash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love these</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing more</li>
            <li> The most I would do is wear them for a costume party or festival or halloween.</li>
            <li> Love love love!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more of these lashes!!!!</li>

            <li> so just try them for yourself :)</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t come in the most protected cases.</li>
            <li> I just ordered two more.</li>
            <li> and it gives you a nice look.&lt;br /&gt;In closing, if you are looking for extravagant, fabulous quality package of eyelashes, these are NOT for you.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT STILL WEARING THEM ABOUT</li>
            <li> TO ORDER SOME MORE</li>
            <li> I actually love these</li>
            <li> Love them</li>
            <li> For it&#x27;s price, pfft this is BUENO for sure.</li>
            <li> i use that to put on even better.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with these lashes and so glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> I wish they&#x27;d come up with more styles because I&#x27;d buy them all.</li>
            <li> so I thought what better price to pay to have 20 pairs to play with.</li>
            <li> Better than that 10 sets of each</li>
            <li> There are more some practice lashes.</li>
            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied .................</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s for sure</li>
            <li> I gave these lashes 3 stars because the regular eyelashes were OK....not the best lashes in the world</li>
            <li> Maybe I just need more practice</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t worry about if I don&#x27;t get as many uses out of 1 pair as I do with others</li>
            <li> These are great products, really do recommend them.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> Received these and love them.</li>
            <li> Overall great buy!</li>
            <li> Looks plastics but once you have them on there ok if you like a fill look</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay .</li>

            <li> i love the product, make my eyes sparkle</li>
            <li> No wonder they cost so cheap!</li>
            <li> You do have to cut them, of course, but they are awesome, especially for the price!</li>

            <li> if u want to stock up on eyelashes I would buy this package :)</li>
            <li> Not the most amazing-quality lashes I&#x27;ve ever used, in terms of their lash dispersal and how &amp;#34;real&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Love these lashes.</li>
            <li> You get more than what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love both of the styles.</li>

            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to not have to go to the store to buy eyelashes when I&#x27;m going somewhere important.</li>
            <li> something you need lashes for but cannot afford to spend more money.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Its ok i love it because it is affordable</li>
            <li> it is not my favorite eyelashes</li>
            <li> but for this price.. it was okay to give a try</li>
            <li> style 2 is my favorite</li>
            <li> The service is so great I wasnt expecting to get the lashes for about 30 days since they were shipping from Hong Kong, but I got i lashes today a week after my order, super fast was very pleased with that.</li>
            <li> For 60 pairs, paying right around 5$ is definitely is good deal.</li>
            <li> Looks very nice like real.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how beautiful these eyelashes looked.</li>
            <li> Very nice, fast shipping</li>

            <li> These lashes are exactly like the picture shows!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive these lashes.</li>
            <li> and I was very excited to use them.</li>
            <li> was very excited to wear these.</li>
            <li> They look beautiful and natural!  </li>
            <li> My daughter has her own unique look.</li>
            <li> If you want beautiful lashes for a more natural look.</li>
            <li> This seems to be the best method for full, natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li> I love them because they make my eyes look so beautiful and natural.</li>
            <li> The main thing is that they look great</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best for beginners..and the shipping was pretty fast</li>
            <li> great product and super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> very cheap, low quality, but good for emergencies when you run out of the good ones</li>
            <li> Super cute !</li>
            <li> I wish you the udachnkh of sales of warm responses from buyers and happiness in new year.</li>
            <li> if you know how to apply eyelashes they are super easy and they are very comfortable on and not to mention, stunning!</li>
            <li> they are super versatile and sturdy the natural ones are perfect for every day.</li>
            <li> the price is great but the product is so so...not so easy to apply...doesn&#x27;t really curve to stay put on your eyes</li>
            <li> well I was not disappointed I am wearing them to a very special event and can&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made and dont apply easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the wait because the price is cheap :) They are good to play around with.</li>
            <li> Pretty eyelashes and good product</li>
            <li> These are pretty good.</li>
            <li> They are pretty good considering the price.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for choosing just the ones you need for any occasion.</li>
            <li> They got to me fast and they were packaged nicely!  </li>
            <li> Also DUO Eyelash Adhesive is the best glue for long wear.</li>
            <li> Nice and full though.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty good quallity.</li>
            <li> These are my first lashes I&#x27;ve ever wore they feel good</li>
            <li> My eyelashes came in a pretty fair amount of time and although the package looked damaged the eyelashes were unharmed.</li>
            <li> Got Them Early (: Beautiful Eyelashes ♡</li>
            <li> /&gt;thick, beautiful, natural.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t  look like shiny plastic and feel pretty good when on.</li>
            <li> You do want to use a good amount of glue on the edges where lashes tend to lift first.</li>
            <li> However, they are pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> They turned out to be pretty good  </li>
            <li> The eye lashes are natural and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re not in a hurry a pretty good buy for the amount you receive.</li>
            <li> I am not the greatest at applying them of keeping them a long time.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good quality considering the price</li>
            <li> but they are pretty good</li>
            <li> the long eyelashes are beautiful!</li>
            <li> These eye lashes are soft and beautiful on.</li>
            <li> Good for first time lash users as well.</li>
            <li> This would&#x27;ve been fine by me, since they were still very cheap and pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> These are OK - kind of stiff feel - doesn&#x27;t apply the best.</li>
            <li> Cheap and easy to put on!</li>
            <li> it just took them forever to get here but the product was good and they give you so many at a decent price!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really fun!!</li>
            <li> Variety of dark and light lashes is always awesome and you cant ask for much more for the price!</li>
            <li> I ordered these and was so excited!</li>
            <li> Worth it all!!</li>
            <li> , they work fine and were very cheap.</li>
            <li> I didnt excpected them to be very nice and natural!!</li>
            <li> I loveeee these lashes , the thinner ones are great have gotten so many compliments on them looking natural.</li>
            <li> This eyelashes are great, I can choose if I want a more dramtic or natural look.</li>
            <li> nice variety, arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Love these easy to use and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> They are OK but the eyelashes fall off easily.</li>
            <li> I love this they are easy to put on</li>
            <li> So easy to put on made my eyes look so much better.</li>
            <li> The darker set is very bold, while the thinner one is more of an accent.</li>
            <li> Cute, easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li> Came in quickly, and they are nice</li>
            <li> I love the thinner lashes, they glue on easy and blend in nicely!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> you are frugal like me and don&#x27;t really want to pay 10 bucks for five pairs at the store, and also mind working with them to make them look a bit more &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes, I enjoy wearing them and there comfortable!</li>
            <li> it was a cheap quality item, and I&#x27;d rather pay more and in return recieve a much better quality item.  </li>
            <li> These lashes are priced extremely good, they aren&#x27;t the kind of lashes professional makeup artists might use for a pop singer&#x27;s music video or anything</li>
            <li> I know this product wasn&#x27;t going to be the absolute best because of where it shipped from, however, I really do like this product.</li>
            <li> Really good quality and gorgeous lashes that last just as well as any lashes</li>
            <li> when ur ready get some more when u get good</li>
            <li> eyelashes are in good shape and look good, if only i can figure out how to apply them!</li>
            <li> Overall they are really nice lashes and great for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to make them curve more to better fit the curvature of my eyelid (including pinning the ends together and let them sit for 48 hours.)</li>
            <li> Better quality than I expected for an awesome price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the thinner lashes they look so natural but make my lashes look great.</li>
            <li> Their sooooo freakin cheap but actually work awesome.</li>
            <li> Looking at the low price, I honestly thought the quality wouldn&#x27;t be that great</li>
            <li> The lighter ones are very natural feeling, and look great.  </li>
            <li> u just need a good glue for lashes and they will be fine but there good cheap looking natural eye lashes</li>
            <li> You have to be able to put eyelashes on pretty near perfect.</li>
            <li> Great deal i received sixty pairs of lashes for 9 bucks like wow!</li>
            <li> Cheap looking and flimsy, very cheap plastic but will work for photos.</li>

            <li> They are very nice, the thinner ones are very natural looking.</li>
            <li> They are very full lashes.</li>
            <li> Very good for basic things like cosplay and photography.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d say the product is very good for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t see a problem with the item at all, they were easy to use, and when you get them on right, they&#x27;re stunning and they make anyone&#x27;s eyes pop.</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I ordered , very good price, and fast delivery</li>
            <li> so i really liked this, easy to put on and use and very pretty on.</li>

            <li> i used the thicker lashes first and then whn i ran out of those i used the natural set.both sets are awesome..</li>
            <li> Love them comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> But the natural ones are amazing, soo cheap but with fair quality</li>
            <li> Love the cheap price</li>
            <li> Not really the best quality</li>
            <li> I expected a lower quality because of the price but they were great !</li>
            <li> These lashes were nicer than I expected them to be, and had a very good price!</li>
            <li> Arrived before expected date and in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had cheap drug store brands that worked way better.</li>
            <li> Looks better in the picture, they look cheap in the package and break apart upon contact.</li>
            <li> , they are soft and stay on great.</li>

            <li> But since it was cheap I am not worried about it.:)</li>
            <li> These lashes are great for wearing as demi since they don&#x27;t fall off and look incredibly natural.</li>
            <li> Far as the looks they are great.</li>
            <li> i was not to happy they just didnt feel as natural as i would have wanted</li>

            <li> quality/&lt;br /&gt;Not easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Both sets of lashes have a bit excess band on the edges which keep them in the packaging, but those can easily be snipped off.</li>
            <li> --you&#x27;ll find lash glue easy).</li>
            <li> They are also easy to take off and are reusable.</li>

            <li> So, first off, I&#x27;d like to say that I am very excited about these eyelashes!</li>
            <li> These are the best lashes hands down I ever came across and at a great price because its better than going to the beauty supply store or Walmart or Mac or sephora and spending an arm and a leg for lashes which don&#x27;t ever last.</li>
            <li> For special occasions I love to go for that doey-eyed look, these do the trick.</li>
            <li> Everyone says these are too stiff, but I find that with a good quality glue, these lashes are great.</li>
            <li> eye lashes look exactly as shown in the picture and look amazing once put on.</li>
            <li> the just took a while to get to me lol other than that they are amazing</li>
            <li> Eyelashes arrived like 2 weeks earlier before time which is great , the natural looking eyelashes are great .</li>
            <li> They are pretty nice.</li>
            <li> OMG great lashes nice , i really was surprised</li>

            <li> it sticks on to her pretty effectively.</li>
            <li> I liked the first set and it took 2weeks to get here /-\</li>
            <li> they are kind of doll like but curl them first or while you have them on</li>
            <li> They look pretty nice</li>
            <li> My fav is style 2 but style 1 is pretty nice as well.</li>

            <li> and they are cheaply made.</li>
            <li> These lashes are most definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> They do not look cheap in my opinion.</li>
            <li> SO CHEAP looking</li>
            <li> As with all lashes, I had to trim them to fit my eyes.</li>
            <li> Because they are cheap</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li> Great price, the only thing you have to do is cut the edges that is holding them in place when they arrive.</li>
            <li> Cheap manmade material.</li>
            <li> They are absolutely perfect for everyday wear in my opinion.</li>
            <li> They fit just right.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Too happy actually to wait until I&#x27;ve tried them to write a review, I just couldn&#x27;t help it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic lashes</li>
            <li> Cheap in quality</li>
            <li> cheap.</li>
            <li> no matter what type of glue you use, these can only be used for 1 time then you must throw away great for things like show choir, dance recitals, cheer-leading competitions ect</li>
            <li> I love this product, cheap and useful in any occasion.</li>
            <li> I loved the thicker lashes and seemed better than some of the human hair lashes I wear.</li>
            <li> My husband and my son both have those long beautiful lashes that us women are always so jealous of and now with these lashes I can keep up in our family battle of the lashes</li>
            <li> but i love the thick one :D</li>
            <li> these lashes won&#x27;t bend, they don&#x27;t look good, I wanted them to look naturally.</li>
            <li> The natural ones look good on any girl looking for something to amp up on.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for a natural kind of lash, these aren&#x27;t for you, but if you feel like being adventurous, you could give it a try.</li>
            <li> they where so good better than expected :)</li>
            <li> I really like these better than any of the ones I have gotten at the store that cost way more for just one pair.</li>
            <li> But I do love the natural lashes, they&#x27;re so nice.</li>
            <li> but so far really good</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> so impressed like holy cow!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re learning or don&#x27;t care about it not being extremely realistic, get them for sure!</li>
            <li> The bases are a bit stiff, so they require a good bit of flexing before application, but all in all, a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with how fast and quickly they were delivered to my house.</li>
            <li> Love these &amp; price is just right.</li>
            <li> I love how you can cut them to the right fit&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The lashes don&#x27;t come with adhesive so you will have to buy your own, the lashes are kind of flat</li>
            <li> Arrived whole weeks in advance!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks again!!!</li>
            <li> I am ADORING these lashes!!!</li>

            <li> Very nice to have different looks .</li>
            <li> these are the best eyelashes I love the price &amp;  quality if you use with proper care  pretty fast shipping from china to san Francisco</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the thicker lashes but the smaller ones are very nice</li>
            <li> The lashes are very nice and for the price I got it for was a total bargain!</li>
            <li> These lashes are very fun.  </li>
            <li> I love them there light and looks good it took a long time to get them</li>
            <li> I love my lashes, their thick, durable &amp; so beautiful :)</li>
            <li> This item arrived early, I am very pleased with the outcome they don&#x27;t feel cheap or look cheap</li>
            <li> These would be really good for a beginner that wants lots of practice or for the Pro that knows exactly what to do.</li>
            <li> They look like my real lashes and they&#x27;re very easy to apply and to remove.</li>
            <li> And the stripes that holds the lashes tend to come off very easily when taking off the old flue to clean them, other than that they&#x27;re perfect !!</li>
            <li> they look good and they seem real enough, just a bit shiny, but thats easily fixable</li>
            <li> And the are super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Product came very early and I love the item and the card it came with is so cute.</li>
            <li> VERY VERY NATURAL LOOKING, I RECEIVED MANY MANY COMPLIMENTS ON THEM.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing price for 20 pairs of eyelashes!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time buying these eyelashes and they are amazing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;m excited to try them</li>
            <li> To long for me but its a great buy</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;m excited to try them</li>
            <li> Although the shipping took too long the lashes are great.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> i was so excited about these.</li>
            <li> I am excited to try them on.</li>
            <li> Not bad for cheap lashes</li>
            <li> The first shipment I never got, but they sent me more</li>
            <li> i would probably order these again, just be aware that you might be waiting more than a month for them to reach you.</li>
            <li> These are great if you like having long eye lashes.</li>
            <li> and I think it is totally worth it for the price !</li>
            <li> Really excited to use them.</li>
            <li> This was definitely the great buy especially if you don&#x27;t mind the fair quality.  </li>
            <li> Overall a pretty good deal, though!</li>
            <li> I was so excited</li>
            <li> they are fun to play around in though!</li>
            <li> I originally rated it one star, but now that the product has arrived and I can see the quality, I would change my rating to three stars.</li>
            <li> , their reusable if you treat them well.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended &amp; worth the wait!</li>
            <li> In all fairness, they did arrive fairly quickly so the seller did his part and quickly to boot !</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the try!</li>
            <li> I love the texture of the lash,,, really pretty</li>
            <li> These lashes were well worth it!</li>
            <li> But I like mines full and fabulous baby.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s OK the eyelashes are made poorly but 20 pairs of eyeleyelashes are good and for the price good</li>
            <li> Most of them broke with first application.</li>
            <li> so I enjoy having the option of full or sparse.</li>
            <li> I occasionally wear lashes and this was a bargain for the quantity and quality, better than most retail store brands Love the product</li>
            <li> They are big and full beautiful lashes, totally worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with them ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s alright for some faces</li>
            <li> it was worth the wait!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great lashes!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how many eyelashes you can get at such a wonderful price...have finally gotten the hang of it--</li>
            <li> i was supper excited.</li>
            <li> love them they are exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li> I recommend them I love the first style</li>
            <li> These are sturdy and fun!  </li>
            <li> they are super inexpensive, so they are not as flexible as you may need them to be, but I needed them for a costume, so they worked out fine.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my eyelashes asking me what I use to make my eyelashes look so good and full and long.</li>
            <li> I got them really fast and they are so easy to wear!</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted them because she was not blessed with long eyelashes and this came at a great time because she is graduating 8th grade and wanted a lil extra eyelash when she dresses for her graduation, not to mention they look full and beautiful, cannot wait till we use them and trust me, they can last more than a year with the set that comes together!  </li>
            <li> These are not even wearable they feel like plastic super cheap material.</li>
            <li> I love how natural but sexy and brighter they make my eyes look.</li>
            <li> Such a great deal for so many lashes, they are not only accurate for anime cosplay, but comfortable too!</li>
            <li> The shipping takes close to a month since it&#x27;s coming from China but definitely worth the money, they are easy to apply you just have to trim off the ends,</li>
            <li> liked the product, I am being satisfied,liked the product, I am being satisfied, it was sent by me in a gift i hope so act set for the one to which a present was given as</li>
            <li> they feel super cheap but are workable</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was quick but they are what you pay for, they are stiffer and resemble those cheap lashes you get at Halloween stores.</li>
            <li> if i clean the glue off i thank</li>
            <li> They look a lot better (read: more natural) than when they&#x27;re sitting in the box.</li>
            <li> feel like I&#x27;ll get more use out of the more natural pair</li>
            <li> take them off with makeup remover and clean after wearing.</li>
            <li> Quality isn&#x27;t that great, but with 10 of each pair, its worth it if you just want to wear them occasionally</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m really enjoying those , the thinner ones are also nice especially if you&#x27;re  someone who just likes</li>
            <li> they aren&#x27;t super comfortable</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re super cheap</li>
            <li> However, you can buy so many for a cheap price that it doesn&#x27;t really affect you.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the price and to get this many sets all at once is a huge bargain.</li>
            <li> luckily they were cheap or i would be livid they look nothing like the picture</li>
            <li> Price is good for the quantity, obviously, but they&#x27;re annoyingly cheap.</li>
            <li> the more natural lashes were ok</li>
            <li> They have a nice curl to them as well, and can be definitely used more than once.</li>
            <li> It was nice, but the package was kind of crushed.</li>
            <li> i havent tried the lashes on yet,but they look nice and lush and easy to work with, and twenty pairs for about two dollars and free shipping is worth the wait.</li>
            <li> It was fast, had really good quality to the product, and it came in a reasonable time frame.</li>
            <li> With a little clipping and bending to shape them you can get them on pretty nicely and the results are great.</li>
            <li> The heavy lashes are perfect when you want to make an impact - Like - drag queen impact.  :P</li>
            <li> The natural looking ones are my favorite!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived and have since ordered 4 more sets!</li>
            <li> Aside from the super long shipping, I was happy w/ my purchase</li>
            <li> These lashes are pretty flimsy, but they don&#x27;t look cheap and are easy to put on with weave glue.</li>
            <li> very light weight and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like them there very cheaply made but</li>
            <li> this product is great cheap got my moneys worth along with long eye lashes !  </li>
            <li> The eyelashes are great, and it&#x27;s much better having all these sets than constantly having to go buy new ones.</li>
            <li> Long and just how they looked for a great price also pretty strong</li>
            <li> These are nice, cheap enough to use &amp; toss, can easily be trimmed to size.</li>
            <li> I paid $1.87 for these 40 lashes and I absolutely got more than my $$ worth!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m waiting for a special occasion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m waiting for a special occasion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wear mine to special events and always receive compliments.</li>
            <li> Just for special occasions</li>
            <li> I use them for competitions and special occasions .</li>
            <li> I use these lashes when I&#x27;m going out for special occasions.</li>
            <li> Got them right on time!</li>
            <li> By hey ya get what you pay for right!</li>
            <li> but they arrived right now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just living them right now!</li>
            <li> i had orderd and when it came in the mail some of the lashes where messed up lashes wernt attached right and lashes where in pieces!</li>
            <li> I love them add mascara looks very natural :) definitely will order again very satisfied</li>
            <li> What a great price for such a large supply!</li>
            <li> They are not thick and plasticky I am sure they will go on just fine</li>
            <li> and apply very smooth lol.. not bad for a few dollars!</li>
            <li> Super excited.</li>
            <li> when I received it I was super excited</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great for the price even if you dont like them there not much of a loss.</li>
            <li> They are long so that you can trim them to fit your eyes which is good</li>
            <li> :) I really liked how long they are also.</li>
            <li> considering how far they had to travel, with heavier packages!&lt;br /&gt;Product itself is amazing, don&#x27;t be intimidated by the exess threads on the sides</li>
            <li> The price was great but the box in the mail was crushed and the eyelashes were misshapen</li>
            <li> The lashes came in on July 11 and were expected to come in on July 20, so I was happy about that.  </li>
            <li> And there not really that attractive.</li>
            <li> I figured with the numerous good reviews</li>
            <li> but all in all good purchase 3rd box ordered</li>
            <li> My 10 full lashes were all sitting at the bottom of the package with what looked like glue already attached to them.</li>
            <li> LOVE THEM, they look really real.</li>
            <li> There are a few styles to choose from, depending on what you&#x27;re looking for, and if the color matches then you have an ideal</li>
            <li> Hopefully it last but good thou</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gotta say it was SUCH A GOOD IDEA to buy these together instead of separate.</li>
            <li> I dont have anything negative to say except the shipping, over all there awesome lashes for the price</li>
            <li> These turned out way better than expected and for such a wonderful price!</li>
            <li> The look cool for evening wear.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re basically disposable, which is good, because I don&#x27;t have the patience to take care of my lashes, but if you remember to store them, each pair can last up to a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gotta say it was SUCH A GOOD IDEA to buy these together instead of separate.</li>
            <li> i love it so much, makes my lashes longer and fuller</li>
            <li> it saves me so much on lashes - most</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t mind trimming overall good product saved me money</li>
            <li> Got these lashes early which was nice..</li>
            <li> Good texture, and lot of different sizes,</li>
            <li> they dnt cost much but will get more</li>
            <li> and I think that some of the reviews were not reflective of the true quality of the product.</li>
            <li> That was really annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the lashes are okay.</li>
            <li> they are cool</li>
            <li> ONLY GOOD FOR PRACTICE PURPOSES NOT GOING OUT</li>
            <li> I really like how they look on me too :)</li>
            <li> nothing i cant fix)&lt;br /&gt;it would be helpful if they came with glue, but they came early and for the price they were there really nice</li>
            <li> If this is true for you, then order this product.</li>
            <li> but they look a lot better on the picture than in real life</li>
            <li> yea and the full ones make u look like u have nicki minaj eyes</li>
            <li> The picture is a true likeness of what the lashes look like.</li>
            <li> : The natural lashes look nice and stay on well</li>
            <li> but i like how full they are.</li>
            <li> Oh I just love this product sooooooooo much.  </li>
            <li> They are cute but they don&#x27;t really have a weft to put the glue on</li>
            <li> but when I open, it is DEFINATELY like it is in the picture, DEFINATELY a good buy.</li>
            <li> but overall they are good eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Overall it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Cheap so worth it</li>
            <li> Outside of that they are a good buy.</li>
            <li> Cheap and worth the money...had no issues wearing/applying either.</li>
            <li> I received them earlier and in good conditions.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> I love these eyelashes, I really like the thicker ones</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t human hair, which isn&#x27;t surprising.</li>
            <li> last about 4 wears depending how good you are to them.</li>
            <li> I love them so much</li>
            <li> Full makeup review with pictures can be found here:</li>
            <li> The package was neat and simple, good for putting away after using a pair .</li>
            <li> Style 1 look glamourous and style 2 look natural but really nice.</li>
            <li> overall a good deal for 2 bucks</li>
            <li> If you look good in big eyelashes</li>
            <li> they hurt only good thing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried on the really thick ones for my cosplay and they look great!</li>
            <li> The darker ones are the ones I like, and they look real when I use it I am satisfied</li>
            <li> a thick density are perfect for embellishing.</li>
            <li> Love them so much</li>
            <li> Good thing I only paid about 3 bucks including shipping.</li>
            <li> so many compliments AND THOUGHT THEY WHERE REAL</li>
            <li> Its Packed With Full eyelashes</li>
            <li> i would def buy these again, these are def ones you cant re use over and over.they are one use only they look good on.</li>
            <li> They were okay , they both look very plasticky but they were 2$</li>
            <li> so natural people think that they&#x27;re my own</li>
            <li> many so if i messed up i wouldnt really care.</li>
            <li> but once they&#x27;re applied they actually look good.</li>
            <li> Good if you starting out with falesie</li>
            <li> I do a living doll dress up at least twice a week, and these are perfect.</li>
            <li> I love them so much</li>
            <li> These hold up much better than t Sally&#x27;s lashes because of what my daughter wants them for.</li>
            <li> Take good care of them if you want to get multiple wears out of each pair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very inexpensive you get 20 pairs for so cheap!</li>
            <li> good product at low price</li>
            <li> Everything was good only thing was shopping took forever</li>
            <li> Not a bad product.</li>
            <li> She loves them and the quality is not bad</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price, wish they came with glue.</li>
            <li> Not bad for cost, either.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product</li>
            <li> Not a bad buy.</li>
            <li> And these eyelashes are not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> not bad.</li>
            <li> Price was not bad</li>
            <li> They are very comfortable and I would recommend these lashes especially since they are very cheap</li>
            <li> The regular lashes are perfect and easy to blend in with your natural ones to make them look real.</li>
            <li> The thinner ones look great when I cut the m in half :)  too much for every day for me!</li>
            <li> Awesome lashes easy to use and long lasting.</li>
            <li> very nice, good quality lashes---- came MUCH later than expected, though.</li>
            <li> liked these especially the thinner ones for day they were also easy for me to apply.</li>
            <li> They are nice looking lashes but were a little to lengthy- very easy to cut and shorten to fit my eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually do reviews, but these lashes were an amazing deal!!</li>
            <li> You cannot expect the best lashes at such a low price, so I&#x27;m not totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> love these falsies :) it&#x27;s easier to work with than other eyelashes for some reason :)</li>
            <li> Looks and feels cheap right away.</li>
            <li> the big full lashes 5 out of 5!!!</li>
            <li> They are easy to place and this was the first time I used eyelashes</li>
            <li> They go on pretty easily</li>
            <li> but I think that the thicker set will be awesome for costumes, parties, special events or for fun in general for when I want an extra oomph to my eyes.</li>
            <li> He only reason they got two stars is because you get so many of them for a very cheap price.</li>
            <li> The only reason it got two stars was because there are so many of them for very cheap.</li>
            <li> Big user of lashes and these are great if you are needing a large amount for a cheer or dance team.</li>
            <li> Other than that its a great christmas gift for my friend.</li>
            <li> Amazing hot priced deals will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> You have to cut to adjust, but other then that, great lashes.</li>
            <li> I received only the natural ones but nice quality 4 the price ! :-)</li>
            <li> Other than that its a great christmas gift for my friend.</li>
            <li> but for someone experienced in false lashes, I think these would be pretty good.</li>
            <li> hmmm, maybe for Christmas or New Years Eve! :)</li>
            <li> So obviously, your buying in bulk for really really cheap, meaning one or two eyelashes occasionally in the box may be stiffer, or not in place when your package arrives, but overall for the price you cant complain, they are easy to bend to the shape of your eye, and re-usable which is even more great!</li>
            <li> I would recommend investing in something quality worthy.</li>
            <li> I love them and will order more in the future!</li>
            <li> Received  them quickly.</li>
            <li> they dont fit ur eye you got to cut them to  adjust to ur eye lids took 3weeks to come in supper fast from china material was cheap</li>
            <li> Lashes shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Curling these with a lash curler and applying mascara makes them look more realistic.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me I already had glue for them.</li>
            <li> It should however be mentioned in bold caps for those anticipating delivery sooner.</li>
            <li> They are super durable and go on like a dream.</li>
            <li> they are so cute the big ones are kinda cute</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s a bold look or not.</li>
            <li> They are quiet cheap and the lashes aren&#x27;t as nice as I thought.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t expect anything super fancy...</li>
            <li> , I can always get more and I will be getting more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> The product shipped and arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the thinner ones but for the price they serve a quick purpose...</li>
            <li> They are super flexible.  </li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe is how quickly they arrived.</li>
            <li> So to update my last post, I finally tried on the thicker ones and they are SO PERFECT.</li>
            <li> Lift up quickly on the eyelid, I feel like I need to super glue them</li>
            <li> Style number two looked more realistic to me than style one.</li>
            <li> The lashes were super plastic.</li>
            <li> Style 2 is definitely so natural looking and feel so real and look good.</li>
            <li> I can MAYBE use 2/20 pairs if I am lucky.</li>
            <li> Delivered quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> They clean off easily and apply without much hassle.</li>
            <li> I got these and was super disapointed.  </li>
            <li> These lashes came in 2 weeks from asia to US which is really quick to me.</li>
            <li> The thinner ones on the photo give a much more realistic style, and the thicker ones are probably ones I&#x27;d wear on Halloween or something.</li>
            <li> Luckily, the eyelashes weren&#x27;t squished or ruined.</li>
            <li> When you pull them out of the container, the end parts have no lashes and are longer so you just do a quick trim of the ends, then put your glue on and apply.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Super , SUPER lightweight.  </li>
            <li> I love these eye lashes definitely buying more</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> When I run out I most definitely will get more from them.  </li>
            <li> But delivery was quick</li>
            <li> really think these are great, and they arrived way earlier then the &amp;#34;estimated time&amp;#34; and they arrived in tact.</li>
            <li> AMAZING PRODUCT FOR SUCH A CHEAP PRICE.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly as well.</li>
            <li> , I can always get more and I will be getting more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> Ok for the price definitely not human hair they are man made but still ok for the price I still got to use them.</li>
            <li> Quick email replies.</li>
            <li> I love both styles of lashes, but I can&#x27;t try them on yet because I have to buy glue, but other than that I am very excited to get to try these on!</li>
            <li> Super cheap, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t wear these daily because they are very costumey, instead I&#x27;ll be ok on Halloween lashes for the rest of my life!!</li>
            <li> Love the Price, Love the Natural looking lashes they blend easily with my natural lashes.</li>
            <li> If you clean and store them right</li>
            <li> I tried the natural looking lashes the other day, and they were perfect!</li>
            <li> These are perfect to use over and over again not just once love the thick ones and the other ones I wear on a daily basis good job!</li>
            <li> I tried the natural looking lashes the other day, and they were perfect!</li>

            <li> They look very pretty.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in a dark bar they look great.</li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy again and very happy with the lashes even if you can only use them once they are worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victoria</li>
            <li> some kind of fun party but for everyday style 2 is amazing.</li>
            <li> not what i am use to, and sure as hell do not stick on with normal eyelash glue.</li>
            <li> Although they are very pretty lashes.</li>
            <li> Beware: very very longggg!</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re pretty comfortable</li>
            <li> , more natural lashes (Style 2) are my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> Very pretty</li>
            <li> Thank you soooo very much! (:</li>
            <li> with all that the price is really good and the shipping did not take that long.</li>
            <li> I chose rating because delivery took long price was good</li>
            <li> The price was low and it seemed too good to be true at first, but when I received them they met my expectations beyond.</li>
            <li> The actual product is not bad, it has pretty good quality</li>
            <li> they are not hard and i love the quality.</li>
            <li> Super quick delivery and for the price worth buying</li>
            <li> I use DUO LASH GLUE which is very good glue, but not very good with these type lashes.</li>
            <li> This was the second order I brought because I loved it very much.</li>
            <li> Perfect combo of lush lashes for elegant affairs and simple lashes for regular nights out</li>

            <li> super fun</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive &amp; easy to apply.</li>
            <li> These lashes don&#x27;t go on easily and don&#x27;t bend very well.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good for first falsies, definitely use with mascara!</li>
            <li> They were so easy to apply, and the material was so real.</li>

            <li> Will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for!</li>

            <li> they last me more than one use and thats what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not mad</li>
            <li> and so much cheaper then one pair !!</li>
            <li> i really don&#x27;t know why i did!!</li>
            <li> Also, since I&#x27;m asian and my lashes are pretty puny, these are a great item to really enhance your eyes.</li>
            <li> Really pretty!</li>
            <li> The only thing I do wish is that they could have a bit more flexibility in them (they seem to want to retain their bowed shape and not bend easily to the shape of your eyelid).</li>
            <li> but I kinda wasn&#x27;t surprised they were very cheap</li>
            <li> They are very light and not heavy like the plastic band lashes</li>
            <li> I love them and how super cheap they are, I just wish I knew how to put them on properly!</li>
            <li> I was really surprised to get these lashes, they are full and lush and so many for such a great price.</li>
            <li> Very good quality , now I can wear lashes everyday without spending so much $.</li>
            <li> In love with these falses, style 2 blends nicely with your natural lashes and style 1 gives you just the right amount of bold for your night out, I always come back for these lashes</li>
            <li> They are beautiful and look amazing on the eye with out being too over dramatic! ♡</li>
            <li> They can be hard to get up to your lash line but tweezers come in handy for that kind of stuff.</li>
            <li> but that wasn&#x27;t a big deal because I have an amazing lash glue.</li>
            <li> you have to really  work with them to make them fit the curve of your eye</li>
            <li> Great for everyday or a girls night out</li>
            <li> I think they are really light which doesn&#x27;t bother me because then you don&#x27;t feel them as much.</li>
            <li> Thank you just got it a few days ago, looks great</li>
            <li> but I can honestly say I will be making more in the near future.</li>
            <li> I would rather pay up to ten dollars on a really amazing set of lashes</li>
            <li> Fast shipping but the lashes are not design correctly to fit almond eyes.</li>
            <li> so i wanted to buy cheap, cuz i really dont wear them often.</li>
            <li> I really liked the regular ones since they look more natural.</li>
            <li> the lashes were boxed up, but the box was smashed in shipping, this didn&#x27;t stop the lashes from still being amazing though, especially for the price...</li>
            <li> It came about a few days before the date it was suppose to rang to come from, which was great because I had forgotten</li>
            <li> Some lashes have an uneven stitch, but besides that this was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Cheap ass eyelashes very plastic</li>
            <li> Amazing, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> , they feel very plastic like and are itchy if not trimmed to tailor fit to your eye shape.</li>
            <li> I was nervous because of the price, but these actually turned out better then expected, great for the price and reusable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the &amp;#34;Style 2&amp;#34; lashes and they work amazing.</li>
            <li> Fun for dress up cosplay stuff.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the wait on shipping.</li>
            <li> Worth it for the money</li>
            <li> they are the same length of my own lashes.</li>
            <li> well worth the money...will buy again if needed.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> They came earlier than expected which was awesome.</li>
            <li> but so worth the wait.</li>
            <li> The price was worth it.</li>
            <li> but it was worth it</li>
            <li> Definetly worth price!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased several sets and my daughters are loving theirs as well.</li>
            <li> You will most likely have to trip these so that they fit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;#1 is kind of big</li>
            <li> They are more natural.</li>
            <li> Have to cut them to size, but for this price, worth it.</li>
            <li> I love love love them, so for the price it was worth at least seeing what style 2 looked like.  </li>
            <li> Fun to use as play makeup, or in a costume, or just for that every day look, lots of them tool</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d say its worth the buy.</li>
            <li> At first you have to train them in order to fit your eyes exact shape.</li>
            <li> Ok not quit sure what I expected</li>
            <li> But not horrible, and they can pass as natural.</li>
            <li> Anybody who&#x27;s a make up artist and cosmetology expert like me will know that these lashes are too cheap, not even human hair and can&#x27;t even wear more than 2 times.</li>
            <li> all there worth the price and wait .</li>
            <li> I love them, theres really natural looking ones</li>
            <li> they are worth your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> But they are worth keeping around to have.</li>
            <li> this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love the natural lashed.</li>
            <li> They looked natural :) every time I wear them I get complemented.</li>
            <li> so far i haven&#x27;t been able to wear these lashes.</li>
            <li> Although it takes about 3 weeks to receive, its worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> it was worth the buy</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> They are worth the value.</li>
            <li> I liked them , you get 40 in total for around 5 bucks</li>
            <li> Not real, however good for a night out.  </li>
            <li> Better when scene from a distance, I wouldn&#x27;t use for professional makeup.</li>
            <li> I got them - came in handy at the last dance competition!</li>
            <li> its worth the price</li>
            <li> I love the natural eyelashes..</li>
            <li> They feel soft and pliable which, I am sure, will facilitate ease when I put them on.</li>
            <li> So, if you don&#x27;t mind waiting 3-4 weeks for delivery, I think the price/quality combination is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get them but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> SOOO WORTH</li>
            <li> and I got my monies worth.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you are going for a more natural look</li>
            <li> The thin lashes are the best..</li>
            <li> they aren&#x27;t worth the investment</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re definitely not the kind you buy at a beauty supply store</li>
            <li> Really long across and cheaply made and don&#x27;t stick well even with glue that normally sticks good with my walmart falsies.</li>
            <li> worth the money were for five day and replace them</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li> They are so fun to wear.</li>
            <li> totally worth buying.</li>
            <li> so i guess it was worth it.</li>
            <li> worth the price.</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;re fun.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> , I love what I see so far</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of time for them to arrive but, it&#x27;s was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Definitely a great item to add to my personal &amp; professional makeup kits.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not worth the price they advertise</li>
            <li> But the natural lashes are okay.</li>
            <li> Shopping took some time but was well worth the wait for the price.</li>
            <li> worth the wait</li>
            <li> with that said they are worth what you pay honestly.&lt;br /&gt;(good</li>
            <li> The more natural looking lashes were the ones I preferred over the thicker ones.</li>
            <li> I only needed to trim the ends where it&#x27;s held in place in the box and kind of \\&quot;wave\\</li>
            <li> Style one would be fun to wear for pictures or halloween or</li>
            <li> They are worth the cost.</li>
            <li> but again worth the price.</li>
            <li> They will definitely will come in handy.  </li>
            <li> its worth the wait</li>
            <li> These lashes are fun to play with.</li>
            <li> u must believe me it worth it</li>
            <li> It was worth it.</li>
            <li> good only if you want add on dolls,because if you actually wear,make sure to look like a fool.</li>
            <li> There were diffedently a lot of eyelashes in the box, but one thing that&#x27;s kind of essential is the glue which is not included.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re fun to wear.</li>
            <li> and they look more natural.</li>
            <li> but I have many to practice with for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> but it was well worth the wait..</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I found it useful because you can use one for the day and the ticker ones for night.</li>
            <li> than that, they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li> Took forever to come but worth it</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re worth it</li>
            <li> I figured it was worth waiting for.</li>
            <li> Worth it</li>
            <li> and I think they will be fun to use.  </li>
            <li> Go more natural and get reg.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes came sooner than expected and my sister loved them (and she&#x27;s picky about lashes)</li>
            <li> but for the price it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> Now me and my friends have lashes when we decide to Cleopatra ourselves up on fun girls nights.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are a good deal if you have time to mess with them but by no means are they user friendly.</li>
            <li> So worth every penny i paid for them</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> But for the price they were pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Would purchase again for fun my boyfriend like them</li>
            <li> but overall they were fun nice price.</li>
            <li> they didn&#x27;t work as good as expected.</li>
            <li> It depends on a person&#x27;s personal preference, if anything try em&#x27; and you&#x27;ll end up loving them.</li>
            <li> so worth the $$.</li>
            <li> but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> For the price of $3 it&#x27;s really worth it for the 20 pairs.</li>
            <li> so they look a bit more natural.</li>
            <li> so they were worth that $$.</li>
            <li> I NEED A DIFFERENT KIND OF GLUE,OR</li>
            <li> I expected for the price, that these lashes would not be good.</li>
            <li> but it was worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> For the price, they&#x27;re definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> they looked better when I put on mascara and almost natural.</li>
            <li> well maybe it might not be worth it to get it</li>
            <li> I like the more natural looking ones.</li>
            <li> It was still worth it though</li>
            <li> The lashes are nice ans shiny and they last.  </li>
            <li> but I almost like them more than the natural set.</li>
            <li> but it wad worth the wait.</li>
            <li> but so worth the price</li>
            <li> I love these lashes, my only complaint would be is that you have to make them for your eye, they aren&#x27;t shaped already for your eye...other than that they are a great deal and reusable!</li>
            <li> I love both of them, especially for the cheap price.</li>
            <li> but well worth the $3.00.</li>
            <li> I used the darker ones and they look natural and are really cute  </li>
            <li> For the price, I think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product so far.</li>
            <li> It was worth the wait fir the lashes.</li>
            <li> YOURSELF CAN BE WORTH IT.  </li>
            <li> Not bad, first time buying these things.</li>
            <li> There cheap so you can&#x27;t expect super high quality eyelashes</li>
            <li> I love my lashes one thing wish naturals were a little fuller thick ones r vere nice good price too!</li>
            <li> Product came in a little over two weeks, they are very nice.</li>
            <li> they last long, you can reuse them, they are easy to put on, looks great.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t natural looking and take some getting used to the plastic band feel but other than that it is great to have a bulk of do able lashes ready for you at hand</li>
            <li> I surprising liked the more dramatic looking lashes over the natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li> Got the lashes sooner than expected the packaging was fine despite the long journey the lashes fit great  </li>
            <li> They are very easy to put on, but make sure you snip the ends since there are little pieces on each side to make them stay in the cases they are in.</li>
            <li> Shipping was the only problem i had with this product i still gave it 5 stars because for the low price you pay to receive 2 packs of lashes is a really good deal!</li>
            <li> Considering they were coming from overseas, shipping was pretty quick...</li>
            <li> For being shipped from China, this got to me pretty quickly too.</li>
            <li> Came pretty quick, I wish it came with adhesive.</li>
            <li> They shipped pretty quick.</li>
            <li> Shipped pretty quickly considering they came all the way from China.</li>
            <li> If you want you can cut the darker set of lashes into different styles of lashes to make it look more unique and they&#x27;re reusable if you take care of them right.</li>
            <li> r super easy to lift and doesnt look natural</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply and so natural looking.</li>
            <li> , I use them to perfection will ask nothing other good brands.</li>
            <li> Other then that I loved them.</li>
            <li> They look and feel just as good as any other brand I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Other wise I like them.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get these since you really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Other wise product works likebit should.</li>
            <li> Look relatively real, and definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind if they&#x27;re too long because I can always cut them, and have plenty more to use!</li>
            <li> When we go to the store she gets a lot of good compliments and a lot of stares and whispers from other people.</li>
            <li> But other than that, It was a good buy, I got 20 eyelashes for $3.</li>
            <li> The quality is really good they can be worn just like other lashes.</li>
            <li> everyone was right on the shipping my box was so cramped in the envelope</li>
            <li> 1-5 day use each if u use them right</li>
            <li> The price was right for the amount of lashes received, not gonna complain there.</li>
            <li> However, with the right glue, and application process anyone can make these work.</li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> Right now I will give it 4 stars for the packaging.</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re plastic and just don&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li> I just wish they got my order right.</li>
            <li> The price was right</li>
            <li> The glue slid right off.</li>
            <li> The picture on the right is NOT what came in the mail...</li>
            <li> If you position it right, it can be the curve for eye liner.</li>
            <li> The price is right and the lashes are reusable.  </li>
            <li> Almost seems like they are all made for the right eye.</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> the price is definitely right</li>
            <li> the right look too fake/plastic to even bother with)</li>
            <li> product is manageable and can be flattering when used the right way.</li>
            <li> You also need to cut off the long ends, but most makeup artists clip the lashes to fit their client&#x27;s eyes, so</li>
            <li> the dramatic sets,they r perfect</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve also trimmed them to fit my particular desires for the day&#x27;s look.</li>
            <li> I wanted something dramatic so these were perfect.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look to dramatic they look good.!!!</li>
            <li> The dramatic lashes is perfect for nighttime.  </li>
            <li> Love the mi could go full out dramatic,or girl next door.</li>
            <li> These are sooo pretty and much more natural looking than they are in the photos.</li>
            <li> One thing I did notice (not a bad thing) is that, if you look closely, the lashes on the &#x27;upper tier&#x27; of the boxes appear to be just a tad shorter than the ones on the &#x27;lower tier&#x27;-- when you hold the boxes with the 3 rows at the top and the 2 rows below the writing on the bottom.</li>
            <li> What is good, it is too long, with you very uncomfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Loved them but took too long to get here but thanks(;</li>
            <li> They were very easy to clean, and I figure I can get at least two or three more uses out the the pair I used.</li>
            <li> They were very easy to clean, and I figure I can get at least two or three more uses out the the pair I used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love they came early and there is so many different choices in sizes was worth the money.</li>
            <li> They also aren&#x27;t natural human hair which is ok, but they look too &#x27;CHEAP&#x27; REALLY REALLY CHEAP.  </li>
            <li> they are so cute and the natural ones look great, and i am definitely using the larger ones for parties and events&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> They are cute and come in a large enough size that they can fit my eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The thicker ones are a little thick to me, but it&#x27;s great for parties and also great for demi-lashes if you cut them in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With enough glue and black eyeliner,  they look great!</li>
            <li> I always cut my eyelashes in half and just where them on the edges of my eves, so I am now stalked forever with such great quality lashes!</li>
            <li> Easily trimmed to your eye shape, and so cheap, you can buy multiple packs and not worry about having to reuse lashes.</li>
            <li> I only paid less than $4.00 for these lashes which it great!</li>
            <li> I love dat BIG BOLD GLAM LOOK.YASSSS GOD.</li>
            <li> Since they&#x27;re so cheap, I don&#x27;t really have the time to clean them to reuse, I just use a new one each time.  </li>
            <li> These are a great buy if you want to learn how to apply false lashes, they&#x27;re very inexpensive and you can practice many times without feeling wasteful.</li>
            <li> I am loving having so many lash changes for such a low price!  </li>
            <li> So fun and pretty to wear.  </li>
            <li> I was a newcomer to lashes and was curious about these, so when I recieved them in the mail i was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Given the price, i guess thats exactly what they are worth.</li>
            <li> I loved them and got here earlier than I expected them to I love</li>
            <li> The crowd favorite is the second, more natural style.</li>
            <li> but i at least expected to be able to wear them even if they weren&#x27;t of the best material.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love these lashes, I&#x27;m a makeup artist, and honestly these are better than some of the expensive lashes I&#x27;ve had to buy.</li>
            <li> Got a lot of lashes for a small price, Great deal.</li>
            <li> The thinner lashes were nice but the thicker ones were way too long.</li>
            <li> They are kind of long.</li>
            <li> They blend well with my own eyelashes because I already have long curly eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Other than that they stay on pretty good.</li>
            <li> These eye lashes were decent for both a natural or more bold look.</li>
            <li> They both are equally long and the quality is nice for what you pay for.</li>
            <li> These are great, arrive quickly from China via USPS, very full, and I&#x27;ll never buy retail for fake lashes again.</li>
            <li> They do need to be bent a little bit before putting them on to fit the curve of your eyelid other than that they&#x27;re awesome!</li>
            <li> They did the job , I&#x27;m new to using eye lashes but my fiance liked the look of them and he usually doesn&#x27;t like this kind of stuff .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to just spend a little bit more  $$$ and get quality lashes</li>
            <li> so I use those for a little thickening on days when I need to look more uppity but the style 1 set is my favorite.</li>
            <li> They are the perfect size and have a little bit left at the edges</li>
            <li> recommend spending a little more and getting a better product.</li>
            <li> First off these were extremly afffordable got here earlier than they said i love them and they look so natural i willbe rdering like alot more of these like 10 for like 11 bucks</li>
            <li> The thicker lashes work really well for photos or events, whereas the more natural ones are suitable for daily wear.</li>
            <li> very fast service nice quality extremely long though</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, they are a little thicker than I&#x27;d like but still very easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the more natural style and they were super pretty and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> thick ones sit funny but are ok the lighter ones i love!</li>
            <li> I have always had to trim lashes and I never get them on right the first time</li>
            <li> GOOD QUALITY FOR THE PRICE PLUS FAST SHIPPING ARRIVED BEFORE I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> really like the more natural looking ones ..</li>
            <li> and you only have these left to use lol.</li>
            <li> Soft to touch and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> These eyeborws look wondeful online, but when you get them in your hand forget it.&lt;br /&gt;You want an eyelash that is going to blend in with the natural hairs of your eyelashes, not plastic on top of real hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I waited forever for these lashes but it was worth the wait, i personally like the thicker ones better tho</li>
            <li> Great for theatrical use as well as daily wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not the most comfortable eye lashes, but should be expected considering the price.</li>
            <li> came a whole month early, i love these.</li>
            <li> Just lke they look in da pic.they or soft &amp; supa easy to apply ad take off as well .they</li>
            <li> Great quality, cuter than the more expensive ones that i find in stores.</li>
            <li> I really order these for myself as i like to create artistic looks with makeup.</li>
            <li> the more natural looking ones really make your lashes look fuller</li>
            <li> If you want a more natural look, then go for the thinner eyelashes, but if you want some very voluminous lashes.....</li>
            <li> I easily make these work because I use professional glue.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, BETTER!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with such a savings seeing that in my local beauty supply store, just one pair is 2.99 when I got 20 pairs for 2.09 to be exact.</li>
            <li> If yours are more so straight when you put them on, just take a eyelash curler to them and they look pretty even though they don&#x27;t look as natural</li>
            <li> i love the long lashes and the natural lashes are ok.</li>
            <li> They feel really stiff and cheap and wouldn&#x27;t stick on my lids with any kind of glue that I tried to use.</li>
            <li> Definitely going to come back and purchase more!!</li>
            <li> when I got them I expected better but after applying a few coats of mascara they look spectacular :)</li>
            <li> Lastly, the spaces and thickness of the darker lashes is very cheap looking on your eyes.</li>
            <li> But like them very much</li>
            <li> So shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Very very cheap, obviously</li>
            <li> I have yet to try the thick ones, but the regular ones were perfect for a more natural makeup look.</li>
            <li> very much Looking forward to cooperate</li>
            <li> The shipment was very fast too.</li>
            <li> I loved them very flexible and easy to put on even when they were thick</li>
            <li> so u need to be good and play a little</li>
            <li> they look real on me &amp; they are pretty!</li>
            <li> However, they were good quality just needed to be trimmed a little bit.</li>
            <li> they come without glue, and are too long, so you have to cut them a bit to fit your eyes besides that their fine.</li>
            <li> The less dense ones are great, very natural looking.</li>
            <li> The full more dramatic lashes are amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great just a little harder to put on in my opinion without the sticky residue that already come on most lashes.</li>
            <li> so getting so much for so cheap when i use them almost daily is a huge plus</li>
            <li> Exactly as I saw it on the Internet. ..</li>
            <li> No its not human hair but they cute.</li>
            <li> If you have been to the store to buy eyelashes than you know that they are pretty pricey.</li>
            <li> They also can be worn more than once because they do last</li>
            <li> u use them , still like it but to much work !</li>
            <li> hassle at first</li>
            <li> there are so many mixed reviews about these lashes but if you are a pro like me these are helpful</li>
            <li> The make my eyes and make up really pop out!</li>
            <li> They are more of plastic then actual hair</li>
            <li> Definitely buying more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally ordering more.</li>
            <li> Had to cut them short because they were long, but they are great.</li>
            <li> The first box arrived smooshed so some of the eyelashes were out of shape and</li>
            <li> The thinner set look so real!</li>
            <li> I have purchased all brands, katy perry, elf , ardell etc and most lashes are the same thing.!!</li>
            <li> It was my first time purchasing eyelashes and the first Time I put them on me.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I am overall pleased with these lashes.</li>
            <li> they are not difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> At First,</li>
            <li> I guess I thought they&#x27;d be more like human lashes</li>
            <li> I was worried about these at first but they&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li> I have received better lashes for the same price.</li>
            <li> They did their job and made me pretty</li>
            <li> definitely continue purchasing more from now on.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> but over all they work pretty well</li>
            <li> THANK YOU SO MUCH!</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY REPURCHASING!!! :)</li>
            <li> I really did not like these lashes!</li>
            <li> Love them and they will last me for a while</li>
            <li> When I first opened they look beutiful</li>
            <li> This is a first time purchase for me</li>
            <li> They go on great and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad these were only a couple bucks.</li>
            <li> They come looking exactly like the picture.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of fake eyelashes and these are some of the best and cheapest.</li>
            <li> I bought these at first</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s an ok purchased</li>
            <li> but at that price it should&#x27;ve been expected order at ur own risk</li>
            <li> I can choose simple or flirty:)</li>
            <li> They stay on pretty well.</li>
            <li> I also gave it a three because it took a long time to arrive and it vexed me a great deal that my cell phone number was on the outside of the package underneath my address.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t look that natural, but they were cheap and somewhat did the job.</li>
            <li> We both love them and would definitely would buy them again.</li>
            <li> First of all, I ordered these lashes September 25 because I wanted them for Halloween.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like these!</li>
            <li> I love that they are two different one two pick from.</li>
            <li> They look exactly like they do in the picture.  </li>
            <li> They are working pretty well.</li>
            <li> Most definitely going to stock up on these!!</li>
            <li> Definitely going to reorder some more.</li>
            <li> They came exactly as shown in the photo.</li>
            <li> It however didn&#x27;t affect the lashes and I&#x27;m overall pleased.</li>
            <li> I would purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> FIRST OF ALL THESE EYELASHES COST</li>
            <li> BECAUSE MOST LIKELY THEY ARE BENT WHEN I GET UP</li>
            <li> imagine they would looks somewhat ok, if she was to indeed actually put them on.</li>
            <li> Have to cut the extra stem , but still love them 😎</li>
            <li> First off let me say these lashes are soooo pretty.</li>
            <li> Also, taking glue off after I use them is an absolute challenge!</li>
            <li> I was pleased to receive package earlier than promised.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and look fabulous.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what the seller said they would be</li>
            <li> GOT MANY COMPLIMENTS WOULD DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN.  </li>
            <li> You get exactly what they say you will get.</li>
            <li> I am always pleased and have ordered about 4 different packs of these now.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t exactly look like the pictures.</li>
            <li> but they look pretty and make your eyes stand out</li>
            <li> so be aware shipping could take awhile.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more of the thinner ones .</li>
            <li> Came exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> If these were excellent fake lashes, I would not complain.  </li>
            <li> i wish i did not buy them in the first place.</li>
            <li> I hope to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I always receive them earlier than it claims on the item, so satisfied with that as well.</li>
            <li> you should be able to re-use for several days.</li>
            <li> Overall i am pleased with my service.</li>
            <li> but they are exactly like the ones in the picture.</li>
            <li> I really like the thicker ones!</li>
            <li> They look cheap and are to long, they don&#x27;t fit across your lash line.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> so the boxes were kind of crushed</li>
            <li> Makes your eyes really pop out !</li>
            <li> ;) *</li>
            <li> I always buy more when I run low</li>
            <li> the thinner ones look nice when you wear them with minimal makeup.</li>
            <li> First off, the eye lashes came in a squished up box and some of them were damaged and un-useable.</li>
            <li> Absolute re-buy!</li>
            <li> And you also see in the picture exactly what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> Thanks, again!</li>
            <li> They should blend in, otherwise you&#x27;d be looking pretty ratchet.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the wait for the product , they are exactly what i was expecting .</li>
            <li> i first used them during a dance recital that i had to do, and then, i also used them on my one sister that does modeling.</li>
            <li> the most loveliest lashes this will be the only one I get now on.</li>
            <li> It is pretty tricky getting them on, but probably easier with practice.</li>
            <li> You get exactly what you see.</li>
            <li> These were great quality &amp; arrived earlier than expected; definitely worth ordering</li>
            <li> I really need to buy another set!</li>
            <li> Mine came exactly as pictured; one set of the thicker and one of the thinner ones.</li>
            <li> I love the lite ones, it looks close to human lashes.</li>
            <li> Came before expected time so that&#x27;s always nice.</li>
            <li> The thinner-looking ones make you look like you just have naturally long-looking eyelashes, and the bolder ones make you look fabulous.</li>
            <li> The box was kind of crushed inside the bubble envelope, but the products weren&#x27;t ruined.</li>
            <li> They are exactly how they look in the picture.</li>
            <li> These came a lot earlier than expected and were so beautiful when I got them.</li>
            <li> My first time buying eyelashes.</li>
            <li> First off it took a month to get here</li>
            <li> Definitely recommended on if you&#x27;re looking to save money and look fabulous!</li>
            <li> but, if I did I would probably choose something of a higher quality.</li>
            <li> although they are pretty lashes it just wasnt anything that i suspected</li>
            <li> Exactly like the picture.  </li>
            <li> but i defintley going to order more when i get low .</li>
            <li> Item came on time, you can create many looks with the different thickness of the eyelashes,ease to applying the eyelashes once you have gotten the hang of it,</li>
            <li> if it your first application</li>
            <li> Love them, been using them for a while and can&#x27;t get enough of them.</li>
            <li> Will more than likely buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Came exactly as pictured, but packing is flimsy</li>
            <li> I love to have both styles and make things different.</li>
            <li> get.&lt;br /&gt;The persons who are wearing them are pleased and still have several to wear and last for many months to go.</li>
            <li> what im used to but look forward to using them on a hot date night</li>
            <li> but they are very plasticky feeling!</li>
            <li> I also love how there are two different kinds of eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Spend a couple extra bucks and get a better quality one.  </li>
            <li> I was able to reuse these several times.</li>
            <li> I could have went to local beauty supply store for a better pair.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> but I love that they are solid</li>
            <li> is my first time using lashes</li>
            <li> Wore them for the first time today</li>
            <li> gave a 3 stars because the package arrive pretty squashed up making some of the lashes bent out of shape.</li>
            <li> I wish I could just buy style #2 because those are my personal favorite</li>
            <li> so when i came across this product i figured I try them out at first</li>
            <li> im sure since there only 2 $</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> Shipping was pretty goid too coming from overseas</li>
            <li> but they are pretty and reusable.</li>
            <li> and they are cheap and look natural</li>
            <li> Thank u! ;-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only $29 and is so much better than falsies, plus its 100%natural &amp; hypoallergenic</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m thinking to combine 2 of the simpler one in order to bring up the volume.&lt;br /&gt;you can go and find something nicer, if you wanna have a higher quality.</li>
            <li> I have even been able to reuse them several times without issues.</li>
            <li> u will look funny when wearing them</li>
            <li> If you often wear fake eyelashes this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Only wish they were a bit more bendy.</li>
            <li> So pretty for the nights you just want to doll up.</li>
            <li> I bet that&#x27;s why the price is able to stay low.</li>
            <li> I really like them!</li>
            <li> My first day wearin them, they fell off and wouldn&#x27;t stick.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> the title is pretty self explanatory.</li>
            <li> Definitely buying more.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what you would expect them to be.</li>
            <li> 2-3 pairs for the play that I was in but for daily street wear they are ok</li>
            <li> , the lashes are made more out of  plasticky material rather than actual hair.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and when i tried to cut the excess it was not cutting very well dont recommend theses</li>
            <li> these were my first lashes to ever buy and try to wear</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommend these lashes to me because she knows I&#x27;m starting to get more females asking me to do their makeup.</li>
            <li> I love them, and I will definitely be buying them again.</li>
            <li> And they are very itchy!</li>
            <li> but I still have many of them left.</li>
            <li> They fit well and look natural</li>
            <li> I use both on a daily basis and am ordering more.</li>
            <li> All the same wish had more of a variety</li>
            <li> However with time they last and held their form..I will reorder them for sure.</li>
            <li> but if you wrap the lashes around a pencil and hold them like that for several seconds then the shape becomes more rounded, and you will have to cut off the ends with scissors.</li>
            <li> Well first of all, the lashes look so plastic.</li>
            <li> but dont plan on ordering any more of these in the future</li>
            <li> I would purchase them again most definitely</li>
            <li> Just make sure to glue them well and possibly bring your glue with you to prevent them from falling off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once we received the first shipment and she me</li>
            <li> it looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend if you want tons of lashes for different make up styles and looks to pull off for a cheap price get them!</li>
            <li> I really like them a lot!</li>
            <li> They are very well made!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this product again. :)</li>
            <li> I will keep them in my lash stash but won&#x27;t be my first pick.</li>
            <li> ; the thinner lash set looks pretty natural&lt;</li>
            <li> will definitely be purchasing again :)</li>
            <li> at first I didn&#x27;t think I would like them</li>
            <li> i finally got these, and i love these.</li>
            <li> When i first read the reviews i thought</li>
            <li> Just exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> first I was worried about buying the thicker pairs</li>
            <li> Very plastic look until you put mascara on them!</li>
            <li> Stil have my first pair on</li>
            <li> Glad I got two different styles.</li>
            <li> all smiles when opening my package and it was exactly how it was described.</li>
            <li> I actually forgot I had them on...love them and the price I love the length of time</li>
            <li> but overall I do love these lashes</li>
            <li> really pretty .</li>
            <li> Good if you want to wear a costume, not for everyday.</li>
            <li> but I trashed few pairs learning to put them on but they are really good for the price..</li>
            <li> Weight wise though it seems like they are a bit heavy on my eyes</li>
            <li> even i have really good glue they dont stick because they are firm and doesnt shape..</li>
            <li> well i dont even have to wear eyeliner with these one they look clean an not messy !</li>
            <li> Took long to come but the lashes are nice and super soft</li>
            <li> the only reason i&#x27;m giving 2 stars is because you get 20 for super cheap.</li>
            <li> I received these in less than two weeks, and in great condition!&lt;br /&gt;They are soft.</li>
            <li> They have no flare, and are not super reusable, but they&#x27;re cute and cheap.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really going for super quality as much as I needed plenty of pairs to practice learning how to apply them correctly to my eyes.  </li>
            <li> the only thing is that theyre long and basically identical on both sides , so make sure you put the right eyelash on the right eye, and trim them right to fit.</li>
            <li> The more subtle lashes are pretty nice and blend in really well.</li>
            <li> The more natural looking set are really beautiful and wearable, both for parties and regular days when you feel like looking a little bit luxurious!</li>
            <li> These lashes would probably work if I have right glue, and another thing is I cannot get these to blend in with my real lashes.</li>
            <li> Too stiff and do not feel good on your eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that I can reuse the lashes a few times if I clean them properly.  </li>
            <li> CVS now stocks ARDELL, YUP, ARDELL, which is the only kind this professional will use from here on out!</li>
            <li> Had great variety on whether I wanted a natural look or more dramatic.  </li>
            <li> They definitely look super great , if you know how to apply them on , gives you a super fimenen look , specially for trans girls or anygirl , they loook really great inloveeeee , if you wanna go for a natural.look use the thin ones , if you wanna go for a smokey eye or to just get dolled up use thick ;)</li>
            <li> love the fact that there are so many of them and there are large ones and small ones to choose from</li>
            <li> I really love the new eyelashes, I love to mess around with makeup</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re pretty good lashes overall, the only issue with mine was that a couple of the lashes were pretty messed up and unusable.</li>
            <li> The styles are a bit dramatic for me, but they&#x27;re very good quality and the price is a steal.</li>
            <li> but other then that they wer amazing</li>
            <li> I purchased these a little while ago, got them early so thats great.</li>
            <li> Yes they are plastic and cheap but they come in cute little boxes.</li>
            <li> so am in love with the #1028 eyelashes and i will reccomend them to the people who love smokey eyes as well , the other pair which is #118 i will be using for like school days , day at a park , mall , places where you want a have more like a natural long eyelash look .</li>
            <li> The package was a bit smooshed in places, but I kind of expected that as it was shipped all the way from Hong Kong!</li>
            <li> The other ones look nice</li>
            <li> but other than that they were nice c:</li>
            <li> I cut up Style 2 because its a little much for me, but  I ordered this product twice because I loved the price.  </li>
            <li> When they come out of package , there straight lol  no curve , kinda hard to put on</li>
            <li> Very cheap, not natural, took forever to arrive.</li>
            <li> I love them, if you that kind of person that loooove being notice then wear the tick ones, i use them almost everyday, and i use the natural ones when i only wear eyeliner, they are handmade &amp; free shipping.</li>
            <li> Really it just depends on the glue you are using I guess.&lt;br /&gt;The natural ones are really light weight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so experienced with fake lashes, but I bought these because they were cheap and there is alot</li>
            <li> They do need trimmed but they look great and arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I got these in Style 2, which is the regular long ones and I must say THEY ARE AMAZING!</li>
            <li> One of the best values thus far for false lashes.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the heavy looking one but love the light one.</li>
            <li> so I will definitely be ordering some more real soon.</li>
            <li> I purchased both the regular and thick eyelashes and both were perfect.</li>
            <li> the only thing is if you get the free shipping it takes quite a while to get them but they are so worth it</li>
            <li> am so tickeled with this purchase, I simply can NOT say enough good things.  </li>
            <li> I get about 5 uses for each pair, only if take really good care of them, especially when your taking them off.</li>
            <li> So first, the product was delivered pretty fast considering the fact that it ships from China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also good to reuse for a little while also!</li>
            <li> When I first got them I was kind of let down.  </li>
            <li> but it doesnt make a difference :) on my picture, my left eye has the larger lashes, and my right eye has the more natural ones</li>
            <li> they are perfect either for everyday wear or the &amp;#34;dramatic&amp;#34; look, the only thing is you have to trim the sides to fit because they have long edges.</li>
            <li> I got most of my lashes bent, and they werent long enough to cover the whole eye like most do.</li>
            <li> These here also have the more full look that are thick and the thinner more natural look.</li>
            <li> The item was a little damaged but other than that it was perfect</li>
            <li> Super soft and wear well!</li>
            <li> They look nice but the part u glue on is little bigger then most</li>
            <li> These are super long so you will have to cut them to fit your eyes just like any pair of lashes.</li>
            <li> The thick eyelashes kind of came a little bend but just kind of curl them by bending and they will be fine.</li>
            <li> These are really sturdy and pretty.  </li>
            <li> They came pretty fast too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more for costume wear not classy events.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re very pretty and look natural!</li>
            <li> and when you first glimpse the eyelashes in the box they look really synthetic.</li>
            <li> and they barely bend to fit your eye.</li>
            <li> Arrived pretty fast.</li>
            <li> one set are cute ,long and simple.which</li>
            <li> They look really fake and cheap to be honest but they are cheap</li>
            <li> /&gt;they come off pretty straight</li>
            <li> Other than needing to adjust for my left eye they are great.</li>
            <li> this product is pretty much plastic.</li>
            <li> They come exactly like in the picture in 2 boxes and they were packaged very well.</li>
            <li> I still have them nd will be a long time until I buy more</li>
            <li> I love the different lengths on the lashes much like how I get them designed at the spa very flattering</li>
            <li> When you first see the lashes they look very cheap ( kinda expected based on the price)</li>
            <li> It comes with a pack of regular every day lashes and a pack of lashes for when you&#x27;re going for a night out on the town or special occasion!</li>
            <li> I will still use them because they are nice but just not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re into dramatic lashes and you are looking for some cheap ones, these are a good option for you.</li>
            <li> They were a decent quality and a very very low price considering one pair or slightly better quality ones can run anywhere from $4-$25 a pair.</li>
            <li> They are very shiny and pretty large</li>
            <li> Super dramatic lashes great for people who love that they are so wide you have to cut both ends</li>
            <li> I just love these lashes they arrived very quick and there are so many of them, natural, dramatic and fullness.</li>
            <li> The thicker lashes are very dramatic and perfect for an ultra glamorous night on the town.</li>
            <li> For them to be less than $5 they are amazing.</li>
            <li> the bigger lashes are a bit bulky but cute and the lighter lashes are fine just as long as you cut them to size</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t expect them to look super natural..</li>
            <li> This will be my first time considering I use red cherry eyelashes , I bought these because they were cheap .</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to apply and last all day.</li>
            <li> They were easy to use,I just snipped the extra strips on the side,applied the glue,and then the lashes.</li>
            <li> a nice line of eyeliner and black adhesive and pop them on.  </li>
            <li> I love love love the thick long ones, and the thin ones are nice to just more natural.</li>
            <li> I definitely like the way the lashes are made and how easy they are to work with.</li>
            <li> and they are very realistic.</li>
            <li> but u do have to buy your own adhesive which I&#x27;d suggest getting black</li>
            <li> they look super natural on and i can wear them to family events</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how quickly my order was shipped.  </li>
            <li> The thin ones are nice because you can coat them with mascara for a more realistic look.  </li>
            <li> these are pretty good lashes, for what i usd them for at least.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d be better off getting a single pair with the self adhesive.</li>
            <li> CVS HAS ARDELL IN A LARGE ASSORTMENT.</li>
            <li> I would certainly order this item again from amazon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this it is plastic pure plastic</li>
            <li> Will certainly buy again</li>
            <li> But yeah, I certainly got what I paid for here.</li>
            <li> They are pure plastic.</li>
            <li> Although they are of good quality and are plenty long enough even for the largest eyes the way that are packaged leaves them straight as a board when you remove them from the box.  </li>
            <li> So beautiful lasted me a long time and came in a little earlier highly recommend them going to buy more</li>
            <li> They are okay, but they really just don&#x27;t want to stay on for very long.</li>
            <li> the less obnoxious ones are nice haha.</li>
            <li> when I first got them, I thought there was absolutely no way that these lashes would blend with my own, but I was happily proved wrong.</li>
            <li> I love my new lashes!I can go heavy for an evening look or light for day</li>
            <li> fine/look fine in person if you cover the band well enough.</li>
            <li> These are surprisingly decent quality!</li>
            <li> So a decent product!</li>
            <li> The eyelashes were pretty decent considering the price for it, PLUS</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feel very high quality</li>
            <li> I also love that the smaller lashes are actually very natural looking and if applied correctly you can&#x27;t tell whether they&#x27;re real or not.</li>
            <li> These last all day dont look super fake and are great quality but probably have to be trimmed to fit.</li>
            <li> My glue sucks, so I haven&#x27;t been able to wear them out yet, but I think with some quality glue these would be fine.</li>
            <li> They are a little more fake looking (as far realistic looking falsies go) than the higher dollar ones but great customer service, fast shipping and very comfortable</li>
            <li> , they lay flat when you take them off the board, they dont stay curved for easy application&lt;</li>
            <li> and you barely feel them, I do like them specially for the price and quantity</li>
            <li> The more natural looking ones on the right are the only ones i&#x27;ve tried so far (Which is today) and my lashes look uh-may-zinggg!</li>
            <li> Also, make sure to carry/have scissors (specially when traveling) because they require that you cut off the ends before applying them; Not because they are too long, but because they have an extra piece on each side where they are attached to the box.</li>
            <li> The lighter ones are perfect for everyday wear as they don&#x27;t feel heavy .</li>
            <li> I love them they look nice not too expensive.</li>
            <li> Really I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much from them</li>
            <li> Dont cost much anyways why not buy it?</li>
            <li> I got 20 pairs for 3 bucks, so I can&#x27;t really say much.</li>
            <li> They are absolute junk</li>
            <li> I like the fact i didnt had to paid so much and got i lot for what i pay for thank you.</li>
            <li> but i really like them</li>
            <li> They work really well</li>
            <li> Really brings out the face.</li>
            <li> I will highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> fast shipping though</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t take too much longer to put on, but its not helpful if these start falling off within an hour or two.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes don&#x27;t even appear close to looking really.</li>
            <li> They look very plastic.</li>
            <li> They were very flimsy.</li>
            <li> Very cheap,too long,does not stay on,I rather get them done at the salon or stick to the name brands</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter how much its being sold for wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Very plastic-y feeling, made my eyes itch</li>
            <li> Do not be scared to buy this eyelashes they will save you  so much  money</li>
            <li> These lashes are so cheap and aren&#x27;t even made of human hair.</li>
            <li> Incognito much?</li>
            <li> so much cheaper than buying them from Sally&#x27;s and walmart.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to the shorter, thicker ones but they look really tacky.</li>
            <li> They arrived at my house very damaged.</li>
            <li> and you get a lot for such a cheap price</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t really use them.</li>
            <li> the item came in well pack and fast..</li>
            <li> Very affordable .</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t complain hahaha.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really love them to drag queen for me</li>
            <li> They look very anime-ish.</li>
            <li> I did not like so much.</li>
            <li> obviously they are cheap</li>
            <li> Got them fast considering they are from china...</li>
            <li> Not made of real hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them whole</li>
            <li> The eyelashes are plastic , I preffer paying the 5$ for a pair because they are so much easier to put on and stay on longer.</li>
            <li> but they really aren&#x27;t usable</li>
            <li> very plastic looking and feeling and don&#x27;t stay on too well.</li>
            <li> It really looks like your real lashes.  </li>
            <li> It has been almost a whole month</li>
            <li> Very plastic looking and feeling</li>
            <li> I apply eyelash glue to them (do not use real glue, and also the eyelash glue does not come in the set - so that will need to be purchased separate).</li>
            <li> I am used to a much thinner band.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes really suck....</li>
            <li> They are more for Halloween or drag queens.  </li>
            <li> i didnt like these they were to plastic feeling and dont work very well.</li>
            <li> they are too much in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I didnt use them much so</li>
            <li> I really like the Style 2</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like that you have to cut those extension things off</li>
            <li> I really like both sets of eye lashes but they are not reusable, I tried to wash them off but it damaged them</li>
            <li> It really depends on my mood.</li>
            <li> is very sparse there is a substantial amount of space in between the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If not, they are just too much.</li>
            <li> they are straight.</li>
            <li> I like to wear eyelashes that are almost like real hair.</li>
            <li> but I preference is real hair.</li>
            <li> They are made from plastic,  but when you have them on,  nobody could really tell.  </li>
            <li> Plus they don&#x27;t really stay on correctly.</li>
            <li> but the thin lashes are great.  </li>
            <li> TOOO much info for all to see.</li>
            <li> theyre straight.</li>
            <li> I had received this product extremely fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see any reason for these Lashes to take 49 days to ship.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that they don&#x27;t look very plastic</li>
            <li> lashes were synthetic and very unnatural looking.</li>
            <li> I really these eyelashes it even though I was a bit scared to purchase them because i didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li> i really like them&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re not even real hair</li>
            <li> The lashes themselves feel very plastic, which wasn&#x27;t an issue to me, but it might be someone else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very enthused to have received these eyelashes today.</li>
            <li> so I go through lashes fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks a bunch</li>
            <li> Also,  this item will be very helpful for you.</li>
            <li> They are plastic and not at all like real hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather buy real hair ones at Walmart any day.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely ♡ these eyelashes.</li>
            <li> And the heavier ones aren&#x27;t too much if you&#x27;re going out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product..</li>
            <li> but over all i really like it..</li>
            <li> They dont even look real at all .</li>
            <li> I really wish they would stay on for longer periods of time, but that might just be the glue I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be straight deff purchase again</li>
            <li> Lashes have the feel of real hair.</li>
            <li> Some have too much glue that you can see it</li>
            <li> Too much shine.</li>
            <li> they came really fast considering they came from hong kong or something...</li>
            <li> I recommend this to any girl who wants to save some money who also wear lashes alot.</li>
            <li> These come straight from China</li>
            <li> These are very affordable and sizable.  </li>
            <li> Really dont buy</li>
            <li> and they came fast.</li>
            <li> AND Yes this is a real person.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping..</li>
            <li> Lets just say they went straight to the trash.</li>
            <li> but they are a bit much..</li>
            <li> ALTHOUGH I DONT HAVE MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH EYELASHES</li>
            <li> These eyelashes really make my eyes pop</li>
            <li> Of course, if you know what you&#x27;re doing, you can cover the band up some without much problem.&lt;br /&gt;Dramatic</li>
            <li> Expected more but like price</li>
            <li> I really really really like these eyelashes  </li>
            <li> the eyelashes arent made with real hair or anything like they feel very plastic</li>
            <li> You have to curve the lashes to fit your eye prior to putting on this lash.  </li>
            <li> but she ended up liking them because she can gently wash and reuse them</li>
            <li> They take FOREVER to adhere to my eyes because they are heavier then real hair eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I imagine it&#x27;s much easier when they&#x27;re sharper.</li>
            <li> It will help them apply much easier.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The thinner looking ones (Style 2) really doesn&#x27;t do much unless you just don&#x27;t have eye lashes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look or feel like real lashes.  </li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve observed, they will give a really &amp;#34;dolly&amp;#34; effect.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving a 4 star because I have not used the light lashes yet.</li>
            <li> &amp; they really have no curve to them .</li>
            <li> without having to spend so much money to get</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> They look very costume-y.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes work really well</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re too straight.</li>
            <li> Like them a lot and very cheep</li>
            <li> doesnt look real,.</li>
            <li> When they arrived I was very please with the quality .</li>
            <li> Someone came up to me and asked me if they were real.</li>
            <li> Did not look real at all.</li>
            <li> Very hard/stiff lashes.</li>
            <li> But if you can keep them bent, maybe tie them around a ping pong ball or something until you&#x27;re ready to use them..</li>
            <li> /&gt;SO REAL, I RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> thank you soo much for letting me buy these.</li>
            <li> Just wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting they looked really really cheap,I won&#x27;t be buying agin but thank you..</li>
            <li> I really wish I didn&#x27;t buy these.</li>
            <li> I personally do not like the lashes because the quality seems cheap</li>
            <li> And also feel like straight plastic.</li>
            <li> up to 3 times!Shipping was fast and there was no damage to the product or packaging when it arrived.</li>
            <li> The section that attaches to the eye, is very stuff.</li>
            <li> Such a cheap quality I still haven&#x27;t used them.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really work well though because they aren&#x27;t fitted to the curved eye shape.</li>
            <li> but otherwise they&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li> Very plastic looking when you apply them</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> But I will have to see just how dramtic the look really is.</li>
            <li> It was also a really fast shipping i received them wihtin a week.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with the product received, there just was not much indication when it was ordered that product was being sent from china.  </li>
            <li> I really wish they would stay on for longer periods of time, but that might just be the glue I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was really fast, recieved a week</li>
            <li> The thin lashes are great</li>
            <li> They are very plastic, but that&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> They do feel much more &amp;#34;plastic-y&amp;#34; than the lashes I am used to, but that&#x27;s to be expected for this price.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Band is too thin but for a price this is surely a win..</li>
            <li> They looked like my real eyelashes.</li>
            <li> And you get a whole bunch.  </li>
            <li> The box was really squished, and not all of they eyelashes were in their designated spots.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t even for real eyes.</li>
            <li> but I just don&#x27;t like the fact that the hair isn&#x27;t real hair.</li>
            <li> Real hair is my prefrence though.</li>
            <li> Also They weren&#x27;t real eyelashes</li>
            <li> Way better than expected.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care too much for the thinner ones, which I am going to give to my sister, since she doesn&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; look for eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> they aren&#x27;t real hair</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> fast thank you</li>
            <li> Also, my eyes are almond shape and these do not bend to shape your eye very well.</li>
            <li> they weren&#x27;t really curly</li>
            <li> Arrived crushed, but everything was still ok.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t real of course.</li>
            <li> Very noticeable.</li>
            <li> These lashes are a really affordable purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like the thicker ones.</li>
            <li> I find they&#x27;re much easier to put on.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really use them much</li>
            <li> They are very lightweight which I like</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> and of course you have to cut them to fit your eye seeing as no one has the same shape eye.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter as she is a freelance makeup artist and these make her life much easier.</li>
            <li> The lashes are completely straight.  </li>
            <li> Went straight in the trash</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Came on time and packaged very well</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried out style #2 that much</li>
            <li> for the price you really cannot beat it..</li>
            <li> I really like these lashes for the price.</li>
            <li> HAHA.</li>
            <li> I really recommend.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> They are really shift&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Delivered fast too.  </li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> Just a few dollars more you are able to get lashes that actually glue onto your eye lids.</li>
            <li> I really didnt like the plastic material.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this problem and its very upsetting.</li>
            <li> Threw them straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> Oh goodness why did I buy these haha.</li>
            <li> Cannot really get these to glue or stay on...</li>
            <li> they straight and no flexibly bend</li>
            <li> Really wish I didn&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> FOR REAL</li>
            <li> The price and delivery rate were better than expected.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t really &amp;#34;ready to wear.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the texture of this product, but hey you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> Im just used to falsies that have real hair</li>
            <li> but i really don&#x27;t care cause they weren&#x27;t for me</li>
            <li> They came just as shown in the picture, depending on how big your eyes are you will probably have to trim off some of the lashes to fit your eyes.</li>
            <li> 2 see that the shipping would takea month, also when I got them they looked really plastic. .</li>
            <li> The lashes feel very plastic and flimsy and do not retain their shape at all.</li>
            <li> or how much glue i used.</li>
            <li> You really get what you pay for, for these lashes.</li>
            <li> They are absolutely tacky</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for eyelashes that look completely real then these are not for you.</li>
            <li> how much she likes them</li>
            <li> because she goes through them so much.</li>
            <li> and they look so real.</li>
            <li> i would highly reccommend!</li>
            <li> I really like them</li>
            <li> but their really well made and quality.</li>
            <li> arrived and ready to use them</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really like how the lash line where you glue was really think so</li>
            <li> I do this gently because the eyelashes are handmade</li>
            <li> They are very affordable.</li>
            <li> However they just look sooo real once you put them on.</li>
            <li> shipped fast and as described</li>
            <li> They both suit me depending on how much make up</li>
            <li> I was very pleases with the lashes.</li>
            <li> much eyeliner</li>
            <li> Not gna complain too much considering the price, so I&#x27;ll just say two stars bc</li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t really pass in day to day life.  </li>
            <li> the are straight and not eye conformed</li>
            <li> who can really complain about it.</li>
            <li> but for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> , very straight&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> AND NOW SHE HAS A WHOLE COLLECTION</li>
            <li> I really thought they came with a glue or something</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because I would of liked the eyelashes to not be so heavy.</li>
            <li> yes i will recomend this product because have different kind of eyelashes for use in different events, conclusión</li>
            <li> The thinner ones are nice for everyday evening wear.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble putting them on but nice quantity for the price.</li>
            <li> They move a lot better with my natural shape rather than what a big name company thinks eye shape should be.  </li>
            <li> I WEAR THEM EVERYDAY TO ENHANCE MY OWN LASHES</li>
            <li> I will be getting more in the near future.</li>
            <li> and I love how they&#x27;re short near the corner or the eye and towards the outer part</li>
            <li> Great for begginers looking to learn how to apply false</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to wear a pair once and throw them away and not feel like Ive wasted a bunch of money.</li>
            <li> I prefer using more natural eyelashes for daily use or a night out.</li>
            <li> I bought these on a whim and figured if they weren&#x27;t good at least I didn&#x27;t lose much $.</li>
            <li> the way, I love natural neutral make up so the lashes totally go with it.</li>
            <li> I plan to order more in the near future.  </li>
            <li> the full ones aren&#x27;t so full that you look like a drag queen either.</li>
            <li> They take forever to arrive, but they are really great false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> could of asked for more i love the false lashes .</li>
            <li> gave the thick ones to a friend who loved them.  </li>
            <li> I have only used 1 pair of the 20 pairs of false eyelashes, but it was perfect.</li>
            <li> I loved the thick styled one.</li>
            <li> Slow shipping but really good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> They are a little stiff, but they are perfect for costume wear, cosplay or even just playing around.  </li>
            <li> I found it very easy to apply when I cut them in half.</li>
            <li> The black paint also rubs off very easily.</li>
            <li> great lashes but there a tad to shiny when worn and youd also have to cut them down to the size of your lash line because there to long</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those were the main problems I was seeing in the lower reviews, but other than these small issues, these lashes are great!</li>
            <li> OR IF YOU ARE ONLY FAMILIAR WITH A CERTAIN TYPE OF LASH BAND</li>
            <li> oh my gosh i was so surprised when i got these!!!</li>
            <li> thinner ones look perfect and natural for everyday use and the thicker ones are more dramatic, I&#x27;m not a very over the top person</li>
            <li> they are okay , worth the price they are very thin on the top</li>
            <li> They have to be modified a bit, and the lash line is thick, but other wise, good steal, especially if you wear falsies a lot and don&#x27;t re-use them</li>
            <li> I mean I&#x27;ve worn Style 1 and they look gorgeous and all</li>
            <li> I actually wore a few of the thinner lashes and they worked very nicely.</li>
            <li> They are kind of stiff</li>
            <li> Before applying the lashes be sure and hold them up to your eyelid and see how they fit to make sure you don&#x27;t need to cut the ends shorter or anything, i usually have to cut a little off the ends.</li>
            <li> and I got mine in less 15 days, which is great because I&#x27;m super impatient.</li>
            <li> I really liked the dramatic eyelashes better than the natural looking ones.</li>
            <li> but u get what u pay for it , this lashes are long and stife not for easy aplication</li>
            <li> these are not natural looking lashes at all, i use them for stage makeup, but they are cheap and pretty decent quality</li>
            <li> They look super fake and I use the 99¢store kind they look super platicy</li>
            <li> they are really shiny, they don&#x27;t really look too realistic ,and they also don&#x27;t bend very well ,i wont be buying these lashes again .</li>
            <li> They are very straight so you will need to spend a little bit of time bending them to adhere better to your eye shape.</li>
            <li> They fit my eye perfectly fine but for really small eyes , youll want to trim them &amp; they dont come with glue</li>
            <li> I bought these mainly for practicing and they were such a cheap price,  they did take awhile to come...</li>
            <li> Not sure why so many complaints on these no problems here!</li>
            <li> these are lot more stiffer than other eyelashes</li>
            <li> I love using them on myself and on other people.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t disform on my face other than that they are ok to have in case of an eye lash emergency</li>
            <li> Other than that i would buy more.</li>
            <li> I originally bought these for cosplay, but I&#x27;ve found myself wearing them even on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> they are a lil hatd to bend the other ones are ok</li>
            <li> I also find they&#x27;re more reusable than other lashes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It took for forever to ship but other than that theyre ok ..</li>
            <li> i was so excited when they finally came.</li>
            <li> I ordered two sets for my teen daughter, and she was so excited to have them.</li>
            <li> But you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> A little long, but great if you go out a lot.</li>
            <li> Other than that i love these lashes.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I totally love them</li>
            <li> and I feel them falling off my eyelids pretty early into the evening!</li>
            <li> I originally bought these for cosplay, but I&#x27;ve found myself wearing them even on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I love these due to quantity and style of lashes</li>
            <li> Other than that I was pleased.</li>
            <li> not best quality but for a beginner who is learning to use them like me they are good!</li>
            <li> I have to trim mine a little to get it to fit my eye, but they are easy to put on, feel and look natural.</li>
            <li> If you want a dramatic look these are great.</li>
            <li> sometimes to dramatic but there great.</li>
            <li> As long as you cut the &amp;#34;stringy&amp;#34; ends off, they work just fine.</li>
            <li> I cut them in half and use them just on my outer because they definitely don&#x27;t look good whole.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They feel super soft and are apparently made with real hair!</li>
            <li> and I clean them and place them back</li>
            <li> But the thin ones are beautiful for a natural sort of look.</li>
            <li> The band is pretty thick and they stay nicely on my lashes.</li>
            <li> The nice thing about these is that they make them long enough for personalization.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to get much use out of the mega super thick ones</li>
            <li> It was cheaply made the bold lashes are a little bolder than my taste.</li>
            <li> They give you two different types of false lashes for a pretty good price!.</li>
            <li> Work them a little before proceeding so they are a little more pliable as they are pretty stiff out of the package, trim them to fit you, &amp; use a good glue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed having two different options in the style: thicker and darker for a night on the town, or a thinner, more natural look for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The thick ones are performance perfect and the thin ones make a great everyday eye enhancement.</li>
            <li> the thin ones aren&#x27;t that great but in love with the thick ones always a fun time</li>
            <li> SO I HAD BOTH 20 PAIRS OF REGULAR AND THINK LASHES TO JUST MY RIGHT EYE!</li>
            <li> It is the same thing of the picture right there!</li>
            <li> all your have to do is cut the extra string that&#x27;s on the ends and put them right on!</li>
            <li> THEY WERENT AS GREAT AS THE PREVIOUS BRAND IM USED TO, AND IF YOUR ROUGH ON LASHES LIKE ME</li>
            <li> These lashes shipped out super fast to me from HK and arrived about a week or two, almost three weeks earlier than what was estimated.</li>
            <li> Came super fast, the thicker lashes are way to shiny and plastic looking for me personally.</li>
            <li> The strip is long which can be trimmed to fit any size eyelid.</li>
            <li> You do need to trim them to fit your eye though as they are a bit long.</li>
            <li> really cheap plastic material and really long.</li>
            <li> Came over a week earlier than expected &amp; the eyelashes are absolutely lovely!</li>
            <li> First of the lashes were delivered a week early so that was a plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried the natural ones, which are great for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I ordered the picture makes the eyelashes look really nice and</li>
            <li> They look exactly like my natural lashes without mascara.</li>
            <li> I use the natural looking ones  more often, but if you&#x27;re daring than the thicker false lashes are a must have :)</li>
            <li> but as soon as I saw the first box, (the natural side)</li>
            <li> The thinner ones look pretty natural in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This was sapposed to be a cool Christmas present</li>
            <li> I have been told to hold off on buying any more for the time being, I think she&#x27;s running over with these lashes, but she still loves them all, and they are not all the same type, I think that part was a big hit also, Thanks.</li>
            <li> These are not bad at all and especially for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Decent for the price, lash band is really thin, lashes are straight; but you can bend them to fit more to your eye shape.</li>
            <li> But, if you want it to be soft right away, I suggest to kind of bend the lining a little bit or use eyelash curler softly so that it&#x27;s a little bit more flexible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I would really order them they are not hard at all</li>
            <li> I am pretty good at applying false eyelashes as I wear them daily, and these wouldn&#x27;t stay put very well, it took a lot of coaxing to get them to stick in the right spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i love this variety of lashes and sometimes I can even reuse the lash up to three- four times, durable, extremely complimenting!</li>
            <li> Good product good-quality wish they were packaged differently have to make them shaped my eyes a little bit</li>
            <li> the product came in seperate boxes in an envelope, so the boxes were a little banged up, but did a good enough job of protecting whats inside.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick band, however it does make the lashes look more full and shorter than the other more natural looking ones.</li>
            <li> The thinner, lighter ones are a little more malleable and I really like them</li>
            <li> Style 1 are very Doll looking very full and not long enough for my taste.</li>
            <li> but each pair is really only good for one wear whereas I normally get about three from more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I know I shouldn&#x27;t be picky or have a hight expectatio on the quality being that I did pay such a cheap amount, but i have ordered other lashes this cheap</li>
            <li> Much lighter and more natural than other lashes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> When I messaged the seller they were very polite though and reshipped a new set.</li>
            <li> I could barely blink right.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if you bend and play with the plastic to make it less rigid then it will feel better.</li>
            <li> However it may just be me because I have black hair, and if you have any lighter color hair the lashes may look more notiable.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes the work like ones u would buy in the store half the price</li>
            <li> The dramatic ones look extremely cheap, I used the natural ones and they looked nice.</li>
            <li> These are decent eye lashes.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t even hold mascara to make look realistic.</li>
            <li> My only complaints are that these lashes are synthetic looking, which is ok if you are wearing them as part of a costume but not for daily use.</li>
            <li> they look fake for sure... but isn&#x27;t that what most people wanted to wear them for?&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> The thick ones are ones I used for a few cosplays I did and they worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Need a steady hand to cut to the size of someone&#x27;s eyes.</li>
            <li> and I got those in a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> They are super low quality.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase and will DEFINITELY purchase these again in the future !</li>
            <li> Over all it&#x27;s a decent deal for what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The thick eyelashes would be great for Halloween or to possibly look like a Jersey Shore member....</li>
            <li> You get what you see, and they are decent in quality.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, there is nothing wring with these, but they are cheap looking and being plastic makes it harder to get them to flow with your real lashes.  </li>
            <li> definitely will order more later!</li>
            <li> I actually get about 40 pairs and even better if stored properly they can be worn</li>
            <li> but i was in love with how thin and light they were on my eyes...</li>
            <li> The thick lashes can get heavy (so if you&#x27;re looking for desu manga &amp;#34;come hither&amp;#34; bedroom eyes they are perfect).</li>
            <li> more for smaller eyes, I have big eyes</li>
            <li> however the only issue I had was the line to apply the glue was super slim.</li>
            <li> I plan on using the bold ones for my boyfriend&#x27;s 21st birthday bash.</li>
            <li> They are ok the thin ones but they are cheap</li>
            <li> Takes away from the realistic look</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t realistic at all</li>
            <li> decent eyelashes</li>
            <li> but overall i really love them especially the fuller lashes.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting but still decent.</li>
            <li> I love the quantity &amp; quality for such a low price.</li>
            <li> All it really took was a good eyelash curler and a thin coat of mascara and</li>
            <li> the material is not very good they are made of some kind of plastic and it can be bothersome to my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have bought more expensive ones in the past and I like them better than this, BUT considering the price was super cheap</li>
            <li> Very soft and glamorous!</li>
            <li> Looks very natural when u put them on!</li>
            <li> They are very soft to the touch, for this price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> If you want better, high quality eyelashes you pretty much have to pay at least $5.</li>
            <li> They are easy to apply, but you probably need to trim them a little at the lash line to fit if you have smaller eyes.</li>
            <li> They were very stiff though so kind of a pain to get on.</li>
            <li> The packaging could have been better too, sent in a tight, non padded envelope, which allowed one side of the box to get smashed and ruined a couple sets of lashes.</li>
            <li> The band of the lashes is very stiff feeling and kind of feels like a wire.</li>
            <li> but they do not feel good on my eyes and are very hard to put on because of the plastic material</li>
            <li> I loved the styles of them both, but the bands were very hard to bend over my eyelid to make them stick.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money very cheap lashes feel like plastic</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> When I want to splurge then I will get the high end lashes and &amp;#34;professional application&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these lashes for the price.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this product to be purchased by consumers</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> If your looking for high quality lashes these are not it.</li>
            <li> Why pay high prices in store</li>
            <li> I received this product with high hopes.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting high quality lashes</li>
            <li> and I did used a high quality lash glue.</li>
            <li> You might get what you want, but there&#x27;s a high chance you won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Although the ones from the store (Andrea and Ardell Brand) are more expensive, they feel much nicer, are easier to apply and look more natural.</li>
            <li> Wish they came a little more curled, but curled them with an eyelash curler and it worked decent.</li>
            <li> Not only are these fantastic, but no other way to go for a beginner!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Problem: lashes are hard to care for and clean (I bought a case for lashes since these lashes came in huge box) and the shipping was well...</li>
            <li> The don&#x27;t feel as nice as more expensive ones but for this price I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something that looks natural these lashes aren&#x27;t the best, even the less thick ones.</li>
            <li> the other one style two is what i wear since it gives it a more natural look</li>
            <li> These were fine, and there&#x27;s not much to say about eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The large ones aren&#x27;t natural looking</li>
            <li> they are a little flimsy but my daughter bought better glue</li>
            <li> I suggest paying a little more for lashes at Walmart, etc.</li>
            <li> You pay a little more</li>
            <li> Over all they were shipped on time and arrived in ok condition, the boxes were a little smashed</li>
            <li> Even if I don&#x27;t get all the glue out, I could do a little something to make it better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try another brand and spend a little more.</li>
            <li> Sure, I got a lot for a little, but I got a lot of GARBAGE.</li>
            <li> Wow what a deal !!</li>
            <li> Not as natural as I wanted them to look!!</li>
            <li> I totally messed up my make up trying to use it for the first time!</li>
            <li> Great for a natural look as well as a dramatic look.</li>
            <li> down side of ordering these, is that it took a good month and a half for me to get them, but for free shipping and only 2 dollars, I think that&#x27;s a steal!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got them for show choir because the thick black ones look great on stage, but i wore the more natural ones on a daily basis!</li>
            <li> Other than that the lashes are usable and fairly easy to put on.</li>
            <li> so theyre kind of hard to put on.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to work with for beginners.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve done a trial and they can definitely look beautiful, you just have to trim them to fit your eyes better and maybe thin it out if it&#x27;s too dramatic.</li>
            <li> I love these eyelashes hands down!</li>
            <li> i love for day to day wear but the other ones!!</li>
            <li> Very great price and the shipping time wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> Not the best quality of lashes, but they definetly don&#x27;t look bad.</li>
            <li> I expected them to be cheap at the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I got these to practice wearing fake eyelashes and was a great idea.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these for my grand-daughter, who is 16 years old and had hinted that she wanted them,  and she really loves them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re still comfortable, so I have no real complaints about the product.</li>
            <li> When I wear them they look natural and everyone believes they&#x27;re my real eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The lashes are very plastic feeling and melt when you get near anything hotter then summer temps.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really tell but if you curl them and put mascara they look so natural.</li>
            <li> But instead of getting the two styles (I really just wanted the natural looking ones, but I couldn&#x27;t just order one,)</li>
            <li> they look cheap and some of them were crushed because they were delivered in a envelope.</li>
            <li> I really like the natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li> It fit exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> Not what i expected.. too cheap .. save your money..</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with how fast they came in the mail (within a couple of days) and</li>
            <li> These are not thick.</li>
            <li> Sorry they didn&#x27;t work so great</li>
            <li> it looks so fake lol.</li>
            <li> And they last for a long time:)</li>
            <li> Love them and they are not at all heavy.</li>
            <li> but i like adding that full look to my long lashes.</li>
            <li> I love that I get everyday and going out lashes and for the price</li>
            <li> I love the heavy lashes.</li>
            <li> well worth it, especially since she loves wearing them.</li>
            <li> I like how long and full they are and it the eyelashes are ever \\&quot;too much\\&quot;, just cut them in halfs or thirds</li>
            <li> Well worth the money since overall</li>
            <li> The heavy ones, don&#x27;t bend well and pops off more frenquently.  </li>
            <li> Ive worn these a few times and I love them.</li>
            <li> Im gonna purchase a few more boxes..</li>
            <li> Because some of these ladies are getting the ghetto fab, vs appropriate heavy.</li>
            <li> yes they are not perfect but for the money i paid for them there pretty good i will buy from them</li>
            <li> The only con I have found to these lashes is that the band is kind of thick and doesn&#x27;t really like to bend as well as the higher priced lashes on the market.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> definitely they are a good quality for the small fee.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t able to wear for everyday lashes</li>
            <li> Only to have fun in one time use</li>
            <li> They do take a while to come in, so I normally order in advance before my others are too used.</li>
            <li> and I am not a person that normally wears eyelashes</li>
            <li> Will last a long time, am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> They are long and full.</li>
            <li> The ends do tend to lift after a few hours with the first couple wears and cheap glue.</li>
            <li> I love the regular long lashes.</li>
            <li> I think of these of more as a clubbing/party lashes than everyday use lashes.</li>
            <li> They were way over the top nothing that you can wear everyday.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s normal but they don&#x27;t hold well with the lash glue(not included).</li>
            <li> Extra long and form fitting</li>
            <li> Not for everyday use, better for costumes.</li>
            <li> The day look is equivalent to my normal lashes...</li>
            <li> Just spend a few more dollars and go to the drug store.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this item if your a big fan of long lashes greatly satisfied</li>
            <li> and I can totally recommend it to my friends but the packaging was not so good they came back wet</li>
            <li> They do the job when I can&#x27;t make it to the beauty supply store to purchase my normal brand lashes.</li>
            <li> The lighter ones can be for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;Please expect lashes to be delivered in more than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The thinner onea didn&#x27;t look normal.</li>
            <li> Mine came up on the sides after a few hours &amp; I had to add more glue.</li>
            <li> These are great false lashes.. for the price (and in general).</li>
            <li> I will be buying a few more sets of these.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of cheap lashes and thus buying only from sephora, but I must say I was amazed at how good these are.</li>
            <li> The darker, thicker ones are pretty much of no use to me, unless I cut them in have and use the halves on the outer corner of my lashes for extra fullness.</li>
            <li> Thin lashes were good not thick</li>
            <li> i guess, I&#x27;ll use them for more everyday style than anything.</li>
            <li> honestly i just got them but my first time trying a pair on not too long ago, they had trouble sticking</li>
            <li> it is nice , and i like it ,,,....,,,beutiful , ,,,,,,......,,, and it&#x27; thick</li>
            <li> /&gt;You have to know how to apply false lashes to make them look good.</li>
            <li> Everyone complaining about these are right they are a little stiff, to help that you need to flex them first (grab them by both ends and kind of keep bending/rolling them side to side to stretch them)</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, wear them all the time, great for decorating with glitter or rhinestones, the only downside it the lashes are a little stiff and stick together</li>
            <li> if you dont clip the edges right they may poke into youe eye skin but its all good there a little but to like stiff</li>
            <li> More than half of them bent from shipping to the point you can&#x27;t use them!</li>
            <li> (This is not hard to do.</li>
            <li> Took a very long time to ship, overall satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that they are super synthetic so they don&#x27;t look as natural</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Make sure while you&#x27;re waiting the 15 seconds for the adhesive to dry, grab the lashes by both ends &amp; wiggle them back &amp; forth into a U-shape.</li>
            <li> it looks just as good as any other expensive lashes :)</li>
            <li> BOTH ITEMS CAME TO THE RIGHT EYE ONLY!!!</li>
            <li> I wish it was a lil more stiff</li>
            <li> Eyelashes were for right eye only .</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t put the inner corner of the lashes on right, it&#x27;s going to bother you a lot.</li>
            <li> I completely love the look, the band is stiff  </li>
            <li> They were very stiff and wouldn&#x27;t bend with my eye shape very easily.</li>
            <li> All in all, I would buy this again considering how cheap they are but be more likely to only purchase the regular long lashes.</li>
            <li> but they took a long time to arrive other than that they were nice</li>
            <li> If you are looking for long and bold lashes i would get these.</li>
            <li> They are okay if you want something cheap in money and quality, but I would not recommend them for serious or daily use.</li>
            <li> but i thought to my self, well $5 isnt much to loose, specially when one pair of eyelashes cost about $4.</li>
            <li> Product came earlier than expected but very cheap material.</li>
            <li> I use the thinner lashes when I&#x27;m looking for a more natural look but the thick ones looks pretty normal for me.</li>
            <li> They look good, my only complaint is that when they were packed, the send put the two boxes ontop of each other crushing a few of the top lashes and making them deformed.</li>
            <li> Overall, pretty worth it for the low cost and for needing them for photoshoots for clients!</li>
            <li> Took longer than expected but so worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I wish the thicker ones were a little more natural looking, also</li>
            <li> I thought they would look a little more natural but not.</li>
            <li> I use false lashes a lot and these are pretty good especially for they&#x27;re price.</li>
            <li> Just ordered a new set.</li>
            <li> going to find a new glue to try out.</li>
            <li> and I live in the U.S.,</li>
            <li> Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new..</li>
            <li> I like them just need to buy new glue</li>
            <li> I live in chicago soo</li>
            <li> So I bought the eyelashes to try something new</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are a lil hard to put on since it is more straight than angled to match your eye</li>
            <li> they are super long and awsome!</li>
            <li> The weft is really soft and pliable so it takes a steady hand to apply them.</li>
            <li> It cames much more earlier that I expected and becouse of this</li>
            <li> Arrived a lot earlier than expected &amp; in love with these lashes.</li>
            <li> i got the same thing for both... -.- not even worth the time to return it; I wanted the natural ones too, but never happened</li>
            <li> However, everything was okay, none of the lashes were damaged, though, they were flattened, so it made it harder to glue them on without extensive bending.</li>
            <li> I got these earlier than I expected, I love them😄</li>
            <li> the thick ones were just too much on m face the thinner ones were okay</li>
            <li> I waited for 6 weeks for these and when they finally arrived they couldn&#x27;t curve to fit properly on my lash and the edges of each lash</li>
            <li> They look kind of ridiculous if you don&#x27;t cut them.</li>
            <li> They were such a low price I was expecting a cheap product</li>
            <li> The lashes are so soft and realistic.</li>
            <li> With careful care i was able to reuse lashes a 2nd time .I</li>
            <li> These are just the most cheap, uncomfortable, unnatural lashes ever.  </li>
            <li> Seriously I do not have sensitive skin or eyes</li>
            <li> I love false eye lashes, so it was convent to buy a set of 40 natural and bold lashes.  </li>
            <li> The thicker ones are a bit hard to put on, but with a little bit of work, they look good for a night out!</li>
            <li> You can trim them down, and they work just fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;#2 is VERY natural looking.</li>
            <li> I donated to my old high school.</li>
            <li> but they look very natural.  </li>
            <li> Style 2 is very natural looking</li>
            <li> Looks very NATURAL .Its</li>
            <li> Very natural looking...</li>
            <li> they are very natural looking</li>
            <li> The thick lashes were very soft and pretty, and the thin ones were more separate, but still nice.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a natural look but lengthy lashes, this is a pretty good buy just for the ten thin lashes.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m super glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly small eyes and the lashes are very long (across the eye)</li>
            <li> Great one-use eyelashes for dramatic effect, use with glue and they stay on all day!</li>
            <li> Great for dramatic length!</li>
            <li> They came a little late but the price is good so no worries!</li>
            <li> These lashes seem of pretty decent quality, especially for the price which is vital for me being a makeup artist.</li>
            <li> They are big enough for anyone that I know and have done their makeup, they are good to take down to size, I just went to walmart and got some clear adhesive.</li>
            <li> The price was right for this product but, not for me in the near future</li>
            <li> LOVE the thin style; they gave me just the right &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The rubbery texture does make it a little harder to mold to the shape of the eye but overall great deal.</li>
            <li> these lashes they are easy to apply they last long and they can be reused.if you take care of them..</li>
            <li> I attempted to use 6 pairs overall (3 natural, 3 full) and never really got them to look right.</li>
            <li> Overall, they are very nice false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!</li>
            <li> Just make sure they are completely dried and affixed before heading out!</li>
            <li> They look exactly the same as in the picture.</li>
            <li> They arrived early!</li>
            <li> Cut to perfection as they are professional that they need to be trimmed to perfection!</li>
            <li> For this small price, I get to have many looks to choose from when getting dolled up.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Even for how cheap these were, I&#x27;d rather spend the extra money next time and not waste my time.</li>
            <li> I usually wear more than one pair of eyelashes</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and they were only willing to send a repeat order.</li>
            <li> first it only took about 1 week</li>
            <li> I am disappointed because every review that said this was a great product is a LIE!</li>
            <li> Just got them today &amp; they came almost two weeks early!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> Pretty standard quality for falsies.</li>
            <li> Wow !</li>
            <li> These are so cheap and not worth a penny.</li>
            <li> Everything was really wonderful except that I have no clue how I am going to manage getting them on, cutting them to size and gluing them by myself!</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I am a pretty simple gal.</li>
            <li> They are thin, flimsy , and look very cheap!</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my 18 year old granddaughter and she loves them!</li>
            <li> I love the natural lashes but the thick ones....not so much.</li>
            <li> They may be good for Halloween but other than that they are a waste.</li>
            <li> really easy to use just have to cut ends a little bit</li>
            <li> Murray for very natural or very dramatic looks, I find the quality to be great for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought these and honestly every one said the dramatic was to much</li>
            <li> These are extremely cheap and when I recieved them the box was all bent up with the eyelashes everywhere (NOT HELD DOWN).</li>
            <li> When I cut them down to fit</li>
            <li> so you have to cut them down to fit your eye</li>
            <li> Very soft and they look strong got them in a few hours ago.</li>
            <li> style 1 lashes looked to thick and fake to me but style 2 looks way more natural and looks great</li>
            <li> At first they were hard to put on because they are not pre-curved to fit your eyelid.</li>
            <li> I believe that all the negative comments come from girls who do not know how to apply lashes, first of all your suppose to trim them down to fit your liner line, then after the lashes feel comfortable</li>
            <li> I have worn them a few times already and haven&#x27;t experienced the same issues as other lashes</li>
            <li> was the actual quality would be at such a low price, but I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> These are great for if you want a dramatic look one day, and then natural the next.</li>
            <li> I also like that they are long enough (width from end to end) which will enable me to cut them to fit the width of my eyelids.</li>
            <li> Reusable and long lasting and so cheap</li>
            <li> Pretty cheap synthetic with a thick strip.</li>
            <li> and you can trim then and apply in small portions to give a more natural look.</li>
            <li> but I think I am good enough too figure out that these are not good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to insert pics for the review...but the regular lashes look pretty natural...</li>
            <li> I had to wait nearly a month for these lashes, and after reading all the other reviews I was so excited to get them.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t do a higher rating was because they are sent in a water proof bag and soft boxes.</li>
            <li> I am used to buying individual specialy lashes so these were alot different but not bad.</li>
            <li> They are plush, soft and very natural looking.</li>
            <li> They are beautiful on, but the &amp;#34;lash line&amp;#34; is very thick when put on, making them seem more fake, than you want them to be.</li>
            <li> In the past, other companies lashes weren&#x27;t long enough, but these are perfect.</li>
            <li> Came sooner then what I thought everything was fine the boxes where a little bent but</li>
            <li> I received my lashes on the very first expected delivery date</li>
            <li> there pretty but style 1 looks really shiny and does make it look even more fake.</li>
            <li> I had a little problem with the sipping at first but the company fixed it right up</li>
            <li> The came a week and a half early which is good, but my package was a little bent up.</li>
            <li> I have only worn the thinner lashes so far and will most likely save the thicker/fuller lashes for a night out as they are more dramatic.</li>
            <li> out of place soft ,black, wispy light.</li>
            <li> Only able to use half of them.</li>
            <li> They only lasted about half the day but thats what to expect for cheap eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I used eyelash glue, glued them on, held it and waited for it to dry, and then they would just pop right off.</li>
            <li> The natural looking ones do look very natural on my eyes and the thick ones are great for a little drama.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are simple and easy to use, They are plastic feeling then the more expensive brands so you will have to bend them and work with them a bit before you apply them</li>
            <li> These lashes are as they are described in that they are not stiff or having a plastic appearance.</li>
            <li> &quot; it (so that it&#x27;s not stiff) before applying it.</li>
            <li> You may have to cut the ends a little to get them to fit with your eyelids.</li>
            <li> The casing is a little cheap</li>
            <li> Just a little cheap.</li>
            <li> Had to cut a little to fit but</li>
            <li> /&gt;Given that I&#x27;ve spent more on a single pair, I think it&#x27;s worth it even if one set might need to be handed to someone who is performing a drag show.  </li>
            <li> Great deal, the long ones are so dramatic.</li>
            <li> The first style looks dramatic, but it looks lovely on the eye.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I expected, and for the price, it is of decent quality.</li>
            <li> I like to wear the normal ones but the dramatic ones are nice to depending on the occasion.</li>
            <li> Was really excited to see that twenty pairs of eyelashes would cost me less than five dollars.</li>
            <li> Was really excited to get these and after waiting 2 weeks for them to arrive, half of them were not in the box.</li>
            <li> ur nail and run it along the connection hard part to curve n make them stick better if needed) and trim ends evenly to avoid scratching</li>
            <li> They were hard to put on and didn&#x27;t stay for more than 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I have used all of the other lashes except the bold ones.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes when received in the mail were a little crushed because they were in an envelope, if you&#x27;re looking for more real textured eyelashes</li>
            <li> Other than the fact that these did NOT come with any glue or some kind of adhesive, and some of the eyelashes were messed up (and hidden).</li>
            <li> At first I was a little upset due to the fact that due to the packaging some were squished but overall they are great.</li>
            <li> Only bad thing was took awhile to get but still great buy for the price!</li>
            <li> but they look extra fake, but when u put em on they look great</li>
            <li> i bought the clear lash glue seperately and</li>
            <li> They are adorable but the fit is awkward</li>
            <li> When they find out that they are false eyelashes they are in complete shock, they say that they are amazing.</li>
            <li> First off they are way too long in length and in width.</li>
            <li> My 10 natural lashes were all ripped up and cut up.</li>
            <li> how natural they look</li>
            <li> I also wouldn&#x27;t suggest these lashes to a beginner as I was, however they did make it a lot easier to use natural eye lashes.</li>
            <li> the eye lashes are set up to give you the natural curves of your eye..</li>
            <li> My young daughter could not believe what I paid for 20 pairs.</li>
            <li> I really like this lashes because I can cut them to my size and wear only once and then dispose</li>
            <li> I received these 2 weeks early.</li>
            <li> Received the lashes early.</li>
            <li> I love my lashes I&#x27;ve been using them a lot lately</li>
            <li> Only downside is they come mostly straight</li>
            <li> One downfall style 1, not everyday glam lashes...</li>
            <li> If you are wanting natural these are not for you.</li>
            <li> I would use only for photo shoots (look real dragqueenish)</li>
            <li> Ordered lashes on 10/1/13, received it on 10/23/13; nearly 1 month.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s something that can be fixed .Over</li>
            <li> Wow what can I say?</li>
            <li> These lashes do not look natural.</li>
            <li> I will buy the natural oned again tho.</li>
            <li> Not as natural as I would prefer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waaaaaay to &amp;#34;theatrical&amp;#34; if you&#x27;re looking for a natural apperance.</li>
            <li> Only received 10, the lashes were too straight</li>
            <li> Arrived early .</li>
            <li> Cost to much to send them back so threw them in the trash.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They went directly into the garbage.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look natural at all.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for natural looking lashes then these are not what you want.  </li>
            <li> but the natural ones I wore all day</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the quality and sturdiness of the lashes.</li>
            <li> and I am a professional make-up artist.</li>
            <li> if you are sensitive these might cause some problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> NATURAL.</li>
            <li> i dont like the bigger ones you can really tell thay</li>
            <li> The only con would be the hair isn&#x27;t real</li>
            <li> they lookd so natural</li>
            <li> Be advised you may damage your natural eyelashes if you ARE NOT A PRO.</li>
            <li> the lashes 2 had to different styles very lite  </li>
            <li> TIP before applying the lashes bend them in a natural curve for about 30 seconds with glue on, this should help it become easier when applying .</li>
            <li> They are packaged efficiently and secure enough for me, nothing fancy, but basic enough for protecting the shape.</li>
            <li> The natural ones ARE just that...not too noticable.</li>
            <li> early than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> your looking for a natural look, they aren&#x27;t natural looking.</li>
            <li> they dont look as natural as i&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m all for natural looking lashes</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look natural at all but for $2 I shouldve known.</li>
            <li> They make me feel classy when I have them on.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect them to be completely unusable.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes don&#x27;t look natural like you would want them to look.</li>
            <li> I like so much with low price</li>
            <li> near the amount you get here.</li>
            <li> :) i got them so late though.</li>
            <li> I like how they look natural</li>
            <li> so I cut mine to where they looked natural.</li>
            <li> These are plastic and not fiber material.did not have a natural look to them at all.</li>
            <li> so I just use the natural ones.</li>
            <li> As I don&#x27;t really know how to apply these eyelashes without the proper tools, I must say that I must wait to utilize them</li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to eyelashes, I decided to try these because of the low price,</li>
            <li> They look natural and for the price...perfect.  </li>
            <li> Utter garbage don&#x27;t look real.</li>
            <li> The picture and the product don&#x27;t match the eyelashes look like the ones children get from a 99 cent store or like a old rusty baby doll .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Even when I go natural with just the lashes, I still get tons of compliments.</li>
            <li> They do not look natural at all .</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money or time.</li>
            <li> AND CHEAP I WASTED MY TIME AND MONEY&lt;</li>
            <li> and I am far from professional at getting them on,</li>
            <li> My selections arrived early and look just like the pictures I chose from.</li>
            <li> At first i thought it was strange because the part that you put glue on is made out of thread</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> wore these once so far, and had no issue.</li>
            <li> Very efficient considering the handling time plus the time to ship internationally.</li>
            <li> These lashes are so soft.</li>
            <li> So far I havn&#x27;t tried then on</li>
            <li> but they feel like natural lashes.</li>
            <li> Natural....</li>
            <li> The thinner ones look so natural</li>
            <li> all i can say is WOW.</li>
            <li> I like the natural looking ones but</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a natural is she or isn&#x27;t she wearing them</li>
            <li> so it blends in with your natural lashes.</li>
            <li> Looks natural.</li>
            <li> These are by far the hardest lashes to put on in my experience.</li>
            <li> I personally like the much fuller lashes, Style 1</li>
            <li> It actually shipped fast too.</li>
            <li> but once I got these I tried to put them on to see how natural they may look but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues putting on lashes but these were the easiest by far.</li>
            <li> I only really had 2</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time or your money.</li>
            <li> The inner corners were coming off and after 10-15 minutes they started to stand out straight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These lashes are so soft when you brush your fingertip over them.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> iveonly worn one pair so far, of the thicker ones</li>
            <li> nearly 24/7</li>
            <li> THAT MAKES THEM COMPLETELY UNWEARABLE.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t a natural shape.</li>
            <li> They are very durable,  you can wear them several times.</li>
            <li> Not everyday ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to the &amp;#34;Handmade Natural soft falsies&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but I was very pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li> (which you should be doing these things anyhow to prevent damage/trauma to natural lash)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not heavy like the ones I&#x27;ve bought from stores.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money..</li>
            <li> rather of got 20 pair of the natural ones then have 10 that I am going to throw away.</li>
            <li> cheap, dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> They seem to want to spring back into an almost straight line.</li>
            <li> I was surprised on how well the lashes hold and look.</li>
            <li> I got two pair of them you can put 10 pairs handmade natural soft eyelashes</li>
            <li> Not for any type of natural look.</li>
            <li> LOOK NATURAL</li>
            <li> These are so cheap, and a waste of your money.</li>
            <li> It should have been sold with a glue to complete the package.</li>
            <li> Do Not Waste Your Money......</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t natural at all.</li>
            <li> cause even though it&#x27;s cheap, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> These are cheap and the same material as the more expensive Ardell lashes.</li>
            <li> One set of the lashes have a very unattractive white band.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend them to people who frequently use lashes.</li>
            <li> I wear these on an almost daily basis since these are so much easier to apply rather than layering on coats of mascara.</li>
            <li> The 20 pair of the natural lashes have lasted me for months when I use them as demi lashes.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for a professional finished look</li>
            <li> You have to shape them with your finger for a few seconds before and cut them so they fit your eyes.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how natural the thicker lashes looked.</li>
            <li> I was surprised and when I saw them I was even happier.</li>
            <li> They didnt look natural at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one pair of each so far in the two weeks</li>
            <li> the natural lashe&#x27;s look really natural</li>
            <li> Fast shipping for international.</li>
            <li> Spend a few more dollars and buy red cherry or ardell.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been able to reuse the same pair a few times.</li>
            <li> Thick ones for night and lighter more natural ones for day.</li>
            <li> The thick ones are ok.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves &#x27;em, but isn&#x27;t sure about the thick set I have.</li>
            <li> It would have been better if you could order just the thinner ones and not the thick ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the thinner ones I use for a neutral look and my thick ones I use for a more night out</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves &#x27;em, but isn&#x27;t sure about the thick set I have.</li>
            <li> It is a good product for someone who likes obviously fake lashes.</li>
            <li> The thick ones were cute</li>
            <li> these eyelashes are just as good as the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> i think if your good at putting them on then they shouldn&#x27;t look that fake..</li>
            <li> Love the thick lashes they really complete the look.</li>
            <li> The thick ones are perfect for parties and clubbing nights, but the thin ones arent my favorites because thery</li>
            <li> You actually get 20 pair of eyelashes, thick and natural with a nice arch.</li>
            <li> The thick set looks more like eye brows.</li>
            <li> I love that they came in 20 pairs and varies from natural to thick.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall they are a good quality fake eyelash.</li>
            <li> I thought they would have been okay with the thick bands</li>
            <li> The thick would look pretty cool during Halloween???</li>
            <li> Some girls want the thick looking ones and others like the more natural look</li>
            <li> If i was into false lashes i may have liked them.</li>
            <li> A little bit long but just cut the edges and cut them in half when applying to make sure you get them on your lash line accurately.</li>
            <li> not very particular about the shape on thicker lashes..but price very reasonable...</li>
            <li> Usually other lashes get gross after I wear them once, but these are fine.</li>
            <li> so I was actually able to cut each individual lash in half and use it as a pair, therefore doubling the use on each set!</li>
            <li> I am giving it three stars only because they were cheap, but I found them completely useless due to the corners not being flexible and not sticking, making it seam as your eyelashes are about to fly off your face.&lt;br /&gt;For a one time party use, will definitely do.</li>
            <li> The thing that make these lashes just ok, is the fact that it&#x27;s just too stiff and not flexible enough when you want  to apply it to your eyes.</li>
            <li> I thought it would come the same time as my other orders but came a week later over all I love the lashes</li>
            <li> I mean the lashes were cute and all.</li>
            <li> it makes the eye just pop out more than usual... ouuuuuuu and try using it for your bottom lashes too!</li>
            <li> I mean its okay for the price that I purchase it</li>
            <li> To me, it looks very thin and quite short, but it is great for bottom lashes or layering!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re stiff and seem to be made of cheap plastic, like something you&#x27;d get out of a gumball machine.</li>
            <li> they add such a powerful look to the eyes (can be dramatic or innocent)</li>
            <li> I liked them for just everyday use and use my other lashes for another time.</li>
            <li> The pairs that are less full look and feel like plastic</li>
            <li> The lashes are fairly flexible and for the price you absolutely CANNOT GO WRONG!</li>
            <li> The package was pretty much smashed up a little.</li>
            <li> I normally wear mascara over my fake eyelashes to make them blend better with my real ones...</li>
            <li> Love the lashes , they&#x27;re a little to long for me .</li>
            <li> I have worn lashes with a higher quality and I have worn expensive individual lashes that have taken my own lashes out.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is totally worth the buy, but if you can&#x27;t wait I would suggest getting some at the store while you wait for these.</li>
            <li> so I always cut a little from both sides of the lash strip to make them the right size!</li>
            <li> The darker ones right now seem to dramatic for me but who knows in time and still you cant even beat the price ( I paid 3.50 with free shipping) for 10 pair, even if I end up not using the darker ones all of the time.</li>
            <li> but they work splendidly, the thicker ones look a bit fake more fake</li>
            <li> Though I usually don&#x27;t wear eyelashes and am quite inexperienced with them, these were pretty easy to apply.</li>
            <li> These were not worth the money, they are cheap and obvious.  </li>
            <li> if you are looking for realistic, spend the extra money.</li>
            <li> I was not happy about the purchase at first glance they look stringy and cheap looking</li>
            <li> Overall though they are decent quality lashes for the price.</li>
            <li> They apply easier than the human remy brand I usually use they&#x27;re definitely a better brand of synthetic fibers.</li>
            <li> , however I had to go personally pick it up from the post office because it had to be signed for.&lt;br /&gt;Overall decent product.</li>
            <li> cheaply made too plastic-y feeling dont look natural not really satisfied with this purchase at all. . . . . .</li>
            <li> they actually look decent.</li>
            <li> You can trim all but a few hairs off the ends and create your own single lashes from the entire band.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They were sealed nice and tight, the boxes inside were fragile so they were a little rough, but none of the eyelashes were harmed, and a little rough is great</li>
            <li> Other than that it arrived right when it said it would.</li>
            <li> 20 pairs for about a buck fifty when in the store it can be as high as 10 dollars for one pair, Yes, they are plastic but that just means you can reuse them, there&#x27;s enough pairs to wear as is, or you can experiment with them and make demi lashes or can cut them shorter.</li>
            <li> They are high quality and last me</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to anyone, don&#x27;t get pulled in by the low price and high quantity &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> Product was worth the purchase price and the quality was good enough, although I was not impressed when I received in the mailbox crushed.  </li>
            <li> I can cut them to fit properly and they last a very long time!</li>
            <li> Just have to cut a very little off to fit.</li>
            <li> Only received HALF of my order,  and these eyelashes are for someone with huge eyes.</li>
            <li> They were easy to apply but I did have to do some cutting to make them fit.</li>
            <li> The skinnies work really well for me as bottom lashes after a quick trim over thick liner.</li>
            <li> The packaging was cheap, and although this purchase was very inexpensive, I had to toss half due to damage.</li>
            <li> I love both sets, natural and thick, natural for every day use and the thick for a night out or a special event.</li>
            <li> When my order finally arrived, my sis took a quick look at them and said they look so cheap, fakeish and dramatic.</li>
            <li> I know they are a cheap price but definitely a waste of money!</li>
            <li> WHEN YOU GET READY TO PUT THEM ON YOU WILL HAVE TO CUT BOTH SIDES OF THE LASHES, BECAUSE THERE ARE LONG STRINGS ON THE SIDE.</li>
            <li> They are like plastic, freakishly long and way too much space in between each lash.</li>
            <li> They barely bend around the natural shape of the eye before the ends pop out again.  </li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t load them with too much mascara each</li>
            <li> The eye lashes are not natural or real looking at all.</li>
            <li> the lashes are way too long, very unatural looking</li>
            <li> you still need to cut a small section at the end in order to fit with your eyeline.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m prbly just gonna switch to using these from now on because they are soooo cheap and still do the job, if not better.</li>
            <li> My natural lashes are pretty long and similar in length to the style 2 set</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not really my style although the thicker ones looked pretty once they were on</li>
            <li> They arrived early and they are really cheaply made but considering your only paying a few dollars</li>
            <li> I normally buy from a retail store and they are S10.00 for 10 pairs of lashes , here they are WAY cheaper plus you get double!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> but I wore them for stage and not for normal daily wear.  </li>
            <li> arrived way before expected looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> So I bought these on recommendation and was pretty nervous about it at first since I don&#x27;t have too much lash experience other than a few dollarstore pairs as a test</li>
            <li> the only problem that I had is that it took so long to send, I&#x27;m very impatient person, but again it&#x27;s 2 dollars, highly recommend them, easy to put on if you have put eyelashes before, I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> They were full and thick plus looked realistic, but i wish they would&#x27;ve come with eyelash glue.</li>
            <li> The natural type is thin, but long and the backbone of the lash isnt hard but molds to your eye perfectly.</li>
            <li> Personally, on the set of lashes that are less full, I have gotten nothing but compliments from friends on how NATURAL they look.</li>
            <li> I can alter these to fit my eyes, but they lay flat, and it&#x27;s hard to get them to stay put because they aren&#x27;t very flexible.</li>
            <li> It is fun and different feeling, especially with the darker shade ones; they feel really heavy on my eyes, it was my first time.</li>
            <li> These are my emergency lashes now, in the event I dont have time to buy new ones or have time to apply the individual lashes.</li>
            <li> would have put 5 stars but the only reason why i didnt is because they took about almost 3 weeks to get to where i live</li>
            <li> /&gt; If you remove them VERY carefully and remove any mascara with a mild oil or make up remover, you will get several uses out of them.  </li>
            <li> I use them as demi lashes on the corners of my eyes, so I&#x27;ll cut the bands in half (or even 1/3 of the length of the band, for a more natural look) and use each half for each eye.</li>
            <li> Instead of using one lash for each eye, I also found it useful to cut each lash itself in half to use as demi lashes.</li>
            <li> Came pretty fast considering where it came from usually</li>
            <li> Thinner lashes look almost spiky and are very short, I personally like but someone else may not (look like real lashes loaded with mascara).</li>
            <li> a few of them are smashed and they can not be used, but for this price more than I was expected.</li>
            <li> I am pretty much not satisfied of this product ｡･ﾟ･(ﾉД&#x60;)･ﾟ･｡</li>
            <li> They are actually quite soft and do not irritate the eyes the hairs are soft and give the eye the \\&quot;gyaru\\&quot; look or dolly eyes .</li>
            <li> They are pretty long so you may need to adjust them if you have smaller eyes.</li>
            <li> :) they dont look fake but they dont look real</li>
            <li> As for Style 2 they are also dramatically long and not as full you also have to be careful on how you trim them, if you do.</li>
            <li> I am gonna have to admit they do when I took a glance at them too, but when I tried them on they look so natural they totally blended with my natural lashes.</li>
            <li> The only thing is they are straight to begin with, not curved to your eye like store bought lashes, which is no biggie, they still go on the same.</li>
            <li> when I got these in the mail, I thought they would be more fluttery than they actually were, and the band on the fuller ones was really thick.</li>
            <li> and i love the way it compliments me although the band is really thing and can be difficult to put on it</li>
            <li> Slow shipping though,but other then that I love it !</li>
            <li> Just as good as the expensive ones I got from Sephora for $15.&lt;br /&gt;I would totally get these if:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not expect any false eyelash to be able to look natural at this price but they do.</li>
            <li> I even tried trimming them down but it didn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li> The thick ones are kind of hard to master at first</li>
            <li> These lashes came in two small cheap boxes they were all smashed up the bands are huge and thick even the hair feels plastic. .</li>
            <li> The other eyelashes look exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> Always stick the middle to your eye FIRST, then the back, &amp; then the inner tear</li>
            <li> was a little smooshed but other than that the eyelashes are okay for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Unless you glue them to the middle of your lid or natural lash!  </li>
            <li> I fell in love with the thick ones!</li>
            <li> I love the thick eyelashes !</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the thick ones!</li>
            <li> These are more stiff than lashes I&#x27;ve tried before &amp; therefore harder to put on, as well as stay on.</li>
            <li> These look very fake, but that&#x27;s what you get for buying super cheap eyelashes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to buy them in the beauty supply store because these are very hard .</li>
            <li> i enjoy the two different options for a more or less dramatic effect.</li>
            <li> very cheap poor quality.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look real at all, complete plastic and thick, better for cosplay or costume instead of everyday life.</li>
            <li> They are very basic as far as style goes, and cheap much along the line of thin shredded plastic.</li>
            <li> Love them I actually like the thick ones better than the thin ones but gave them to a co worker and she loves them ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to trimmed them down a little, but other than that they are good for about two uses each.</li>
            <li> but i was able to wear the thin ones on a daily basis and they looked natural!</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t even worth the little amount of money that I paid for them.</li>
            <li> They were pretty Good fake eyelashes, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that they were a little hard to shape other than that nice product..</li>
            <li> This is totally cute if you&#x27;re going for the &#x27;dramatic&#x27; or &#x27;natural look.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I have the choice for dramatic or more natural looking.  </li>
            <li> The thinner pair is more natural, while the thicker pair is dramatic and luxurious.</li>
            <li> They look really nice, big and dramatic for a night out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it takes a little while to get here, but for a little over a buck I&#x27;d strongly recommend buying these lashes!</li>
            <li> They are very pretty, just a bit stiff.</li>
            <li> neither but.way better than what i expected for so little money!</li>
            <li> they are a little long to fit my eyelids</li>
            <li> Cheap, flimsy, but I shouldve known that since I didn&#x27;t pay hardly anything for it.</li>
            <li> They make your eyes look cheap and they are hard to glue on.</li>
            <li> hard to cut the lashes to fit your size</li>
            <li> They look cheap, and have a hard time shaping correctly around the eyelid.</li>
            <li> I found these hard to put on because they come pretty straight</li>
            <li> They are plastic, and they are very long, you will have to cut them to fit your personal needs but other thab</li>
            <li> These lashes are cute, as natural as false lashes are, flexible, more for an everyday look with a little glam.</li>
            <li> only &#x27;con&#x27; is that it took a very long time to arrive, I live New York, but I was told it would take about 15-20 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thick lashes are very long and full-looking but still very light.</li>
            <li> Lol I knew it was going to be of bad quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They feel amazing, the lashes are firm but feel like they are made out of small slivers of satin not plastic.</li>
            <li> I have re-used the same ones for over a month just adding clear glue and pealing them off.</li>
            <li> The lashes are way too straight which makes applying harder.</li>
            <li> will be buying again in the near future!</li>
            <li> It came much sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase in the near future.</li>
            <li> Also, they&#x27;re not very curly which kind of defeats the purpose of fake lashes since they stick straight out</li>
            <li> i bought these thinking they were actually going to look natural.</li>
            <li> Wish the natural lashes were a bit longer but overall I like them.</li>
            <li> There are to kinds sent... tarantula and barely anything.</li>
            <li> Wow, for ladies who never have enough eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I know these eyelashes are UBER cheap, but I would definitely recommend spending the extra few dollars and just going to Walgreens or CVS or</li>
            <li> I got the lashes in the mail, the box was all crumbled and smashed, and slightly wet because it had been raining for a week straight.</li>
            <li> That also is fixed with the extra glue coats.</li>
            <li> so I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much</li>
            <li> have only used one pair so far, when i ordered them i was i</li>
            <li> So I only wear the sort of natural ones for length.</li>
            <li> i have not wore them them simply because they do not look natural</li>
            <li> I only used 1 pair so far.</li>
            <li> These were shipped much faster than I expected them to be to begin with.</li>
            <li> They look natural and I constantly get compliments.</li>
            <li> I wear the thin ones and my daughter wear the thick ones, we&#x27;re happy so far.</li>
            <li> I love my lashes, they are not too long or thick.</li>
            <li> Not terrible, but not great.</li>
            <li> These lashes are made of fairly thick plastic, it looks rather cheap.  </li>
            <li> I selected this brand of eyelashes, because I love thick and long eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I will never order these kind again unfortunately</li>
            <li> is so sad that being selling this kind of quality product...</li>
            <li> You know kind of fake because of the price....</li>
            <li> the thicker ones are much better the the thin ones cant see them</li>
            <li> I do like the thin lashes better.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t need fake eye lashes since my eye lashes are so long, and because of that I was worried the natural looking lashes weren&#x27;t going to make much of a difference, but they actually give it a nice hime-sama</li>
            <li> Not bad for .45 cents, but not the style I would usually wear.  </li>
            <li> I love these false eyelashes</li>
            <li> Just to see if they like to have false lashes on before I put the better ones on them.</li>
            <li> I just love false eyelashes...</li>
            <li> At first i was nervous on getting them due to all the negative reviews but they are fine , totally recommend them.</li>
            <li> All I recommend is that you bend them up back and forth with your fingertips a little before application because they can be a little stiff, other than that they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
            <li> has a plasticy feel at first but with extended wear the shine goes down and the shape relaxes to your eye.</li>
            <li> This lashes are synthetic, and if you are not used too falsies, this product (especially the thick lashes) are INTENSE, BOLD, TOTALLY GLAMOUROUS, but can over whelm some people.</li>
            <li> The less thick and dressy looked natural, and the big black were great for costumes or dressing up.  </li>
            <li> The thick ones are a bit too dramatic, the small ones are great as long as you curl them with a pencil and trim them appropriately.</li>
            <li> They wear comfortably and as long as you put the glue on the lash band correctly and place them well, they&#x27;ll wear just as well and just as long as any other brand of lashes.</li>
            <li> I mean it costs cheap.</li>
            <li> cause they are just too dramatic for me, the normal ones are ok but kinda too long</li>
            <li> First off I received my eyelashes in less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> but Im close to the warehouse and usually get every thing quick.</li>
            <li> Okay so I love to have really dramatic false lashes</li>
            <li> This product took a very long time to get to me and the packaging was a little damaged but the actual product is fine and was what was needed.</li>
            <li> So anybody thinking about not buying these because of reading bad reviews, DON&amp;#34;T LISTEN, give them a try, you&#x27;ll love them!!</li>
            <li> I didnt like the lashes because they dont bend like the other brands and the hair felt very &amp;#34;plasticy&amp;#34; i never got to wear them</li>
            <li> Her clothes are her own personality and her makeup is a little too edgy for some people.</li>
            <li> The naturals give my own lashes just a little boost, and the thick ones give my eyes a va-va-voom needed for nights out on the town and costuming.</li>
            <li> The naturals give my own lashes just a little boost, and the thick ones give my eyes a va-va-voom needed for nights out on the town and costuming.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like these, they aren&#x27;t like real eyelashes, they are hard plastic pieces.</li>
            <li> For like $2 I get 20 pairs of natural AND thick lashes, and they are just as good if not better than store bought $6 single pair lashes.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic and you  get ten sets of day lashes and ten sets of night lashes all for less than $5.00!!  </li>
            <li> These are beautiful and I have used them and get complicated on them!!</li>
            <li> but they work and don&#x27;t look bad specially great for ppl that is starting</li>
            <li> They were Huge in length and looked extremely ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting for mine can&#x27;t wait , love dramatic lashes , and I&#x27;ll wear my natrual ones w. Mascara</li>
            <li> Im in love with the dramatic lashes</li>
            <li> i always glued 2 of the thinner lashes together for a more dramatic look..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a dramatic eyelashes fan</li>
            <li> style1 is a more dramatic look for night out etc.</li>
            <li> The thicker ones are definitely more dramatic you would need to cut them</li>
            <li> Enjoy those fake lashes they really bring me out</li>
            <li> The only two negatives that gave it a 4 instead of 5 is that the lashes didn&#x27;t have &#x27;&#x27;pairs&#x27;&#x27; that were the same length (easily fixed with mascara)</li>
            <li> Plastic not human hair as I expected, the don&#x27;t stick to eyelashes very well</li>
            <li> though the price is cheap do not buy these invest in some better ones I hate mine</li>
            <li> i thought these would look more natural looking judging from the picture, but i was wrong.</li>
            <li> The thick lashes are great but the thin ones are like synthetic.</li>
            <li> Their slightly better looking than natural looking fake lashes which is sometimes all I want.</li>
            <li> but they are actually almost like a plastic which was kind of weird.</li>
            <li> but they are actually almost like a plastic which was kind of weird.</li>
            <li> They look like they&#x27;d be super thick, but they actually look quite natural.</li>
            <li> I noticed they were a little stiff even with me bending them and wrapping them around a pencil but its ok.</li>
            <li> Not so pleased with how stiff they are!you need to apply a lot of glue in order for them to stick,and you have to wait a little longer for the glue to become tacky.</li>
            <li> The dramatic ones are very nice but the subtle ones are a bit too natural can barely tell there on</li>
            <li> But for evey day wear you can tell very easily they are fake</li>
            <li> they are long and heavy and the other is ok for an every day look</li>
            <li> They are made out of plastic not actual hair like most false lashes in the us...and they do not come lined with the little sticky strip of light adhesive that other eyelashes sometimes come with...</li>
            <li> Very dramatic and sexy!</li>
            <li> Disliked very much</li>
            <li> I love this because you have a natural long look or dramatic lashes.</li>
            <li> The thick ones were way too dramatic for me, maybe good for Halloween buy not on a normal day.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s so hard to apply the lashes because maybe it&#x27;s just cause I&#x27;m amature but not bad</li>
            <li> They were alright the small ones are great size, but the large ones are a little to dramatic for my taste.</li>
            <li> I had to apply eyeliner around them to make them look at least a little more natural.</li>
            <li> Good product besides the little white strip on the thin lashes</li>
            <li> Only giving it three stars because the more dramatic eyelashes don&#x27;t really stick on &amp; aren&#x27;t super dramatic when their on.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be disappointed if they aren&#x27;t what you like, they were a great deal at $2</li>
            <li> Not worth the $5 I paid haha.</li>
            <li> I like these so much cause they really last me a long time, they&#x27;re long for my eyes</li>
            <li> not so much the second for me but other than that it&#x27;s a five</li>
            <li> The thins lashes make your eyes look long and natural</li>
            <li> I naturally have long eye lashes and have never worn falsies before</li>
            <li> and I need some longer lashes for my first few cosplays.</li>
            <li> I used small scizzors to taper the thicker set and they looked fun for a night out.</li>
            <li> If you treat them with the same hands most woman Ive personally known, treat their false eye lashes with...</li>
            <li> Very fake looking but good for the price.</li>
            <li> She has had to cut a few down to size, but that is pretty much with any of them.</li>
            <li> They look nice online but are very hard to put on and a plastic, not worth</li>
            <li> Depending on how dramatic you want a look, the thick lashes would be great for a night out to go clubbing.</li>
            <li> They cut down to size very well.</li>
            <li> They look like horse lashes that grow straight down</li>
            <li> These were shipped exactly on time and the only issue I have with the shipping is that the boxes containing the lashes were stuffed into an envelope and arrived a little smushed (hence the subtraction of one star).</li>
            <li> These were shipped exactly on time and the only issue I have with the shipping is that the boxes containing the lashes were stuffed into an envelope and arrived a little smushed (hence the subtraction of one star).</li>
            <li> They seem a little big at first</li>
            <li> Shipping took a little long but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I got these a little then what the seller said, but I actually like these lashes at first when it opened them</li>
            <li> Super hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Not to mention they&#x27;re not very long.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I had was that they could have been packaged a bit better, the boxes were crushed!</li>
            <li> These are too stiff, but they are pretty.</li>
            <li> they are pretty stiff.</li>
            <li> It came on time the Shipping was just right, was not sure when I got it</li>
            <li> Flimsy cheap and hard to put on!</li>
            <li> The thicker ones don&#x27;t last anywhere near as long as the thinner ones do.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased but jot worth sending back.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth the actual product.</li>
            <li> The thicker ones are more dramatic but the thinner ones look more fake.</li>
            <li> While they did take awhile to ship, I knew how long it would take when I ordered them and for the crazy good price</li>
            <li> style 1 is SUPER THICK</li>
            <li> I know this may sound dumb</li>
            <li> Style 2 was not long lashes they were very short.</li>
            <li> plus fo me they are jus not long enough like I want.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t like these if you&#x27;re used to lashes that feel natural and comfortable on your eyes, these ones are quite long and inflexible.</li>
            <li> They are not stuck to plastic like normal falsies that you get from Walmart, or other beauty departments.</li>
            <li> the thin eyelashes made my eyelashes long better thicker and longer especially for what I paid for them like 2.00 and some change!</li>
            <li> If your doing a fashion show or going to a event then get it, but a everyday look which i was looking for not good unless u cut it and make sure it blends with your natural eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The thick eyelashes  are perfect for going out and the thin ones you could wear everyday!</li>
            <li> Bad quality, super cheap.</li>
            <li> ok for the price, but not very easy to attach kinda thick plastic to eyelids</li>
            <li> But the band is definitely an..almost paper-y plastic that is not totally black (and not totally clear).</li>
            <li> the thick lashes i personally think they are to bold for me</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap and very hard to bend to the shape of your eyes.</li>
            <li> I love the thick full eyelashes , the only problem with these eye lashes is that they feel so fake</li>
            <li> The less dramatic ones are my favorite!</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s exactly how I expected it to be .</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re full and not as choppy looking as some other sets I have.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t anything special; personally I would never wear them for anything serious or formal.</li>
            <li> The light ones for a regular natural day and the thick ones for a night out !!💁</li>
            <li> A little hard to get out, but the packaging was safe that it came in.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have much to say but bad quality and very cheap.</li>
            <li> Not good for more than one use, unless you are very careful with them.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;natural\\&quot; pair were a little too much for me still.</li>
            <li> I just got two packs of thick ones, which I didn&#x27;t even want in the first place!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one set so far, looks natural, didn&#x27;t stay on long, but that could be due to me not applying them correctly to my eye lid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Who can really deny all these lashes for such little cost?</li>
            <li> Have fun and play hard.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews but these were worth the couple bucks</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t know what all the bad reviews are about, saying these are hard and plastic-y and poke your eyes, these are freaking awesome!</li>
            <li> I usually put glue on the whole lash then apply outside-in, this way the outside of the eyelash dries a little bit first before I apply the inside of it, making them look very equal and proportioned.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a difference in these and other drug store lashes that cost three times as much for a single set.</li>
            <li> On the bright side there are multiples so 3 bent ones isn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> These r great after reading some of the bad reviews i didnt know what to expect but they arrived weeks before expected</li>
            <li> So, I Read The Reviews, Some Good - Some Bad | Blah Blah.</li>
            <li> They just came and the only thing bad I have to say is that the boxes were piled and stuffed into the package, but the good thing is that didn&#x27;t effect the lashes so...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only worn the more natural ones lately, since the others look a bit too thick for just daily wear.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the few bucks I spent on them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the thin ones but not so much the thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used false eyelashes before and these were cheap enough to be a throw-away if they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-a bit long...will have to trim ends, but that is expected for many false lashes&lt;br /&gt;-kind of plasticky.</li>
            <li> but cheap if u use false lashes alot.</li>
            <li> They are a little hard to get on but other than that these eyelashes look natural and cute.</li>
            <li> The Lashes Are SUPER Pretty, The Band Is Just A Little Thin...</li>
            <li> I love them but sometimes hard to put on there stiff bt for a dollar</li>
            <li> I usually wear red cherry or ardell which are more expensive but anyhow after cutting them and shaping them the other pair the natural looking ones look pretty nice</li>
            <li> These are plain and simple and do not look real.</li>
            <li> Very economical way to buy false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> But for someone who likes to use them every other day, and is too impatient to glue them on, it&#x27;s a waste of time ( because I found that it took more effort and time to put them on)</li>
            <li> so you have to color them in with eyeliner or marker, but the bands are so stiff that you can&#x27;t form them to your eye and they stick straight out.</li>
            <li> One pair looks really subtle and the other very bold.</li>
            <li> These lashes were rubbery and would not stick on, even with the most professional and expensive glue!</li>
            <li> You are better off seeking other false lash products.</li>
            <li> At first i was a little skeptical to purchase these eyelashes because they were just so increadibly cheap..</li>
            <li> they are ok to learn with but but are very thin</li>
            <li> The lashes are very long, though I had previously read that in another review before I purchased, so you will have to trim the very ends off.</li>
            <li> The dramatic thick lashes are a bit good but from the side looks hideous.</li>
            <li> the don&#x27;t have the natural curve other lashes have that you buy from the store.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have the natural curvature that other lashes have.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Obviously these flat, strip lashes require a bit of work in order to be useable.</li>
            <li> do not buy if you have big eyes they will not fit, they are also really short in length they look like normal lashes</li>
            <li> I expected to get 10 natural eyelashes and 10 full eyelashes to use on clients.&lt;br /&gt;However, I received two broken boxes of lashes that have all fallen out of the package.</li>
            <li> but I mean what can you expect for $2 right ?</li>
            <li> My roommate and I had to trim them down a little bit, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> But how can I go wrong a month or two worth of lashes for 2$!!</li>
            <li> Very straight and hard to apply but once wrapped around a pencil, I made them work</li>
            <li> That is the point of fake eye lashes to look real and pretty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The thicker lashes (Style 1) can look pretty fake, and I don&#x27;t really use them because of this.</li>
            <li> I only got the regular long lashes</li>
            <li> Enough lashes to last a long time.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the band is pretty thick.</li>
            <li> My product of eye lashes came exactly as I ordered and on time, 10 pairs of regular and 10 thick.</li>
            <li> otherwise a little black piece sticks out on either end but depending on how you do your eyeliner that might be useful.</li>
            <li> The thick lashes are hands down UNWEARABLE, unless you want to look like some sort of cheap hooker.</li>
            <li> the other pair are way more dramatic will wear them maybe when I go out.</li>
            <li> Awesome for dramatic or casual looks!</li>
            <li> It came pretty fast but it irritated my eyes pretty badly and they were even puffy and pink on my lids</li>
            <li> Of course as stated in other reviews, it is necessary to cut them a bit shorter before applying due to how long they are but it gives you options as to how much lash you want on a given day.</li>
            <li> These are worth the price, dirt cheap because they are dirty poor in quality, I&#x27;ll give you that much.</li>
            <li> At first, they can be hard to put on.</li>
            <li> I cut them in half and wear them on the outside of each eye and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know why those that are giving negative reviews thought that for $2 or less these lashes were going to be wispy, realistic looking lashes.</li>
            <li> I completely lost my eyelashes to chemotherapy and they&#x27;re still growing back and are a mess.</li>
            <li> yet this is pretty common for all the lashes i think.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very durable lashes usually if I wear lashes after awhile</li>
            <li> One box looked sort of natural and the other box looked like snooki eyelashes (not natural at ALL).</li>
            <li> not to long but not too short either.</li>
            <li> as well only thing I don&#x27;t like is the long strain of hair that comes on the sides.</li>
            <li> extra long</li>
            <li> a 2nd chance in hopes I wouldn&#x27;t have the same issue as the first round, but man O man did this seller mess up.&lt;br /&gt;First off - 1st order never came.</li>
            <li> But they do last long.  </li>
            <li> The regular long eyelashes are a bit longer than I thought they were going to be</li>
            <li> the seller asking why it would take so long to be shipped, (before I received my order) and they promptly got back to me and explained that it was because they are being shipped from Hong Kong.  </li>
            <li> These lashes are flat instead of curved to sit well on the eyelid</li>
            <li> they face downward because in the packaging they are layed completely flat agains the box.</li>
            <li> Also they&#x27;re flat</li>
            <li> The only problem is how long they take to get here but</li>
            <li> -Ive tried various glues and only the inner tend to semi stick and from the center out</li>
            <li> Third, you have to cut the edges because they are extremely long and when you remove them from the package part of the cartboard is stuck to the eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The lashes come in a box where they lay flat, so they don&#x27;t mold to your eyes the way they should.</li>
            <li> They last long.</li>
            <li> I probably will only use the natural thin ones since the thicker ones are too much for me</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s always a thick and a thin pair, but some look more natural than others.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I think it&#x27;s worth it in the long run if you are a fan of false eyelashes in general.</li>
            <li> the thick ones are very glamorous!</li>
            <li> The strips have to be trimmed and the bases are pretty thick.</li>
            <li> The only complaints that I had were that they were very stiff and very shiny.</li>
            <li> These look like a good deal but eyelashes are very stiff and difficult to put on.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes were very nice for the price but not all of them were the exact same length but its not really an issue, they came earlier than expected but my one issue was i was never able to track this product which is alittle annoying seeming as i&#x27;d like to know</li>
            <li> The other set however is reasonable to add a little extra *plink plink* lashes for a night out.  </li>
            <li> Not good at all waste of money though cheap dont recommend get more expensive ones</li>
            <li> but i use the thick lashes because they look better and arent hard to put on.</li>
            <li> false lashes do require a little trimming, but that&#x27;s easy enough and only takes a couple of seconds.</li>
            <li> They are completely flat with no curve to them AT ALL!</li>
            <li> I may update my rating when/if they get here but a month later is just too long!</li>
            <li> I mean why pay higher price, theyre gonna end up in the trash.</li>
            <li> The only thing I did not like is on the thicker set they are extremely long!</li>
            <li> Lash line is really thick making them hard to stick and they look really fake, kind of a waste to still have so many</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but they don&#x27;t seem to be lasting very long.</li>
            <li> the more natural lashes aren&#x27;t as bad</li>
            <li> The lashes are also attached to a black string instead of something clear like you would see if you bought a pack of lashes at the store.</li>
            <li> I had to blow dry them on low heat to curve them and the box was in terrable shape.</li>
            <li> These are the most cheap eyelashes I have ever purchesd the quality is awful</li>
            <li> But more importantly the lashes themselves were TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> They look terribly fake and are not that easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> However, the actual lashes are cheap and somehow twisted in the track.</li>
            <li> they feel fake but at the same time it was cheap</li>
            <li> I love the thin wispy style I wear them everyday I have not tried the glam ones</li>
            <li> This takes a few tries before you get really efficient at it</li>
            <li> Full, long, thick lashes are always in style, but applying false lashes daily isn’t always practical and is very time consuming.  </li>
            <li> I loved the eyelashes the thick eyelashes looked fake&#x27;ish</li>
            <li> The thick lashes were too thick and did not stay on my eyes for more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re not the best quality but certainly not the worst for that price</li>
            <li> No need to keep buying single lashes that cost 5 or 7 dollars a set, that you will only use once.</li>
            <li> but I have found eyelashes that cost $5 for a single pair that was the same quality as these!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m just going to use the deformed ones as smaller single lashes and cut them up.</li>
            <li> I would recommend cutting them in half if you don&#x27;t like the dramatic look.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great product!&lt;br /&gt;Update; the dramatic lashes are super dramatic and harder to stay on, you need a really good glue.</li>
            <li> The problem for me was the stiff band made it so they would pop up on the ends worse than most eyelashes do.</li>
            <li> The only down side was that I had to cut the width of them because they were a little too wide, but that may not be a bad thing for you dolls who have big, gorgeous eyes!</li>
            <li> Not very natural looking at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The strips are very stiff and straight, so they don&#x27;t curve with your eyelid.</li>
            <li> These lashes are very stiff along the lash line, so they don&#x27;t contour to my eyes very well and are unconfortable</li>
            <li> They last longer through water, since you have so many and for such a low price I don&#x27;t feel bad about throwing a pair away.</li>
            <li> The thick one was a little intense but the thinner one looked natural!</li>
            <li> Packaging was pretty ridiculous</li>
            <li> What a view in the picture is what I came cantidad.en equal and quality is same as buying other brand.</li>
            <li> it looks so fake but the other ones are ok</li>
            <li> these eyelashed arent even made out of real hair, and the lash band is actually very thick so its very hard to conseal without putting on a huge cat eye.</li>
            <li> but since they have a very thin band they are soo easy to apply.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are very long and very thick, but very pretty.</li>
            <li> These are too firm to put on and not long enough from corner to corner (and I have tiny eyes!)</li>
            <li> and the thin style looks absolutely real!!</li>
            <li> I cut mine down a little, as I usually do and they worked fine.  </li>
            <li> I really like how you get both dramatic and natural in one to vary, depending on the occasion.</li>
            <li> The thick ones are really dramatic, and they have a nice quality(ish).&lt;br /&gt;Natural</li>
            <li> no more beauty supply lashes for me with their high prices.</li>
            <li> They dont have any curve to them they are stick straight making them hard to apply.</li>
            <li> They are made of hard plastic that can&#x27;t be curled so they stick straight out.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell if they are real or not.</li>
            <li> Very unnatural and hard</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look real, they look too shiny and hard and plastic.</li>
            <li> Very synthetic and hard to apply</li>
            <li> The strips for the darker thicker ones are too rigid and it is hard to work with the whole strip.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable fit.</li>
            <li> I guess if you don&#x27;t mind cutting them and making them look better</li>
            <li> after I realized cutting them into 3 pieces was better for me.</li>
            <li> Theyre uncomfortable and dont fit well...</li>
            <li> The think ones are really long</li>
            <li> Theme wait was really long..</li>
            <li> Way too long for any order if you ask me.</li>
            <li> It took so long</li>
            <li> and there really long what a shame</li>
            <li> The so called long lashes  are NOT at all long</li>
            <li> A complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> the only complain is that my box that my lashes came in was crushed</li>
            <li> But for the price, I&#x27;m not surprised.</li>
            <li> They took long and were smashed</li>
            <li> The natural curve was missing so I couldn&#x27;t attach them correctly.</li>
            <li> It Came WAY Earlier Than Expected &amp;</li>
            <li> I took one star off because of the how long it took to receive.</li>
            <li> It did state that it could take long, so don&#x27;t expect them any sooner than that.</li>
            <li> They around a couple weeks earlier than I expected</li>
            <li> they came earlier than expected</li>
            <li> However a lot of them were flattened and it took a long time to un flatten them, hence the loss of one star.</li>
            <li> They are way too long.</li>
            <li> Too long for me.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not very flexible which means that you may need constant checking to ensure they&#x27;re still on every hour.</li>
            <li> It took wayyyyyyyyyy to long to receive them.</li>
            <li> I thought these would take an incredibly long time to get to my house</li>
            <li> so I added the long eyelashes and glued them together</li>
            <li> Also, they are really long.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> They look so soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> Too long u need to cut sides..  </li>
            <li> Lots of long lashes.  </li>
            <li> THE STRIPS ARE WAY TO LONG AND WILL HAVE TO BE CLIPPED</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re enterily too long, and I don&#x27;t see how anyone could wear these..</li>
            <li> It took quite a long time to come.</li>
            <li> my daughters just snipped the lil long edges</li>
            <li> it shipped and arrived way earlier than expected</li>
            <li> AND LONG they feel like butterfly wings.</li>
            <li> Too long halloween material and not like what i get at pharmacy, threw away.</li>
            <li> The product got here a lot sooner than expected, though I can&#x27;t say that will be the same for everyone.</li>
            <li> They are long.</li>
            <li> I suggest not purchasing these eyelashes if you&#x27;re looking for an everyday or natural wear.</li>
            <li> Even with the minor defects I&#x27;ll be buying again.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re a bit long for me</li>
            <li> They are LONG so if you don&#x27;t like long these aren&#x27;t for you..</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I wear the natural for everyday and the fuller ones when going out.</li>
            <li> I must say if you are one that has to have her long eyelashes</li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivery time took long.</li>
            <li> long lasting&lt;</li>
            <li> I ordered these &amp; my rough week was instantly</li>
            <li> so expect a long ship time.</li>
            <li> Also they are reallllly long.</li>
            <li> I also waited way too long for this product.</li>
            <li> The only thing is I expected the eyelash glue to come with them.</li>
            <li> However a bit to long I needed to cut them a bit.</li>
            <li> I like that they were long for every size</li>
            <li> Took quite a long time for shipping, but I received them just as pictured.</li>
            <li> They are veeeery long.</li>
            <li> Nothing was damaged, came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Lashes were extremely long.</li>
            <li> I just got the product I like this and the  fact that it didn&#x27;t take that long to get it here for the price</li>
            <li> but it did took long , but you can understand when they shipping from china to united states , but either way the packaging didn&#x27;t took 100% of care with these items i received</li>
            <li> But yes it&#x27;s definitely not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plastic, like not soft at all</li>
            <li> They took so long to ship I</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The eyelash strip part is also too long for your eyes&lt;</li>
            <li> and i understand why it takes so long , they are shipped all the way from hong kong</li>
            <li> because they are too long.</li>
            <li> They would not stay on no matter what they are really long</li>
            <li> Too long and kinda looks plastic when your eye lids are lowered.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected and also stay on all day ...</li>
            <li> Also, lashes are way way too long,  and do not adhere well.</li>
            <li> shipping took too long but you get what u paid</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t like how long it took for me to get them.</li>
            <li> these are not as advertised...definately not real looking, they look like plastic actually.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The thinner ones are not that long.</li>
            <li> nor how long it took...</li>
            <li> The only thing is they did come crushed in the mail</li>
            <li> and they dont look too long, nor too thin, nor too thick, nor too fake, They&#x27;re absolutely perfect!!</li>
            <li> Shipping takes way too long.</li>
            <li> the track is long</li>
            <li> It took 6 wks to come then every last one was crushed to pieces.  </li>
            <li> Just took a long time to get them.</li>
            <li> Only reason I have to switch them up is if I brake one or get them wet.</li>
            <li> You have fairly long to long lashes already.</li>
            <li> This way you dont need to trim them and they still have that uneven natural length of lashes.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> They may be too long when I go to put them on</li>
            <li> and my eyes pop, especially while having my features drowned out in grey face</li>
            <li> but they are so thick and straight.</li>
            <li> As someone who absolutely loves false lashes and gets them every chance they can, the chance to get twenty pairs for such a low price was a godsend.</li>
            <li> Looks real when on, even the thick lashes, no mascara is needed.</li>
            <li> Really cheap of course, but totally not what I was expecting, not the everyday false lashes</li>
            <li> The band is too thick and you have to use so much glue to keep it in place.</li>
            <li> The thick ones are plastic, and they do not glue very well.</li>
            <li> I bought these false eyelashes just for fun.</li>
            <li> They are a bit long in width and generally need cut down.</li>
            <li> The thick eyelashes are nice and very thick, and I haven&#x27;t tried the other ones yet.</li>
            <li> Plain strung together lashes in a natural and</li>
            <li> Not great in quality, but I needed some to practice with, and they were the right price.</li>
            <li> Exactly as shown and described only thing is not very sticking very hard to put on your eyes.</li>
            <li> They are also very long so you have to trim them unless you have exceptionally long</li>
            <li> Had to hold lash in place for glue to dry for waaaaay to long.</li>
            <li> The bolder lashes are not easily blended with natural lases and they are not as flexible.</li>
            <li> I am happy this product was only two dollars, I was very disappointed when I received it in the mail.</li>
            <li> First if all, they never give me the other eyelashes, just the thick one.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy these unless you plan on giving them to a bunch of three year olds for dress up for a playdate they&#x27;re very poorly made they look cheap</li>
            <li> Style 1 lashes look nice in the picture but are actually quite difficult to wear only because of the poor quality of the plastic lash strip.</li>
            <li> I LOVE fake lashes!</li>
            <li> They did take a bit long for delivery!</li>
            <li> The lashes were cut way too long, had no adhesive on them, and didn&#x27;t stick when adhesive was added!  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t remove it but other that that i would definitely buy these again ....</li>
            <li> Why does it take so long to arrive?!</li>
            <li> They came in earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> They do have the little bit extra backbone, but once again, it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my eyelashes, and either no one has noticed or doesn&#x27;t mention it, but nobody has asked if they were fake!</li>
            <li> Although I was excited about the quantity of the lashes for the price I paid, I am not impressed with the quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked and worked with each one to try and get them to contour to my eye lid but find myself constantly having to reapply glue and/or adhesive to one end or the other in hopes they will stick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did, I would&#x27;ve been mad if I listened to what others&#x27; said.</li>
            <li> These bump up your style, pop the eyes open wide, go well for almost any occasion!</li>
            <li> But the lashes are kind of hard and uncomfortable on the lid.</li>
            <li> i like the thiner eyelashes but the thick onces are too hard and dont bend to fit your eyelash shape</li>
            <li> so my eyelashes aren&#x27;t very long.</li>
            <li> they are very long</li>
            <li> Although I cannot complain about the price, these are very long, and non-natural.</li>
            <li> I will not be buying lashes for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Took a very long time to get them</li>
            <li> Took very long for them product to arrive.</li>
            <li> so it takes a very long time to get.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re very long and have a lot of volume</li>
            <li> I also appreciate the ability to customize the different sets of lashes and because there are so many, I don&#x27;t feel bad if I lose a pair.</li>
            <li> But overall it&#x27;s not too bad either. :)</li>
            <li> I like the thick ones for a fuller dramatic night look, and the thin ones if I want to be extra fab during the day the don&#x27;t look like you&#x27;ve stuck your finger in socket and electrocuted your self LOL.</li>
            <li> So although they stayed dry (it&#x27;s WA State after all)</li>
            <li> I only paid $2 dollars but not very well spent.  </li>
            <li> The thicker ones felt heavy on my eyelids and the thinner ones were the same length as my actual eyelashes.</li>
            <li> my wife loves them only issue is they get a tiny bit heavy after a while of wear she says.</li>
            <li> These were the first experience I had with fake eyelashes and the first time I tried to put them on I thought they were ineffective and hated them; however, I bought a better eyelash adhesive and looked up a tutorial and finally got it.</li>
            <li> I have bought a few sets of lashes from my local drug store that cost the same price for one pair that I paid for all 20 pairs.</li>
            <li> but I only got 1 box of the thick ones and 5 of the natural ones.</li>
            <li> They were for a baby doll not a live person.</li>
            <li> the thick ones are pretty much for parties or dramatic makeup.</li>
            <li> I will never buy single sets of lashes again.</li>
            <li> I go through lashes alot, and found myself buying these two styles in the single packs.</li>
            <li> I might as well have flushed three bucks down the toilet, they are a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Easy one day lashes, the only bad thing about them is you have to cut the inside and outside of the lashes due to them being too long</li>
            <li> The less dramatic ones really do look natural.</li>
            <li> and i usually wnt wear those everyday,the naturals were a bit to natural for me</li>
            <li> I opened the package after it arrived WAY past two day shipping and threw them directly into the trash.  </li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re soft and don&#x27;t stab the eye and aren&#x27;t heavy either!</li>
            <li> They are long, and wide.</li>
            <li> Poor quality compared to higher priced lashes.</li>
            <li> This was my first time EVER trying out false eyelashes</li>
            <li> It was a little hard for me to get them on at first</li>
            <li> Further down in the review, I&#x27;ll be posting pictures</li>
            <li> the packaging was horrid and the lashes down the left side are all bent with hairs poking in every direction.</li>
            <li> I like it only down side is it doesn&#x27;t come with glue</li>
            <li> Shipping came in earlier than expected !!</li>
            <li> These took way to long to get processed and shipped!!</li>
            <li> The lashes have absolutely NO curve to them and they are so stiff which makes it even more difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> When I opened the boxes to the lashes I noticed they were a bit long, but no big deal I just had to cut them a little.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it&#x27;s a little long</li>
            <li> The cut is very straight and all the lashes are the same length which makes them look very clownish, not beautiful and dramatic.</li>
            <li> The thick ones are definitely not for everyday wear but the thin ones seem so authentic.</li>
            <li> Definitely not high quality and the shipping took forever.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if they&#x27;re longer lasting than other false eyelashes, because I tend to throw them away after every use.  </li>
            <li> so if I mess a single lash up here and there I dont have to throw away an entire set, I can just grab another one and move on.  </li>
            <li> They shipped pretty fast, and for the price, these lashes are not that bad</li>
            <li> Not realistic looking</li>
            <li> there is a white like tape that is inside the strip which makes you probably have to wear ALOT of black eye makeup to cover it</li>
            <li> They are not realistic at all to me.  </li>
            <li> Had to find some liquid black eyeliner to cover the white.</li>
            <li> I clip them in half and apply them to the outside corners of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> However when I got the package about half of them were dented because it wasn&#x27;t packaged properly.</li>
            <li> Also I didn&#x27;t have to use any eyeliner because they were dark enough, giving a wide eye effect.  </li>
            <li> , it said &amp;#34;phone case package&amp;#34; and smushed the eyelashes:/ it also arrived like a month and a half later.</li>
            <li> i cut them in half and only wear them in the corner to create a cat eyeliner</li>
            <li> The band is super thin!</li>
            <li> Poorly made..not thick enough or long enough.fall apart quickly after wearing them once.</li>
            <li> Which is kind of bad because they&#x27;re hooker lashes, hands down.</li>
            <li> With a good quality lash adhesive, these aren&#x27;t bad!</li>
            <li> Thick pretty much to the point of absurd, unless you are going for &amp;#34;doll-like&amp;#34; or cartoonish, you probably won&#x27;t use them.  </li>
            <li> I was nervous about ordering this product online especially since I&#x27;m new to using false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The boxes arrived a little smooshed, but considering that I spent less than $2.00 on them, not including the shipping, I wasn&#x27;t all that surprised or concerned.</li>
            <li> The boxes arrived a little smooshed, but considering that I spent less than $2.00 on them, not including the shipping, I wasn&#x27;t all that surprised or concerned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all of how you care for them, but the are typically single day use!</li>
            <li> The longer thicker eyelashes are very dramatic, and with some patience the thin ones are a more natural alternative.</li>
            <li> I get complements all the time on it on the dramatic looking ones and the one that&#x27;s not so dramatic, i tend to double up even triple up on lashes because I love the fullness of it.</li>
            <li> The dramatic looking lashes looks intimidating at first with</li>
            <li> The ones on the left are especially thick and very pretty when on the eye.&lt;br /&gt;Con:</li>
            <li> The lashes themselves were in their proper places except for a few that had gotten loose and despite them probably being shipped that way, were not flattened at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The elastic is more firm than American quality lashes, so by cutting it in half</li>
            <li> And my other problem is that the lashes are too straight, which makes them hard to put on because one side goes up and then the other one which is extremely aggravating.</li>
            <li> Only thing is work them a little before applying(use</li>
            <li> Only had to trim them a little.</li>
            <li> The have a little extra wiring (I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s called) to keep them in place that you have to cut off.</li>
            <li> it took a little over 3 wks to here,no biggie,I knew they were being shipped internationally</li>
            <li> I cut them a little but looking back didn&#x27;t need to for my eyes</li>
            <li> They seem a little big</li>
            <li> a little extra trimming doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> Theyre a little too big and they don&#x27;t come with glue</li>
            <li> The glue line on these are a little thicker than store bought lashes so it gives you a little extra room for glue, so if anything they last longer.</li>
            <li> I suppose a little care, the structure will go back into place.</li>
            <li> Especially the dark, pointed ones!  </li>
            <li> I thought they would be a little smaller .</li>
            <li> horrible , super stiff the glue was ok.</li>
            <li> The box was a little crushed, but only one eyelash was harmed</li>
            <li> They are hard they have paper on them like cardboard they DONT LOOK NATURAL  </li>
            <li> These are made completely of semi hard plastic including the part you are to glue to your lid.</li>
            <li> The more dramatic ones are slightly difficult to bend the band to put on, and can sometimes pop up if not curled for long enough.</li>
            <li> They are hardly noticeable to feel while wearing and last all day with even a simple whit glue by revelon!&lt;br</li>
            <li> they are bone straight so its hard to put them on when good eyelashes curve JUS AWFUL</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why there&#x27;s so many bad reviews.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll be ordering more after I use these bad boys up</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have a reaction and you want some cheap lashes to practice with or use occasionally they aren&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I really feel the only difference in these and expensive brands is that these are synthetic.</li>
            <li> , I softly bent each one I tried to put on for at least 2 minutes and STILL struggled with getting them to stick.</li>
            <li> First of all, it took a LONG time to ship, and they looked really fake.</li>
            <li> I tried to cut them hoping I could use them as partial lashes(just</li>
            <li> These lashes are plastic and not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> They werent what i expected...</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t realize that these were coming from china and the expected delivery date started 25 days after I ordered it</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t exactly as I expected</li>
            <li> Expected Delivery date was no sooner than July 25th.  </li>
            <li> box was crushed when I got it, the lashes fell apart when I tried to apply them.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, but wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> theyre 10 of them in each box &amp; theyre not as wide as you think theyre are.</li>
            <li> Also, I ended getting pink eye from using these lashes, but I just put eye drops and it went away.</li>
            <li> For everyday use I wear the regular lashes.</li>
            <li> The thicker ones obviously feel heavy on your eyelids, but they compliment well.</li>
            <li> No harm done, not too much $$ spent</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money, don&#x27;t buy this unless you plan on using it once and throwing it out.</li>
            <li> Not what I&#x27;d expected</li>
            <li> Total waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I recieved just what I expected.</li>
            <li> few things to know before buying these(to avoid any possible disappointment)&lt;br /&gt;-they&#x27;re made from plastic.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these for creating a wide range of looks.</li>
            <li> I guess...for a drag queen</li>
            <li> The box was crushed and smashed.</li>
            <li> No boxes were crushed.</li>
            <li> No real feeling at all</li>
            <li> Not at all like I expected.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s to be expected coming from another country.</li>
            <li> /&gt;just be careful when putting them on.</li>
            <li> I dont care too much for the thin ones tho&#x27;.</li>
            <li> so i bought some regular eyelash glue and the eyelashes are so heavy, that the eyelash would just pop off.</li>
            <li> With these eyelashes I have not only wasted my money but my time on trying to put them on.</li>
            <li> My expected delivery date was 11/13-12/2</li>
            <li> I did receive them about a week before the expected date.</li>
            <li> this is not what i expected all kinds of glues dont even stick...</li>
            <li> The shipping was as expected.</li>
            <li> But i should have expected it for how inexpensive.</li>
            <li> But when they came in the mail, like I said before, a month later, the boxes were smashed and torn, damaging a few of the lashes.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> This product was not as expected.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re made of material that&#x27;s a lil bit harsher than i expected , there made of plastic.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the thicker ones, but the thinner ones are plastic and not very noticeable.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> When I got my package the box was crushed thank goodness</li>
            <li> not what i expected they look and feel plastic</li>
            <li> too thin to even really get glue on...</li>
            <li> They came sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer style2 for everyday use(since</li>
            <li> they are not real hair</li>
            <li> Harder to put on</li>
            <li> Came at the expected time because it was sent from a didferent country.</li>
            <li> and I used the heavy set ONLY for costumes (Ballet &amp; Cosplay).  </li>
            <li> Not much else to say about this product.</li>
            <li> The lashes themselves are plastic-y and not very hair like.</li>
            <li> I wear lashes almost everyday and these just collected dust for months until I finally threw them out.  </li>
            <li> Came WAYYY sooner then expected (:</li>
            <li> Eyelashes took almost 2 months to arrive and the lashes wasn&#x27;t what I expected and used to.</li>
            <li> If u get them wet</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I got a plastic bag ripped open with nothing in it.</li>
            <li> They look like plastic its not what I expected</li>
            <li> Shipping time was to be expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really feeling it.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Received these absolutely crushed.</li>
            <li> these are not what was expected they are glued in to the package.</li>
            <li> they do not come with gkue as expected, and they do need to be trimmed.</li>
            <li> Not really as luxurious as I thought they would be</li>
            <li> I tried the natural pair, but removed them because I did not want to use eyeliner, which I think is going to be necessary with false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the thick ones only the regular size.</li>
            <li> I like the think set for going out and clubbing but the regular natural are a lil thin</li>
            <li> They are too thick and they don&#x27;t look natural at all.</li>
            <li> You can always personalize them and cut them down if its too long.  </li>
            <li> They are pretty much hard to put them on once I tried them on(#ﾟДﾟ)ｺﾞﾙｧ!!</li>
            <li> but if you want that super dramatic look then it will work for you as is!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed, but I did some what expect them to be less than amazing.</li>
            <li> Oh, and they&#x27;re made entirely out of stiff plastic.</li>
            <li> let me make this plain and simple...</li>
            <li> cant tell they are fake if you use the ones on the right</li>
            <li> The only thing some people might have trouble with is the lash band is a little stiff &amp; hard to work with at first</li>
            <li> but I cut the lashes in half and put the long ends on each eye</li>
            <li> also these lashes are exact opposite style 2 is very thick too thick</li>
            <li> One can definitely tell that you can get two look from them, a natural &amp; dramatic look.</li>
            <li> the thick ones are a really dramatic and huge.</li>
            <li> i used the dramatic looking ones and they looked good and not too crazy.</li>
            <li> These are huge, too long, too thick, plastic and they def look too fake.</li>
            <li> They are pretty a little thin</li>
            <li> They were harder to put on than the other drug store ones.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li> you nay have to clip the ends because they are a little bit too long and careful taking them out the box part</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re soooo pretty (only the thick ones, the thin lashes are flimsy af and unwearable)</li>
            <li> They take a little longer than usual to put on as they are stiff and straight.</li>
            <li> I had to cut the second box down a little bit</li>
            <li> I only wear these for special photographs because they&#x27;re very thick and dramatic so that they show up well when photographed.</li>
            <li> Poor quality super fake look plastic and like size and half normal eyelashes length</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason they&#x27;re so cheap obviously, I was totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m almost out of the long thin ones they look extremely natural</li>
            <li> My only complaint about these lashes is that unlike the human ones I get, these are less flexible so you feel them when you put them on.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to try fake lashes and now I bought a whole bunches for less than one pair I can purchase from the local drug store.</li>
            <li> but they look half way decent with some mascara and a thick black winged liner/cat eye.</li>
            <li> Only got long not the thick in package but for $2 can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> B00538TSMU 20 Pairs Regular Long and Thick Eyelashes Style 1 and 2]]</li>
            <li> 20 pairs regular long and thick eyelashes</li>
            <li> 20 Pairs Regular Long and Thick Eyelashes Style 1 and 2</li>
            <li> I like my pairs regular long and thick eyelashes by DPNY</li>
            <li> the 20 Pairs Regular Long and Thick Eyelashes Style 1 and 2 arrived as advertised and as pictured</li>
            <li> bought &amp;#34;20 Pairs Regular Long and Thick Eyelashes Style 1 and 2&amp;#34</li>
            <li> thicker ones are impossible to work with because the &amp;#34;seem&amp;#34; of the eyelash does bend enough to shape to the eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;The thinner ones are better but the extra lining is pointless and makes it hard to attach.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> box they came in was a little beat up, but they came a little earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Although Are A Little To Long</li>
            <li> they are a little long</li>
            <li> They were just a little long for my eyes</li>
            <li> It can be a little too long</li>
            <li> Trim off the ends as they are a little long...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super thin and hard to put on.</li>
            <li> The lashes are a little hard to apply at first, but once you get them to stick, they are firm and give you a glamorous look!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them to anyone looking to purchase false eye lashes</li>
            <li> The dramatic lashes are a bit harsh for normal day use, but the regular ones are</li>
            <li> the inner bubble rap was the one who caused a little damage to the eyelashes pack, based on what i saw i think that it is because they rapped the bubble rap too tight on the eyelashes box, and</li>
            <li> 10 of the lashes are super thick and the other 10 are thin but longer.</li>
            <li> The thick lash are way to hard to put on and the thin lashes are easier and look better.</li>
            <li> they came in sooner than I expected!</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Maybe for other people they would work.</li>
            <li> It was pretty difficult to get these on.</li>
            <li> Some of the lashes are longer than the other you have to mix n match.</li>
            <li> Other than that the price for this product is anazing</li>
            <li> other than that theyre oaky .</li>
            <li> I recommend no one to buy these, they are not like the ones you buy at CVS or the drug store very fake and cheaply made.</li>
            <li> other lashes cost well over the price I paid for these</li>
            <li> Just like any other eye lashes you&#x27;d buy at the store.</li>
            <li> I give the other ones to a Friend.</li>
            <li> They feel pretty fake.</li>
            <li> Poorly made, honestly it was a waste of my money, they are still just sitting in a drawer in my bathroom and are useless</li>
            <li> DUE</li>
            <li> Also, they were shipped in an envelope and were extremely squished when I received them.</li>
            <li> I usually wear human hair eyelashes</li>
            <li> and the other ones I kept and use every once in a while.</li>
            <li> the thin ones are great they look natural but the other ones look HORRIBLE !</li>
            <li> However the other look like they belong at a Halloween store</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of other things on amozon</li>
            <li> Even the 20 cents I spent on this was not worth it.</li>
            <li> Product can end up looking pretty fake</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if the other reviews are written by the company.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have any problem gluing them on like I read in other reviews.</li>
            <li> The other reviews convince me and I am satified.</li>
            <li> They work like regular other lashes when I put them on, so I&#x27;m not sure what people were talking about.</li>
            <li> They work like any other type of eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> The shipping was faster than expected!</li>
            <li> and I believe it was entirely due to the stiffness of the band.</li>
            <li> The only issued I had was the stiffness, but you can usually fix it with an eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am using fake eyelashes</li>
            <li> They arrived before due date.</li>
            <li> The other ones are so flimsy, i shared both with my sister, and she got a wear each out of them.</li>
            <li> Just what was expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to bother with the other ones.</li>
            <li> When I received the box it was empty!</li>
            <li> Very low quality lashes even compared to inexpensive drug store off brands my wife has bought in the past to do in a pinch.  </li>
            <li> We didnt expect MAC brand cosmetics quality she usually buys but did expect a reasonably middle of the road and usable product</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ll give them a shot on the other hand</li>
            <li> and once you cut and adjust them to your eye shape they look just like any other lashed ive bought from the store.</li>
            <li> The estimated delivery (~1 month) seemed a little bit long; yet I received the package within 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I dont know what to say other than my sister puts them on all the time</li>
            <li> Due to the quality of the other reviews, I would say that you could still buy this, but it&#x27;s a gamble.</li>
            <li> Some of the lashes were damaged and bent due to the packaging.</li>
            <li> I would glue one side of the lash and the other side would unstick.</li>
            <li> so it makes for a very uncomfortable fit.</li>
            <li> and so they never look lopsided after you put them on, as other lashes.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the time &amp; money spent.</li>
            <li> i got no thick lashes, they&#x27;re all thin.</li>
            <li> They mess up in the box only a few are still usable</li>
            <li> I also ordered the other set of 10, ao</li>
            <li> I just wish they were made from human hair and weren&#x27;t synthetic :/</li>
            <li> I will buy other one if I run out this.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re perfeft other than the strings I have to cut off</li>
            <li> I like these lashes although they come with the other type of lashes I don&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> They came in way before the due date.</li>
            <li> I had no problem with packaging or any other problems.</li>
            <li> These lashes a bit bit rough since the bands are dark plastic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> thicker ones on the other hand....</li>
            <li> The other pairs were sustainable.</li>
            <li> Other than that no issues with the eyelashes themselves</li>
            <li> I think they could work for other things like a performance at school or something like that.</li>
            <li> First time impression I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> one makes my eyelashes thicker and the other pair just makes them look longer.</li>
            <li> But you do have to cut the sides of the lashes a bit but other</li>
            <li> Very rough.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the strips was so hard and rough that it wouldn&#x27;t curve around your eyes.</li>
            <li> Im new with wearing false eyelashes</li>
            <li> They are a bit stiff and quite long after opening, so I roll the lashes between my fingers and cut the ends off a bit before I put them on.</li>
            <li> They are a bit stiff and quite long after opening, so I roll the lashes between my fingers and cut the ends off a bit before I put them on.</li>
            <li> The bad: chuncks of lashes easily comes of the strip.</li>
            <li> Holy cow, I cannot even begin.</li>
            <li> There to long to think and very black</li>
            <li> the only thing I hate was they look cheap and plastic</li>
            <li> I have never really had a problem with the product, though sometimes some of the lashes come bent into odd shapes.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting them into thirds and halves, so they will last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that</li>
            <li> Yes they were  slightly longer than expected</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are super heavy and the adhesive strip is so thick that you can totally tell you are wearing fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> ordered this item because I wanted an inexpensive alternatives to buying individually sold false eyelashes which range from $1.50 to $4.00 in my local beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> I will say they are just a little stiff and can have an especially plastic-like shine at some points, so they may not be for you if that&#x27;s an issue.</li>
            <li> One single eyelash was also missing, so I returned it.</li>
            <li> Could not bare the pain past 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> The band is very stiff and I bend it around my finger several times to loosen it up.  </li>
            <li> Low quality and very stiff ...</li>
            <li> so it is very hard to put on and make them look natural.</li>
            <li> My only disenchantment was that the natural lashes are very thin.  </li>
            <li> The thin eye lashes are ok, but the thick ones were hard and stiff.</li>
            <li> I never usually wear fake eyelashes because I myself have long eyelashes</li>
            <li> :  One box is ALL thick and the other is ALL regular....</li>
            <li> Boxes got a little crushed but all the lashes were in tact and usable.</li>
            <li> They are a little harder to work than the lashes I used to buy</li>
            <li> plus when I received them,the packaging was bent and a little crushed at the ends.</li>
            <li> Packaging is cardboard &amp; a little crushed, but no worries.</li>
            <li> If u cut them off its hard for you to put the eyelash back into the case .</li>
            <li> For first timers using fake eyelashes it may be a little nerve racking but here is how I apply..</li>
            <li> The only thing is it&#x27;s kinda hard to get them out of the package.</li>
            <li> Hard to put on I finally gave up and gave them to my niece</li>
            <li> hard to mold them so the inner corner part keeps coming up.</li>
            <li> I dnt think these eyelashes are made from human hair, one, two, for some reason they are so hard to stick from the corners.</li>
            <li> Took a month to get n when I finally recieved the lashes where sooooo hard felt like sythenthic hair.</li>
            <li> I just got these today &amp; they are super fake!</li>
            <li> I even bought a very high end expensive glue to try to make it work, yet it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> They are long lasting, reusable (for weeks), very thick lash line not flimsy.</li>
            <li> The cheap box they come in wouldn&#x27;t be bad</li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews before I bought them and even though some were bad, I couldn&#x27;t resist the temptation for cheap lashes.</li>
            <li> These are made out of some sort of cheap plastic and are just bad.  </li>
            <li> Bad quality, didn&#x27;t like them, can&#x27;t wear them, makes u look like a cheap doll.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not to fake looking but not to real looking .</li>
            <li> You can really tell they are fake when you put them on</li>
            <li> The eyelashes look so fake they kept having a straight shape instead of curvy</li>
            <li> I usually can&#x27;t keep them on for too long and will tear them off because it&#x27;ll fall off partway thru the night.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is they took what seemed like forever to come in , 2 weeks or longer</li>
            <li> Idk why ppl keep saying they are not worth 1$.</li>
            <li> eh not worth it</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see anything wrong with them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would just stick with the dark lashes.</li>
            <li> AVERAGE  BUY</li>
            <li> they suck and were not worth the money</li>
            <li> The dark ones feel somewhat unnatural but after wearing I became adjusted to the feel.  </li>
            <li> The lashes do not bend very well so it is extremely difficult to keep them curved to the shape of your eyes.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes some of the lashes will have weird glue on them or will be bent, but for the price these work really well.</li>
            <li> and i only have one complaint.</li>
            <li> Not worth waiting a month for.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re not worth even the effort of trying to put them on your eyes not worth my time and effort to try to return them</li>
            <li> Not worth the purchase at all.</li>
            <li> Plastic material,  not worth it.</li>
            <li> Neither are real hair, in case anyone was wondering; but I&#x27;ve used fake eyelashes for years</li>
            <li> the only negative is that it does not bring the glue</li>
            <li> They definitely need to be bent or at least held together</li>
            <li> but I think ill stick to the real deal when it comes to lashes.</li>
            <li> But trust me they&#x27;re not worth buying.</li>
            <li> Which is understandable for the price they are just sitting in the package still because they are not worth trying to put them on.</li>
            <li> these things feel like plastic, not worth it even though it was $1.</li>
            <li> but I have yet to trust them to stay in place for long periods of time without an excessive amount of DUO.</li>
            <li> Stay away from this item not worth it</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Save your money not worth your money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the 2 or so dollars I paid for them</li>
            <li> not worth buying at all.</li>
            <li> Not worth it, move on.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read seem to give these such a negative review.</li>
            <li> You have dark color hair/lashes.</li>
            <li> Didnt really like these they look too fake</li>
            <li> The thin lashes seems just so natural.</li>
            <li> The band is too thick which makes it such a process to apply!</li>
            <li> you know what i hate the most?</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have the natural bend that all false lashes have, once you pull it out</li>
            <li> Not great quality , they look plastic from far away .</li>
            <li> I WEAR THIN NATURAL LOOKING LASHES THROUGH THE WEEK...</li>
            <li> I only received thick ones, no naturals so that sucked .</li>
            <li> The thin lashes could look natural but the thick lashes are total desu manga lashes.</li>
            <li> but a few got crushed in the shipping process</li>
            <li> I thought maybe there would be a variety of regular and thick..</li>
            <li> My only concern is that once in a while the thick ones are defective.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just wanting to experiment or don&#x27;t want to spend too much money on false eyelashes than I recommend these!</li>
            <li> Super hard and fake couldn&#x27;t even get them off the board they arrived on.</li>
            <li> Not very comfortable for models (or me).</li>
            <li> I think that this would be a really smart buy for anyone who craves really dramatic lashes but either can’t wear false lashes, or don’t have the time to apply falsies in their daily routine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t apply mascara to these false lashes and so for me, they last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Instead they have tabs on each side that are down in the cardboard.</li>
            <li> when i put them on, they &amp;#34;fought&amp;#34; me to stay, but of course i man handeled them and got them glued down.</li>
            <li> They needed to be cut down a bit, but not a problem at all, theres a ton of them there and have helped me practice wearing them.  </li>
            <li> I cut them down on the sides.</li>
            <li> down side, they took FOREVER to arrive.</li>
            <li> You can cut it down</li>
            <li> Maybe they could be cut down and used for lower lashes.</li>
            <li> but I can always trim them down if that is the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Tumbs down.</li>
            <li> They came faster than I expected!!</li>
            <li> I mean I only paid two dollars</li>
            <li> They reminded me of something made for a DOLL- extremely unnatural looking and feeling!</li>
            <li> The thin lashes could be used everyday - as they look very natural.</li>
            <li> There were legit, get them if you like the dramatic side of beauty, the thin ones are very natural and the the thick ones are very dramatic, love them both!</li>
            <li> They do not look like lashes, and are too thick, too long, and extremely unnatural.</li>
            <li> is very thin and if you use to much glue they move around</li>
            <li> My only issue with the dramatic set is that I can&#x27;t wear my glasses with them because they&#x27;re too long.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who has small, thinner eyelash and wants a blinged out dramatic eye look.</li>
            <li> I double up the thins once with the thick ones and cut the length a little.</li>
            <li> I really like the natural lashes but the thick ones look very fake and their shiny</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the thin ones only the thick fuller ones and once I actually have them on after struggling to put them on (which is never an issue with other brands)</li>
            <li> Plus you have the choice of dramatic or natural.</li>
            <li> You have your dramatic and natural lashes.</li>
            <li> I was supposed to receive 10 natural &amp; 10 dramatic.</li>
            <li> With these I can wear them without damaging my lashes and spending the time and money going to the beauty salon for them to do something that I can do myself for way less money.</li>
            <li> but it took less than a month.</li>
            <li> I cut the thinner set into halves and applied to outer half of my lid for a day of shopping.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically have a reaction to anything so BUYER BEWARE</li>
            <li> I found they work well if I trim them and cut them in half and apply two pieces to each eye.  </li>
            <li> you get 20 pairs for less than 3.00 dollars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn some of the thick pairs, after cutting the edges to fit</li>
            <li> somtimes i cut the thinner ones in half to use them as demi lashes.</li>
            <li> I like to cut them in half and just stick them on my outer corners.</li>
            <li> I was leery because it was saying that it would take a month and half to ship-</li>
            <li> While the product arrived about a month and a half after amazon said it would, it arrived nonetheless.  </li>
            <li> I had to put black glue on it to cover it up.</li>
            <li> Because of its stiffness they don&#x27;t like to stay put, and end up peeling off in less than an hour.</li>
            <li> I think I can cut them in half</li>
            <li> second it looks fake going to have to cut extra hair off!</li>
            <li> And when they do, they fall off half way through my night.</li>
            <li> they came in a half cushed box and all that can be said is you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> They also are slightly flimsy</li>
            <li> I ordered three sets, and only had a few wonky lashes out of sixty.</li>
            <li> Theyre a bit pinchy and odd because of this.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s been a month and a half</li>
            <li> cause some will split in half</li>
            <li> now I have 30 sets of lashes for less than $10.00.  </li>
            <li> I tend to prefer the thin ones, since the thick ones are very dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They took about three and a half weeks to arrive, no surprise being that they came from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li> so I cut each strand of lashes in half, and use one half of a strip on the outer ends of my eyes instead</li>
            <li> Thick for cosplay, thin for everday, and they really do work nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I ripped half of them just trying to take them off the thing</li>
            <li> My critic would be the photo they were less quality</li>
            <li> What I do is cut the lash in half, and use each half on each eyes.</li>
            <li> I got these in less than 2 weeks and wasn&#x27;t supposed to receive them until over a month from now.</li>
            <li> I just cant seem to cover it all maybe use black thread,</li>
            <li> Completely not worth even the little money you pay.</li>
            <li> THE OTHER STYLE IS WAY TO THICK AND LONG FOR EVERYDAY WEAR.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER THEY ARE A BIT ON THE LONG SIDE AND HARD TO TAKE OUT THE BOX.</li>
            <li> The lashes are hard plastic, and they are too long for my eyes.</li>
            <li> These lashes were stiff and had thick veins, not too mention they were not human hair.</li>
            <li> I have to cut them down a little</li>
            <li> They all needed to be trimmed because each strip of eyelash is almost twice the length that I need and the base to put the glue on is a little more narrow than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> I also had to cut them which made me mess up like one pair or so.</li>
            <li> They are not like normal fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> not cool.  </li>
            <li> The boxes came bent up which mess up the lashes .</li>
            <li> your gonna make a mess</li>
            <li> I didnt bother to apply them because I already know they would look a mess.</li>
            <li> The thick lashes were way too long.</li>
            <li> The thick ones are way too long</li>
            <li> AND I WEAR LONG THICK LASHES ON THE WEEKEND...</li>
            <li> Two styles (long and thick) at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t too thick or too long.  </li>
            <li> I really love these fake eyelashes whether it&#x27;s the thick ones or thin ones</li>
            <li> Same issues here as with the other false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> In order to make them less shiny, I soaked each pair in a little cup of laundry softener overnight and rinse them THOROUGHLY before applying.</li>
            <li> : The dramatic lashes are slightly heavy and have a thicker band than the natural ones.</li>
            <li> These lashes are great, and just reading those bad reviews makes me a little mad....</li>
            <li> these are really a waste of money and time better off buying drugstore stiff and dont stick with any amount of glue worthless</li>
            <li> :( I was a little scared too because it was so cheap</li>
            <li> Dark lashes which feels a little heavy</li>
            <li> I thought it at first sight that they would be hard to put on or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> As someone who is new to fake eyelash application</li>
            <li> Everyday, my eyes would hurt because they would poke the corners of my eyes and would come half way off through out the day.</li>
            <li> get the lashes today and the heavy lashes are nothing like my previous order.</li>
            <li> The band is wayyyyyyyy to thick to look natural not a good buy.</li>
            <li> At first we were not happy that the packing was poorly done.</li>
            <li> but the corners never go down because the lashes are too stiff</li>
            <li> These lashes are really stiff there hard to put on unless you take the time to bend them and flex them also they weren&#x27;t as long as I had hoped for</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they are very stiff, making them pretty uncomfortable and hard to put on.</li>
            <li> They take a little bending but it doesn&#x27;t even bother me.</li>
            <li> the lashes do look a little like plastic</li>
            <li> and I wished that it was a little bit thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> but the box was a little smashed.</li>
            <li> The thicker ones do look a little plastick&#x27;y, but at night it is not noticeable.</li>
            <li> A little advice, after you put the glue on, bend the lashes to form an upside &amp;#34;U&amp;#34;  to help it form easier to your eyes.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re a little flimsy but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> there a little on the plastic side</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little longer</li>
            <li> Package was a little squished</li>
            <li> BUT , USUALLY IF I FALL ASLEEP IN THEM DUE</li>
            <li> /&gt;THE LASHES ARRIVED IN THIS LITTLE BOX</li>
            <li> Just grab some scissors; any pair will do, and cut a little off at a time, holding them over your eyelid after each bit is cut off to test the length and see if it looks right.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are these little things sticking out on the sides of the lashes that are supposed to hold the lashes in the box, but I had to cut it off with scissors.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Also you have to cut the edges a little (you don&#x27;t have to)</li>
            <li> They literally look like little pieces of bottle cap plastic.</li>
            <li> And I Do Not Like How You Have To Cut Off The Little Wings</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to ship</li>
            <li> Giving it a little flattering, cateye, look.</li>
            <li> A little plastic looking but a little mascara fixes that.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes were a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> THESE EYELASHES ARE A LITTLE THICKER</li>
            <li> Some were a little bent when I recieved them</li>
            <li> The thick ones make you look like a drag queen and the thin ones are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> little dislike:</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous after reading reviews about these lashes</li>
            <li> These took a little while to arrive but I was in no hurry to get them.</li>
            <li> They took a little bit of time to get here</li>
            <li> but i just snipped the end a little.</li>
            <li> Case&#x27;s were smashed a little</li>
            <li> ,they have to be trimmed a little</li>
            <li> (you can just us your fingers or tweezers to pull off any adhesive) and then use a little alcohol if you&#x27;re worried about bacteria.</li>
            <li> you may have to cut them a little around the edges</li>
            <li> these last for at least 2months!</li>
            <li> Lots of lashes for little money.</li>
            <li> They work well but takes a little practice</li>
            <li> The thickest set might look a bit like plastic, but with a little mascara, the problem is solved.</li>
            <li> They feel a little plastic</li>
            <li> then I shaped them to my eyes and trim them a little</li>
            <li> I use them to add a little volume &amp; thickness for going out.</li>
            <li> Gotta work with them a little bit.</li>
            <li> Packing was all jacked up came with a little tree of life leckless</li>
            <li> took a little while to come</li>
            <li> These take a little bit to get here because they are from China</li>
            <li> Poor quality they look super fake</li>
            <li> 4/5 wish that the band was a little less stiff .</li>
            <li> I would suggest to cut them in half and only apply them to your outer corner for a less dramatic look.</li>
            <li> I find these a little too heavy.</li>
            <li> how little I had to pay (a few dollars).  </li>
            <li> but they are soft and the band is small !!!</li>
            <li> I usually cut one in half, trim the sides, and bend each half around my finger, then apply adhesive.</li>
            <li> Its really hard to get them to stay on due to the fact that theyre not even curled slightly</li>
            <li> i wear very very very very dark makeup</li>
            <li> Just what I expected !!!</li>
            <li> I used the thin one on a daily bases and the thicker ones when im on a night out to add a little glam.</li>
            <li> Not worth the very little they cost.</li>
            <li> My only complaint with these is that they are kinda hard to apply the lashline</li>
            <li> , my only problem was that the band was slightly white, so when you&#x27;re up close to someone, I&#x27;m afraid that they will see the band.</li>
            <li> and even i think theyre crazy haha.</li>
            <li> and if I need help I will try cutting them in sections and putting them on instead of in one whole strip</li>
            <li> Not for an everyday use basis.</li>
            <li> but you should be ashamed of yourself for carrying such a poor quality product made on an assembly line by workers in China.</li>
            <li> Wasted money......</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will never recommend anyone buy this product it cannot be used and is completely a waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used these lashes almost everyday going out night and day.</li>
            <li> for everyday use...</li>
            <li> but I wouldnt get them for everyday use.</li>
            <li> will a few kinda did but not noticeable....</li>
            <li> and I also gave a few 2 my friend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an everyday eyelash wearer.</li>
            <li> I wear eyelashes everyday.</li>
            <li> If you wear them everyday.</li>
            <li> I like them for everyday use</li>
            <li> I got a few compliments on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t judge the heavy ones till you try them out.</li>
            <li> My review is not because I feel like I was scammed but just to let people know not to even waste your money..</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY</li>
            <li> the thicker lashes were not comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I get complements everyday</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and i use heavy duty glue (duo)</li>
            <li> the only thing about it is that the eyelashes are thin</li>
            <li> Can be used everyday.</li>
            <li> you can reuse a few times.love them</li>
            <li> I would wear everyday style 1</li>
            <li> Otherwise, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> And a few lashes were bent.  </li>
            <li> but a few of them got stuck in the packaging</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> it was missing some lashes out of one of the boxes and bixes was damagedso</li>
            <li> I got these for both cosplay and everyday use.</li>
            <li> They feel  heavy</li>
            <li> WEAR EYELEASHES EVERYDAY....</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful when cutting it because I need the inner corners to be at least same length.  </li>
            <li> 20 pairs lasts me about 3 months and for awhile I was wearing them nearly everyday because of my job as a promo model as well as outings with friends.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for an everyday use maybe a dress up day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both for a few weeks now,&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The rows are broken up by the Chinese writing.  </li>
            <li> However, their being low-quality AND made in China ... please don&#x27;t waste your money overseas.</li>
            <li> Unwearable, don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> Still, I can use these for when I do  a heavy smoky eye or anime eyes or something like that.</li>
            <li> to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Great for everyday makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Fits</li>
            <li> It feels heavy.</li>
            <li> They are made of a plastic material that is heavy on the eye.</li>
            <li> Remember to wait a few seconds for the glue to get</li>
            <li> and I wear them everyday.</li>
            <li> I assume it&#x27;s to keep the lashes firmly in place.</li>
            <li> IF you are looking for everyday throw away lashes, then this is your item.</li>
            <li> I will never recommend theses for everyday use.</li>
            <li> WAste of money.</li>
            <li> Although, some hairs off the lashes were missing, so I ended up throwing some away.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money , take my word for it .</li>
            <li> The thin ones had a white strip on them</li>
            <li> a waste of money and will not buy again</li>
            <li> I got these and they were thin and they were short.....</li>
            <li> I buy these lashes all the time and have been using them for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Not for everyday use but still received compliments.</li>
            <li> but no just don&#x27;t waste your Time or money</li>
            <li> dont even waste your money</li>
            <li> so heavy</li>
            <li> All though my pup got to a few there are still plenty I can rock and show off.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried a few differen types of glue</li>
            <li> if it is missing they replace it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I disliked that it didn&#x27;t include glue.</li>
            <li> They are like plastic, which makes them heavy..</li>
            <li> these lashes have such poor structure</li>
            <li> The eyelashes can be worn for everyday looks.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re almost too heavy for an eyelash.</li>
            <li> please don&#x27;t waste your money like i did</li>
            <li> dont waste your money and time waiting for these lashes</li>
            <li> Not human hair poor quality</li>
            <li> I use latex eyelash glue, and the lashes are too heavy for the glue to bond them to my eye.</li>
            <li> Just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> (as natural as fake eyelashes can look)</li>
            <li> didnt returned them since they were so cheep, basicly a waste of money</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a everyday use then I would NOT recommend you buy this.</li>
            <li> But this was not the everyday solution I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Two hair thin bands running parallel</li>
            <li> I have even reused them a few times.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> just waste of money</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t get them it will be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> They are not for everyday wear.  </li>
            <li> Waste my time.&lt;br /&gt;Did</li>
            <li> Which I have suggested these eyelashes to a few of my co - workers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> As everyday wear, no not at all.</li>
            <li> 2, when I recieved them, they were too fake looking even the natural ones.</li>
            <li> They are made of plastic and are really harsh on the eyes.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, I&#x27;d stick to Red Cherry #43 lashes, amaaaazing price and value, these ones are just...</li>
            <li> Took a few weeks to ship and some of the lashes were all bent and ruined in the package.</li>
            <li> He hair is aqua and lime green.</li>
            <li> Synthetic eyelashes are difficult to apply and do not look natural.</li>
            <li> When i took one out and tried on my eye lid, the lash is not fit to the eye lid.</li>
            <li> so I wasted a few dollars.</li>
            <li> I tried curling them with an eyelash curler but it only made it worse.</li>
            <li> ..nothing can beat the price.m using duo adhesive to stick it...not so heavy on eyelid..</li>
            <li> Waste.</li>
            <li> I kind of knew that these were going to be awful</li>
            <li> If your barley starting to wear false eyelashes, I recommend</li>
            <li> You get a whole bunch of thick and thin lashes!</li>
            <li> I could go for something simple and use the thin or practically everyday.  </li>
            <li> False lashes are an essential to completing a make up look and putting it all together.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to practice how to put false lashes on definitely buy these.</li>
            <li> Only order if you have experience with false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Stiff - but do loosen up if bent and rolled a little in the fingers.</li>
            <li> They are a little stiff and plastic-y, but for the price, I am not upset at all.</li>
            <li> A little stiff to work with</li>
            <li> They are a little stiff so carry your glue with you for touch-ups.</li>
            <li> They were a little too stiff and didn&#x27;t quite bend and mold to my eye.</li>
            <li> A little stiff</li>
            <li> not what I expected, material is to hard, not easy to mold, but you get what you pay for..</li>
            <li> but I guess for what I paid $0.47 I couldn&#x27;t expect less!</li>
            <li> Wear them with black eyelash glue!</li>
            <li> They are hard because they are not as flexible as other brands.</li>
            <li> I was super disappointed.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t have a problem with the band on the thicker lashes, the band was completely black; which would make it hard to get them to blend with your lashes if you weren&#x27;t planning on wearing any black liner under them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ill spend the extra dough on the other lashes.</li>
            <li> (This caused some bad reviews from people expecting real hair, or high quality fake hair)</li>
            <li> I may use the regular lashes if i run out but the thick lashes look ridiculous.</li>
            <li> AND THEY ARE SO LONG AND THICK!</li>
            <li> Too long and just had a fake look then again I might just have the wrong shaped eye mine are shorter and very circle like.</li>
            <li> The thick lashes on the other hand, i did not even try on.</li>
            <li> lashes are to stiff and don&#x27;t flex to go with the contour of your eye lid.</li>
            <li> theyre way to stiff</li>
            <li> Really stiff lashes.  </li>
            <li> Somewhat stiff</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t even get them to bend to the shape of my eye and stick with the glue because they&#x27;re so stiff and plastic.</li>
            <li> So stiff you can&#x27;t get them to adhere.  </li>
            <li> so they aren&#x27;t so stiff feeling / looking.</li>
            <li> but when I took one out the band was so stiff</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even tell how stiff the band feels to the finger.</li>
            <li> The thicker ones are practically unusable because they&#x27;re so stiff.</li>
            <li> Plastic and supers stiff.</li>
            <li> They are stiff and will not conform to your eye lip.  </li>
            <li> They were to plastic and too stiff for me.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a stiff plastic</li>
            <li> These are cheaply-made, low-quality, stiff (but lightweight) lashes from China.  </li>
            <li> The won&#x27;t bend so they don&#x27;t stay on because they&#x27;re to stiff.</li>
            <li> I find these lashes to be extremely stiff and itchy.</li>
            <li> Stiff as hell save ur money or you will look like a broom</li>
            <li> Stiff lashes...</li>
            <li> I thought they were a bit stiff.</li>
            <li> Stiff and rigid lashes</li>
            <li> they are stiff n don&#x27;t lay well on the eye lids.</li>
            <li> but they are stiff...</li>
            <li> They are so stiff they hurt when I blink 😑</li>
            <li> girlfriend didnt like them, she said they were too stiff..</li>
            <li> The lash strip is really stiff</li>
            <li> Stiff</li>
            <li> I will not use them for personal use.but for a dramatic photoshoot they will work.</li>
            <li> But since i suck at applying lashes and there a bit too dramatic i use these only to practice applying !</li>
            <li> Also, dramatic lashes like these ones aren&#x27;t what I personally prefer.</li>
            <li> If you are wanting a dramatic look I would reccomend finding a different product.</li>
            <li> And the really dark ones are heavy lots of thick lashes on them.</li>
            <li> They feel like plastic and was not easy to apply on the lash line because of the thickness of the plastic texture lash band.</li>
            <li> The rim that the hairs sit on are white, so it looks horribly fake if you wear dark shadow or eyeliner.</li>
            <li> lashes are extremely fake looking, this was my first time buying false lashes ever</li>
            <li> The thick lashes, however, is thick and too long for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have to mess with mascara after putting them on!</li>
            <li> the thicker ones look funny on and have a very fake look but the other ones have a very natural look and aren&#x27;t to bad they are wearable.</li>
            <li> They look super plasticy, fake, silly, the lashes are stiff, and the corners will poke and irritate your eyes.  </li>
            <li> The are really shiny, stiff and just look very fake on.</li>
            <li> The are really shiny, stiff and just look very fake on.</li>
            <li> and I definitely recommend watching a tutorial if you&#x27;re not super fake eyelash savvy.</li>
            <li> A little unconfirtable to wear cause their a little to hard</li>
            <li> they are a little hard to get out of the box, but a little tug</li>
            <li> One out of the 20 eyelash came out bad the lashes where not on right and fell off, 10 are thick and 10 are daily use eyelashes (thin)</li>
            <li> One package had the less thick lashes and the other had the insanely thick lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing eyelashes almost everyday for about 2 years and never had a problem with putting them on, even if my eyes are small.</li>
            <li> usually lashes annoy me because of how heavy they are</li>
            <li> too long, flimsy and poorly made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to trim with my dull nail scissors, but only took 3 squeezes &amp; they&#x27;re trimmed.</li>
            <li> i hate them they are super stiff</li>
            <li> reasoning for 4 out of 5 is that they are a little difficult to apply with the current adhesives i have.</li>
            <li> Also even medium thick ones were little heavy on my eyes</li>
            <li> They started irritating my eyes because I&#x27;m not used to such a hard band on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> They are very plastic looking and feeling and almost impossible to attach (for me-</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re less thick than the picture depicts.</li>
            <li> The lash band is too thick which makes it harder to mold to eye contour; Tried everything to adhere but lash glue wouldn&#x27;t even hold because the thick band.</li>
            <li> but not a big thick look you can layer two thin pairs</li>
            <li> Not worth one Pennie ..!!</li>
            <li> they look extremely fake and theyre stiff, not flexible enough to lay on your eyelid to glue.</li>
            <li> A little hard for the application</li>
            <li> Very hard to put on, they are not real, they are plastic.</li>
            <li> They are not natural looking they are dramatic with plastic feel to them.</li>
            <li> The dramatic ones are my fave,granted they are not natural hair</li>
            <li> but they are extremely long and dramatic</li>
            <li> but they came a little late.</li>
            <li> But hey, They cost very little.</li>
            <li> I gave the product a three because the lash band was a little thick.  </li>
            <li> I used those in the nights with very little make up</li>
            <li> waste your hard earned $$$$$$.</li>
            <li> YUCK.&lt;br /&gt;Again, Lash users: DONT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY.</li>
            <li> They came in and I was a little disappointed because they are plastic and very shiny.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is their a little to wide for my eyes</li>
            <li> the lashes are very stiff and are not easy molded to the eye lid.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think they looked bad, but she didn&#x27;t really care for them.  </li>
            <li> I must say they aren&#x27;t that bad considering how much u pay</li>
            <li> They are thick firm plastic.</li>
            <li> Was not able to use these lashes because they were not sturdy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how to put them on</li>
            <li> As per usual with lashes, you just cut them to your eye size, bend them to your shape and glue them on.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> but I think that&#x27;s a small thing compared to the use you get out of these.</li>
            <li> I wear them everyday!</li>
            <li> I usually buy these a pair at a time at Walgreens, but they cost around $4.99 for one pair.</li>
            <li> Only used them a couple times unfortunately</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of the cost but not only did I not receive them.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected since it&#x27;s thin cardboard.</li>
            <li> Obviously they are in fact fake eyelashes</li>
            <li> What an unbelievable price.</li>
            <li> I always get a load of compliments from my lady-friends when I use my fake eyelashes and especially when I do a smokey eye.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would give these a shot for the price before buying the expensive ones since I wear falsies on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> and  I suggest you add a small  6 oz bottle of glue</li>
            <li> that they are I usually wear Kiss lashes</li>
            <li> No they don&#x27;t look fake if you know how to do your makeup properly.</li>
            <li> Not sure what happen</li>
            <li> and they are a complete disappointment.</li>
            <li> The only problem I found wrong when it was delivered was that it was in an envelope so the boxes for the eyelashes were snooshed a bit .</li>
            <li> I wear them everyday!</li>
            <li> Eyelashes are poorly packaged in a box that  was shipped crushed.</li>
            <li> beyond flimsy and not cute.</li>
            <li> My wife clients was not pleased at all.</li>
            <li> When she put them one, you can see the white fabric strip that they are attached too, which makes them look really fake.</li>
            <li> I usually loves these</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that they don&#x27;t have any adhesive on them, so they are difficult for trying on clients; you can&#x27;t show them in the mirror how they will look because they don&#x27;t stay along the lash line, as if they had been glued.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> but u can definitely tell the difference that these look way to fake.</li>
            <li> Overall they are fake eyelashes and get the job done.</li>
            <li> My everyday go to looks!</li>
            <li> so I usually like longer lashes.</li>
            <li> Waste of money !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really satisfied when I wear it ..</li>
            <li> They were to theatrical and fake looking.</li>
            <li> Too thick and fluffy.</li>
            <li> They go past the length of my eyes.</li>
            <li> These were terrible, to this day have not been able to make them stick.</li>
            <li> I tried various types of methods of application, each one failed</li>
            <li> these were too big and flashy..</li>
            <li> but it was a small snip to adjust.</li>
            <li> These lashes are so heavy and thick and don&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> but I put lashes on daily and take care of mine and know how to deal with difficult ones.</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed with these lashes.</li>
            <li> it is silly to buy eyelashes at the retail stores when this double tray can do the job.  </li>
            <li> But i mean what can you expect when you spend so little?</li>
            <li> However the thick ones were a waste.</li>
            <li> Waste!  </li>
            <li> lot of people didn&#x27;t like the thick ones, but they&#x27;re everyday to me.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> So finding a way to get the look of fake lashes without actually having to take the time to glue them on is life changing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have fake lashes to last me for months.</li>
            <li> I would recommend them to anyone who likes to wear fake eyelashes  either daily, or for costumes.</li>
            <li> Was not pleased the lashes do not hold once applied.</li>
            <li> are fake because the white thread that holds it together is visible and no matter&lt;br /&gt;how</li>
            <li> and i didnt like it compared with what i usually use..</li>
            <li> Very hard to put on due to its stiffness.</li>
            <li> Hard &amp; stiff</li>
            <li> They are kinda stiff &amp; hard to glue on</li>
            <li> they are stiff and hard to put on</li>
            <li> They feel so stiff and are hard to use.</li>
            <li> They are very long which is fixable and they also looks very fake especially the thick ones.  </li>
            <li> and they are not easy to stay on because the crease of the eyelashes is to hard.</li>
            <li> Cheap,plastic, Cheap, very bad quality</li>
            <li> They are just too stiff and wonky.</li>
            <li> The lashes are too thick and stiff.</li>
            <li> The bands are thick and stiff and took a lot of coaxing just to get one pair on.</li>
            <li> of the lash has a thick lining and it&#x27;s quite stiff.</li>
            <li> but they are just not good quality, hard to put on and keep them on because they are heavy, thick and you will probably have to cut them down to size.</li>
            <li> short waiting time, but the quality of the product is very poor.</li>
            <li> But she wanted something a little less dramatic</li>
            <li> I think that is due to the poor quality.</li>
            <li> They called me at 10:45 at night begging me to take down my negative review!</li>
            <li> I had the worst reaction to them and a whole week later I am still fighting the scabbing along my lash line.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, such a disappointment</li>
            <li> If you are a beginner with false lashes I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend these because they are a little stiff to work with.</li>
            <li> Stiff and plastic!</li>
            <li> I even tried cutting them down and they were still way to long.</li>
            <li> but they are hard to work with because the band is a bit stiff and thick.</li>
            <li> Not very good quality</li>
            <li> and so the quality is not very good.  </li>
            <li> they are not very good, they are so so.</li>
            <li> Not a very good quality of lashes.</li>
            <li> the big spider looking ones are to dramatic !</li>
            <li> and I can put them on easily , not theses!</li>
            <li> Luckily for me, mine came in such awful packaging that all the lashes were crushed, so I couldnt attempt to use them even if I was desperate.</li>
            <li> A little too dramatic for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been wearing falsies for at least 6 years :\</li>
            <li> but I still have a lot of trouble putting them on since I&#x27;m not good at it yet.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I like the thick ones.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the thick lashes and I&#x27;m not sure I will</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tired them a few times and just bought them as practice lashes to play around with before risking damaging an expensive set.</li>
            <li> Not worth it, the packaging around the eyelashes themselves was all busted up and broken</li>
            <li> They are also way too long that it looks weird from the side views.</li>
            <li> These are not for the average person who wears false eyelashes</li>
            <li> No matter how expensive the glue is or how long I wait.</li>
            <li> however, they are super poor quality, the plastic is tough and doesnt bend well to the curve of the lid, making application very difficult.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;i tried to trim a pair down, but they just looked worse</li>
            <li> you cant go wrong with a couple bucks for 20 pairs of lashes!&lt;br /&gt;these are really common within the Asian community when it comes to selling, and you can usually get one pair for $1-$2... and look here!</li>
            <li> very stiff</li>
            <li> They were very stiff.</li>
            <li> Very stiff irritated my eyes</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very stiff and don&#x27;t shape well to the lashline.</li>
            <li> The band is very stiff and will not bend too your eyes.</li>
            <li> very stiff and plastic feeling.</li>
            <li> The lashes looked like plastic and when I put them on they are very stiff.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are very stiff, almost plastic-like.</li>
            <li> Almost impossible to look natural.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty unwearable unless you want INSANE DRAMA like for drag or competition or something of that.</li>
            <li> Very stiff, hard to work with.</li>
            <li> The lashes are very stiff and hard to get them to stick on an stay.  </li>
            <li> Sometime when the line is thin they mess up</li>
            <li> but I really had to do a review on this because ppl on here are wrong!!</li>

            <li> they didn&#x27;t stay on hardly any time, they kept falling off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hardly anything so when you take out the glue</li>
            <li> I thought they are dull</li>
            <li> No flexible hard to apply.</li>

            <li> The lashes are hard to put.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so hard and doesn&#x27;t bend accordingly to your lash line glue</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t help cause it&#x27;s so hard it pops off your eyelid.</li>
            <li> These suck so hard to put on</li>
            <li> They AREN&#x27;T hard or pokey</li>
            <li> They are too hard to put on your eyes.</li>
            <li> they r on this hard strip that is way longer than your eye</li>
            <li> and the strip is hella hard</li>

            <li> NOT WORTH THE BUY!!!</li>
            <li> Long dramatic lashes!</li>
            <li> These are thick and have no curve to them, so it&#x27;s hard to adhere to the eyes.</li>
            <li> they are thick  and hard to apply</li>
            <li> The band is thick and hard.</li>
            <li> The plastic on the lashes I think is to hard and thick to bend and this is what cause the lashes to lift.</li>
            <li> Very hard, not easy to bend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked and pleased they aren&#x27;t as bad as I thought they&#x27;d be for the price.</li>

            <li> Terrible and cheap.</li>
            <li> There is a bit extra on the ends but cutting them off was no issue.  </li>

            <li> But i&#x27;m not giving this 5 star because of the stiffness and the thick lining.</li>
            <li> But if it were for the thick eyelashes alone</li>
            <li> the edges are to thick to glue on</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ll give these lashes A three out of five for the natural - due to the fact that they are really fake plastic looking, not to bad</li>
            <li> I was worried the thick lashes would be too dramatic for my little eyes</li>
            <li> Poor quality, too stiff</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t wear them on a daily basis because it&#x27;s too dramatic, but I would use them for events or just put them on when I feel like going for a playful look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who said they look too fake</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually 1 pair for $5.00!</li>
            <li> I was not pleased!</li>
            <li> but i mean, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I will diffidently be buying them again!!</li>
            <li> Feels like fake plastic barbie doll hair and were not curly like other store brand falsies.</li>
            <li> I mean you get what you paid for</li>
            <li> I am not pleased!</li>
            <li> I mean they are $2</li>
            <li> i mean they look so plastic</li>
            <li> Sadly the packaging was bad, two of my cases smushed and they came out funny.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t what i expected, I expected real or fake hair not plastic</li>
            <li> we&#x27;re way to big and looked and felt very fake.</li>
            <li> my lashes are very small &amp; sparse)</li>
            <li> first couple of times I hated them , they always seemed to come off at corner of eye or at the end...and glue</li>
            <li> There is not a better value in false eyelashes</li>
            <li> This do look fake and are a little hard to put them on</li>
            <li> I tried to give them a chance, but they are so stiff it is hard to keep them on because they do not take the natural curve form of your eye, so they like to pop off or maintain a real awkward and unsightly position.</li>
            <li> This are just ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Seriously youll never come across a deal like this</li>
            <li> Ridiculous that they would even sell these.</li>
            <li> I would still look ridiculous.</li>
            <li> They look completely ridiculous on.</li>
            <li> This is a guaranteed way to look ridiculous.</li>
            <li> They are plastic and look ridiculous</li>
            <li> But seriously... I can wait...</li>
            <li> these look ridiculous</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I will never use falsies again.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t look ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I just use cold cream that you would use for removing makeup  off of your face and rub the cold cream on the eyelashes in the palm of my hand gently.</li>
            <li> I wanted to save money since fake eye lashes are so expensive in the drugstore, but this product was a total flop!</li>
            <li> Horrible super plastic looking lashes.</li>
            <li> too stiff and hard.. look so fake.. but whaever..</li>
            <li> Big mistake, way too long on the edges, awful bands on them, so hard to glue</li>
            <li> I mean its bad enough I have to trim all of them</li>
            <li> So yes, you get a lot for the amount you pay but the lash bands are so stiff and thick that it was incredibly difficult to glue them on.</li>
            <li> They are stiff and hurt your eyes, and don&#x27;t even make that much of a difference with your eyelashes, they are horrible!!!</li>
            <li> Very stiff and poor quality</li>
            <li> Poor quality and very stiff.</li>
            <li> Very thick and hard to put on.</li>
            <li> It can get a little expensive but this changed it all.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t cut or bend them, then they will probably end up looking a little weird.</li>
            <li> I actually thought they were going to look bad, but noooo not at all</li>
            <li> These came all mixed up and in bad shape.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that aren&#x27;t to flexible and</li>
            <li> for two bucks, and ten pairs each, that&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> After reading all the bad reviews about these lashes I almost didn&#x27;t buy them, but I thought what the hell, they&#x27;re only $2.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see why these lashes get bad reviews they only cost $1</li>
            <li> only bad thing is they come with no glue</li>
            <li> Just a bad product overall.</li>
            <li> For the price got lots of pair, but the quality is no good.</li>
            <li> they are too big, too ugly</li>
            <li> Not impressed don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> You could tell they were totally fake, and they did not fit well at all.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are no good.</li>
            <li> Not a good buy</li>
            <li> well also they are heavy uncomfortable .</li>
            <li> They are not good do not buy them .</li>
            <li> The thick is too thick and the thin is too thin.</li>

            <li> these are no good</li>
            <li> Not a good buy.</li>
            <li> Complete crap.  </li>
            <li> The thin ones are for every day  use for me and the thick ones are for the nights I go out .</li>
            <li> The lashes are poor quality and too thick.</li>
            <li> They give you two sizes, thick and thin.</li>
            <li> These are too thick and just poorly made.</li>
            <li> Complete crap.</li>
            <li> I mean their false eyelashes</li>
            <li> The lashes are too stiff and are too difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say but they are horrible...too stiff to place on eyeliner...and whatever brand of glue I tried, they wouldn&#x27;t adhere..</li>
            <li> They are not realistic at all, not that false eyelashes usually are, but these are exceptionally bad.</li>
            <li> Hard to put on the dramatic ones</li>
            <li> I had never used false eyelashes before these weren&#x27;t TOO difficult to get on just takes a little practice</li>
            <li> If you look at these eyelashes to hard the lashes will fall out!</li>
            <li> The really thick lashes that comes in this pack is way too dramatic.</li>
            <li> I get scared using something that thick because I dont like the dramatic look</li>
            <li> The thick lashes are really thick and difficult to bend to my eye.  </li>
            <li> the thick ones are really dramatic but its wearable like at clubs.</li>
            <li> I usually wear fake lashes but always the ones with real&lt;br /&gt;Hair.</li>
            <li> These Lashes Are Horrible, Very Plastic, Doesn&#x27;t Stick, I Threw Them All Away!</li>
            <li> if there&#x27;t not enough glue the eyelash starts to unglue and straighten out :(</li>
            <li> I can reuse them at least 3 times!</li>
            <li> Only bump On this was tht twO sets Of eyelashes wer smashed in :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the product overall</li>
            <li> I was hoping they would both be the thick variety but no matter!</li>
            <li> I think if you have big eyes , like I do , the dramatic lashes wouldn&#x27;t be so bad.</li>
            <li> Very hard to use.</li>
            <li> Very hard to put on...</li>
            <li> Very hard to use ..</li>
            <li> The lashes are very hard &amp; irritated my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The strip was very hard and would not contour to my eye shape.</li>
            <li> The material is very hard, do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> The lashes are real hard to manouver, They are real stiff, and feel like plastic on my lids.</li>
            <li> eyelashes were stuck on plastic and very hard to remove, they were sticky and very weak, ripped apart very easily, not at all like the eyelashes i buy from the store, i will never buy eyelashes from amazon again</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting them in half to apply on my outer eye for a doll look on Halloween.</li>
            <li> cutting in half helps</li>
            <li> I figured that I would use the eyelashes as practice anyway because I&#x27;m not very good with fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> These lashes are so tough to use.</li>
            <li> These lashes are tough to put on.</li>
            <li> They are very stiff and look totally fake.</li>
            <li> they are very stiff and difficult to put on plus shipping took forever</li>
            <li> They are very delicate to use</li>
            <li> very slow shipping.</li>
            <li> , the band is very thick.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied! !</li>
            <li> I mean cmon ?!</li>
            <li> , Don&#x27;t Waste your money on this product!!!</li>
            <li> Thick ones are stiff and nearly impossible to apply.</li>
            <li> I must say I was a bit skeptical at the beginning since the box looks ehhh, and the lashes look a little fake.</li>
            <li> they feel way to fake and to hard to put on</li>
            <li> Too fake looking and hard to put on</li>
            <li> Really difficult to stick on as well, they are so plasticy and hard and non-flexibile that they will poke you in your eye.</li>
            <li> These people are very unprofessional and their products are terrible.</li>
            <li> Not great quality at all.</li>
            <li> maybe my eyelashes are just that thin.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> I just received this about a month after purchasing and the boxes they came in were literally so damaged and broken</li>
            <li> the style one is way to thick and looks so fake and</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> Not happy with these.</li>
            <li> Worse eyelashes I have ever received.</li>
            <li> I should have guessed they would be horrible quality, but even that is really understated.</li>
            <li> I wear eyelashes quite often and the quality of these is definitely not great, but for a daytime use they will work.  </li>
            <li> and what a poor quality.</li>
            <li> TO ME BEING EXHAUSTED ....</li>
            <li> Also the thinner ones are paper thin.</li>
            <li> From china or japan, poor quality</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the lashes are almost some type of uber thin silicone or plastic.</li>
            <li> The thin ones work well.  </li>
            <li> but the thinner ones work well with my sparse and thin eyelashes.</li>
            <li> they sent me two of the thin eyelashes</li>
            <li> Not a great buy.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes are poorly made, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The thin ones</li>
            <li> would not buy again poorly maid!!!!!!!!!!!!1</li>
            <li> but these are straight up awful.</li>
            <li> not happy.</li>
            <li> i dont know if i will use the thin ones</li>
            <li> The place on the eyelash were you put the glue is so thin</li>
            <li> I have naturally thin hair and lashes</li>
            <li> Thin like paper.</li>
            <li> The thin ones feel like plastic</li>
            <li> they are thin...</li>
            <li> These are the absolute worst eye lashes I have ever seen!</li>
            <li> They are plastic and they aren&#x27;t irritating to the eyes.</li>
            <li> quality, poor service.</li>
            <li> The thin I wore to homecoming</li>
            <li> and they arrived all bent up from poor packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not great with false lashes (just started using them)</li>
            <li> I thought they were real lashes the worst.</li>
            <li> Affordable, but not really happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I know I got tired of paying $6 a pair from Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li> a false look not happy</li>
            <li> they are so fake and thick .</li>
            <li> I Like the thicker ones the thin ones</li>
            <li> I do not to wear false eyelashes, but my kids like to play with them.  </li>
            <li> and yes they are FALSE eyelashes</li>
            <li> You are probably considering these false lashes because you want to enhance your look while staying under budget.</li>
            <li> no one ever thinks i have false eyelashes on.</li>
            <li> If you know anything about false lashes you don&#x27;t want these.</li>
            <li> I recommend them if you are used to wearing false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Loos tottaly false dont buy it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if all false eyelashes are like this or not.</li>
            <li> How can you complain about 20 pairs of false lashes for the price you&#x27;ll pay for one pair at Walgreens?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My sister asked me to buy this product for her, i do not know anything of false eyelashes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear false lashes all of the time</li>
            <li> , people didn&#x27;t even know I were wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> If you are going for that non-natural in your face false these are for you.</li>
            <li> The false eyelashes could probably be worn at Halloween and by stage performers, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I wear false eyelashes almost every day.</li>
            <li> Recommend these to those who just wanna try out or play around with false lashes.</li>
            <li> , what do you expect from a false lash.  </li>
            <li> I use false lashes a lot</li>
            <li> THESE FALSE EYE LASHES LOOKS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used false eyelashes before</li>
            <li> BUUUT the thick eyelashes are crazy thick.</li>
            <li> They are itchy and look extremely fake (both the thin and the thick).</li>
            <li> I always had to trim false eyelashes before place them on...</li>
            <li> and I wear false lashes every day.</li>
            <li> The packaging is a little silly!</li>
            <li> The strips, however; was very difficult to manage because it was so thick and hard to bend and form to the eye lash lines.</li>
            <li> They are not wearable unless you want to look fake, like a doll, and ridiculous.</li>
            <li> They have a weird shape and when you cut them down they look awkward.</li>
            <li> but you get exactly what you pay for and the eyelashes are very poorly made and when you put them on they look very FAKE!!</li>
            <li> For the money I spent, can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not too hard to do it yourself just a little annoying.</li>
            <li> and the base is a little thick.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use the dramatic lashes though.</li>
            <li> they are too dramatic for every day use.  </li>
            <li> I have not used the dramatic ones yet</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re still not over dramatic.</li>
            <li> so I bought these expecting to give the dramatic set to my sister-in-law.</li>
            <li> But after trying the dramatic set, I think I&#x27;ll keep them too.</li>
            <li> Also, the dramatic ones hurt your eyes...</li>
            <li> The dramatic lashes, however, don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The dramatic ones do their job: to be dramatic.</li>
            <li> and i like how dramatic they are.</li>
            <li> ;  I guess I didn&#x27;t realize just how DRAMATIC one of the sets is.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get the thick lashes, they look horrible, too short and stubby.</li>
            <li> BUT.. They Are Very Hard And Uncomfortable</li>
            <li> It looks really fake and they are very hard.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to put them on when they&#x27;re bent all crazy but for the price</li>
            <li> Trying to take out of packaging a few of the eyelashes ripped off so bad</li>
            <li> Not worth it at all :(</li>
            <li> the lashes look so fake and when placed on the eyes, it looked even worse.</li>
            <li> Was just what I needed because I am a hula dancer and we use false lashes all the time, but they can b so expensive</li>
            <li> two thumbs down. :(</li>
            <li> Terrible customer service &amp;&amp; the eye lashes are gross &amp;&amp; really hard !</li>
            <li> The base is too thick, they wont bend to shape the eye, and they are very stiff</li>
            <li> the only bad thing I can is that when the product was deliverd it was all smashed up and made some of the eyelashes ugly</li>
            <li> I havent put them on yet because im afraid they will look ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I like these lashes; however, I&#x27;m a little disappointed in the texture of the lashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i would probably recommend once they come to some of my friends but hvnt came yet which sucks !!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed</li>
            <li> The thick lashes look like caterpillars, nothing I would EVER put on my eyes!!</li>
            <li> Very stiff and impossible to apply.</li>
            <li> Lashes were very hard!</li>
            <li> $2 eyelashes sucked bad :/</li>
            <li> The thick ones look very fake.</li>
            <li> Yes, they&#x27;re not real hair, but they don&#x27;t look bad at all!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed they don&#x27;t even have glue in the back</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend  to any eyelash obsessed girl!!!</li>
            <li> the thin ones are ok but the thick &amp;#34;FULL&amp;#34; ones are terrible and look like construction paper glued to your eyes bad bad bad!</li>
            <li> Hated the thick lashes they were hard to but on.</li>
            <li> Im sorry</li>
            <li> They look so fake.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t go wrong buying a lot of them for the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know wtf</li>
            <li> If u luv fake lashes these are a</li>
            <li> so it makes it difficult to glue on .</li>
            <li> A lot of my lashes were bent unfortunately, but not terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know they are FAKE eyelashes</li>
            <li> but they look too fake if that makes any sense..</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re too fake looking.</li>
            <li> shipping takes a while and unable to track were the item is at.</li>
            <li> It looks so noticeable that your eyelashes are 110% FAKE when you wear them.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them and mostliky won&#x27;t sorry</li>
            <li> some lashes had been bent for staying in a wrong position during transit.</li>
            <li> they sent me the wrong style 1, but it&#x27;s whatever.</li>
            <li> I Was Skeptical</li>
            <li> ill probably be ordering .</li>
            <li> I was sad.</li>
            <li> They look so fake.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t return item because it would be too expensive.</li>
            <li> They feel weird and like they would poke you in the eye when they&#x27;re in the box</li>
            <li> but you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price it has</li>
            <li> /&gt;First I hold a fake eyelash up to my eye and try and size it.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it... not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> No glue included unfortunately.</li>

            <li> Weird looks like they&#x27;re</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t see myself wearing these every day.</li>
            <li> they were too thin to work with&amp; falling apart when I was cleaning the glue off!</li>
            <li> However, have worn the thicker ones they look like fake barbie doll ones</li>
            <li> It saves me a lot of money on fake lashes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> (and yes I tried to trim them but they just looked silly).</li>
            <li> They looked like they were going to be terrible and not last at all.  </li>
            <li> And the thinner ones help define your eyelashes but don&#x27;t make them seem fake.</li>
            <li> They do look fake, but then again nobody has gigantic eyelashes.</li>

            <li> The lashes look fake and plastic .</li>

            <li> WHEN GOING TO THE BEAUTY SALON CAN BECOME EXPENSIVE, DOING IT</li>
            <li> the eyelashes are plentiful, but clearly fake and plasticy.</li>
            <li> &amp;&amp; I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERY FALSE EYELASH LOVERS !</li>
            <li> I ordered these false lashes because I thought, hey, why not!</li>
            <li> These are poorly made lashes that look very fake and uncomfortable on the eye.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed on how long it takes them to ship and them not showing up on time!</li>
            <li> these lashes are very poorly made, flimsy,</li>
            <li> Very poor quality, plastic like material.</li>
            <li> Very thin band.</li>
            <li> They are very false looking.</li>
            <li> Ill save those for Halloween to create some really dramatic looks!</li>
            <li> Eyelashes are horrible, 1, took to long for them to arrive.</li>
            <li> these eyelashes are horrible so stiff so hard to put on ugh!</li>
            <li> Horrible quality wayyyyy to stiff not real feelings or looking hate</li>
            <li> They are poorly made and are impossible to glue on.</li>
            <li> They had a weird smell to them and the thin ones were extremely ugly.</li>
            <li> my goodness, these are dramatic!</li>
            <li> I bought these to use for practicing how to apply false lashes and are so bad I can&#x27;t even use them for that.</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t so crazy, the lashes were bent and twisted and some fallen out of slot once they arrived</li>
            <li> BUT instead I receive these worthless thick costume set.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t go wrong for the price with a girl that goes through lashes like crazy.</li>
            <li> but I hate the thick ones.</li>
            <li> Fake eyelashes shouldn&#x27;t look fake on your eyes!</li>
            <li> just VERY dramatic lel</li>
            <li> but they are very dramatic I don&#x27;t mind though.</li>
            <li> They are very dramatic.</li>
            <li> Both thin and thick pack of lashes came bent and the packaging was horrible</li>
            <li> These are so bad, they&#x27;re fake plastic</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I read the bad reviews after I had already purchased these &amp;#34;eye lashes&amp;#34; and they were two weeks into delivery.</li>
            <li> plastic fake bad quality...</li>
            <li> unfortunately they are bad quality like doll&#x27;s lashes...</li>
            <li> Horrible will never order again plastic waste of money</li>
            <li> so you have to keep cutting them.overall there</li>
            <li> but since I get (20) pairs for this price I&#x27;d be crazy to pass up this deal.</li>
            <li> SO UNREALISTIC FLIMSY AND UGLY.</li>
            <li> I was afraid</li>
            <li> They look very plasticy, horrible quality and look horrible on the eyes.</li>
            <li> cold not get them to stay on.</li>
            <li> Afraid to even try them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid this product ended in the garbage for me...</li>
            <li> Horrible and not comfortable</li>
            <li> Therefore I can&#x27;t see myself using them unless they&#x27;re for a costume or a really crazy party.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> The thicker lashes are the heavy ones, the thinner ones are just horrible, they&#x27;re plastic lashes.</li>
            <li> Even after cutting them to the correct length, and using eyelash glue I&#x27;ve never had issues with, these will not stick to my eyelid.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt waste my time buying this again,they look horrible on and feel like pastic.</li>
            <li> recommend cutting the ends.&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li> Save yourself a few dollars and do not buy these horrible quality lashes.</li>
            <li> There is definatly some crazy non fda approved chemical in there.</li>
            <li> The base part of the strip is really thin, almost paper like.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m used to them, these just wouldn&#x27;t stick AND they looked FAKE!</li>
            <li> Obsessed with Style 1!</li>
            <li> These look so fake!</li>
            <li> they are to fake !</li>

            <li> To rigid, uncomfortable !</li>
            <li> horrible, just thick and bulky.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> Just like the others I ordered are very poorly made lashes, I do not recommend anyone buying them!</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable to wear and was falling apart when I took them out of the box.</li>
            <li> The thicker lashes however look very fake, and in my opinion are unwearable.</li>
            <li> The thick ones are the worst!</li>
            <li> They are very difficult for me as a newbie to put on, but the price is UNBEATABLE.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable, not useable..</li>
            <li> They look very fake and shiny won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re very difficult to put on.</li>
            <li> Once they are on as well they look very fake.</li>
            <li> Looks very fake</li>
            <li> They look very fake on</li>
            <li> The wire that&#x27;s attached to them makes it impossible for the lashes to stay glued on ..</li>
            <li> The seam is impossible to hide.</li>
            <li> with these plastic eye lashes this was impossible to do.  </li>
            <li> instead neither design had any shape so they wouldn&#x27;t curve to the eye and was impossible to glue on my eye lid.  </li>
            <li> They are plastic and impossible to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY STIFF!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The price is AMAZING for so many &amp; the quality is actually really good for the price . It&#x27;s not to fake looking but not to real looking . But if you put mascara on it and blend it well with your actual eyelashes it looks just as good as any other expensive lashes :)</li>
            <li> These are not even wearable they feel like plastic super cheap material.</li>
            <li> Just DON&#x27;T!!!!!! Don&#x27;t!!</li>
            <li> GOOD QUALITY FOR THE PRICE PLUS FAST SHIPPING ARRIVED BEFORE I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> I got the ones in the picture and these would be great for costume play. They are not natural looking they are dramatic with plastic feel to them. And the really dark ones are heavy lots of thick lashes on them. Fun for dress up cosplay stuff. Not for an everyday use basis. Dont cost much anyways why not buy it? halloween does come every yr!</li>
            <li> Absolutely hated them. I&#x27;m a daily eyelash wearer so I&#x27;m used to them, these just wouldn&#x27;t stick AND they looked FAKE! HATED THEM.</li>
            <li> Took about a month to get them.Not satisfied! !</li>
            <li> I love my lashes, they are not too long or thick. I love how natural but sexy and brighter they make my eyes look.</li>
            <li> These were the most HIDEOUS lashes I have ever seen or used. I would only use them now out of desperation in a fashion show setting where the models eyes cannot be seen up close. these lashes are very poorly made, flimsy, kindy like plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned $$$$$$. Amazon carries Red Cherry- BUY THOSE. CVS now stocks ARDELL, YUP, ARDELL, which is the only kind this professional will use from here on out! Im sorry Amazon- but you should be ashamed of yourself for carrying such a poor quality product made on an assembly line by workers in China. My guess is they are not even sanitary. YUCK.&lt;br /&gt;Again, Lash users: DONT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY. CVS HAS ARDELL IN A LARGE ASSORTMENT.</li>
            <li> They are very nice. The think ones are really long and i cant wear them with my glasses. But otherwise they are nice.</li>

            <li> The price is amazing! They took awhile to get here and 3 lashes were bent when I finally received them. On the bright side there are multiples so 3 bent ones isn&#x27;t that bad plus they were so cheap.</li>
            <li> They look so fake. It looked as if i glued a piece of plastic to my eye. Im saving mine for Halloween. Lol.</li>
            <li> These are decent eye lashes. At first, they can be hard to put on. But once you get the hang it&#x27;s easy. They are hard because they are not as flexible as other brands. Beginners should not buy.</li>
            <li> Not very good quality</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money very cheap lashes feel like plastic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only worn the more natural ones lately, since the others look a bit too thick for just daily wear. They are plastic and not the most nice eyelashes, but you have to take into consideration I got 20 pairs for 3 bucks, so I can&#x27;t really say much. I don&#x27;t know why people are saying they are hard to apply, etc, because I didn&#x27;t have that problem at all. Really it just depends on the glue you are using I guess.&lt;br /&gt;The natural ones are really light weight and I forgot I had them on until I looked into the mirror later on the day and noticed them.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say anything about that others though, I haven&#x27;t gotten them yet.&lt;br /&gt;But yeah, don&#x27;t expect them to be nice feeling or for them to be amazing, because you get what you pay for. If you spend on cheap lashes, you are going to get cheap looking lashes.&lt;br /&gt;If you are frugal like me and don&#x27;t really want to pay 10 bucks for five pairs at the store, and also mind working with them to make them look a bit more &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I really liked the dramatic eyelashes better than the natural looking ones. They could do better in packing them so they don&#x27;t bend but for 2 bucks and change what do you expect.</li>
            <li> If I could give this zero stars I would. I read tons of great reviews on these lashes &amp; I have no idea why. I wear fake lashes often(of MUCH better quality, obviously!). I figured with the numerous good reviews I couldn&#x27;t go wrong buying a lot of them for the price. Uh...no...just don&#x27;t. They are completely flat with no curve to them AT ALL! They do not have glue on them but that wasn&#x27;t a big deal because I have an amazing lash glue. Well, even my amazing lash glue didn&#x27;t help them adhere to my eyes. They are thick firm plastic. I tried to reshape them...nope. I tried to cut them hoping I could use them as partial lashes(just on the outer corners of the eye) nope. They are absolute junk...PERIOD! If they &amp;#34;worked&amp;#34; for you I honestly have to wonder what in the world you looked like. This are just ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes good price to</li>
            <li> The lash band is too thick which makes it harder to mold to eye contour; Tried everything to adhere but lash glue wouldn&#x27;t even hold because the thick band. If not for this, it would have been a great buy.</li>
            <li> Terrible and made of plastic</li>
            <li> Some are good. You can really tell they are fake when you put them on</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. These lashes are plastic and not what I expected at all. They wouldn&#x27;t bend to fit the shape of my eyes, so they didn&#x27;t stay on. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Theses are plastic eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;Not safe for wearing</li>
            <li> Love these. Very cheap and our does take awhile before you receive them but all in all good purchase 3rd box ordered</li>
            <li> Not the best buy not the worst. To be honest the dollar store lashes I&#x27;ve tried are better than these. First off they are way too long in length and in width. The thick ones were way too dramatic for me, maybe good for Halloween buy not on a normal day. The thinner ones were OK I guess. I guess you get what you pay for. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again and the ones I have ate still unused I&#x27;ve had them for 2 months now. If you want beautiful lashes for a more natural look. Don&#x27;t buy these! Wasted money......</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I got them.  Biggest mistake.  Nuff said</li>
            <li> If your barley starting to wear false eyelashes, I recommend these!!&lt;br /&gt;I loved them and they didn&#x27;t rip easily for me. My all time favorite!! And they last for a long time:)</li>
            <li> For the price got lots of pair, but the quality is no good.</li>
            <li> Love my new lashes cant wait to try them. I like the fact i didnt had to paid so much and got i lot for what i pay for thank you.</li>
            <li> You get what you payed for. These are poorly made lashes that look very fake and uncomfortable on the eye. Would NOT recommend this at all. Save your money on some well made lashes.</li>
            <li> In love with these falses, style 2 blends nicely with your natural lashes and style 1 gives you just the right amount of bold for your night out, I always come back for these lashes</li>
            <li> you have to cut each end and the string off. you have to really  work with them to make them fit the curve of your eye but....for the price they are good! i had compliments on the thick ones. today i am wearing the wispy ones which was easier to get on.</li>
            <li> So many for a great price! They take a little bending but it doesn&#x27;t even bother me. Perfect for going out :)</li>
            <li> I got this back in 2014 it took a while to received them but i really like them i would buy them again thankx😊</li>
            <li> Theme wait was really long.. And the stripes that holds the lashes tend to come off very easily when taking off the old flue to clean them, other than that they&#x27;re perfect !! I would recommend them and also use them again</li>
            <li> they came in sooner than I expected! I got them all for an amazing price. My mother loved them &amp; they look great on her !</li>
            <li> i got a urban decay3 platelet !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> ONE WORD: HORRIBLE!!!</li>
            <li> They work really well but they can fall apart easily.</li>
            <li> These are awesome! Thicker ones for parties and the thinner ones are awesome for everyday wear. Really brings out the face. I got all my friends to buy them. Love them! Amazingly affordable!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know wtf these are but they were not as described.</li>
            <li> looks just like the picture..</li>
            <li> Exactly as I saw it on the Internet. ..</li>
            <li> 1.85 for a ton of eyelashes. Who wouldn&#x27;t love it. Thick ones for night and lighter more natural ones for day.</li>
            <li> i love these they are well made ....and so many :) i am buying them for my sister cause i know she will love them :)</li>
            <li> These are not even eyelashes, they&#x27;re plastic. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product and it&#x27;s vendor. They called me at 10:45 at night begging me to take down my negative review! These people are very unprofessional and their products are terrible. Please take my advice DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!</li>
            <li> I DO realize you get what you pay for, but geesh!!!!  These were so hideous, I donated the to the local theater group for costume/makeup!  Horrid...</li>
            <li> The lashes are great! and apply very smooth lol.. not bad for a few dollars! I will highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> These are plastic, did not like them at all. I should have known with the price. Too good to be true!</li>
            <li> I was so pumped when I saw this deal for 20 eyelashes! As an MUA this was a steal. I expected to get 10 natural eyelashes and 10 full eyelashes to use on clients.&lt;br /&gt;However, I received two broken boxes of lashes that have all fallen out of the package. My 10 natural lashes were all ripped up and cut up. My 10 full lashes were all sitting at the bottom of the package with what looked like glue already attached to them. All this goes without mentioning that I ordered these around May 17th and did receive them until June 10th! Way too long for any order if you ask me. It took so long I forgot I ordered them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never recommend anyone buy this product it cannot be used and is completely a waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unhappy customer.</li>
            <li> Do Not Buy these. lashes are to stiff and don&#x27;t flex to go with the contour of your eye lid. also they are to heavy for the best lash adhesives. i know they are cheap but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The package was a bit smooshed in places, but I kind of expected that as it was shipped all the way from Hong Kong! The lashes were all in tact though, and they look pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; **UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;After trying to put these on, I have decided that they are horrible. lol!&lt;br /&gt;The strips are very stiff and straight, so they don&#x27;t curve with your eyelid. I used two types of glue, and each time, the things straightened out so the corners became detached.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re better off getting lashes from Wal-Mart. lol</li>
            <li> they come without glue, and are too long, so you have to cut them a bit to fit your eyes besides that their fine.</li>
            <li> LOVE THEM, they look really real. Got lots of compliments at school. Recommended!</li>
            <li> this is the 4th time i order this eye lashes. i think they are perfect length. not to long but not too short either. and on the plus side they come with two diff. kinds if lashes..</li>
            <li> Eye lashes are not shaped to fit to eyelid. They do not stay on. Not going to be able to use any of them.</li>
            <li> Good product. Even better price. Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I do not to wear false eyelashes, but my kids like to play with them.  The price was so good, I didn&#x27;t mind getting them so they could play dress up.  They don&#x27;t come with glue, so remember to order it separately.  Other than that, they are a good deal.</li>
            <li> Hard to wear. Pretty cheap synthetic with a thick strip. But hey, They cost very little.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes look so fake they kept having a straight shape instead of curvy could not keep them on my lash line i dont recommend the seller</li>
            <li> Cheap,plastic, Cheap, very bad quality</li>
            <li> these eyelashes are wonderful they look so natural and nobody can ever tell I like to use hair extension glue to put them on because that is cheap and stays on for about a day it doesn&#x27;t hurt when you go to take it off</li>
            <li> their perfect and exactly what they say in the description and also it said I would get my between may 13 through jun 1 and I got them may 2</li>
            <li> If u luv fake lashes these are a must have product great all day wear this is my third order of them I even got my sister to get some great for a night out shipped sooner than expected :) .....,,, Lilly</li>
            <li> I personally dont&#x27; like them for what I was shopping for. Maybe for other people they would work. They are very full lashes. fast shipping though</li>
            <li> perfect. No need to look any further. Don&#x27;t for get to curve them. I do it like i am curling ribbon with my finger nail</li>
            <li> I love these lashes, I enjoy wearing them and there comfortable! Great for everyday or a girls night out I am ordering more!</li>
            <li> It was pretty difficult to get these on. I think that is due to the poor quality. There is a reason why they are so cheap...</li>
            <li> Best thing to get, I just love it!</li>
            <li> received and like that there are many. however I have not tried them on yet, so we will see then.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product</li>
            <li> very stiff and they do not apply easy</li>
            <li> I recieved the product alittle late and the box was alittle smashed but the lashes were perfectly fine. They are perfect for me and I love them. Great for a natural look as well as a dramatic look. I probably will only use the natural thin ones since the thicker ones are too much for me</li>
            <li> got this for a joke but my daughter love them</li>
            <li> These are surprisingly decent quality! Well worth the wait on shipping. I don&#x27;t notice a difference in these and other drug store lashes that cost three times as much for a single set.</li>
            <li> The price was right for this product but, not for me in the near future</li>
            <li> Not terrible, but not great. Worth it for the money and you can trim then and apply in small portions to give a more natural look.</li>
            <li> They do not stay on your eyes! (even with MAC adhesive) I tried using them for about a week. Everyday, my eyes would hurt because they would poke the corners of my eyes and would come half way off through out the day. I would advise you to buy the ones from walmart, even the dollar store has better ones. Thank you.</li>
            <li> took quite awhile to arrive, but theyre good lashes at a better price</li>
            <li> Very straight and hard to apply but once wrapped around a pencil, I made them work</li>
            <li> They are like plastic. yuck</li>
            <li> I love them, it&#x27;s worth the money. No its not human hair but they cute.</li>
            <li> These lashes are made of fairly thick plastic, it looks rather cheap.  I usually can&#x27;t keep them on for too long and will tear them off because it&#x27;ll fall off partway thru the night.  I&#x27;ve been wearing lashes for more than 5 years now, so I consider myself an expert.  They don&#x27;t take too much longer to put on, but its not helpful if these start falling off within an hour or two. I personally won&#x27;t be buying these again as they don&#x27;t serve my purposes.</li>
            <li> These just don&#x27;t work for me. I don&#x27;t know about others but the strip is so thick. They don&#x27;t stick for crap with any of the glue I have. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
            <li> GREAT EYELASHES..THE BEST IVE EVER USED.</li>
            <li> I love these!! They are cheap and they stay on!! I recommend them.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes my faves are the thicker ones</li>
            <li> Arrived whole weeks in advance!!! Great quality for price. They are a little more fake looking (as far realistic looking falsies go) than the higher dollar ones but great customer service, fast shipping and very comfortable</li>
            <li> Easy one day lashes, the only bad thing about them is you have to cut the inside and outside of the lashes due to them being too long</li>
            <li> I really love the new eyelashes, I love to mess around with makeup</li>
            <li> The whispie kinds are the best the other ones you can tell there on</li>
            <li> they are not eye lash feeling, they are plastic and hurt when you ware them,</li>
            <li> I love this product, cheap and useful in any occasion.</li>
            <li> Perfect, great condition and amazing price!</li>
            <li> Not a bad product.I would order them again.I just need more practice putting them on..</li>
            <li> Take your time flexing the lashes in its shape before placing it onto your lashes. Trim  to its perfect size to your eyes. With that being said, its perfect for the price. I used these lashes almost everyday going out night and day. The thin lashes seems just so natural.</li>
            <li> came on time from china? but too plastic? so couldnt wear them</li>
            <li> Not great quality at all.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed they don&#x27;t even have glue in the back and there really long what a shame</li>
            <li> The so called long lashes  are NOT at all long they are the same length of my own lashes. The thick ones are ok. Some of the lashes are longer than the other you have to mix n match. You also have to bend the lashes the don&#x27;t have the natural curve other lashes have that you buy from the store.</li>
            <li> Bought them more than 1 year ago still have some...I personally like the thinner ones...for everyday use...good value honestly for what u paid for</li>
            <li> They are pretty a little thin but if you want a fuller thicker eyelash look you can just stick a couple of pairs together only thing is they take forever to come</li>
            <li> I am happy this product was only two dollars, I was very disappointed when I received it in the mail. The eyelashes don&#x27;t even appear close to looking really. They look very plastic. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone to buy this product, you can go to a beauty supply store and get human hair eyelashes around the same price. Also, it takes about 2-3 weeks to ship. Hope this review was helpful :)</li>
            <li> Just got mine in the mail. I was very satisfied with how fast and quickly they were delivered to my house. Love them and they are not at all heavy. Thanks again!!!</li>
            <li> Murray for very natural or very dramatic looks, I find the quality to be great for the price.</li>
            <li> Cost efficient, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because I&#x27;m used to the quality of Ardell lashes, but you get what you pay for. Instead of using one lash for each eye, I also found it useful to cut each lash itself in half to use as demi lashes. The elastic is more firm than American quality lashes, so by cutting it in half I found it lasts longer during the day as opposed to using the entire lash. You won&#x27;t like these if you&#x27;re used to lashes that feel natural and comfortable on your eyes, these ones are quite long and inflexible.</li>
            <li> I bought it for someone else</li>
            <li> Got them right on time! Not sure why so many complaints on these no problems here! But I&#x27;m grateful with a good deal I guess!</li>
            <li> My daughter fell in love with these!</li>
            <li> These are really sturdy and pretty.  Easy to apply, too, which is a must.  There are a few styles to choose from, depending on what you&#x27;re looking for, and if the color matches then you have an ideal product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the color doesn&#x27;t match it won&#x27;t be horribly obvious, but it will be noticeable under close scrutiny, so keep that in mind too.</li>
            <li> Love the lashes makes me more prettier.</li>
            <li> Made for dolls not people</li>
            <li> They werent what i expected...</li>
            <li> Love the look and how natural they look as well only thing I don&#x27;t like is the long strain of hair that comes on the sides. If u cut them off its hard for you to put the eyelash back into the case . Other than that the price for this product is anazing</li>
            <li> Great product came as described just in time for valentine. My husband loved them had lots of fun also!</li>
            <li> They are horrible! Plastic and look cartoony. Unless it&#x27;s Halloween...DO NOT BUY!!</li>
            <li> Received the lashes missformed. They are hard to handle and they don&#x27;t stay on. The lashes are way too straight which makes applying harder. Not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend to friends and family? NO.</li>
            <li> If you have been to the store to buy eyelashes than you know that they are pretty pricey. I bought these and honestly every one said the dramatic was to much I liked them the most ! maybe my eyelashes are just that thin. I think they are really light which doesn&#x27;t bother me because then you don&#x27;t feel them as much. Great deal for the price I will buy again .&lt;br /&gt;  My only complaint is they took what seemed like forever to come in , 2 weeks or longer but Im close to the warehouse and usually get every thing quick.</li>
            <li> Marvelously put together! They wear and look, like a million dollar babe!</li>
            <li> I only got the regular long lashes</li>
            <li> they are okay , worth the price they are very thin on the top so it makes it difficult to glue on .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good deal! But it&#x27;s so hard to apply the lashes because maybe it&#x27;s just cause I&#x27;m amature but not bad i guess. It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> The price is amazing and I love these lashes. Even the more &amp;#34;dramatic&amp;#34; ones aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;too much.&amp;#34; I can wear both day or night. The lashes are fairly flexible and for the price you absolutely CANNOT GO WRONG!</li>
            <li> Loved these. Wear great . Very good quality</li>
            <li> Great quality. They also arrived sooner than predicted. Very happy with the length of the lashes and the bands. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Was not able to use these lashes because they were not sturdy. They were very flimsy. I threw them away.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised to get these lashes, they are full and lush and so many for such a great price.</li>
            <li> Well loved the eye lashes and the packaging was wonderfil could of asked for more i love the false lashes .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how to put them on but i try everyday and they look awesome! I got them for only a dollar and some change  couldn&#x27;t pass that by!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Style 2 was not long lashes they were very short. They were shorter than my regular lashes, so there is not way I could wear them.</li>
            <li> Love them look awesome on too!</li>
            <li> Party Lashes...&lt;br /&gt;Every day lashes</li>
            <li> Hopefully it last but good thou</li>
            <li> Very cheap,too long,does not stay on,I rather get them done at the salon or stick to the name brands</li>
            <li> They lasted me for a while and if you know how to put lashes on thn you shoulnt have any problems fitting them to your eye I thought they look good on me but that&#x27;s my opinion</li>
            <li> I ordered in April and still had not received them by July. Contacted seller and eventually received them. Flimsy cheap and hard to put on! More than half of them bent from shipping to the point you can&#x27;t use them! You get what you pay for... I know they are a cheap price but definitely a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I bought these just to practice putting them on but i fell in love with them!!!!! I just bought 2 sets just so i wont run out.&lt;br /&gt;I WILL DEFINITELY KEEP BUYING THESE!!!!</li>
            <li> A lot of my lashes were bent unfortunately, but not terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I also wouldn&#x27;t suggest these lashes to a beginner as I was, however they did make it a lot easier to use natural eye lashes.</li>
            <li> ok for the price, but not very easy to attach kinda thick plastic to eyelids</li>
            <li> Eh good for some cheap ones. I used it for cosplay so it worked well for that, but I wouldnt get them for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Great quality and looks amazing</li>
            <li> Bought these last year, they&#x27;re great I love that I get 2 choices and super affordable. Just ordered a new set. Don&#x27;t know why there&#x27;s so many bad reviews.</li>
            <li> These were shipped exactly on time and the only issue I have with the shipping is that the boxes containing the lashes were stuffed into an envelope and arrived a little smushed (hence the subtraction of one star). The lashes themselves were in their proper places except for a few that had gotten loose and despite them probably being shipped that way, were not flattened at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the lashes~ I tried the natural looking lashes the other day, and they were perfect! I had to cut away the excess on the ends (which keep them in place in the box) and to hide the part that attaches to my eyelid, I just brushed some eyeshadow over it like it was a liner, and ta-dah! They were very easy to clean, and I figure I can get at least two or three more uses out the the pair I used. My boyfriend loves &#x27;em, but isn&#x27;t sure about the thick set I have. Personally, I&#x27;m excited to try them but I&#x27;m waiting for a special occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gotta say it was SUCH A GOOD IDEA to buy these together instead of separate. I totally saved money on this purchase and I&#x27;ll probably buy from these guys again.</li>
            <li> Great lashes! They look incredible!</li>
            <li> I love them add mascara looks very natural :) definitely will order again very satisfied</li>
            <li> I bought these for cosplay purposes and man are they amazing!! Such a great deal for so many lashes, they are not only accurate for anime cosplay, but comfortable too! As per usual with lashes, you just cut them to your eye size, bend them to your shape and glue them on. Perfect!</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t realize that these were coming from china and the expected delivery date started 25 days after I ordered it but the product actually came in about 10 days. It&#x27;s worth the wait because the price is cheap :) They are good to play around with.</li>
            <li> I got them really fast and they are so easy to wear! I would definitely order these lashes again. They also can be worn more than once because they do last</li>
            <li> thick ones sit funny but are ok the lighter ones i love!</li>
            <li> everyone was right on the shipping my box was so cramped in the envelope its a miracle the eye lashes didn&#x27;t get damage will a few kinda did but not noticeable.... the lashes do look a little like plastic I know this may sound dumb but they look extra fake, but when u put em on they look great and you barely feel them, I do like them specially for the price and quantity</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price. No complains!</li>
            <li> i love the lighter lashes. they feel so comfortable. will be buying again in the near future! love love love it!!!</li>
            <li> this took forever to get to me! they are a little flimsy but my daughter bought better glue and she said they are okay.</li>
            <li> Poor quality. Too hard to use.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes works good but, I just wish it came with glue and I wished that it was a little bit thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> The bases are a bit stiff, so they require a good bit of flexing before application, but all in all, a good value for the money. Just expect to have to soften them up a good bit before using. Just make sure they are completely dried and affixed before heading out!</li>
            <li> The eyelashes are plastic not my cup of tea. Their not that really great. But they cheap though but not for me</li>
            <li> Very good for the price but u get what u pay for it , this lashes are long and stife not for easy aplication so u need to be good and play a little befor u use them , still like it but to much work !</li>
            <li> Pretty eyelashes and good product the only bad thing I can is that when the product was deliverd it was all smashed up and made some of the eyelashes ugly</li>
            <li> Eyelashes were made from plastic . Doesn&#x27;t matter how much its being sold for wouldn&#x27;t buy again. Please do better</li>
            <li> Seriously youll never come across a deal like this I love all my lashes n even gave some to all my girls so were fabulous together 1-5 day use each if u use them right n honestly 4 $ for one pair or 2 $ for alll these options :)</li>
            <li> Just what I expected !!! These lashes are fantastic !!</li>
            <li> One of the best values thus far for false lashes.  My only disenchantment was that the natural lashes are very thin.  Still a very good value.</li>
            <li> For the price this is great. I give it 4 stars because I would of liked the eyelashes to not be so heavy. Lash style #2 are more noticeable for me. Style 1 are very Doll looking very full and not long enough for my taste. Overall, this was great for this price. I also had to cut them which made me mess up like one pair or so. Oh well, still good. :) enjoy</li>
            <li> How can they sell these for practically free? The lashes are great!!! I have to trim mine a little to get it to fit my eye, but they are easy to put on, feel and look natural. I use the heavier sets for going out at night. The thinner set for daytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super deal!!</li>
            <li> hassle at first but once you get a hang of it they&#x27;re perfect especially for the price. i use hair glue to practice with these. i dont need eye lashes but i like adding that full look to my long lashes. and i use hair glue so i wont end up lash less lol</li>
            <li> I ordered these eyelashes on December 1st and got them today January 5 so they take awhile to get here.  They&#x27;re great for the price even if you dont like them there not much of a loss. Both the styles feel and look great I really love them. You can easily stack them if you want thinker or longer lashes or leave them as is . I dont have anything negative to say except the shipping, over all there awesome lashes for the price</li>
            <li> I just got my shipment and I LOVE them! The shipping takes close to a month since it&#x27;s coming from China but definitely worth the money, they are easy to apply you just have to trim off the ends, if you know how to apply eyelashes they are super easy and they are very comfortable on and not to mention, stunning!</li>
            <li> Only got long not the thick in package but for $2 can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> Very bad never buying again if I could get a refund I would , bad shape.</li>
            <li> there are so many mixed reviews about these lashes but if you are a pro like me these are helpful and I would really order them they are not hard at all but I may have gotten a good batch good lashes as far as I&#x27;m concerned</li>
            <li> The company is great&lt;br /&gt;But i just had a&lt;br /&gt;Hard time tryinf to put them on theyre way to stiff</li>
            <li> Ordered them for my sister she loves them</li>
            <li> these are great you can cut them to fit.. the eye lashes are set up to give you the natural curves of your eye.. great product</li>
            <li> Love them! The make my eyes and make up really pop out!</li>
            <li> great value...great product...well worth the money...will buy again if needed. easy to use and package keeps them nice and neat. love it</li>
            <li> I ordered dese falsies a couple months bacc. They arrived fast and n perfect condition. They look really nice tho I had 2 cut dem a lil and I also gave a few 2 my friend n she love it also!</li>
            <li> Good and low price, am happy with the purchase A++++++ good product and a lot of Pairs nice nice nice ......</li>
            <li> Came pretty fast considering where it came from usually I wait a lot longer. Good price for amount of eyelashes. I know they are FAKE eyelashes but they look too fake if that makes any sense..these are lot more stiffer than other eyelashes</li>
            <li> Every makeup artists Christmas gift last year! They are great.</li>
            <li> These are extremely cheap and when I recieved them the box was all bent up with the eyelashes everywhere (NOT HELD DOWN). Also some are broken!!!! I hate them!!!!! I wouldn&#x27;t have paid one cent from them. I also tried to contact them and they never got back with me! Dont order these!!!!</li>
            <li> These are plastic, rubbery lashes. Better suited for a doll than  a person. Ridiculous that they would even sell these. A complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality, plastic like material. Won&#x27;t even hold mascara to make look realistic.</li>
            <li> The price was right for the amount of lashes received, not gonna complain there. The quality of the lashes though isn&#x27;t up to par. However, with the right glue, and application process anyone can make these work. These are my emergency lashes now, in the event I dont have time to buy new ones or have time to apply the individual lashes.</li>
            <li> Thought the price was to good to be true, and I was right...it was a cheap quality item, and I&#x27;d rather pay more and in return recieve a much better quality item.  The lashes look cheap, and unatractive.  Wasn&#x27;t to satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very plastic-y feeling, made my eyes itch</li>
            <li> The lashes are too stiff and are too difficult to use. They need to be softer</li>
            <li> Loved the eyelashes. Super good and for a really cheap prize! I love using them on myself and on other people. Rey are fantastic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an everyday eyelash wearer. It can get a little expensive but this changed it all. They are more of plastic then actual hair but that&#x27;s why I love them. They last longer through water, since you have so many and for such a low price I don&#x27;t feel bad about throwing a pair away. I double up the thins once with the thick ones and cut the length a little. It does it a while to come in since they&#x27;re imported but the wait is werth it.</li>
            <li> loved them, just had to cut them a bit shorter so they fit my eyes, but that was it, they look great!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re too fake looking. The base is too thick, they wont bend to shape the eye, and they are very stiff so they kinda pop off yur eye. Uncomfortable fit. Heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;U get what u pay for...... I never left the house with either styles on.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with Style 1! I cut up Style 2 because its a little much for me, but  I ordered this product twice because I loved the price.  You can always personalize them and cut them down if its too long.  This is a thumbs up from me!</li>
            <li> These turned out way better than expected and for such a wonderful price! I have worn them a few times already and haven&#x27;t experienced the same issues as other lashes</li>
            <li> Do not be scared to buy this eyelashes they will save you  so much  money</li>
            <li> Not as good as the kind you buy in the stores, but considering you get 20 pairs for the price you would pay for just one pair in the store makes it totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I love my eyelashes! They look exactly the same as in the picture. They arrived in tact. they&#x27;re beautiful! And for that prive I couldn&#x27;t be happier! Definitely buying more.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these eyelashes!It&#x27;s really a great set for the money. It came really fast too, excellent service.Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> Low quality,  plastic looking . It&#x27;s better to just spend a little bit more  $$$ and get quality lashes</li>
            <li> shipping takes a while and unable to track were the item is at. Other than that its a great christmas gift for my friend.</li>
            <li> I wear eyelashes everyday. The eyelashes are great for a great price. Plus you have the choice of dramatic or natural.</li>
            <li> These lashes are so cheap and aren&#x27;t even made of human hair. It looks so noticeable that your eyelashes are 110% FAKE when you wear them. Incognito much? I think not. The fibers on the lashes also give off this glare that make it so obvious that the lashes aren&#x27;t yours.</li>
            <li> The lashes were all there but the box was a little smashed. The shipping took a while but I still really liked this product. I think it&#x27;s a great price and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li> It looked very cheap ...I didn&#x27;t like them at all..they were so rubbery</li>
            <li> They are kind of stiff but you get what you pay for. They aren&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> To long for me but its a great buy</li>
            <li> They came earlier than expected which was awesome. I&#x27;m totally ordering more. Not to mention they&#x27;re really good for the price.</li>
            <li> These are perfect to use over and over again not just once love the thick ones and the other ones I wear on a daily basis good job!</li>
            <li> I just received this about a month after purchasing and the boxes they came in were literally so damaged and broken I have yet to actually wear them but that review will come later.</li>
            <li> I like them,have good quality , I use them to perfection will ask nothing other good brands. use them good.</li>
            <li> It feels like plastic. I will not recommend to anyone else. I will not be buying again. There is nothing else to say.. But I need 20 words to leave a review lol</li>
            <li> They are pretty nice. Had to cut them short because they were long, but they are great.</li>
            <li> Love em superrr I wil definitely order some more👍</li>
            <li> My young daughter could not believe what I paid for 20 pairs. She loves them and the quality is not bad</li>
            <li> so much cheaper than buying them from Sally&#x27;s and walmart. I haven&#x27;t used the heavy looking one but love the light one. I put mascara on and well, they look AMAZING if i may say.</li>
            <li> It arrived finally after 1 month and some days but they are easy to put on and it serves the purpose</li>
            <li> I love my new lashes. They&#x27;re great. I love that I get everyday and going out lashes and for the price how can you beat that. They came pretty fast too. If you need lashes I would suggest these.</li>
            <li> The first box arrived smooshed so some of the eyelashes were out of shape and the box was messed up. The second box was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were too big for eyes and didn&#x27;t look like the picture. I was looking forward to the shorter, thicker ones but they look really tacky. They can be worked with if you cut them up a bit.</li>
            <li> i love these eye lashes i was waiting for them to come because i ran out of money to got to the store and just buy a pair :) they are wonderful!</li>
            <li> These lashes are plastic. I didn&#x27;t attempt to apply them, I just threw them away. I suggest paying a little more for lashes at Walmart, etc.</li>
            <li> They arrived at my house very damaged. How can I wear them that way? They also look and feel very cheap.</li>
            <li> The thinner set look so real!</li>
            <li> So, first off, I&#x27;d like to say that I am very excited about these eyelashes! They were a steal at such an in-expensive price. I really enjoyed having two different options in the style: thicker and darker for a night on the town, or a thinner, more natural look for everyday use. Each set, comes in FIVE DIFFERENT LENGTHS! You get 10 pairs of each style as well. What is not to love about that, ladies?? The lashes do stay on all day or all night, or even all day and all night! I didn&#x27;t even have to mess with mascara after putting them on! The thinner, day time ones were perfect for a work atmosphere at a women&#x27;s clothing boutique. The darker, thicker ones were perfect for a night out with the girls. The only down side was that I had to cut the width of them because they were a little too wide, but that may not be a bad thing for you dolls who have big, gorgeous eyes! I would advise each and every one of you to try out these perfect accessories for any outfit or occasion![[ASIN:B00538TSMU 20 Pairs Regular Long and Thick Eyelashes Style 1 and 2]]</li>
            <li> I am giving it three stars only because they were cheap, but I found them completely useless due to the corners not being flexible and not sticking, making it seam as your eyelashes are about to fly off your face.&lt;br /&gt;For a one time party use, will definitely do. But for someone who likes to use them every other day, and is too impatient to glue them on, it&#x27;s a waste of time ( because I found that it took more effort and time to put them on)</li>
            <li> I love it. This is a very great deal for the price. I used already. Looks very nice like real.</li>
            <li> The thick ones were too thick and unnatural.  It would have been better if you could order just the thinner ones and not the thick ones.</li>
            <li> Let me just put it like this You get what you pay for. I haven&#x27;t used them and mostliky won&#x27;t sorry</li>
            <li> when I got them I expected better but after applying a few coats of mascara they look spectacular :)&lt;br /&gt;the thinner ones I use for a neutral look and my thick ones I use for a more night out look! can&#x27;t complain got 20 pairs for 35 cents. definitely coming back to purchase these again.</li>
            <li> Worst lashes ever they felt and looked like plastic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting for mine can&#x27;t wait , love dramatic lashes , and I&#x27;ll wear my natrual ones w. Mascara ☺</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for. The lashes are.... just okay. I would recommend investing in something quality worthy.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing eyelashes online since I discovered that It is a better deal. If you are just learning how to apply lashes you will notice that this come in handy. No need to keep buying single lashes that cost 5 or 7 dollars a set, that you will only use once. I have purchased all brands, katy perry, elf , ardell etc and most lashes are the same thing.!! I really like this lashes because I can cut them to my size and wear only once and then dispose</li>
            <li> Love! Love! Love! You can use them more than twice. Would recommend duo glue with this product which allows you to rewear them many times if you take good care of them. A pack can last up to 4 months! If you wear them everyday.</li>
            <li> I got most of my lashes bent, and they werent long enough to cover the whole eye like most do. But I guess you do get what you pay for..</li>
            <li> It was my first time purchasing eyelashes and the first Time I put them on me.I was so happy with the results and the seductive look I had! ;-)</li>
            <li> I just got my order in. It came much sooner than expected. They look great cannot wait to try them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy camper.</li>
            <li> I received these 2 weeks early. They are cute &amp; I wore these with no problem. They are synthetic but I had no issue with it. You get what you pay for. In this case you get A LOT!  this was a great buy &amp; I will be buying again. I wore the thicker lashes in the pic..</li>
            <li> These are pretty good. They don&#x27;t feel very high quality but u can&#x27;t tell from the way they look on. I like them for everyday use and you get a lot for such a cheap price</li>
            <li> The lashes are really nice. The weft is really soft and pliable so it takes a steady hand to apply them. Make sure you buy glue!</li>
            <li> I am overall pleased with these lashes. The thin ones are nice because you can coat them with mascara for a more realistic look.  My only complaint about these lashes is that unlike the human ones I get, these are less flexible so you feel them when you put them on. I got a few compliments on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box they came in was a little beat up, but they came a little earlier than expected. I would recommend these....ladies, stock up!</li>
            <li> I love these lashes!. They are perfect. The natural looking ones do look very natural on my eyes and the thick ones are great for a little drama. Either way I love the look of both lashes. Not to mention the price is insanely cheap. Shipping took about 2 weeks but so worth the wait. HAPPY</li>
            <li> There were legit, get them if you like the dramatic side of beauty, the thin ones are very natural and the the thick ones are very dramatic, love them both!</li>
            <li> The thick lashes were way too long. I just wish i had known that. i don&#x27;t really use them. The thinner ones i do use constantly. Sadly the packaging was bad, two of my cases smushed and they came out funny. some lashes had been bent for staying in a wrong position during transit.</li>
            <li> Im new with wearing false eyelashes but I have found eyelashes that cost $5 for a single pair that was the same quality as these! I love them and will order more in the future!</li>
            <li> this what i was looking for it was easy to put on and take off but you need to buy the glue to stick it on..the item came in well pack and fast..</li>
            <li> These are great.The price was worth it.The quality and the amount I rec. I will be ordering some more when I run out. I love the heavy lashes. The best! The look cool for evening wear. Don&#x27;t judge the heavy ones till you try them out.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE THE MOST AMAZING THINGS I&#x27;VE EVER SEEN. THEY APPLY NICELY AND THEY ARE SO LONG AND THICK! IT&#x27;S CRAZY! 5 STARS!</li>
            <li> I like in jersey . Not a thing to dislike about this product . Very affordable . Good investment I will gladly buy more . 😍💕💳</li>
            <li> I buy these every couple of months, so or received at least 5 sets of orders. That being said, they&#x27;ve been slightly different every time. There&#x27;s always a thick and a thin pair, but some look more natural than others. For as many as you get, it&#x27;s seriously a good deal. They&#x27;re basically disposable, which is good, because I don&#x27;t have the patience to take care of my lashes, but if you remember to store them, each pair can last up to a week. Obviously these flat, strip lashes require a bit of work in order to be useable. I usually cut one in half, trim the sides, and bend each half around my finger, then apply adhesive. This seems to be the best method for full, natural looking lashes. If you don&#x27;t cut or bend them, then they will probably end up looking a little weird.</li>
            <li> Very hard to use. I expected them to be cheap at the price I paid. My review is not because I feel like I was scammed but just to let people know not to even waste your money..</li>
            <li> Thank you just got it a few days ago, looks great</li>
            <li> Terrible customer service &amp;&amp; the eye lashes are gross &amp;&amp; really hard ! &amp;&amp; when I tried to return them they wouldn&#x27;t do it ! Do not buy</li>
            <li> I bought it because it s so cheap comparable with the price and amount. It s good for someone who like to make up.</li>
            <li> Love these!! They came faster than I expected!! I ordered this 1-20-15 and got them today! Idk why ppl keep saying they are not worth 1$. They do bend and they fit perfect on my eyes. I honestly do not do any reviews but I really had to do a review on this because ppl on here are wrong!! I recommend this product if you love wearing eyelashes. I hope this help anyone thinking about buying this.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a second pair! The band is thinner this time can&#x27;t wait to put them on,  shopping was and delivery was 11 days. I will buy more</li>
            <li> Took long to come but the lashes are nice and super soft the only complain is that my box that my lashes came in was crushed</li>
            <li> Thick lashes are very long and full-looking but still very light. Thinner lashes look almost spiky and are very short, I personally like but someone else may not (look like real lashes loaded with mascara). Received the lashes early. Very nice quality.</li>
            <li> Horrible product, very bad quality. It&#x60;s the kind of cheap that is worth 0, so it&#x60;s better to look for a quality one.</li>
            <li> Cheap and poorly made.</li>
            <li> NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE!!! BOTH ITEMS CAME TO THE RIGHT EYE ONLY!!! SO I HAD BOTH 20 PAIRS OF REGULAR AND THINK LASHES TO JUST MY RIGHT EYE! DONT PURCHASE! WASTE OF MONEY</li>
            <li> This package is perfect. The lighter lashes are great for daytime, and the thicker lashes add the perfect touch to your night makeup. The thicker ones do look a little plastick&#x27;y, but at night it is not noticeable. Also, make sure to carry/have scissors (specially when traveling) because they require that you cut off the ends before applying them; Not because they are too long, but because they have an extra piece on each side where they are attached to the box.</li>
            <li> the thicker lashes were not comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t complain hahaha. I was planning on using these for my friends and I for prom. We&#x27;ve done a trial and they can definitely look beautiful, you just have to trim them to fit your eyes better and maybe thin it out if it&#x27;s too dramatic. My only complaint is that they are very stiff, making them pretty uncomfortable and hard to put on. But for the price, I&#x27;m not surprised. Still great lashes!</li>
            <li> eh not worth it lol they look very plastic-ish</li>
            <li> Love these &amp; price is just right. Only thing is work them a little before applying(use ur nail and run it along the connection hard part to curve n make them stick better if needed) and trim ends evenly to avoid scratching</li>
            <li> They took long and were smashed but i needed them</li>
            <li> I was greatly disappointed! The majority of these lashes were unusable because of the way they were packaged. The natural curve was missing so I couldn&#x27;t attach them correctly.</li>
            <li> Super cheap looking! Can&#x27;t put them on! Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Amazing hot priced deals will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> this just is really bad</li>
            <li> Would not stay on. Second star is just in case it was the glue, but I doubt it. They were very stiff.</li>
            <li> Do not go on well at all.</li>
            <li> the style one is way to thick and looks so fake and the other one style two is what i wear since it gives it a more natural look but i would say go out and buy ones from e.l.f at target its only $1 and my opinion better quality.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter was really pleased. It was a great price and well worth it, especially since she loves wearing them.</li>
            <li> Great lashes. Easily trimmed. Each pair can be worn more than once. I&#x27;m happy enough that I already ordered another set.</li>
            <li> These were shipped exactly on time and the only issue I have with the shipping is that the boxes containing the lashes were stuffed into an envelope and arrived a little smushed (hence the subtraction of one star). The lashes themselves were in their proper places except for a few that had gotten loose and despite them probably being shipped that way, were not flattened at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the lashes~ I tried the natural looking lashes the other day, and they were perfect! I had to cut away the excess on the ends (which keep them in place in the box) and to hide the part that attaches to my eyelid, I just brushed some eyeshadow over it like it was a liner, and ta-dah! They were very easy to clean, and I figure I can get at least two or three more uses out the the pair I used. My boyfriend loves &#x27;em, but isn&#x27;t sure about the thick set I have. Personally, I&#x27;m excited to try them but I&#x27;m waiting for a special occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gotta say it was SUCH A GOOD IDEA to buy these together instead of separate. I totally saved money on this purchase and I&#x27;ll probably buy from these guys again.</li>
            <li> Not what i was expecting.....not very particular about the shape on thicker lashes..but price very reasonable...shipping does take a while</li>
            <li> Would not stay on!!!! Used 2 different types of adhesive</li>
            <li> Very stiff irritated my eyes</li>
            <li> these eyelashes are nice. i love them. they are not difficult to apply. they are not hard and i love the quality. they sent me the wrong style 1, but it&#x27;s whatever. these lashes are trill...</li>
            <li> I like these lashes a lot and they are super cute. They are very comfortable and I would recommend these lashes especially since they are very cheap</li>
            <li> Cheap feel like broom bristles</li>
            <li> loved these will be purchasing more when I run out. There cheap so you can&#x27;t expect super high quality eyelashes but there good for the price. They take longer to come because there from hongkong but they came on time. I really recommend these great, great, great product :)</li>
            <li> 20 pairs for under $3.00? It&#x27;s usually 1 pair for $5.00! Need I say more? Love these. You may have to snip them to fit your eye, but that&#x27;s all! If you know how to apply falsies then putting these on will be a snap. (:</li>
            <li> The thick ones are way too long I would never wear them. The other ones look nice I cut them in half and wear them on the outside of each eye and it looks natural. It is a good product for someone who likes obviously fake lashes.</li>
            <li> So, I Read The Reviews, Some Good - Some Bad | Blah Blah. I Was Skeptical At First, But The Purchase Turned Out Great!! It Came WAY Earlier Than Expected &amp; The Lashes Are SUPER Pretty, The Band Is Just A Little Thin... Overall - Great ♡</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great I guess I thought they&#x27;d be more like human lashes however I would and will definitely order more !.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really love them to drag queen for me</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t exactly as I expected but I did end up  really like the more natural looking ones ..</li>
            <li> yes i will recomend this product because have different kind of eyelashes for use in different events, conclusión I recomend this product</li>
            <li> Expected Delivery date was no sooner than July 25th.  I got the lashes on 7/15! Boxes got a little crushed but all the lashes were in tact and usable.</li>
            <li> They look very anime-ish. They started irritating my eyes because I&#x27;m not used to such a hard band on my eyelids. It doesn&#x27;t move with your eyes. Just imagine having a piece of plastic on your eyelid. Definitely don&#x27;t wear these if you&#x27;ll be outside or all day like for work. These should definitely only be used for a couple of hours while indoors. Bring your eyelash glue because it will start to peel off. Perhaps if you bend and play with the plastic to make it less rigid then it will feel better. I will still use them because they are nice but just not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I recently bought these and i love them . ill probably be ordering . a set a mo. i just ordered for next mo. thank you :)</li>
            <li> I loved the thicker lashes and seemed better than some of the human hair lashes I wear. The thinner set I did not like so much.</li>
            <li> I know some people were complaining about these lashes but with the price I thought if give them a try. First I have to say they arrived right on time which is great! I order from amazon a lot and know great stuff when I see it. No these aren&#x27;t the Katy perry lashes or something obviously they are cheap but they do the job. They look real and are easy to apply. I also appreciate the fact that the shop emailed me making sure I got them and that they were satisfactory. That is amazing customer service I have order many things and have never got an email assuring my happiness. I do and will recommend this product to anyone!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great price and very good quality.</li>
            <li> Although the shipping took too long the lashes are great. Feel like human hair.</li>
            <li> What a view in the picture is what I came cantidad.en equal and quality is same as buying other brand.</li>
            <li> I was worried about these at first but they&lt;br /&gt;Look amazing on my face!  I&#x27;ve gotten lots of love of ppl for wearing these. I had to cut the second box down a little bit but if you want that super dramatic look then it will work for you as is!</li>
            <li> They look like they&#x27;d be super thick, but they actually look quite natural. You need to cut them from the backing at they are sewn tot he card board. Aside from the super long shipping, I was happy w/ my purchase</li>
            <li> horrible, just thick and bulky.</li>
            <li> Awesome amount of lashes for the price you pay, but I was rather put off by the cheap packaging it was in. But I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> For the price I&#x27;m not gonna complain.</li>
            <li> These lashes are cute, as natural as false lashes are, flexible, more for an everyday look with a little glam. 5 stars for the seller Fashion Factory, which has excellent Customer Service, prompt and courteous problem resolutions. Thank you!</li>
            <li> They are good! My box was beat up &amp; some where not attached. But I got them faster then I had presumed. Being the fact they are a cheap buy plus I received free delivery! But besides that you get what you pay for in a GOOD WAY!!</li>
            <li> Got them fast considering they are from china...and I love them! Flexable and easy to apply. Only had to trim them a little.</li>
            <li> I love these....they are very easy to apply although they took forever to come it...now that i am wearing them I get complements everyday</li>
            <li> I received my lashes on the very first expected delivery date so I was very pleased with shipping! I love both styles of lashes, but I can&#x27;t try them on yet because I have to buy glue, but other than that I am very excited to get to try these on! They are very pretty!</li>
            <li> What can i say i LOVE  EM.Although they have to be manipulated a bit to conform to the shape of my eyes.Also had to trim the ends a  bit.&lt;br /&gt;Love the dramatic sets,they r perfect and i usually wnt wear those everyday,the naturals were a bit to natural for me so i just take two and glue em together to add some fullness.They were cheap,and shipping was free.I def order these again .ALSO PEOPLE KEEP IN MIND THESE ARE SYNTHETIC N NOT HUMAN HAIR sooooo JUST BE PATIENT. And u can get two or three uses out of them. shipping took abt three weeks but it was worth it</li>
            <li> I wish it had the glue</li>
            <li> Lovee them! I&#x27;m so picky with eyelashes ! Glad I found these :D</li>
            <li> good for the price. I took one star off because of the how long it took to receive.</li>
            <li> box was crushed when I got it, the lashes fell apart when I tried to apply them. I was sad.</li>
            <li> I would consider them anytime. The arrived well and on time. Thank You. Kindly appreciate. I will continue to purchase in the near future. Highly recommend. Very Pretty.</li>
            <li> These are thick and have no curve to them, so it&#x27;s hard to adhere to the eyes. Spend a few more dollars and buy red cherry or ardell. These are crap!</li>
            <li> My daughters loved them. They wear the every day! Received  them quickly.</li>
            <li> This was perfect for me</li>
            <li> They are really big have to trim alot for my eyes</li>
            <li> they dont fit ur eye you got to cut them to  adjust to ur eye lids took 3weeks to come in supper fast from china material was cheap u just need a good glue for lashes and they will be fine but there good cheap looking natural eye lashes</li>
            <li> this product is wonderful, thank you...i love it so much, makes my lashes longer and fuller, i feel like a different woman...</li>
            <li> Some of the lashes had white thread in them that I couldnt remove but for the price Id probably purchase in bulk again</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re beautiful and natural looking, the perfect length, and they&#x27;re so cheap it&#x27;s practically a steal! All I recommend is that you bend them up back and forth with your fingertips a little before application because they can be a little stiff, other than that they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
            <li> Omg i don&#x27;t even know why I bought these. They are so hard, there&#x27;s no way someone can put them on. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Sometimes cheap things are not that great</li>
            <li> I have received better lashes for the same price. These are too firm to put on and not long enough from corner to corner (and I have tiny eyes!)</li>
            <li> They are very shiny and pretty large but that&#x27;s okay for the price. I can cut them up and use in sections or layer them for drama. Also, I&#x27;m in makeup school and I go through lashes very quickly, so this is ideal for me.</li>
            <li> honestly i just got them but my first time trying a pair on not too long ago, they had trouble sticking and i use heavy duty glue (duo) and I&#x27;ve been wearing falsies for at least 6 years :\</li>
            <li> Great for the price.  20 pair of lashes that still cheaper than the price one pair in the store.  Not made of real hair.</li>
            <li> So many eyelashes, as promised. They did their job and made me pretty and my eyes pop, especially while having my features drowned out in grey face paint.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to mess-up falsies.</li>
            <li> They took FOREVER to get...close to a month.  It did state that it could take long, so don&#x27;t expect them any sooner than that.</li>
            <li> They are pretty good considering the price. You have to snip away the ends. I can&#x27;t use the dramatic lashes though. They are way too gaudy and I gave them to my friend.</li>
            <li> The thins lashes make your eyes look long and natural the thick ones make you look like you have a caterpillar on your eyes.</li>
            <li> Definetly worth price!&lt;br /&gt;So cheap and reusable at least twice!&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely continue purchasing more from now on.&lt;br /&gt;Best bargain iv found!!!</li>
            <li> I love them... Get complemented every time. If you want you can cut the darker set of lashes into different styles of lashes to make it look more unique and they&#x27;re reusable if you take care of them right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one set so far, looks natural, didn&#x27;t stay on long, but that could be due to me not applying them correctly to my eye lid.</li>
            <li> They are cheap and don&#x27;t stay on. They&#x27;re hard</li>
            <li> But anyways this is amazing I wish it was a lil more stiff but ya they came out beautiful and I will order more.</li>
            <li> I rather pay $7 to $10 dollars for some eyelashes than using this. They look so fake.</li>
            <li> These lashes are priced extremely good, they aren&#x27;t the kind of lashes professional makeup artists might use for a pop singer&#x27;s music video or anything but they&#x27;re good lashes nonetheless. I find these to be perfect for beginners who are just learning how to trim them down and for those learning how they want their eyes to look with falsies on. You can trim all but a few hairs off the ends and create your own single lashes from the entire band. I&#x27;ve used them whole and I&#x27;ve also trimmed them to fit my particular desires for the day&#x27;s look. They wear comfortably and as long as you put the glue on the lash band correctly and place them well, they&#x27;ll wear just as well and just as long as any other brand of lashes. I really feel the only difference in these and expensive brands is that these are synthetic. I recommend them, can&#x27;t be these for the price!! They&#x27;re really fun!!</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, but wasn&#x27;t what I expected. It was more like the Halloween lashes. But still came with a great variety.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are super heavy and the adhesive strip is so thick that you can totally tell you are wearing fake eyelashes. I like to go for a more hidden/natural eyelash look. The eyelashes are plastic , I preffer paying the 5$ for a pair because they are so much easier to put on and stay on longer. When I wore these I felt like a doll, the ones where the eyes roll back lol !</li>
            <li> This is an amazing deal! The lashes are well made and look fabulous. The thicker lashes are very dramatic and perfect for an ultra glamorous night on the town. The thinner ones are nice for everyday evening wear. I purchased several sets and my daughters are loving theirs as well.</li>
            <li> They look nice but the part u glue on is little bigger then most but over all they work pretty well</li>
            <li> I ordered these as a gift for my sister! You get 40 pairs and the great part is the timely manor they came in, before the estimated arrival too. She hasn&#x27;t worn them yet but I am crossing my fingers that they look great!</li>
            <li> I love my lashes I&#x27;ve been using them a lot lately &amp; they are great. For this price its great i can&#x27;t wait to purchase more.</li>
            <li> Really stiff lashes.  Make sure to have a scissors on hand to give them a trim. A little advice, after you put the glue on, bend the lashes to form an upside &amp;#34;U&amp;#34;  to help it form easier to your eyes.</li>
            <li> great lashes especially for the price I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> They are a little harder to work than the lashes I used to buy</li>
            <li> As someone who is new to fake eyelash application i hate these lashes. They are very cheaply made and do not provide the neccessary bend to allow them to stay on. You get what you pay for i suppose. Would not recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> You will most likely have to trip these so that they fit. They are a bit too plastic, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> So I bought these on recommendation and was pretty nervous about it at first since I don&#x27;t have too much lash experience other than a few dollarstore pairs as a test but I really enjoy these. With a little clipping and bending to shape them you can get them on pretty nicely and the results are great. My natural lashes are pretty long and similar in length to the style 2 set so I use those for a little thickening on days when I need to look more uppity but the style 1 set is my favorite. They&#x27;re full and not as choppy looking as some other sets I have. You do have to purchase your own glue but I think that&#x27;s a small thing compared to the use you get out of these. If you clean and store them right they&#x27;re easily reusable so you get some nice milage out of them. Definitely enjoying my sets.</li>
            <li> These lashes are AWFUL! Do not buy them - they are cheap for a reason! I ended up throwing them out! The band is too thick which makes it such a process to apply! Never again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE LASHES. HOWEVER THEY ARE A BIT ON THE LONG SIDE AND HARD TO TAKE OUT THE BOX. WHEN YOU GET READY TO PUT THEM ON YOU WILL HAVE TO CUT BOTH SIDES OF THE LASHES, BECAUSE THERE ARE LONG STRINGS ON THE SIDE.</li>
            <li> I love the eyelashes .&lt;br /&gt;#1 is kind of big but i still liked them because i like my eyelashes big .&lt;br /&gt;#2 is VERY natural looking. the only thing about it is that the eyelashes are thin so theyre kind of hard to put on.&lt;br /&gt;Both - you can get 2-3 wears out of them. theyre 10 of them in each box &amp; theyre not as wide as you think theyre are. They fit my eye perfectly fine but for really small eyes , youll want to trim them &amp; they dont come with glue</li>
            <li> I actually thought they were going to look bad, but noooo not at all they look real on me &amp; they are pretty! i loved them &amp; the price?!?! AMAZING!</li>
            <li> you know what i hate the most? these is no eye lash glue on the lashes or in the box with the lashes, so there they sit in my bathroom dresser drawer. they are nothing to write home about. you&#x27;d be better off getting a single pair with the self adhesive. they look cheap!</li>
            <li> These lashes are really stiff there hard to put on unless you take the time to bend them and flex them also they weren&#x27;t as long as I had hoped for</li>
            <li> Somewhat stiff but they are amazing after bending them in</li>
            <li> Would give no stars if that was an option. Maybe good for someone who hasn&#x27;t used good quality lashes but I couldn&#x27;t even get them to bend to the shape of my eye and stick with the glue because they&#x27;re so stiff and plastic. Bad quality! You get a lot for a good price but I tried using and had to throw them all away.</li>
            <li> Awesome deal, use and order these frequently.. These are light, perfect for half lash styles</li>
            <li> I love these lashes! Great quality at a great price. I will definitely purchase them again.</li>
            <li> Goregous lashes! Amazing quality for the price! Very soft and glamorous! I naturally have long eye lashes and have never worn falsies before but i wanted to see what i looked like with them on and just wanted a more glamorous look! Havent tried them on yet but when i opened them up they looked beautiful! Cant wait to try em on!</li>
            <li> Horrible will never order again plastic waste of money 👎🏼 I didn&#x27;t want to give it any stars but the way amonzon has this set up u have to pick a star in order to writ a review that sucks.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOOOOOOOVVVVVVEEEEEEE</li>
            <li> They feel plastic. Don&#x27;t look good at all. They are not like normal fake eyelashes. They looked horrible and felt horrible.</li>
            <li> Theyre okay . Good price for a lot of lashes . They just take more time to adjust and fix for my eyelid . other than that theyre oaky .</li>
            <li> These lashes are a great valued for the money. I had a friends birthday and decided to bring the lashes and ended up putting them on 10 of my girlfriends. Light and durable. Can be used everyday. The thin lashes could be used everyday - as they look very natural.</li>
            <li> great, I love these. Purchasing them has allowed me to save tons of money. I would certainly order this item again from amazon.</li>
            <li> These came all mixed up and in bad shape. The eyelashes were moved around and stuck together. One single eyelash was also missing, so I returned it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty good for the price, but cheap quality.</li>
            <li> I loved the thiner looking one. They are more natural. But loved these anyways.</li>
            <li> Not realistic looking but then they were cheap.</li>
            <li> They just came and the only thing bad I have to say is that the boxes were piled and stuffed into the package, but the good thing is that didn&#x27;t effect the lashes so...Over all I give it a 4 star. Really good deal for the price. THANK YOU SO MUCH! c:</li>
            <li> i love these falsies....&lt;br /&gt;i recommend these to anyone....you might have to cut the ends off a bit but they are good.</li>
            <li> Hard to get off the packaging without them sticking and having to unfold. Have to cut them to size, but for this price, worth it.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, BETTER! These lashes are great. I was expecting your basic run of the mill eye lashes. Boy was I suprised. The boxes were smashed like they had been to war and back. When I opened them the lashes appeared to be bent and out of shape but they actually were not. They are not stuck to plastic like normal falsies that you get from Walmart, or other beauty departments. Instead they have tabs on each side that are down in the cardboard. You don&#x27;t have to fight with that sticky stuff to get it off plastic (and bend them out of shape trying to do it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They feel amazing, the lashes are firm but feel like they are made out of small slivers of satin not plastic. You do have to cut them to your eye size since they are a bit long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can not beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend buying these. If anything, they are great for beginners to learn with and there is enough to practice with.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes! They around a couple weeks earlier than I expected so that&#x27;s a plus! The only thing some people might have trouble with is the lash band is a little stiff &amp; hard to work with at first but when you get use to it the lashes are fabulous! They are a good quality &amp; great price. DEFINITELY REPURCHASING!!! :)</li>
            <li> i just got them and i love them they came earlier than expected but i dont mind im actually very happy :]</li>
            <li> Amazon needs to stop forcing us to write things in the comment box, or they will continue to get messages like this when no comments are necessary.  The product was fine, no problems, no issues.</li>
            <li> Shipping arived much earlier then i thought, I am a model so getting so much for so cheap when i use them almost daily is a huge plus</li>
            <li> These were not worth the money, they are cheap and obvious.  Very hard to put on...I tossed them after one attempted trial!</li>
            <li> They will do the job there extra long so you have to keep cutting them.overall there nice and for the price you can&#x27;t ask too much</li>
            <li> I líked it!  It is the same thing of the picture right there! It is so awesome! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> These are a great buy if you want to learn how to apply false lashes, they&#x27;re very inexpensive and you can practice many times without feeling wasteful. My only complaints are that these lashes are synthetic looking, which is ok if you are wearing them as part of a costume but not for daily use. Also, they&#x27;re not very curly which kind of defeats the purpose of fake lashes since they stick straight out and you can hardly tell they&#x27;re there.</li>
            <li> They never went on and if they did they lifted after 5 minutes. They felt like plastic on my eyes!</li>
            <li> OK these were a bargain price-definitely get what you pay for.  So stiff you can&#x27;t get them to adhere.  Not worth it at all :(</li>
            <li> was the producuto I wanted and arrive on time</li>
            <li> These lashes where great for practice.</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; service</li>
            <li> Love these, love the price. Only downside is they come mostly straight and it takes a min or two of bending to get them to curve. The lashes are also attached to a black string instead of something clear like you would see if you bought a pack of lashes at the store.</li>
            <li> Poor quality. But you get what you pay for. I suppose 20 pairs for the price is an okay deal but they really aren&#x27;t usable</li>
            <li> A great product. Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> very plastic looking and feeling and don&#x27;t stay on too well.</li>
            <li> Long and just how they looked for a great price also pretty strong you can reuse a few times.love them</li>
            <li> Eyelashes were for right eye only . I was very disappointed . Didn&#x27;t return item because it would be too expensive.</li>
            <li> Style 1 &amp;#60;----- I love love love them, so for the price it was worth at least seeing what style 2 looked like.  I don&#x27;t like it... there is a white like tape that is inside the strip which makes you probably have to wear ALOT of black eye makeup to cover it but I didn&#x27;t even try.  Stuck with Style 1 and love how you can trim to fit your eyes.  One downfall style 1, not everyday glam lashes... like a after 5pm eyelash...lol</li>
            <li> I placed my order on December 1st and got them in about 2 weeks. I fell in love instantaneously. The thick ones are definitely not for everyday wear but the thin ones seem so authentic. It really looks like your real lashes.  Really easy to apply simply cut the corners off, line it with some glue and you&#x27;re good to go. All my friends wanted some so I will definitely be ordering some more real soon.</li>
            <li> I chose a 1 star. I chose this because these were cheaply made. I recommend no one to buy these, they are not like the ones you buy at CVS or the drug store very fake and cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I really did not like these lashes! They feel like plastic and was not easy to apply on the lash line because of the thickness of the plastic texture lash band. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> these are ok, not as good as pharmacy ones but they are defiantly a good price for 20 of them they also do not come with glue</li>
            <li> these were a great price. My daughter wears these every day and they worked out well for her. would purchase again</li>
            <li> Lashes shipped quickly both sets are easy to apply and everything I expected and more they are easy to trim and great for beginners</li>
            <li> I loved them very flexible and easy to put on even when they were thick</li>
            <li> good product for a cheap price, but if you are looking for realistic, spend the extra money.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are great! I have no problem with the quality of these lashes and i use them on myself and others all the time. I like how long and full they are and it the eyelashes are ever \\&quot;too much\\&quot;, just cut them in halfs or thirds and applyto the outer edges of the eyelashes! I enjoy these.</li>
            <li> These look so fake! I love the Ardell eyelashes. You pay a little more but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Nice quality for the price took awhile to come but for the price no issue</li>
            <li> Delivered before on time.They&#x27;re very pretty.Very satisfied.Ordering more.</li>
            <li> These are trash. They dont have any curve to them they are stick straight making them hard to apply. Not happy with these.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this it is plastic pure plastic</li>
            <li> Very difficult to apply. You get what you pay for....</li>
            <li> Bad quality ,The cheapest Eyelashes I ever  bought . Ugly plastic lashes .</li>
            <li> All the best styles and sized in one big box.  Pretty good for choosing just the ones you need for any occasion.</li>
            <li> Love them and they will last me for a while</li>
            <li> Over all they were shipped on time and arrived in ok condition, the boxes were a little smashed but the lashes themselves were still in good condition. However a lot of them were flattened and it took a long time to un flatten them, hence the loss of one star.</li>
            <li> It has been almost a whole month and I have yet to receive them. I may update my rating when/if they get here but a month later is just too long!</li>
            <li> Fun to use as play makeup, or in a costume, or just for that every day look, lots of them tool</li>
            <li> They go on cute, I just wish they didn&#x27;t feel so plastic. They feel weird and like they would poke you in the eye when they&#x27;re in the box but you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price it has and how many you get.</li>
            <li> It was nice to receive so many for a low price plus it was fast delivery I did not expect but what a surprise I&#x27;m thankful</li>
            <li> Very plastic looking and feeling</li>
            <li> I LOVE fake lashes! These are OK - kind of stiff feel - doesn&#x27;t apply the best. But, a great value.</li>
            <li> Stiff - but do loosen up if bent and rolled a little in the fingers. Well worth the money since overall it saves me so much on lashes - most other lashes cost well over the price I paid for these but since I get (20) pairs for this price I&#x27;d be crazy to pass up this deal. For first timers using fake eyelashes it may be a little nerve racking but here is how I apply..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I hold a fake eyelash up to my eye and try and size it. I cut off the extra amount if they are larger than my eyes (which they are). Then I roll them in my fingers a bit to loosen the lashes up so they aren&#x27;t so stiff feeling / looking. Once I feel like they are flexible enough I apply eyelash glue to them (do not use real glue, and also the eyelash glue does not come in the set - so that will need to be purchased separate). I let the glue sit on the lash for about a minute before trying to apply them to my lashes..this gives the glue time to set. (use tweezers to apply if fingers seem to get in your way). Curling these with a lash curler and applying mascara makes them look more realistic. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy these again, very cheap!</li>
            <li> These are lovely, sturdy, I even find them reusable. Trim them to fit and they&#x27;re good to go! You can get by with cheaper lashes but buy a good adhesive because you&#x27;re worth it. :)</li>
            <li> Horrible .. The wire that&#x27;s attached to them makes it impossible for the lashes to stay glued on .. Terrible</li>
            <li> They arrived early! The packaging is a little silly! They work with standard Arrell lash glue, revlon glue, whatever is your favorite lash glue! Cut to perfection as they are professional that they need to be trimmed to perfection! If you know how to apply lashes  and don&#x27;t mind that tiny bit of work! You will love these! I wear them all the time! I don&#x27;t wear mascara or eyeliner so my lashes last days! It&#x27;s all of how you care for them, but the are typically single day use! I will only buy from here!</li>
            <li> It is fun and different feeling, especially with the darker shade ones; they feel really heavy on my eyes, it was my first time.</li>
            <li> I will re-order these.</li>
            <li> These are so bad, they&#x27;re fake plastic</li>
            <li> I bought these lashes to see cheaper alternatives to buying from store.&lt;br /&gt;  I love them. They arrived when they said they would. When I first opened they look beutiful but when I took one out the band was so stiff I though I would not like it at all. I am used to a much thinner band. I put them aside for a while and finally took them out to give them a chance. I can&#x27;t even tell how stiff the band feels to the finger. It makes no difference in the way they wear. They are hardly noticeable to feel while wearing and last all day with even a simple whit glue by revelon!&lt;br /&gt; Love these  I will be ordering more.&lt;br /&gt; But how can I go wrong a month or two worth of lashes for 2$!!</li>
            <li> Worse eyelashes I have ever received. The quality is so bad that i couldn&#x27;t even try to wear these. I know I shouldn&#x27;t be picky or have a hight expectatio on the quality being that I did pay such a cheap amount, but i have ordered other lashes this cheap and they were not as bad. Maybe they are good and are what someone else is looking for but unfortunately it... not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Got the eye lashes faster than estimated delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;Got one pack of 20 thick eye lashes, and one pack of 20 thinner eye lashes. 40 eye lashes all together.&lt;br /&gt;I like the thinner ones better, they look more natural.&lt;br /&gt;They seem to be fine. Just like any other eye lashes you&#x27;d buy at the store. I don&#x27;t really see anything wrong with them.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say its worth the buy. Doesn&#x27;t come with glue for them so you&#x27;ll have to buy your own if you don&#x27;t already have. Lucky for me I already had glue for them.</li>
            <li> i guess you get what you pay for they are pretty cheap and if you really want some eyelashes go for a more expencive and better kind still good</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are very nice. At first I was a little upset due to the fact that due to the packaging some were squished but overall they are great. You can cut them to your preference. I wear mine to special events and always receive compliments.</li>
            <li> I love them! At first you have to train them in order to fit your eyes exact shape. But very nice quality! I wear them everyday!</li>
            <li> I receive it all the transaction with perfect just didn&#x27;t like much the materials but for the price into practice is perfect</li>
            <li> So far they look great I have not worn them yet,but I will keep you posted on how well they do on Halloween,but they are better looking than pictured.</li>
            <li> nice variety, arrived quickly. I do cosplay and I photograph models often and these are nice because they show up on camera. recommend, a great deal for so cheap.</li>
            <li> I will forever buy these amazing eyelashes. Cheap,amazing, eyelashes &amp;#60;3. The only thingis that I had to color the lashes with sharpie in some spots bc they were white.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes really suck....but I mean what can you expect for $2 right ? I tried them on and they are really horrible quality.</li>
            <li> No glue included unfortunately. Was hoping there would be glue, there was no glue. the eyelashes were ok, plenty of them, still cheap</li>
            <li> Not a product I&#x27;d order twice. package was open when it finally arrived. Each has to be cut ,reguardless. I have ordered others prior and they were the same quality and I got 70 for the same price.</li>
            <li> they look fake for sure... but isn&#x27;t that what most people wanted to wear them for?&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying them. But I don&#x27;t think I would buy them again...</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are very long and very thick, but very pretty. If you are wanting natural these are not for you. I wanted something dramatic so these were perfect.</li>
            <li> Good product good-quality wish they were packaged differently have to make them shaped my eyes a little bit but I don&#x27;t mind trimming overall good product saved me money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought plenty of lashes and these aren&#x27;t that bad. For the price, they&#x27;re great! The customer service was the best aspect of this purchase. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Exactly as stated on here, very pleased!  This is way cheaper than what we&#x27;ve been paying for only one or two pairs!</li>
            <li> First of the lashes were delivered a week early so that was a plus. However I was under the impression that these were human hair lashes. Anywho. Besides the fact that they are plastic I like the way they look style 2 I would wear everyday style 1 I would use only for photo shoots (look real dragqueenish) I&#x27;ll wear these but I won&#x27;t order then again</li>
            <li> very cheap, low quality, but good for emergencies when you run out of the good ones and you only have these left to use lol. I have them for a while and only end up using one pair... will not buy again from this buyer, plus it took forever to arrive.</li>
            <li> i was so excited about these. they last for a while. you have to trim off the edges bc they are pretty long but others wise def great for the price:)</li>
            <li> The thick ones were cute</li>
            <li> Product came very early and I love the item and the card it came with is so cute.</li>
            <li> I really loved these. They&#x27;re at the thick side but if tou have really good lash glue you will love them.also you gotta shape them with your finger for you could install them way quicker:)</li>
            <li> I am loving having so many lash changes for such a low price!  This is a first time purchase for me but I can honestly say I will be making more in the near future.</li>
            <li> These lashes came in two small cheap boxes they were all smashed up the bands are huge and thick even the hair feels plastic. . .Even though the price is cheap do not buy these invest in some better ones I hate mine</li>
            <li> I would not wear these out in public. I could maybe use these for Halloween... maybe. I would still look ridiculous. Horrible quality and I should have known at this price...They are like plastic, freakishly long and way too much space in between each lash. If you have a life size doll that needs 20 sets of eyelashes, then these are for you! Otherwise, don&#x27;t waste your money. I was super disappointed.</li>
            <li> Ok not quit sure what I expected but when they came I was happy. They are cute for the money. I will get them again.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m looking to do a more naturally full eyelash look, these are great! I also appreciate the ability to customize the different sets of lashes and because there are so many, I don&#x27;t feel bad if I lose a pair. Great purchase :-D</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these lashes. It gives you two looks to choose from. You have your dramatic and natural lashes. I&#x27;m very happy with this item. I will purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> The lashes are very long, though I had previously read that in another review before I purchased, so you will have to trim the very ends off. I think they are only like that so they can be packaged the way that they are. They are a little stiff and plastic-y, but for the price, I am not upset at all. I have only worn the thinner lashes so far and will most likely save the thicker/fuller lashes for a night out as they are more dramatic.</li>
            <li> I love them. They go on great and last a long time. The only thing is it&#x27;s kinda hard to get them out of the package. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I have to give the thicker ones to my stylist for his upcoming hair show...they are too dramatic for every day use.  The thinner ones look great when I cut the m in half :)  too much for every day for me!</li>
            <li> I hate these lashes. they are so hard to put on. the lashes I purchase from the beauty supply store are more curved so they are easier to put on. I&#x27;m glad these were only a couple bucks. I wamt to give thes away. plus fo me they are jus not long enough like I want.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about the lashes they are nice. I&#x27;m happy with such a savings seeing that in my local beauty supply store, just one pair is 2.99 when I got 20 pairs for 2.09 to be exact. I will definitely be ordering again. The packaging was a lil beat up but it did have to go through a lot to get to me and even better just because the packaging was a lil bent my eyelashes went untouched. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the texture of the lashes as they have a velour feel to them.</li>
            <li> Not so pleased.  Some are alright but most of them would look like a furry worm stuck on your eye lid.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> These are very cheap so that&#x27;s great but you get what you pay for! so if you are looking for some nice lashes that will look more believable these are not them. These are huge, too long, too thick, plastic and they def look too fake. They are more for Halloween or drag queens.  You get a lot for the price but they are just not good quality, hard to put on and keep them on because they are heavy, thick and you will probably have to cut them down to size.</li>
            <li> i didnt like these they were to plastic feeling and dont work very well. so i wouldnt buy this item</li>
            <li> They are super cute. Great deal. I will be rebuying when they run out. I never use the thick lashes though... they are too much in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Just like the others I ordered are very poorly made lashes, I do not recommend anyone buying them! Its a good thing they were cheap so I don&#x27;t feel I missed out on a refund :(</li>
            <li> I bought these to use for photo shoots and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I cannot say how easy they are to put on as I have not used them myself but they look amazing in photos and I haven&#x27;t heard a model complain!  They come looking exactly like the picture.  I&#x27;m going to re-order these in the future!</li>
            <li> There is not a better value in false eyelashes so I fully recommend getting these but each pair is really only good for one wear whereas I normally get about three from more expensive ones. They all needed to be trimmed because each strip of eyelash is almost twice the length that I need and the base to put the glue on is a little more narrow than I&#x27;m used to. The good news is that after going through these you will be an eyelash expert if you&#x27;re not already and YouTube has some awesome videos about application techniques.</li>
            <li> When they come out of package , there straight lol  no curve , kinda hard to put on</li>
            <li> Can waits to put them on. Have to get some glue stripes.</li>
            <li> good price. does the job</li>
            <li> I needed it for crochet dolls I make. It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted for the price I paid.&lt;br /&gt;But I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if I needed it for myself to use.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes are por quality but I guess for what I paid $0.47 I couldn&#x27;t expect less! The package were smudge and the eyelashes were bent it.</li>
            <li> They are very basic as far as style goes, and cheap much along the line of thin shredded plastic. But not horrible, and they can pass as natural. Very good for basic things like cosplay and photography.</li>
            <li> Not bad for .45 cents, but not the style I would usually wear.  Nothing against the company (they delivered in the time frame they said they would maybe even sooner) but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the product. It&#x27;s more for costume wear not classy events.</li>
            <li> I love the lashes, the box came crushed but the lashes are in great condition.  the thick lashes are not curled already which means that i will have to heat my curler to curl them so they don&#x27;t disform on my face other than that they are ok to have in case of an eye lash emergency</li>
            <li> I should have guessed they would be horrible quality, but even that is really understated. Still haven&#x27;t had the heart to try them yet, they just don&#x27;t look that great.</li>
            <li> I selected this brand of eyelashes, because I love thick and long eyelashes.  I would recommend this product because of the excellent quality, length, and color of the eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I love it! Just what I wanted! You get exactly what you asked for, and I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Ordered lashes on 10/1/13, received it on 10/23/13; nearly 1 month. I don&#x27;t know if I failed to read shipping time or if seller failed to mention on ad. Fortunately for me is a xmas gift so I was in no rush.  It should however be mentioned in bold caps for those anticipating delivery sooner. As for the lashes, I&#x27;m pleased with the quality and quantity for the price. They look very pretty.  I will recommend it, but don&#x27;t expect speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> They where ok. I didnt use them much so yeah. If i was into false lashes i may have liked them.</li>
            <li> They definitely look super great , if you know how to apply them on , gives you a super fimenen look , specially for trans girls or anygirl , they loook really great inloveeeee , if you wanna go for a natural.look use the thin ones , if you wanna go for a smokey eye or to just get dolled up use thick ;)</li>
            <li> Anybody who&#x27;s a make up artist and cosmetology expert like me will know that these lashes are too cheap, not even human hair and can&#x27;t even wear more than 2 times. These lashes are for low budget folk. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> I still have these after 3 years- they&#x27;re soooo pretty (only the thick ones, the thin lashes are flimsy af and unwearable) but I still have a lot of trouble putting them on since I&#x27;m not good at it yet. Best part is that they&#x27;re totally reusable.</li>
            <li> Some sort of synthetic material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not human hair but great for night life or photo shoots.&lt;br /&gt;Saved me money for several months</li>
            <li> they didnt cost much at all and they came with 20 pairs! :D they shipped quick too which was great! they&#x27;re a little flimsy but that&#x27;s it. they&#x27;re very pretty and look natural!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Cosmo student super good lashes to practice with... I don&#x27;t know if is actually wear these on the daily thou!</li>
            <li> Very nice to have different looks . Dark lashes which feels a little heavy but I wear those at night going out.  The lighter ones are perfect for everyday wear as they don&#x27;t feel heavy .</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Enough said. I have always had trouble putting them on but nice quantity for the price.</li>
            <li> The large ones aren&#x27;t natural looking but, the small ones are very! They are NOT bad quality for the price, definitely a good buy!</li>
            <li> liked the product, I am being satisfied,liked the product, I am being satisfied, it was sent by me in a gift i hope so act set for the one to which a present was given as</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of fake eyelashes and these are some of the best and cheapest. They were really easy to put on with some lash glue I bought a while ago.</li>
            <li> Im an eyelash virgin, but these lashes are really great! Im in love with the dramatic lashes, they look so beautiful on. I found it very easy to apply when I cut them in half. They took about 2 weeks to arrive i believe.</li>
            <li> These a not individual pieces of hair or hairlike pieces. Almost like plastic.  They are not realistic at all to me.  I would not buy these again.</li>
            <li> Poor quality super fake look plastic and like size and half normal eyelashes length .. Weird looks like they&#x27;re the kind vintage dolls have glued on!!!</li>
            <li> Product came earlier than expected but very cheap material. Very uncomfortable to wear and was falling apart when I took them out of the box. I just threw them out. I guess I got what I paid for!</li>
            <li> The heavy ones, don&#x27;t bend well and pops off more frenquently.  I&#x27;m not used to trimming both edges and them being so no flexible.</li>
            <li> theycame and shockingly they look like plastic. I havent put them on yet because im afraid they will look ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by these lashes. They are almost rubbery. Not made of hair. I would not recommend these to anyone. They look completely ridiculous on.</li>
            <li> It cames much more earlier that I expected and becouse of this I gave 4 stars, not 3... they are so plastic.. and also during the shipping a few of them are smashed and they can not be used, but for this price more than I was expected.</li>
            <li> Best eyelashes EVER!! Like nobody ever comments on my eyelashes before i wore these. Everyone like where u get them there so nice and blah blah. YES get these one pair of eyelashes at my local beauty store cost me 4 dollars like no i don&#x27;t even by those anymore i buy these. They don&#x27;t look to dramatic they look good.!!!</li>
            <li> there a little on the plastic side but i  cant beat that  deal especially for that price.. they do the job...</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, wear them all the time, great for decorating with glitter or rhinestones, the only downside it the lashes are a little stiff and stick together and the base is a little thick.</li>
            <li> amazing product and service. eye lashes look exactly as shown in the picture and look amazing once put on. everyone compliments me when i use them, and price is amazing :)</li>
            <li> These lashes are O.K. I really like the Style 2 but Style 1 is NOT for me. What I dislike about this product is that it is made out of plastic. So if you don&#x27;t put the inner corner of the lashes on right, it&#x27;s going to bother you a lot. Also, I ended getting pink eye from using these lashes, but I just put eye drops and it went away. I&#x27;ll say give them a try, takes a while to get here and I&#x27;m not so sure if it is worth the wait considering the material and problems I had with these lashes.</li>
            <li> I gave these 4 stars because you can&#x27;t beat the price.  I wear eyelashes quite often and the quality of these is definitely not great, but for a daytime use they will work.  The band is very stiff and I bend it around my finger several times to loosen it up.  I also double them up for a thicker look.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t try them yet but they look ok, i gotta say though i will never use the thick ones cause they are just too dramatic for me, the normal ones are ok but kinda too long but i guess they will do</li>
            <li> Upon arrival, all of the eyelashes were bent out of shape.  They are poorly made and are impossible to glue on.</li>
            <li> Ive worn these a few times and I love them. They did take a bit long for delivery! about 3-4 weeks. super fun though i may buy them again if i ever get low!</li>
            <li> They are beautiful on, but the &amp;#34;lash line&amp;#34; is very thick when put on, making them seem more fake, than you want them to be.</li>
            <li> they look good and they seem real enough, just a bit shiny, but thats easily fixable :) i like them</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in these eyelashes the we&#x27;re way to big and looked and felt very fake. Hard to put on I finally gave up and gave them to my niece she is a pro at falsies.</li>
            <li> Shipping took about 3 weeks . I really like the natural lashes but the thick ones look very fake and their shiny but that&#x27;s something that can be fixed .Over all there worth the price and wait . Very good for beginners like myself .</li>
            <li> Got these lashes early which was nice.. they look real cheap but what can you do.. look at the price I paid for them.. they are still nice..but you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> I cant say enough about my lashes.  I love them, theres really natural looking ones and then there&#x27;s the more jazzy ones and I love them. Im gonna purchase a few more boxes..no more beauty supply lashes for me with their high prices. Im truly satisfied! !!</li>
            <li> Not a fan of strip lashes but these work great! I even ordered some for a friend because she lived the way they looked.</li>
            <li> These eye lashes look cheap because maybe they are. Most of them are not even and the lashes are bunched up. They are way too long. I guess if you don&#x27;t mind cutting them and making them look better they are worth your money. I threw them in the trash.</li>
            <li> So great! It&#x27;s cheap yet so amazing! It does take almost a month and it&#x27;s a little longer but you know what? It&#x27;s WORTH IT. Guaranteed.</li>
            <li> Good texture, and lot of different sizes,</li>
            <li> didnt expect them to be plastic</li>
            <li> Awesome I use them and there amazing !!! Good quality for price !!!!</li>
            <li> they are thick  and hard to apply</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty great price for lashes. They look amazing but do not come with eyelash glue. It also took a while to receive in the mail. When the package came it was a bit busted up. And a few lashes were bent.  A little too dramatic for everyday wear. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t see myself wearing these every day. Just for special occasions or if I feel like dressing up. But they are worth keeping around to have.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like that you have to cut those extension things off</li>
            <li> this is worth every penny. these eyelashes are just as good as the expensive ones. I&#x27;m gonna keep purchasing them.</li>
            <li> They are super durable and go on like a dream. I love them!! The price was to die for and the product is even better.</li>
            <li> Eh what did I expect for cheap lashes? They are not wearable unless you want to look fake, like a doll, and ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased! they were too thin to work with&amp; falling apart when I was cleaning the glue off! u get what u pay for.  CHEAP STUFF</li>
            <li> Very stiff and poor quality</li>
            <li> I really like both sets of eye lashes but they are not reusable, I tried to wash them off but it damaged them</li>
            <li> I like both types of lashes these are good practice lashes for so one who is learning how to do lashes.</li>
            <li> The thinner lashes were nice but the thicker ones were way too long. The base part of the strip is really thin, almost paper like. A little hard for the application</li>
            <li> Took a while to get here. Once they got here I like how they look. I am excited to try them on. My mom likes them too she tried them already and likes them however said they were hard to put on.</li>
            <li> I love them they were what I was expecting but when I received and open up the box the box was messed up</li>
            <li> Wow what can I say? Arrived a lot earlier than expected &amp; in love with these lashes. Definitely going to come back and purchase more!!</li>
            <li> luv these they are so cute the big ones are kinda cute but egh the others are really good. i dnt reuse them bc they dnt cost much but will get more</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews and I think that some of the reviews were not reflective of the true quality of the product. First of all these are lashes that are not the top of the line, BUT they are very very nice! I purchased both the regular and thick eyelashes and both were perfect. Depending on the occasion and preference they are quality lashes and make a nice beauty addition. I have gotten many compliments on my lashes which I do myself. I customize them to my eyes and taste. I simply measure the lashes and cut them to match the contour of my eyes which is what I did with the &amp;#34;store bought&amp;#34; lashes. For everyday use I wear the regular lashes. When I am singing on stage I wear the thick lashes. Although I sometimes wear the thicker ones when not performing. It really depends on my mood. I have worn lashes with a higher quality and I have worn expensive individual lashes that have taken my own lashes out. With these I can wear them without damaging my lashes and spending the time and money going to the beauty salon for them to do something that I can do myself for way less money. When I want to splurge then I will get the high end lashes and &amp;#34;professional application&amp;#34;. I highly recommend these lashes for the price. They did take two weeks to arrive, but when they arrived they were in good condition. I will order them again soon!!!!</li>
            <li> The entire lash pack lasted me over a year. I absolutely love how these look! Whether it&#x27;s a bold look or not. I am always pleased to order these lashes!! The only bad thing is their a little to wide for my eyes so I always cut a little from both sides of the lash strip to make them the right size! But, overall 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> I donated to my old high school.</li>
            <li> These are awful. They feel really stiff and cheap and wouldn&#x27;t stick on my lids with any kind of glue that I tried to use. They don&#x27;t look as nice in person either. There&#x27;s a reason they&#x27;re so cheap obviously, I was totally disappointed. DON&#x27;T BUY THESE.</li>
            <li> Great pack! You get a whole bunch of thick and thin lashes! They are gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Love these! Not bad for cheap lashes</li>
            <li> You get what u pay for</li>
            <li> I loveeee these lashes , the thinner ones are great have gotten so many compliments on them looking natural. However, have worn the thicker ones they look like fake barbie doll ones so probally wont use them. Other than that i would buy more.</li>
            <li> This is a guaranteed way to look ridiculous. These lashes do not look natural. They look like they came off a baby doll. The feel horrible and do not stay in place. Worst lashes ever.</li>
            <li> I love the natural lashed. Not the fuller ones the fuller ones r like a strip of thick lashed. I will buy the natural oned again tho.</li>
            <li> i bought these thinking they were actually going to look natural. but they arent. these eyelashed arent even made out of real hair, and the lash band is actually very thick so its very hard to conseal without putting on a huge cat eye. also these lashes are exact opposite style 2 is very thick too thick were you cant even look up you would have to look up by moving your head up and style 1 is very sparse there is a substantial amount of space in between the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great for the price, bad for the look</li>
            <li> Not as natural as I would prefer.</li>
            <li> OMG great lashes nice , i really was surprised when i opened the box they came in a bubble elevlope  not a one&lt;br /&gt;was out of place soft ,black, wispy light.</li>
            <li> I bought these at first I was not happy about the purchase at first glance they look stringy and cheap looking but hey that&#x27;s why they were like 2  bucks right. I usually wear red cherry or ardell which are more expensive but anyhow after cutting them and shaping them the other pair the natural looking ones look pretty nice the other pair are way more dramatic will wear them maybe when I go out. Overall it&#x27;s an ok purchased</li>
            <li> The thick eyelashes are extremely thick. I am not sure I like the thick ones. The thinner pair wil work great</li>
            <li> very real and the variety of lashes is great.  I would recommend product to fashion divas for beautiful eyes that last.</li>
            <li> They looked natural :) every time I wear them I get complemented. And the thick ones I wear when I go out which everyone likes too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they will work great and the price is good, but the package was munched. The cheap box they come in wouldn&#x27;t be bad but it&#x27;s munched as well.</li>
            <li> the bigger lashes are a bit bulky but cute and the lighter lashes are fine just as long as you cut them to size but they are great for the price and the amount that you receive.</li>
            <li> You have to keep in mind you&#x27;re only spending $2 for these. The natural lashes are perfect. The thicker ones are practically unusable because they&#x27;re so stiff. I had to get them reshipped because they never came the first time I ordered, but the company was kind and courteous to resend! :)</li>
            <li> The eyelashes FOR SURE need to be cut before wearing. If not, they are just too much. I can&#x27;t see myself wearing the thicker band. It&#x27;s waaaaaay to &amp;#34;theatrical&amp;#34; if you&#x27;re looking for a natural apperance.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes. They were a great price and for the right amount. I would buy more again and again</li>
            <li> well, the lashes are at best .25 cent machine quality. when i put them on, they &amp;#34;fought&amp;#34; me to stay, but of course i man handeled them and got them glued down. once on, they looked nice. thats why I gave them three stars. cause you get what you pay for. which was like 3 dollars for 20 so whos complaining.....</li>
            <li> Kinda like plastic I will never order these kind again unfortunately but at that price it should&#x27;ve been expected order at ur own risk</li>
            <li> Terrible. Took forever to get here &amp; ive never had so many problems trying to put on eye lashes before. They are cheap material that doesnt bend with eye shape. I recommend staying away from these lashes.</li>
            <li> my Niece was absolutely thrilled with the quality of the lashes I was thrilled with the price - I would purchase again</li>
            <li> Dear sirs. I secured the order, remained is happy with purchase. I wish you the udachnkh of sales of warm responses from buyers and happiness in new year. Yours faithfully, your client Sergey.</li>
            <li> I use the style #2 only. I give the other ones to a Friend. They are very light and I can use them several times. It saves me a lot of money on fake lashes. I usually buy these a pair at a time at Walgreens, but they cost around $4.99 for one pair. Here I get 20 pairs total. The price is perfect. I will order these forever. So glad I found them so cheap. I am a very happy Customer!!!</li>
            <li> Was really excited to see that twenty pairs of eyelashes would cost me less than five dollars. However, you get what you pay for. They are quiet cheap and the lashes aren&#x27;t as nice as I thought. They don&#x27;t have the natural bend that all false lashes have, once you pull it out they are straight. Lastly, the spaces and thickness of the darker lashes is very cheap looking on your eyes. I would rather pay up to ten dollars on a really amazing set of lashes then look like I&#x27;m trying to hard with this set.</li>
            <li> They were very stiff and wouldn&#x27;t bend with my eye shape very easily. They also bothered my eyes quite a bit. With some work, trimming and moving they do look nice.</li>
            <li> Only received 10, the lashes were too straight I had to blow dry them on low heat to curve them and the box was in terrable shape. They are great for costumes and maybe some nice pictures. Not much of a bad product I just wasn&#x27;t too happy with them, specially since I didn&#x27;t get the thinner ones.</li>
            <li> Too long for me. I&#x27;m bummed :(.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks anyway.</li>
            <li> Wish the natural lashes were a bit longer but overall I like them.</li>
            <li> You get what you paid for. Plastic and supers stiff.</li>
            <li> These lashes are fantastic! Very inexpensive &amp; easy to apply. I&#x27;ve only tried the natural ones, which are great for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Cheap. They&#x27;re not very flexible which means that you may need constant checking to ensure they&#x27;re still on every hour. They&#x27;re also uncomfortable. And if you&#x27;re not a regular user, then they will bother the heck out of you!</li>
            <li> This was a great great price for the product. Love the lashes got great great compliments thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality for the price, love them would purchase  again!!</li>
            <li> not the best quality.  the glue i got which has nothing to do with this product would not hold the lashes on. going to find a new glue to try out. so far i haven&#x27;t been able to wear these lashes.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for, not that great. It took wayyyyyyyyyy to long to receive them. i wouldn&#x27;t buy them again personally. the only reason i&#x27;m giving 2 stars is because you get 20 for super cheap.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for life like! they are more on the plastic side! however they come in great boxes, on time! product is presented well. the only reason I gave it a two was because I didn&#x27;t expect them to be less realistic. They went on great, they were easy to put on! If you&#x27;re learning or don&#x27;t care about it not being extremely realistic, get them for sure! But they are not the best quality! wore them out people liked them! So a decent product!</li>
            <li> I like to wear eyelashes that are almost like real hair. These where ok and great to reuse but I preference is real hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like them at all I wont purchase this item again they feel way to fake and to hard to put on</li>
            <li> have not used them yet but you can&#x27;t go wrong with eyelashes :)</li>
            <li> For this small price, I get to have many looks to choose from when getting dolled up.  Very easy to apply and adds lots of glamour to your eyes.</li>
            <li> I love my eyelashes! They came in day after estimated date of arrival. I wear the thinner lashes for work and daily wear and thicker eyelashes when I go out! Absolutely good buy and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> They are the perfect size and have a little bit left at the edges so you can adjust it to perfectly fit your eyes.</li>
            <li> They were ok but looked too fake. Made of some plastic looking material. Only used them a couple times unfortunately</li>
            <li> I thought these would take an incredibly long time to get to my house but it took less than a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating this 5 stars based on the quality for the price.  Under $3 WITH shipping for ALL these lashes shipped from Hong Kong?  Wow!  They are made from plastic,  but when you have them on,  nobody could really tell.  With enough glue and black eyeliner,  they look great!</li>
            <li> I loved the eyelashes the thick eyelashes looked fake&#x27;ish so I added the long eyelashes and glued them together the looked perfect after that they feel nice one but a few of them got stuck in the packaging</li>
            <li> Arrived early . 22nd instead on the 2nd ! Acceptable quality for the price ! I just didn&#x27;t like how the tracking # didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I usually wear fake lashes but always the ones with real&lt;br /&gt;Hair. I bought these to try them out and they are okay but&lt;br /&gt;just not for me. But you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Oh i love, i love. I mean why pay higher price, theyre gonna end up in the trash. I can choose simple or flirty:)</li>
            <li> These are absolutely great. You get quite a lot. Quality was great.</li>
            <li> If I could rate zero stars I would. They are very cheap!..but you get what you pay for. They are made of hard plastic that can&#x27;t be curled so they stick straight out. Also, they are really long. I can&#x27;t imagine these fitting anyone&#x27;s eyes (and yes I tried to trim them but they just looked silly). After playing around with them, I gave what was left away.</li>
            <li> The natural looking ones are my favorite! They stay on pretty well. The think ones aren&#x27;t that great. They take a lot of the lash glue to keep it from coming off. Plus they don&#x27;t really stay on correctly.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes. I haven&#x27;t tried the thick lashes and I&#x27;m not sure I will but the thin lashes are great.  When I first got them I was kind of let down.  They looked like they were going to be terrible and not last at all.  I am use to the lashline being more of a plastic kind of material and these are more like a string.  I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like how flexible and shapeless they were but that has been great!  When I cut them down to fit right they set wonderfully on my eyes.  They move a lot better with my natural shape rather than what a big name company thinks eye shape should be.  Not only do they feel like I have nothing on but they look very natural.  My husband and my son both have those long beautiful lashes that us women are always so jealous of and now with these lashes I can keep up in our family battle of the lashes lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these eyelashes for a couple months now and although i don&#x27;t use them often, they&#x27;re still wonderful to wear when I do. The thicker ones obviously feel heavy on your eyelids, but they compliment well. And the thinner ones help define your eyelashes but don&#x27;t make them seem fake. My store bought eyelash glue works great with them. The only thing you have to do is cut them to size.</li>
            <li> Took Forever to get here. and what a poor quality. They are the worst lashes I&#x27;ve ever come across. don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I like the lashes.  I gave the product a three because the lash band was a little thick.  I received twenty pairs.  They are good foor a beginner like me who is just learning how to apply lashes.  At the price, you are not made about the price.  I also gave it a three because it took a long time to arrive and it vexed me a great deal that my cell phone number was on the outside of the package underneath my address.  not cool.  TOOO much info for all to see.</li>
            <li> Some of the eyelashes don&#x27;t come out without tearing, but the ones that do are great and work as they should.</li>
            <li> These are very ugly eyelashes!! I bought these as a gift for my sister in law... they are too ugly to give.  There are to kinds sent... tarantula and barely anything.</li>
            <li> Love them will be ordering again all my friends want some ...  shhhhh im not telling them about this  gold mine</li>
            <li> These are the worst eye lashes I&#x27;ve ever order.  They are stiff and will not conform to your eye lip.  Cost to much to send them back so threw them in the trash.  These came from China and should be taken off the market.</li>
            <li> They feel pretty fake. I used them for halloween and gave the rest away. You get what u pay for.</li>
            <li> Of course they&#x27;re wicked cheap so I wouldn&#x27;t expect anything super fancy... Wish they came a little more curled, but curled them with an eyelash curler and it worked decent. They were very stiff though so kind of a pain to get on. Overall, pretty worth it for the low cost and for needing them for photoshoots for clients!</li>
            <li> it was missing some lashes out of one of the boxes and bixes was damagedso I was not pleased but jot worth sending back.</li>
            <li> The laahes are ok...I will not use them for personal use.but for a dramatic photoshoot they will work. The lashes are too thick and stiff.</li>
            <li> They are plastic &amp; not hair. Maybe it stated that &amp; I should&#x27;ve read more about them. No harm done, not too much $$ spent</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I read the bad reviews after I had already purchased these &amp;#34;eye lashes&amp;#34; and they were two weeks into delivery. I thought to myself,&amp;#34;I&#x27;m sure they aren&#x27;t that bad&amp;#34;, but oh was I wrong. Everything complained about in the reviews I read, were true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They went directly into the garbage. Even for how cheap these were, I&#x27;d rather spend the extra money next time and not waste my time.</li>
            <li> I dont wana give astar at all I guess I shoulda read more in debt in these. These are the cheapest crappiest pos eyelashes I have ever evperienced! The linong is plastic they dont bend to form to your eye theyre straight. Not good at all waste of money though cheap dont recommend get more expensive ones</li>
            <li> they are really  awesome! I  just wish I can figure out how to put them on now without messing then up</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t look that natural, but they were cheap and somewhat did the job.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes, looks very beautiful That I had to buy another set very good price,  you can&#x27;t beat it, amazing!</li>
            <li> A little stiff to work with but they work ok. I&#x27;ve only tired them a few times and just bought them as practice lashes to play around with before risking damaging an expensive set.</li>
            <li> Horrible...... Eye lashes were not the same as one another ... Also really ugly..... Ugh idk I threw all of them away because they were just so hard to work with as well</li>
            <li> I was worried that I would not get my lashes. I was skeptical because of the cost but not only did I not receive them. They came packaged nicely. All 20 in tack! Haven&#x27;t tried them on yet. Although it takes about 3 weeks to receive, its worth it for the price. I don&#x27;t think they are human eyelashes. I&#x27;ve never worn synthetic lashes before. I will come back with a follow up review at that time I will rate the quality of the lashes.  Right now I will give it 4 stars for the packaging. All the way from China. Impressed that they where all together and not one damaged.</li>
            <li> incredible lashes, great quality lashes, great for more then 1 wear and they sand up in water well and keep there shape</li>
            <li> The boxes arrived a little smooshed, but considering that I spent less than $2.00 on them, not including the shipping, I wasn&#x27;t all that surprised or concerned. These lashes are perfect for those special occasions when my lashes need a little more oomph. As with all lashes, I had to trim them to fit my eyes. The naturals give my own lashes just a little boost, and the thick ones give my eyes a va-va-voom needed for nights out on the town and costuming. They are easy to clean and are suitable for 2-3 uses per pair.  The band is also of a paper like quality material that makes it easier to flex around the eye, apply glue, and give the eye a bit of breathe-ability while wearing them. Because they are cheap I don&#x27;t worry about if I don&#x27;t get as many uses out of 1 pair as I do with others, I can always get more and I will be getting more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> They shipped and came more quickly than I thought. I would just stick with the dark lashes. The light ones I think, but are too light for me. But like them very much</li>
            <li> It was cheap and I got what I paid for. Definitely not high quality and the shipping took forever. Not very natural looking at all.</li>
            <li> They were to plastic and too stiff for me. They don&#x27;t look natural at all. They have extra string too! Don&#x27;t like!</li>
            <li> I had received this product extremely fast. I was thrilled. When I opened the boxes to the lashes I noticed they were a bit long, but no big deal I just had to cut them a little. I noticed they were a little stiff even with me bending them and wrapping them around a pencil but its ok. The main thing is that they look great I am extremely happy with how they look.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping but the lashes are not design correctly to fit almond eyes. There is no tapering of the length toward one end. The really thick lashes that comes in this pack is way too dramatic. I even tried trimming them down but it didn&#x27;t look right. For the price, it makes great stocking stuffers, but the quality is not so great.</li>
            <li> I order this produce for my daughter.Pacage come on time.It is amazing.She is happy and seys never have bether product.Thank You.</li>
            <li> I bought a set for my daughter and a set for myself. We both love them and would definitely would buy them again.</li>
            <li> These look amazing. I had to buy glue at Walmart. I would recomind these to everyone. They fit perfect and amazing for family get together a and a night out</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for natural looking lashes then these are not what you want.  They are so shiny I hate them</li>
            <li> Very nice lashes well worth the wait!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Eh you get what you pay for. Flimsy and don&#x27;t compliment my eye but i figured I&#x27;d give it i try. Works well with stacking</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t that impressed. they didn&#x27;t stay on hardly any time, they kept falling off. that may have been the glue but it may have been the lashes. the packaging wasn&#x27;t very good but i mean, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> dont like it they are to fake !</li>
            <li> These are the worst eyelashes I have ever used. Complete waste of time and money. Please Do not buy these.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that I was able to cut them to my ideal eye shape. I would definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say but they are horrible...too stiff to place on eyeliner...and whatever brand of glue I tried, they wouldn&#x27;t adhere..plus when I received them,the packaging was bent and a little crushed at the ends. They obviously don&#x27;t care when shipping..try another distributed!</li>
            <li> First of all, I ordered these lashes September 25 because I wanted them for Halloween. They arrived TODAY, November 5. I&#x27;ve ordered stuff from China before and I received the items after 5 days, so I don&#x27;t really see any reason for these Lashes to take 49 days to ship. That was really annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the lashes are okay. I like the fact that they don&#x27;t look very plastic and they are easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would order these again because of the great price, but now I know better than to expect them to arrive within one month.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like these! Wouldn&#x27;t fit and wouldn&#x27;t stay on! Ruined 2 pair before I even got any on because they were glued into the packaging!</li>
            <li> if you dont clip the edges right they may poke into youe eye skin but its all good there a little but to like stiff but they look great i deff recommend</li>
            <li> They were perfect  to work with at a excellent price . I highly reccomend this product to be purchased by consumers</li>
            <li> Very nice got them way before time.I can&#x27;t wait to try them out. I love that they are two different one two pick from.</li>
            <li> 20 pairs regular long and thick eyelashes it is nice , and i like it ,,,....,,,beutiful , ,,,,,,......,,, and it&#x27; thick</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. I like them. I usually wear more than one pair of eyelashes so these are great. The have a little extra wiring (I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s called) to keep them in place that you have to cut off. They do look fake, but then again nobody has gigantic eyelashes. Package was a little squished but that&#x27;s to be expected since it&#x27;s thin cardboard. Might buy more. I like them for the price. Would definitely reccomend</li>
            <li> These r great after reading some of the bad reviews i didnt know what to expect but they arrived weeks before expected and they r awesome u do have to trim them a lil to fit but no big deal. I get compliments on the all the time at work fyi i work with the public. i will definently order more and its a great price all in all im very pleased...</li>
            <li> They look exactly like they do in the picture.  Just as discribed but they are so thick and straight. Almost impossible to look natural. Haven&#x27;t used any of them they look terrible! Hate them! I&#x27;ll stick with Ardell</li>
            <li> Not bad, first time buying these things. I cant compare it to any thing else. They are working pretty well.</li>
            <li> They got to me fast and they were packaged nicely!  I love them and will for sure be ordering them again! They look beautiful and natural!  I think anyone would be happy with this product!  Good Buy!!!!</li>
            <li> The band is not invisible but is flexible since it is a thread. I thought it at first sight that they would be hard to put on or uncomfortable. All the contrary. I have not used the dramatic ones yet but the natural ones I wore all day and they did not bother me.</li>
            <li> Love these easy to use and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> The price was great!!! Eyelashes are nice!!! I pay 8$ for one set. 2$ for twenty pairs was an awesome deal. They go on and stick on great! Just bought my glue separetely.</li>
            <li> lashes were synthetic and very unnatural looking. Such a waste of money, don&#x27;t buy this unless you plan on using it once and throwing it out. completely disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> Great and amazing eyelashes 😍</li>
            <li> love the fact that there are so many of them and there are large ones and small ones to choose from</li>
            <li> i love them! just trim a little off the sides and perfect fit! only issue since paper mail some of the lashes where bent but thats all</li>
            <li> I got these to practice wearing fake eyelashes and was a great idea.  The product shipped and arrived quickly.  They needed to be cut down a bit, but not a problem at all, theres a ton of them there and have helped me practice wearing them.  Good value!</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my grand-daughter, who is 16 years old and had hinted that she wanted them,  and she really loves them.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, I love them.</li>
            <li> Save your 50 cents and put it towards some eyelashes you will actually use! I understand the price is really cheap but you get exactly what you pay for and the eyelashes are very poorly made and when you put them on they look very FAKE!!</li>
            <li> SO THICK AND NOT CONFORTABLE AT ALL :(</li>
            <li> Awesome lashes! Great price. Got mine for under $2!!!</li>
            <li> I am ADORING these lashes!!! Holy cow, I cannot even begin. The more natural looking ones on the right are the only ones i&#x27;ve tried so far (Which is today) and my lashes look uh-may-zinggg! They look so soft and fluffy. Most definitely going to stock up on these!!</li>
            <li> Took a while to come but I love em! And for the price couldn&#x27;t complain about the time it took</li>
            <li> Not good quality!!! They look so cheap!!!! I would NOT recommend them!!!</li>
            <li> I received them in good condition not smashed. I have never put on lashes in my life so these were good to practice with. The only thing is that the band is pretty thick. Other then that I loved them.</li>
            <li> I really these eyelashes it even though I was a bit scared to purchase them because i didn&#x27;t know what to expect. The only downfall is that you do take a bit of time to receive them.</li>
            <li> i really like them&lt;br /&gt;just wish we could figure out how to put them on properly&lt;br /&gt;she does like them!!</li>
            <li> I love them but sometimes hard to put on there stiff bt for a dollar they are cool it was worth the buy</li>
            <li> Love it even though I haven&#x27;t tried using it yet.  I need my friend to show me how to put it on.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> they are so cheap looking they&#x27;re not even real hair they are horrible I was embarrassed to even show them to anybody</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great product. Definitely going to reorder some more. The lashes are comfortable and light weight and don&#x27;t bother my eyes.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the quality and sturdiness of the lashes. I would most definately will buy again once i run out.</li>
            <li> Not what I&#x27;d expected</li>
            <li> Sturdy and eloquently positioned.  Soft to touch and easy to apply.  Color is appealing. Very satisfied and would recommend product.</li>
            <li> i got the same thing for both... -.- not even worth the time to return it; I wanted the natural ones too, but never happened</li>
            <li> alot for a cheap price , its was great ^^</li>
            <li> I got these for both cosplay and everyday use. The regular lashes are perfect and easy to blend in with your natural ones to make them look real. The thick ones are ones I used for a few cosplays I did and they worked wonderfully. The lashes themselves feel very plastic, which wasn&#x27;t an issue to me, but it might be someone else. The box is great for easy storage and traveling. Definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> Not great quality , they look plastic from far away . Again for a cheap price one ca not expect a great quality</li>
            <li> Too long u need to cut sides..  n then they look wei rd</li>
            <li> Good for starters, I think that of course they are not gonna be the best but they work and don&#x27;t look bad specially great for ppl that is starting</li>
            <li> It was a little hard for me to get them on at first but once you get used to them they look really good.  They are a little stiff so carry your glue with you for touch-ups.</li>
            <li> These are a very good product , I suggest others to order !!!!</li>
            <li> Poorly made, honestly it was a waste of my money, they are still just sitting in a drawer in my bathroom and are useless</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with them, they are so comfortable its like I&#x27;m not even wearing them... I had a little problem with the sipping at first but the company fixed it right up</li>
            <li> The lashes were cut way too long, had no adhesive on them, and didn&#x27;t stick when adhesive was added!  I will NEVER purchase these again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very enthused to have received these eyelashes today. I&#x27;ve pulled on them, cut them and i&#x27;ve tested them to the maximum! I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality. They came exactly as shown in the photo. The only complaint I had was that they could have been packaged a bit better, the boxes were crushed! It however didn&#x27;t affect the lashes and I&#x27;m overall pleased. I will be ordering many many more, very soon!</li>
            <li> I love my new lashes!I can go heavy for an evening look or light for day and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Too cheap and unnatural looking.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes were difficult to deal with. They look very artificial I didn&#x27;t want to wear them outside the house let alone on my job so I tossed them out. Get what you pay for I guess lol</li>
            <li> Yes it most certainly did meet my expectation I love them will be ordering more real soon my friends love them</li>
            <li> They are ok. But I can reuse them over n over. I would purchase more in the future. Thank u</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Sooo fake looking. Looks almost like plastic. Put a few extra bucks in and invest in some real lashes</li>
            <li> I prefer the thinner ones but for the price they serve a quick purpose... they are plastic i must warn u!!! u get what u pay for but they still arent back... i order 4 boxes at a time...</li>
            <li> They were beautiful and the quality was great...i just cut it so it would fit my eyes..:) I was pleased</li>
            <li> Great price for lashes.  I wear and throw away so I go through lashes fast. They are super flexible.  I cut them down on the sides. Not a fan of the packaging. If I just want to take one set with me on vacation I had to cut into the cardboard.  Over they are ok.</li>
            <li> Its took time to get here since it shipped over seas but i was beyond happy with my purchase good amount of lashes for the good amount of money . I fell in love definitely will keep buying from here</li>
            <li> GOT MY ITEM A LOT SOONER THAN I THOUGHT AND SOONER THAN THEY PROMISED! LOVED IT! VERY SATISFIED AND HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE. IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL! IF YOU KNOW HOW TO PUT LASHES ON THEN IT WILL LOOK AMAZING! I PERSONALLY LIKE TO ADJUST THEM TO THE SIZE OF MY EYE BECAUSE THE LASHES ARE BIG BUT IT WORKS OUT WONDERFULLY BECAUSE I CAN ADJUST THEM TO A PERFECT FIT! I WILL BE GETTING MORE! CAN’T BEAT THAT PRICE!</li>
            <li> Love them I actually like the thick ones better than the thin ones but gave them to a co worker and she loves them ... Not bad for the price !!!!!</li>
            <li> Cheap quality.  They feel  heavy but hey they are only a dollar! So you get what you pay for they have a plastic feel .</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT! !!!!!! Came faster than expected, and the lashes are beautiful!</li>
            <li> Lots of long lashes.  So fun and pretty to wear.  Great value and great price.  I would buy them again versus the $5 a pair drugstore ones.</li>
            <li> They took forever to come and they fell off once I put them on</li>
            <li> FIRST OF ALL THESE EYELASHES COST MORE TO GET HERE THAN I PAID ....DONT EXPECT THEM TO BE LIKE MINK  OR  HUMAN HAIR LASHES. IF YOU ARE EXTREMLY PICKY....GO TO THE STORE AND PURCHASE!&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU NEED YOUR LASHES LIKE YESTERDAY....GO TO THE STORE AND PURCHASE....THEY WILL NOT BE IN THE MAILBOX THE NEXT DAY OR  NEXT WEEK....FOR THAT MATTER.  THESE LASHES ARE NOT LIKE KISS, ARDELL, OR DURALASH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WEAR EYELEASHES EVERYDAY....I WEAR THIN NATURAL LOOKING LASHES THROUGH THE WEEK...AND I WEAR LONG THICK LASHES ON THE WEEKEND...IF I CAN REUSE THEM I DO SO! !!!! BUT , USUALLY IF I FALL ASLEEP IN THEM DUE TO ME BEING EXHAUSTED ....I HAVE TO THROW THEM AWAY BECAUSE MOST LIKELY THEY ARE BENT WHEN I GET UP.........I EASILY ON AVERAGE  BUY 2-3 PAIR PER WEEK.....&lt;br /&gt;AFTER MY PURCHASE ....I MADE UP MY MIND THAT WHENEVER THEY ARRIVE AND WHAT EVER THEY LOOKED LIKE...&lt;br /&gt;THE LASHES ARRIVED IN THIS LITTLE BOX AS SHOWN IN THE PICTURES...THE STRIPS ARE WAY TO LONG AND WILL HAVE TO BE CLIPPED ON BOTH ENDS  DUE TO THE WAY THEY ARE ATTACHED IN THE BOX.....THERE IS NO ADHESIVE ON THE BAND, SO YOU WILL NEED SOME TYPE OF GLUE.....THE BAND IS NOT AS FLIMSY OR THICK AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. THEREFORE, IF YOU DONT KNOW HOW TO MEASURE AND CUT THE STRIP OR IF YOU ARE ONLY FAMILIAR WITH A CERTAIN TYPE OF LASH BAND I WOULD NOT ADVISE YOU TO PURCHASE.&lt;br /&gt;ONCE I APPLIED THE LASHES TO MY FACE ...I WAS ABLE TO PLAY WITH THEM AND MAKE IT WORK... I WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE FOR WORK ...BUT NOT FOR THE WEEKENDS....WHEN I USE MORE ATTENTION TO DETAIL WITH MY MAKE UP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THESE LASHES WILL WORK FOR SOMEONE WHO USES A LOT OF LASHES AND WANT TO SAVE MONEY...SUCH AS MYSELF AND WOMEN WHO MAY DO HAIR, MAKE OVERS, AND  ARE LEARNING TO APPLY LASHES.</li>
            <li> I personally loves these. I have Asian eyes so my eyelashes aren&#x27;t very long. these give a hugeeee impact on my eyes. They need some trimming. They are long, and wide. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for beginners. Need a steady hand to cut to the size of someone&#x27;s eyes.</li>
            <li> I like my eyelashes to bend more but these were a great price and work just fine! Thanks a bunch</li>
            <li> I used these for an art project that I was working one. I actually wore a few of the thinner lashes and they worked very nicely. The thicker lashes however look very fake, and in my opinion are unwearable. Overall though they are decent quality lashes for the price.</li>
            <li> You can create a lot of looks using these eyelashes. Also,  this item will be very helpful for you. also, reliable seller.</li>
            <li> these guess you get what you pay for these are the worst lashes I&#x27;ve ever seen.  They are plastic and not at all like real hair.  I&#x27;d rather buy real hair ones at Walmart any day.  I won&#x27;t even wear these!</li>
            <li> These look like a good deal but eyelashes are very stiff and difficult to put on. But they were only two dollars!</li>
            <li> I  didn&#x27;t realize they were plastic weekend I ordered it online. They&#x27;re not the same as the eyelashes sold in department stores.  I ended up giving them to my daughter to use for her cosplay costumes.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for. I would not buy these again. They had a weird smell to them and the thin ones were extremely ugly. I ended up throwing them away. Also, they were shipped in an envelope and were extremely squished when I received them. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> These lashes look aweful.They have no movement, they&#x27;re enterily too long, and I don&#x27;t see how anyone could wear these.. I&#x27;ll still to my Red Cherrys...</li>
            <li> First off I received my eyelashes in less than two weeks. I&#x27;m shocked and pleased they aren&#x27;t as bad as I thought they&#x27;d be for the price. They apply easier than the human remy brand I usually use they&#x27;re definitely a better brand of synthetic fibers. What I find most appealing is that I can trim and curl them to make them appear more natural.&lt;br /&gt;What I still can&#x27;t believe is how quickly they arrived.</li>
            <li> I only paid $2 dollars but not very well spent.  I through them away.  They are plastic and look ridiculous and I am a professional make-up artist.</li>
            <li> Love my lashes super cute ladies</li>
            <li> She never wears them...sigh.&lt;br /&gt;I imagine they would looks somewhat ok, if she was to indeed actually put them on. eh.</li>
            <li> Have to cut the extra stem , but still love them 😎</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM! Is there a way to buy the thinner lashes only? Those are my favorite! I wish I could just have those!</li>
            <li> These are okay. Not bad for the price, wish they came with glue. if they were not an add on, I would&#x27;ve never purchased them.</li>
            <li> These are well manufactured they just don&#x27;t stay on!! :(  I wish they would I thought what a great value!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that there are so many of them and I don&#x27;t have to worry about buying any more for awhile.</li>
            <li> SO UNREALISTIC FLIMSY AND UGLY. THEY LOOK LIKE SPIDERS ON YOUR EYES. ONLY GOOD FOR PRACTICE PURPOSES NOT GOING OUT</li>
            <li> Yikes....I threw my money away on these. Cheap is not always the best choice! One box I tried to use the lashes I looked like I was scared all day! And the butterfly lashes I cant even experiment with .......they would be an obstruction of my view!!! Garbage!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely ♡ these eyelashes. For them to be less than $5 they are amazing. I usually wear human hair eyelashes but these comes close to it.  Very impressive.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2GJ32GN0GQMQ1]]UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Took a 2nd chance in hopes I wouldn&#x27;t have the same issue as the first round, but man O man did this seller mess up.&lt;br /&gt;First off - 1st order never came. They sent again and i got it two months later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the lightweight lashes. Hard to tell if they are real or not. People often asked me.&lt;br /&gt;For that reason alone, I got another order. Did i received the 2nd order? Nope. I contacted the seller and they were only willing to send a repeat order. Wouldn&#x27;t duplicate or offer me a discount seeing how i was a repeat customer. They also knew that this was the 2nd time i didn&#x27;t receive my order. Oh well... won&#x27;t do business again right?&lt;br /&gt;I get the lashes today and the heavy lashes are nothing like my previous order. These are some \\&quot;I love NY\\&quot; lashes. Truly hideous. And maybe that&#x27;s why they are getting some bad reviews. Because some of these ladies are getting the ghetto fab, vs appropriate heavy. VIDEO AND PICTURE ADDED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry seller.... you messed up and should&#x27;ve done your part on keeping customers around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLDER:&lt;br /&gt;Who can really deny all these lashes for such little cost? The less dramatic ones really do look natural. And the heavier ones aren&#x27;t too much if you&#x27;re going out.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again...but it&#x27;ll take me like a year lol&lt;br /&gt;Only down side, they took FOREVER to arrive. The first shipment I never got, but they sent me more and I got those in a decent amount of time. Total wait time, almost two months! But seriously... I can wait... these are too cheap to even care lol</li>
            <li> Complete crap.  Does not deserve one star.  I opened the package after it arrived WAY past two day shipping and threw them directly into the trash.  They look cheap, they are cheap,  they look like plastic.  How this product has received the great reviews it has blows my mind.  Total waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I recieved just what I expected. It looks exaclty like it does in the picture. They are a bit long in width and generally need cut down. Great quality, great price!</li>
            <li> It was nice, but the package was kind of crushed. They look great though ! I really like how they look on me too :)</li>
            <li> Been waiting for them for about a month now !!! I would like them since I paid for them.. Than you</li>
            <li> I like them , they were nice , my friends loved them</li>
            <li> Poor quality and very stiff.</li>
            <li> First off let me say these lashes are soooo pretty. I got these just because they was very cheap. My delivery date was between February 19th - March 9th. I received them on the 4th of February. So shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> these a good lashes, it did take forever for me to receive them. they are very long so you have to cut them down to fit your eye which sometimes is a hassle.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes!!! This is the second set I bought...it took a little over 3 wks to here,no biggie,I knew they were being shipped internationally but they are easy to apply and look great! The dramatic ones are my fave,granted they are not natural hair but so what?? They still good!! I will continue to purchase these.</li>
            <li> i atually liked this lashes yes they are not perfect but for the money i paid for them there pretty good i will buy from them again omly thing it takes foreverrrr to get them</li>
            <li> I bought these because I need to practice putting lashes on and it&#x27;s a good value 20 pair for the price you pay for one pair at the beauty mart. Surprisingly they are good quality. I like the thick ones for a fuller dramatic night look, and the thin ones if I want to be extra fab during the day the don&#x27;t look like you&#x27;ve stuck your finger in socket and electrocuted your self LOL.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.. it took some time to come by but over all i really like it.. and yes they are FALSE eyelashes so don&#x27;t expect them to look super natural.. i think if your good at putting them on then they shouldn&#x27;t look that fake..</li>
            <li> lashes are extremely fake looking, this was my first time buying false lashes ever so i wanted to buy cheap, cuz i really dont wear them often. would never buy these again, everyone can tell they are fake</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for. the material is not very good they are made of some kind of plastic and it can be bothersome to my eyes.</li>
            <li> Super dramatic lashes great for people who love that they are so wide you have to cut both ends they feel super cheap but are workable I used them in Halloween and when I have gone out and have done darker spoken Eye looks I won&#x27;t repurchase not for every day wear</li>
            <li> good deal for all the eyeslashes it comes with but I was disappointed that my package came damages they do need some bending to apply but for the price im not complaining !</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost. No complaints from me.</li>
            <li> they suck and were not worth the money i wouldnt tell my friend about them but i would say never buy them</li>
            <li> They are so fake . They dont even look real at all . I dont recommend</li>
            <li> lashes are nice but the packaging is beaten up and was ripped, although the lashes are a bit too long width wise (nothing i cant fix)&lt;br /&gt;it would be helpful if they came with glue, but they came early and for the price they were there really nice</li>
            <li> I ordered these back in November, and I never wrote a review, so here it goes! I originally bought these for cosplay, but I&#x27;ve found myself wearing them even on a daily basis. They really do accentuate your eyes amazingly, and don&#x27;t even feel like they&#x27;re there. I really wish they would stay on for longer periods of time, but that might just be the glue I&#x27;m using. They are a bit stiff and quite long after opening, so I roll the lashes between my fingers and cut the ends off a bit before I put them on. Though, the price is something you can&#x27;t beat. I&#x27;ll be buying from this seller again</li>
            <li> These are the best lashes hands down I ever came across and at a great price because its better than going to the beauty supply store or Walmart or Mac or sephora and spending an arm and a leg for lashes which don&#x27;t ever last. But these last me months! And I wear them every day. You can cut it down it fit your eye too. I get complements all the time on it on the dramatic looking ones and the one that&#x27;s not so dramatic, i tend to double up even triple up on lashes because I love the fullness of it. I buy these lashes at least 2x a year and I&#x27;m ordering more now because the weather getting warmer and I gotta look cute with my lashes lol&lt;br /&gt;@king_rosaline 😘😊😍💁</li>
            <li> I wear eyelashes everyday and this seemed perfect. It&#x27;s not the greatest pair of eyelashes but you throw some mascara on them and eyelash curler you could even double them and you&#x27;ll be straight deff purchase again</li>
            <li> Very unnatural and hard</li>
            <li> Very hard to use ..hey but what can I expect for a couple dollars...... never will purchase again.. Disliked very much</li>
            <li> I cut the thinner set into halves and applied to outer half of my lid for a day of shopping. I wore them about 4 hours and had to remove. I had the worst reaction to them and a whole week later I am still fighting the scabbing along my lash line. I don&#x27;t typically have a reaction to anything so BUYER BEWARE if you are sensitive these might cause some problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick but they are what you pay for, they are stiffer and resemble those cheap lashes you get at Halloween stores. If you don&#x27;t have a reaction and you want some cheap lashes to practice with or use occasionally they aren&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Cheap, flimsy, but I shouldve known that since I didn&#x27;t pay hardly anything for it. I threw them away immediately. Don&#x27;t bother!</li>
            <li> LET ME GUESS. You are probably considering these false lashes because you want to enhance your look while staying under budget. If this is true for you, then order this product. These lashes are very low priced while still in fact doing their job. Personally, on the set of lashes that are less full, I have gotten nothing but compliments from friends on how NATURAL they look. Yes!! NATURAL. I did not expect any false eyelash to be able to look natural at this price but they do. Of course as stated in other reviews, it is necessary to cut them a bit shorter before applying due to how long they are but it gives you options as to how much lash you want on a given day. This product is a must have for lash lovers, I&#x27;m a full-time buyer.</li>
            <li> These lashes are great.  With both I could use for any occasion or outfit even.  I could go for something simple and use the thin or practically everyday.  With the thick ones I use for going out, parties, etc.  The only thing is that it&#x27;s a little long so I have to be careful when cutting it because I need the inner corners to be at least same length.  Also, taking glue off after I use them is an absolute challenge! The band is super thin! It&#x27;s hardly anything so when you take out the glue you&#x27;ll probably end up ruining the band and plucking some lashes out.  But they do last long.  Even if I don&#x27;t get all the glue out, I could do a little something to make it better.  I could pull maybe 5-7 times with the lashes or more sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thick lash is really thick. Great for parties and night time events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thin great for anything anytime and anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem: lashes are hard to care for and clean (I bought a case for lashes since these lashes came in huge box) and the shipping was well... It took quite a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Love,Love,Love ......these lashes they are easy to apply they last long and they can be reused.if you take care of them..</li>
            <li> I was a newcomer to lashes and was curious about these, so when I recieved them in the mail i was very satisfied. The fuller ones I didnt like the way they looked on me so i gave them to my cousin who does makeup. and the other ones I kept and use every once in a while.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to receive package earlier than promised.  The dark ones feel somewhat unnatural but after wearing I became adjusted to the feel.  Don&#x27;t need a lot of DUO glue to hold in place.  Plan on ordering more can&#x27;t beat the price.  California</li>
            <li> i did a 4 star on these for the reason . i dont like the bigger ones you can really tell thay are fake not like them at all . but the thiner ones are great i have used 1 out of them 2 times and i thank i can get 1 more out of them and if i clean the glue off i thank i can get more but thay are just enuff for every day i love them . so for what you pay you get your money out of the one set .</li>
            <li> I like the longer lashes. I am using the shorter lashes for a lower lash, but I love them, I&#x27;d have liked them longer, but I make them work.</li>
            <li> Lashes have the feel of real hair. The only thing I did not like is on the thicker set they are extremely long! I have big eyes and never have this problem but I had to trim them.</li>
            <li> These eyeborws look wondeful online, but when you get them in your hand forget it.&lt;br /&gt;You want an eyelash that is going to blend in with the natural hairs of your eyelashes, not plastic on top of real hair!&lt;br /&gt;These are good for practice though.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes are great, and it&#x27;s much better having all these sets than constantly having to go buy new ones. Not only that but it&#x27;s also slot cheaper this way. The regular long eyelashes are a bit longer than I thought they were going to be but they&#x27;re still not over dramatic. The other eyelashes look exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> I have yet to wear them but they did come on time. They look great and I like the fact that the line is thicker. Sometime when the line is thin they mess up and you can&#x27;t wear them more than twice. I can&#x27;t wait to wear them and try some on others. The price was great also I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> The lashes scattered throughout the box. Most of them couldn&#x27;t be used.  Very sad disappointing. I wouldn&#x27;t re order again.</li>
            <li> I feel for the price and quantity they deserve a mid grade. They are worth the value. And I would purchase again. They r great to just have in the make up kit</li>
            <li> I liked them they go on easy and are easy to take off. The only con would be the hair isn&#x27;t real but you get what you pay for. It was worth it : )</li>
            <li> Great Price, for your Buck! Two styles (long and thick) at an affordable price. What a good offer, you can&#x27;t miss out!</li>
            <li> Wow, for ladies who never have enough eyelashes! Good quality too!</li>
            <li> the thin ones are great they look natural but the other ones look HORRIBLE ! There to long to think and very black</li>
            <li> bought these as a gift for my daughter, she loved them even though they didn&#x27;t come in time. Not bad for cost, either.</li>
            <li> These are really really great eyelashes I love them. I originally only got them because of the price, but they&#x27;re great! I love them. They&#x27;re soft and look fabulous. I will order again! The shipping time was really good too, they came quickly! Love love love</li>
            <li> oh my God...I loved them and for the price you cant beat. These are exactly what the seller said they would be and they are just awesome. I love them because they make my eyes look so beautiful and natural.</li>
            <li> The more natural looking set is perfect, easy to put on, curl, and no one ever thinks i have false eyelashes on. The more dramatic ones are slightly difficult to bend the band to put on, and can sometimes pop up if not curled for long enough. They both look really nice and are soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was requested and they look amazing for the price!! Love the thick lashes they really complete the look.</li>
            <li> I got these mailed today. First if all, they never give me the other eyelashes, just the thick one. The package was pretty much smashed up a little. They are pretty much hard to put them on once I tried them on(#ﾟДﾟ)ｺﾞﾙｧ!! These are cheap anyway &#x3D; poor quality. If you want better, high quality eyelashes you pretty much have to pay at least $5. I am pretty much not satisfied of this product ｡･ﾟ･(ﾉД&#x60;)･ﾟ･｡</li>
            <li> I liked them , you get 40 in total for around 5 bucks so that&#x27;s good. The only thing is that they are super synthetic so they don&#x27;t look as natural</li>
            <li> Awesome! I use them for shows and they are great!</li>
            <li> Amazing value! Theses false lashes do require a little trimming, but that&#x27;s easy enough and only takes a couple of seconds. I will definitely order more!!</li>
            <li> The package was a bit banged up but the product was in perfect shape, they are beautiful! Some have too much glue that you can see it but once its one at you put on mascara on its nice:3</li>
            <li> Awesome, need to be cut to size but awesome for a few bucks ^_^</li>
            <li> Good for the price. Not real, however good for a night out.  Only used one pair.  Not bad.</li>
            <li> They suck..hard to cut to the length you want...also they don&#x27;t bend...waste of money</li>
            <li> i just finally got these today. ordered Nov. 6th, and i honestly wasnt sure if theyd ever arrive. very slow shipping. the product came in seperate boxes in an envelope, so the boxes were a little banged up, but did a good enough job of protecting whats inside. i havent tried the lashes on yet,but they look nice and lush and easy to work with, and twenty pairs for about two dollars and free shipping is worth the wait. i would probably order these again, just be aware that you might be waiting more than a month for them to reach you.</li>
            <li> Not the kind they look in the pic....Too much shine. I thought they are dull but they arent. but cheap if u use false lashes alot.</li>
            <li> They are great! The best I have found..they are so pretty I love the thicker ones..they are easy to bend and a just to your eyes...A must have!!!</li>
            <li> I always cut my eyelashes in half and just where them on the edges of my eves, so I am now stalked forever with such great quality lashes!</li>
            <li> I love them and how super cheap they are, I just wish I knew how to put them on properly! Ah well, practice makes perfect haha.</li>
            <li> The only con I have found to these lashes is that the band is kind of thick and doesn&#x27;t really like to bend as well as the higher priced lashes on the market.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t feel like plastic, and do look nice once you get them on.  Just use a good adhesive like DUO.  These do not come with lash adhesive!&lt;br /&gt;The package was in excellent shape when they arrived, and no lashes were damaged in transit.</li>
            <li> Lashes aren&#x27;t bad. Nice shape/band, but they are literally made of plastic strips. Better when scene from a distance, I wouldn&#x27;t use for professional makeup.</li>
            <li> These are plain and simple and do not look real. They make your eyes look cheap and they are hard to glue on.</li>
            <li> i used the thicker lashes first and then whn i ran out of those i used the natural set.both sets are awesome.. i always glued 2 of the thinner lashes together for a more dramatic look.. they came really fast considering they came from hong kong or something...</li>
            <li> They look super fake and I use the 99¢store kind they look super platicy</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the thick ones! They make my eyes pop so much &amp; look beautiful! Thank you :)</li>
            <li> NO DISAPPOINTMENTS HERE...THEY ARE GREAT.  GOT MANY COMPLIMENTS WOULD DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN.  I WEAR THEM EVERYDAY TO ENHANCE MY OWN LASHES</li>
            <li> Obviously they are in fact fake eyelashes but they look a lot better on the picture than in real life, they&#x27;re plastic and just don&#x27;t feel right. Given the price, i guess thats exactly what they are worth. Might be good for a night out when you&#x27;re wearing a load of makeup but not for natural looking days, they won&#x27;t fly.</li>
            <li> Awesome price for SOOOO many eyelashes!! I would definitely recommend  to any eyelash obsessed girl!!!</li>
            <li> These worked great - great price and surprisingly fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I got them - came in handy at the last dance competition!</li>
            <li> If you take part in a play in which people see you from many feet away, or you wear Halloween costumes and want to dramatize your eyes a lot, you may like it. They are just not for me. They look so fake even the thinner ones.</li>
            <li> I love the thin wispy style I wear them everyday I have not tried the glam ones yet I will use them for going out on Saturdayl</li>
            <li> You get exactly what they say you will get. They are 100% reusable depending upon how well you take care of them. I take them off and store them until next time I need them. They do take awhile to get to me considering they are in HONG KONG and I am in U.S. but I don&#x27;t have to re order more for quite sometime. What an unbelievable price. I had to order them to see if the price would be fitting to the quality and I can definitely they are a good quality for the small fee.  I am always pleased and have ordered about 4 different packs of these now. 20 pairs lasts me about 3 months and for awhile I was wearing them nearly everyday because of my job as a promo model as well as outings with friends. I recommend this to any girl who wants to save some money who also wear lashes alot.</li>
            <li> WHAT A GREAT BUY, I HAVE WORN LASHES FOR 40 YEARS AND THEY ARE $$ THESE ARE A BARGIN  WISH I HAD FOUND SOONER.....WILL BUY MORE IF I NEED THEM.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t exactly look like the pictures. They&#x27;re not really my style although the thicker ones looked pretty once they were on but I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again. Also the thinner ones are paper thin. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for an everyday use maybe a dress up day.</li>
            <li> The band is wayyyyyyyy to thick to look natural not a good buy.</li>
            <li> I purchased these a little while ago, got them early so thats great. They came all the way from hong kong and they were EXTREMELY cheap. cons: they product looked like it was in a fight and lost and when you first glimpse the eyelashes in the box they look really synthetic. Pros: really cheap,and they look great on, which is all that matters. try them love them!</li>
            <li> These are my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;This seller Always have ut arive before the estimated date. It is way cheaper because if i buy one pair of eyelashes from a store its like 1$ or sometimes 2$ .Here im getting 20 pairs for a really cheap price!  And tge quality is amazing. I love both sets.</li>
            <li> I know these eyelashes are UBER cheap, but I would definitely recommend spending the extra few dollars and just going to Walgreens or CVS or wherever and but quality over quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These eyelashes work fine though if you want to practice your applying technique.</li>
            <li> too cartoony. The lighter one looks like soongebobs eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I just purchased 3 more boxes my daughters just snipped the lil long edges an glued an bam there on...they lookd so natural im thinking of buying them for myself its worth the price my girls were spending $2.99 for each pair so Great Deal..</li>
            <li> Thanks for sending me this product that I really liked ... I recommend it to everyone for being excellent and very good quality</li>
            <li> If you know anything about false lashes you don&#x27;t want these. They are so unnatural looking and they barely bend to fit your eye. They&#x27;re a stiff plastic and you have to the lashes practically in half for them to be somewhat decent. I tried them once then threw out the boxes that same day. JUNK.</li>
            <li> I love the natural eyelashes.. However the other look like they belong at a Halloween store they are too big, too ugly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both for a few weeks now,&lt;br /&gt;The thinner ones look perfect and natural for everyday use and the thicker ones are more dramatic, I&#x27;m not a very over the top person so I wasn&#x27;t able to wear for everyday lashes but they&#x27;d be good for a night out and I wore them to prom.&lt;br /&gt;Super cheap for a ton of lashes only draw back is that they are shipped from China so it takes a little while to get here, but for a little over a buck I&#x27;d strongly recommend buying these lashes!</li>
            <li> I really liked the regular ones since they look more natural. The thick ones... maybe for Halloween. They were a bit too much for me, but still at a very good price.</li>
            <li> Great price, works for homecoming and weddings.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I ordered the picture makes the eyelashes look really nice and what i recieved is some weird eyelashes that you have to cut apart. I don&#x27;t even think the glue i have will stick to them. I guess buying in bulk doesnt always work out.</li>
            <li> Not the best, but for the price you can toss them after one use. They cut down to size very well. In the past, other companies lashes weren&#x27;t long enough, but these are perfect. Great deal!</li>
            <li> Some were bent and unwearable when they came. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> looove these lashes.. and so do my clients</li>
            <li> these are really a waste of money and time better off buying drugstore stiff and dont stick with any amount of glue worthless</li>
            <li> I surprising liked the more dramatic looking lashes over the natural looking lashes. The dramatic looking lashes looks intimidating at first with it&#x27;s thick band, however it does make the lashes look more full and shorter than the other more natural looking ones. However it may just be me because I have black hair, and if you have any lighter color hair the lashes may look more notiable. They are quite reusable, and stackable for any eye look you are trying to retrieve.</li>
            <li> my daughter liked these eyelashes on her. it sticks on to her pretty effectively.</li>
            <li> Great to customize for your eye, super cheap!</li>
            <li> great lashes but there a tad to shiny when worn and youd also have to cut them down to the size of your lash line because there to long</li>
            <li> i love this variety of lashes and sometimes I can even reuse the lash up to three- four times, durable, extremely complimenting!</li>
            <li> First off these were extremly afffordable got here earlier than they said i love them and they look so natural i willbe rdering like alot more of these like 10 for like 11 bucks yea and the full ones make u look like u have nicki minaj eyes lol.</li>
            <li> these are a bunchh a really cheap great if you know how to put them on lol but they look pretty and make your eyes stand out</li>
            <li> Held up well. I use them to TAKE OFF AT NIGHT AND APPLY WHEN I WANT LASHES. The WILL hold up for every day wear. If you do not know how to apply strip lashes CUT THEM TO YOUR COMFORTABLY to apply. Also DUO Eyelash Adhesive is the best glue for long wear. Be advised you may damage your natural eyelashes if you ARE NOT A PRO.</li>
            <li> I completely love the look, the band is stiff  but it&#x27;s still flexible. It is a great value for the money</li>
            <li> In store the cheapest pair of eyelashes I can find are 4 dollars for one pair. I got 20 for 2 bucks! Can&#x27;t beat that. They look and feel just as good as any other brand I&#x27;ve used. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend... they feel too cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for and thats the case here.</li>
            <li> I waited forever for these lashes but it was worth the wait, i personally like the thicker ones better tho</li>
            <li> These are great lashes and the fact that there are two different styles makes it even better. Have fun and play hard.</li>
            <li> 20 Pairs Regular Long and Thick Eyelashes Style 1 and 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love the lashes 2 had to different styles very lite  i will be getting more soon&lt;br /&gt;it seemed like they took forever but came on time</li>
            <li> These last all day dont look super fake and are great quality but probably have to be trimmed to fit.</li>
            <li> I bought these lashes to experiment with , but I didn&#x27;t think I would actually use them. They are actually quite soft and do not irritate the eyes the hairs are soft and give the eye the \\&quot;gyaru\\&quot; look or dolly eyes . TIP before applying the lashes bend them in a natural curve for about 30 seconds with glue on, this should help it become easier when applying . 4/5 wish that the band was a little less stiff .</li>
            <li> I LOCE THE &#x60;1ST style the best but both are good. the just took a while to get to me lol other than that they are amazing</li>
            <li> LOVE the thin style; they gave me just the right &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;. The thick ones look very fake. Make sure you have lash glue on hand.</li>
            <li> ya they are def pretty cool, specially for the price one pays.... great deal, I bought the glue in Walmart, and I put them on everytime I go out dancing</li>
            <li> These lashes are great, and just reading those bad reviews makes me a little mad....&lt;br /&gt;A few things to know before buying these(to avoid any possible disappointment)&lt;br /&gt;-they&#x27;re made from plastic. (This caused some bad reviews from people expecting real hair, or high quality fake hair) However, they don&#x27;t look completely fake. These lashes earn me many compliments every time I wear them.&lt;br /&gt;- You may have to cut the ends a little to get them to fit with your eyelids. (This is not hard to do. Just grab some scissors; any pair will do, and cut a little off at a time, holding them over your eyelid after each bit is cut off to test the length and see if it looks right.)&lt;br /&gt;Those were the main problems I was seeing in the lower reviews, but other than these small issues, these lashes are great! Especially for the low price. I honestly didn&#x27;t see a problem with the item at all, they were easy to use, and when you get them on right, they&#x27;re stunning and they make anyone&#x27;s eyes pop.</li>
            <li> I love this product  I bought a couple of other things on amozon but I got this package first it only took about 1 week</li>
            <li> Lashes did eventually show up, ordered in November, arrived in January. When I messaged the seller they were very polite though and reshipped a new set. These come straight from China so be aware shipping could take awhile. My daughter was pleased with her lashes, so I&#x27;m happy in the end. Price was very good.</li>
            <li> The thick ones are perfect for parties and clubbing nights, but the thin ones arent my favorites because thery r super easy to lift and doesnt look natural like i thought it would once i put them on.</li>
            <li> My only complaint with these is that they are kinda hard to apply the lashline is very thin and if you use to much glue they move around</li>
            <li> These lashes are as they are described in that they are not stiff or having a plastic appearance. The picture is a true likeness of what the lashes look like. They feel soft and pliable which, I am sure, will facilitate ease when I put them on. I also like that they are long enough (width from end to end) which will enable me to cut them to fit the width of my eyelids. Additionally, I like the length of the lashes which was a huge consideration when I chose them. One thing I did notice (not a bad thing) is that, if you look closely, the lashes on the &#x27;upper tier&#x27; of the boxes appear to be just a tad shorter than the ones on the &#x27;lower tier&#x27;-- when you hold the boxes with the 3 rows at the top and the 2 rows below the writing on the bottom. The rows are broken up by the Chinese writing.  It&#x27;s not a deal-breaker, just an observation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is potential for lots of wear for the price. I feel like I have gotten a bargain! I have not worn them yet, but if there is anything noteworthy after wearing them 4-5 times, I will come back and add to this review. So, if you don&#x27;t mind waiting 3-4 weeks for delivery, I think the price/quality combination is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Terrible product. Even the 20 cents I spent on this was not worth it. They&#x27;re made of plastic and the bands are so thick. Not to mention they&#x27;re not very long. They look exactly like my natural lashes without mascara. Not impressed don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I always get a load of compliments from my lady-friends when I use my fake eyelashes and especially when I do a smokey eye.  These are very affordable and sizable.  Excellent for demi lashes.  Just cut one in two.</li>
            <li> crappy quality eyelashes, very cheap and i would not recommend them to anyone that wants good looking lashes. They also did not stay on</li>
            <li> I ordered on a whim, but like the quality. You actually get 20 pair of eyelashes, thick and natural with a nice arch. I do not think I will use the thick ones at all. I tried the natural pair, but removed them because I did not want to use eyeliner, which I think is going to be necessary with false eyelashes.  The seam is impossible to hide. They are not self-adhesive and you will need to buy glue. They are packaged efficiently and secure enough for me, nothing fancy, but basic enough for protecting the shape. They arrived way ahead of the anticipated date. I recommend them if you are used to wearing false eyelashes. The price is amazing.</li>
            <li> Horrible i dont like it. Loos tottaly false dont buy it. Really dont buy it is cheap but i dont like it</li>
            <li> I have waited over a month for these lashes to come in and today was the last day for them to be shipped to me and they have not showed up! I&#x27;ve had several jobs where I needed the lashes and I did not have them&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed on how long it takes them to ship and them not showing up on time! I would not get these lashes if your looking to get them for a job in time</li>
            <li> liked these especially the thinner ones for day they were also easy for me to apply. I will definitely order more of the thinner ones .</li>
            <li> Price is great and so r the lashes! Clients love them . Took a while to get them but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like these eye lashes. They have a weird shape and when you cut them down they look awkward.</li>
            <li> is so sad that being selling this kind of quality product...plastic fake bad quality...&lt;br /&gt;not ordering again never again waist of time and money</li>
            <li> Love the eyelashes cannot wait to receive them. The price is good.</li>
            <li> Love them comfortable to wear. Will certainly buy again</li>
            <li> I use them for competitions and special occasions . They are great !</li>
            <li> You get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> I love the assortment of lashes.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes. Great price and they came fast. Highly recommend them to anyone looking to purchase false eye lashes</li>
            <li> these look ridiculous</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, and a great product, came as shown. Also VERY satisfied with these lashes. Will be ordering again. Came exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the worst products I&#x27;ve ever purchased. These lashes look and feel as though they were made out of the same material used to make barbie doll lashes. I am disappointed because every review that said this was a great product is a LIE! I bought these to use for practicing how to apply false lashes and are so bad I can&#x27;t even use them for that. I am not the type to write reviews but they are so horrible I had to let the world know. Save your $2. AND Yes this is a real person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VIA.. InvogueNikky (IG and Youtube)</li>
            <li> I love them! Looks very natural when u put them on! Every body love my make up when I had them on!</li>
            <li> I admit I was nervous about the quality of these lashes, but I am very impressed with them. This is such an amazing price for 20 pairs of eyelashes! The shipping was a lot faster than it said as well.</li>
            <li> I loved them and got here earlier than I expected them to I love the thin eyelashes made my eyelashes long better thicker and longer especially for what I paid for them like 2.00 and some change!</li>
            <li> These are good for practice! I have always sucked at putting on false lashes and paying $15 for a pair of lashes is horrible. So buying this to practice is awesome.</li>
            <li> Great deal, the long ones are so dramatic. Wonderful for prom. Both easy to cut and add glue. All in all a fantastic bargain. Ships faster than you&#x27;d think as well. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Horrible, do not buy glue will not stick to eyes. The picture is better. From china or japan, poor quality</li>
            <li> I bought these for my friends. There were no adhesive inside. I had to purchase it separate. But my friends do like them and they are wearing them.</li>
            <li> Bad quality, super cheap.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Product is wonderful. Good for every day and special occasions</li>
            <li> The box was worn out . The lashes look fake and plastic . I haven&#x27;t tried them on yet . This will be my first time considering I use red cherry eyelashes , I bought these because they were cheap .</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.. Great quality.. Very happy with my purchase..</li>
            <li> I love these lashes the work like ones u would buy in the store half the price it just takes better glue  then what&#x27;s at the dollar store</li>
            <li> arrived on time and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;nice price and quality</li>
            <li> Exactly like the picture but they came a little late. I love them though! Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mom and she loved them! They arrived a week after I placed my order.</li>
            <li> These are not natural looking nor are they very good quality. He only reason they got two stars is because you get so many of them for a very cheap price. The only reason it got two stars was because there are so many of them for very cheap. I use them for practice, and I ended up giving a bunch to my daughters for play.</li>
            <li> I love my lashes, their thick, durable &amp; so beautiful :)</li>
            <li> These are cheaply-made, low-quality, stiff (but lightweight) lashes from China.  They barely bend around the natural shape of the eye before the ends pop out again.  There are so many good-quality brands of lashes made in the USA!  If these were excellent fake lashes, I would not complain.  However, their being low-quality AND made in China ... please don&#x27;t waste your money overseas.</li>
            <li> No flexible hard to apply.</li>
            <li> These lashes are so fake and won&#x27;t even stay on my lashes with a lot of glue</li>
            <li> Lets just say they went straight to the trash. They are very stiff and look totally fake. Very hard to put on due to its stiffness.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this look! Its almost like a make over without plastic surgery &amp; I look even more cute! (Lol)</li>
            <li> Good if you want to wear a costume, not for everyday.</li>
            <li> I have to cut them down a little but they are great</li>
            <li> I know this product wasn&#x27;t going to be the absolute best because of where it shipped from, however, I really do like this product. The only two negatives that gave it a 4 instead of 5 is that the lashes didn&#x27;t have &#x27;&#x27;pairs&#x27;&#x27; that were the same length (easily fixed with mascara) it shipped and arrived way earlier than expected, however I had to go personally pick it up from the post office because it had to be signed for.&lt;br /&gt;Overall decent product.</li>
            <li> Obviously a great price for all of these. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more for your money. Will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I only wear these for special photographs because they&#x27;re very thick and dramatic so that they show up well when photographed. The skinnies work really well for me as bottom lashes after a quick trim over thick liner. Good buy for the price!</li>
            <li> style 1 is SUPER THICK AND LONG they feel like butterfly wings. No joke. Style 2 is very natural looking and they feel weightless. I&#x27;d definitely recommend. Style 1 must be worn to a club or maybe for Halloween or if you have no eyelashes at all. I mean I&#x27;ve worn Style 1 and they look gorgeous and all but they are a bit much..</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with these lashes they arent like red cherry at all the lash is like glued to cardboard ughh horrible!</li>
            <li> Unwearable, don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> I use falsies a lot for parties, holidays, etc. These did not stay on at ALL! They looked &amp; felt awful. It&#x27;s like the lashes are almost some type of uber thin silicone or plastic. Not buying again.</li>
            <li> I have bought these like 8 times&lt;br /&gt;THE BEST</li>
            <li> ALTHOUGH THEY SEEMED A BIT LENGTHY ITS A GOOD THING THAT WAY I HAD SPACE TO CUT AND FIT THEM TO MY EYES. GREAT GREAT BUY. SOOO WORTH THE WAIT I HAD ENOUGH TO MAKE MISTAKES WITH PRACTICE WITH AND SHARE! ALTHOUGH I DONT HAVE MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH EYELASHES THEY WERENT AS GREAT AS THE PREVIOUS BRAND IM USED TO, AND IF YOUR ROUGH ON LASHES LIKE ME THESE ARENT FOR YOU. BUT ITS OKAY BECAUSE YOU&#x27;VE GOT 20 PAIRS!</li>
            <li> Too long halloween material and not like what i get at pharmacy, threw away. would b good for costume .</li>
            <li> the big lashes are unconfortable they are a lil hatd to bend the other ones are ok</li>
            <li> These are very high quality lashes and lots of them for an awesome price! It comes with a pack of regular every day lashes and a pack of lashes for when you&#x27;re going for a night out on the town or special occasion!</li>
            <li> Product can end up looking pretty fake it you do not trim the actual lashes. However, the product leaves a lot of room to customize the lashes. Not a bad product</li>
            <li> Made in china.... They look ok.</li>
            <li> No, in my life I could were this ugly eyelashes... I bought it tinking that it going to be... You know kind of fake because of the price.... But when I recived it... 😱...No! they are like peaces of plastic eyelashes ...oh well the price said everything.</li>
            <li> short waiting time, but the quality of the product is very poor. Theyre made in China so I wouldnt recommend buying them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I completely lost my eyelashes to chemotherapy and they&#x27;re still growing back and are a mess. I&#x27;ve never used false eyelashes before and these were cheap enough to be a throw-away if they didn&#x27;t work. The only thing I do wish is that they could have a bit more flexibility in them (they seem to want to retain their bowed shape and not bend easily to the shape of your eyelid). I don&#x27;t know if all false eyelashes are like this or not.</li>
            <li> You could tell they were totally fake, and they did not fit well at all. i wish i did not buy them in the first place.</li>
            <li> As someone who absolutely loves false lashes and gets them every chance they can, the chance to get twenty pairs for such a low price was a godsend. I was worried at was the actual quality would be at such a low price, but I was not disappointed! The quality is very similar to what I would spend on one $6 pair at the store. I&#x27;m extremely happy with them and actually willing to buy some more! The product got here a lot sooner than expected, though I can&#x27;t say that will be the same for everyone. I will say they are just a little stiff and can have an especially plastic-like shine at some points, so they may not be for you if that&#x27;s an issue. However I am personally  very happy with this product!!</li>
            <li> These eyelashes really make my eyes pop</li>
            <li> when I got these in the mail, I thought they would be more fluttery than they actually were, and the band on the fuller ones was really thick. Still, I can use these for when I do  a heavy smoky eye or anime eyes or something like that. They&#x27;re still comfortable, so I have no real complaints about the product.</li>
            <li> For the price that you get them for and how many you get I&#x27;m okay with this purchase I will say they were really cheaply made and kinda looked and felt like plastic but I kinda wasn&#x27;t surprised they were very cheap</li>
            <li> For $3, I can&#x27;t complain!  I had no problems putting them on or taking them off.  I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> So to update my last post, I finally tried on the thicker ones and they are SO PERFECT. I get scared using something that thick because I dont like the dramatic look but it is not at all, its beautiful! Will def buy again ! :)</li>
            <li> I Love Them Came At A Great Time , There Easy To Put On Although Are A Little To Long But You Can Cut A Little Of For A Perfect Fit . I Love Them .</li>
            <li> I love these lashes! So much better than paying $10 a freakin&#x27; pair!! Really good quality and gorgeous lashes that last just as well as any lashes you would buy at the store!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product!!!!!! The simple ones are great for on the go cuteness and the thicker ones are great for parties, church, etc. Great product!!</li>
            <li> Where to start..? The lashes are nice. The thick ones are really dramatic, and they have a nice quality(ish).&lt;br /&gt;Natural: The natural lashes look nice and stay on well, my only problem was that the band was slightly white, so when you&#x27;re up close to someone, I&#x27;m afraid that they will see the band. Of course, if you know what you&#x27;re doing, you can cover the band up some without much problem.&lt;br /&gt;Dramatic: The dramatic lashes are slightly heavy and have a thicker band than the natural ones. But I&#x27;m sure that would make sense because they are thicker. I also didn&#x27;t have a problem with the band on the thicker lashes, the band was completely black; which would make it hard to get them to blend with your lashes if you weren&#x27;t planning on wearing any black liner under them.&lt;br /&gt;Quality: They&#x27;re quite obviously synthetic, when I first got them, I thought there was absolutely no way that these lashes would blend with my own, but I was happily proved wrong. All it really took was a good eyelash curler and a thin coat of mascara and everything blended nicely.&lt;br /&gt;When I got the lashes in the mail, the box was all crumbled and smashed, and slightly wet because it had been raining for a week straight. However, everything was okay, none of the lashes were damaged, though, they were flattened, so it made it harder to glue them on without extensive bending. But what can you expect? They&#x27;re coming from another country. They&#x27;re going to take damage.&lt;br /&gt;One down side of ordering these, is that it took a good month and a half for me to get them, but for free shipping and only 2 dollars, I think that&#x27;s a steal!&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would recommend these to anyone who is trying to figure out how to use lashes (beginners), or anyone who uses fake lashes on more than one occasion.</li>
            <li> Expected more but like price</li>
            <li> very fast service nice quality extremely long though</li>
            <li> The thick lashes are really thick and difficult to bend to my eye.  I found they work well if I trim them and cut them in half and apply two pieces to each eye.  The thin ones work well.  They are long.</li>
            <li> Awsome eyelashes I love them and will forever order from you the price if a steal. People this was ordered to me in great condiciones I was afraid but now I can see I don&#x27;t have to worry about my orders becoming a nightmare return lol</li>
            <li> Really this lashes are good for any occasion. I use the natural looking ones  more often, but if you&#x27;re daring than the thicker false lashes are a must have :)</li>
            <li> Only to have fun in one time use</li>
            <li> Awesome lashes easy to use and long lasting. They didnt irritate my eye and I got my monies worth. I love it!</li>
            <li> They are not to bad. They work out for my fx makeup. Like how I got 2 diffrent kinds. Not a bad buy.</li>
            <li> I did get all 20 lashes it just took a while to come I thought it would come the same time as my other orders but came a week later over all I love the lashes and I do recommend this supplier</li>
            <li> I love these lashes. they are really easy to take the glue off. i prfefer the thick ones.Love Love Love</li>
            <li> These Lashes Are Horrible, Very Plastic, Doesn&#x27;t Stick, I Threw Them All Away!</li>
            <li> I Love these! Great quality and the price is amazing for 20 pairs of lashes. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> For 1 dollars they were great.</li>
            <li> I really really really like these eyelashes  They look so natural and the size is perfect. I would defiantly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Very cute.  The natural ones ARE just that...not too noticable. The thicker ones are perfect.  They aren&#x27;t too thick or too long.  Great for the money.</li>
            <li> I received my order within a week, however I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the product.  I won&#x27;t be ordering again.  The lashes are very hard &amp; irritated my eyes.  The lashes do not bend very well so it is extremely difficult to keep them curved to the shape of your eyes.  Some of the lashes also had a white line on the outside band.  Had to find some liquid black eyeliner to cover the white.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Came early than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Great for everyday makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Fits perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;There are these little things sticking out on the sides of the lashes that are supposed to hold the lashes in the box, but I had to cut it off with scissors.&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for a natural look, they aren&#x27;t natural looking.</li>
            <li> You do need to trim but they arr great I just wish they got my order right. I contacted them and they are in the process of fixing it. I hope to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> the eyelashes arent made with real hair or anything like they feel very plastic like but i like how full they are. the fact that there are a bunch of them is awesome.</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 sets of these over time, being 60 pairs of lashes. For 60 pairs, paying right around 5$ is definitely is good deal. They are easy removing and reusable. I always receive them earlier than it claims on the item, so satisfied with that as well. They might not be top notch quality, but for the price, they are definitely worth it. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> They seem flexible and somewhat easy to work with, but the image is deceiving. The &amp;#34;Thick&amp;#34; eyelashes look more like feathers than what is shown in the picture. I guess not the end of the world for $2.00. I thought I would give these a shot for the price before buying the expensive ones since I wear falsies on a daily basis. As long as you don&#x27;t load them with too much mascara each you should be able to re-use for several days.</li>
            <li> they dont look as natural as i&#x27;d like but i do the best that i can with them, i wouldnt order them again</li>
            <li> As long as you cut the &amp;#34;stringy&amp;#34; ends off, they work just fine. They do not come with glue. Over all I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but they don&#x27;t seem to be lasting very long. however it is a good thing that there is 20 pairs.</li>
            <li> Thick ones are stiff and nearly impossible to apply. But the natural ones are amazing, soo cheap but with fair quality</li>
            <li> I have used them and shared them. I will be getting more in the near future. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> This product worked really great for me , I love it . I didn&#x27;t have a hard time put them on .I like the way they were packet and how they  were tied from the back . I would recommend to buy this !</li>
            <li> They were hard to put on and didn&#x27;t stay for more than 5 minutes and  I suggest you add a small  6 oz bottle of glue I don&#x27;t want to use this product and the lashes look too fake please fix these things and I will buy them again</li>
            <li> Great amount for a great price. Received item within a good amount of time. Overall i am pleased with my service.</li>
            <li> Oh I just love this product sooooooooo much.  I will be purchasing this always.</li>
            <li> I order these all the time now. Sometimes some of the lashes will have weird glue on them or will be bent, but for the price these work really well. I use nail clippers to cut off the excess length, and tweezers to put them on with my eyelash glue. They do take a while to come in, so I normally order in advance before my others are too used.</li>
            <li> You have to curve the lashes to fit your eye prior to putting on this lash.  Nice and full though.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have much to say but bad quality and very cheap. the thick ones were unwearable (made you look trashy)</li>
            <li> These are nothing like you buy in the store but for a dollar I didn&#x27;t lose out at lest at all</li>
            <li> These are the most cheap eyelashes I have ever purchesd the quality is awful and I am not a person that normally wears eyelashes so when I get them they have to be good quality they are bone straight so its hard to put them on when good eyelashes curve JUS AWFUL</li>
            <li> So these people suck because I never recived the product. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY i wish i diddnt. Lame!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Makeup Forever, Revlon, ELF, etc, and these are certainly the best. Easily trimmed to your eye shape, and so cheap, you can buy multiple packs and not worry about having to reuse lashes. The fuller lashes don&#x27;t look that fake!</li>
            <li> Same issues here as with the other false eyelashes. Poorly made..not thick enough or long enough.fall apart quickly after wearing them once.</li>
            <li> Great eyelashes, will definitely be ordering more. Very good quality , now I can wear lashes everyday without spending so much $.</li>
            <li> These were bent and in terrible condition when I received them. I guess you get what you pay for. I will not purchase from the eyelash company afain. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes I love wearing and I will order them again! The came a week and a half early which is good, but my package was a little bent up. The eyelashes were in good condition though  :)</li>
            <li> these eyelashes look like the ones from walmart and i only have one complaint. they dont have any adhesive on the lash line... but other than that they are wonderful.. they have lasted me 3 months and i still have 17 pairs left.(:</li>
            <li> Much lighter and more natural than other lashes I&#x27;ve tried. The thinner pair is more natural, while the thicker pair is dramatic and luxurious. I would recommend these for creating a wide range of looks.</li>
            <li> Lasts me for a very long time and very easy to apply!  Had great variety on whether I wanted a natural look or more dramatic.  I highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> I WA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; S HAPPY TO SEE THIS  ALL THOSE EYE LASHES FOR THAT  LILLTLE BIT OF MONEY&lt;br /&gt;  WHEN I GOT THEM AND PUT THEN ON I LOOK  GREAT I BROUGHT A LOT&lt;br /&gt;  TO GIVE TO MY FRIENDS  AND TOLD THEM HOW TO GET THEIRS</li>
            <li> I love these false eyelashes they are the bomb.com especially for the price that they are I usually wear Kiss lashes but now I don&#x27;t anymore ... Good product besides the little white strip on the thin lashes you can&#x27;t remove it but other that that i would definitely buy these again ....</li>
            <li> Lashes arrived 2 weeks earlier than I was told it will get here by. The eye lashes are not natural or real looking at all. It feels heavy. I suggest not purchasing these eyelashes if you&#x27;re looking for an everyday or natural wear.</li>
            <li> They look like your trying to look like a plastic doll&#x27;s eyes.</li>
            <li> These are good eye-lashes. It did take around a week to come but that&#x27;s okay !! I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> They were okay I guess...for a drag queen....I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you are going for a more natural look</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are no good. I&#x27;m wondering if the other reviews are written by the company. They are made of a plastic material that is heavy on the eye. By hey ya get what you pay for right! I&#x27;ll try another brand and spend a little more.</li>
            <li> Good quality with cheap price. I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Bought these as a gift. The texture is somewhat rubbery which she wasn&#x27;t expecting but she ended up liking them because she can gently wash and reuse them and they last longer than traditional ones. The rubbery texture does make it a little harder to mold to the shape of the eye but overall great deal.</li>
            <li> The thin eye lashes are ok, but the thick ones were hard and stiff.</li>
            <li> Yes they are plastic and cheap but they come in cute little boxes. They are pretty long so you may need to adjust them if you have smaller eyes. I wasn&#x27;t able to get much use out of the mega super thick ones but i was able to wear the thin ones on a daily basis and they looked natural! I love it, would not buy again but i thoroughly  enjoyed and got max use out of this product. Not recommend for beginners bc you need some exp on blending them in.</li>
            <li> Completely not worth even the little money you pay. Can&#x27;t even use them!</li>
            <li> They are cute but they don&#x27;t really have a weft to put the glue on so they don&#x27;t stick as well</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I ordered , very good price, and fast delivery :-D very satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> Trying to take out of packaging a few of the eyelashes ripped off so bad I had to throw them away. The thicker ones don&#x27;t last anywhere near as long as the thinner ones do. You get what you pay for but I definitely prefer these over any I can buy at stores. Even with the minor defects I&#x27;ll be buying again.</li>
            <li> How can you complain about 20 pairs of false lashes for the price you&#x27;ll pay for one pair at Walgreens?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m all for natural looking lashes so I bought these expecting to give the dramatic set to my sister-in-law. But after trying the dramatic set, I think I&#x27;ll keep them too. They look a lot better (read: more natural) than when they&#x27;re sitting in the box. My only issue with the dramatic set is that I can&#x27;t wear my glasses with them because they&#x27;re too long. (Contacts are a must for them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any problem gluing them on like I read in other reviews. Remember to wait a few seconds for the glue to get tacky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: These don&#x27;t come with glue, you have to have your own. (But the listing doesn&#x27;t say that it does, so I don&#x27;t know why people were complaining about that either.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are sent from China, so expect a delay in the shipping. (i.e. Don&#x27;t buy these for a wedding you&#x27;re going to next weekend.) Mine took about three weeks to come in and now I know to restock three weeks prior to running out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I will never buy single sets of lashes again. Thank you again, Amazon!</li>
            <li> I need to get more of these, good quality but I trashed few pairs learning to put them on but they are really good for the price..</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for! They&#x27;re perfect! They&#x27;re simple and elegant and I love them very much.</li>
            <li> Omg I love these lashes!!!!!!!!!!!! When I got the package the boxes were smushed but the lashes were in perfect condition I love the I will diffidently be buying them again!!</li>
            <li> They were good lashes</li>
            <li> It came on time the Shipping was just right, was not sure when I got it but when I open, it is DEFINATELY like it is in the picture, DEFINATELY a good buy. I recommend it if you are a person who wear LASHES. Will last a long time, am glad I bought it. The other reviews convince me and I am satified. Will order again when these are finish...</li>
            <li> Eh, so-so..... they look a bit \\&quot;plasticy\\&quot;. They have to be trimmed. If you&#x27;re in a dark bar they look great. Don&#x27;t wear these around a chick you don&#x27;t like, you&#x27;re gonna get called a muppet.  For the money I spent, can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m disappointed. I&#x27;ll use them when I run out of the good ones.</li>
            <li> I am asian so they&#x27;re a bit long for me but these are fantastic falsies, just needs to trim them to fit my eyes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great I love them. Reusable and long lasting and so cheap</li>
            <li> The thin lashes are the best.. The thick ones are the worst! They poke my eyes so bad!</li>
            <li> I have bought more expensive ones in the past and I like them better than this, BUT considering the price was super cheap it&#x27;s a great deal. They are not curved like the more expensive ones but it&#x27;s not too hard to do it yourself just a little annoying. Also you have to cut the edges a little (you don&#x27;t have to) otherwise a little black piece sticks out on either end but depending on how you do your eyeliner that might be useful. I haven&#x27;t used the thicker ones yet but the thinner ones work well with my sparse and thin eyelashes. This doesn&#x27;t come with glue so you&#x27;ll have to buy it separately.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are rather big, You have to cut them of course. And these eyelashes are not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased as a gift for a family member, a makeup artist. She says the lashes were soft and great for general makeup application.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase these lashes again. I did not have a good experience with them. Even tho they&#x27;re cheap they aren&#x27;t worth the investment</li>
            <li> yes they are made out of some plastic like material. No they don&#x27;t look fake if you know how to do your makeup properly. They are LONG so if you don&#x27;t like long these aren&#x27;t for you..</li>
            <li> I will never buy these lashes ever again. The boxes came bent up which mess up the lashes . So many I couldn&#x27;t use</li>
            <li> I dont even wear them. The are horrible quality so the glue doesnt hold to them. But they did show up on time.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected. They work like regular other lashes when I put them on, so I&#x27;m not sure what people were talking about. I also find they&#x27;re more reusable than other lashes I&#x27;ve tried. Usually other lashes get gross after I wear them once, but these are fine.</li>
            <li> Loved them. Variety of dark and light lashes is always awesome and you cant ask for much more for the price! Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t but them. They take FOREVER to adhere to my eyes because they are heavier then real hair eyelashes. Packaging was pretty ridiculous but what can you expect when it&#x27;s coming all the way from Hong Kong. Even the box was in Chinese. Not worth waiting a month for.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re definitely not the kind you buy at a beauty supply store but they are exactly like the ones in the picture. I really like the thicker ones! They came a little late but the price is good so no worries!</li>
            <li> These work perfectly I couldn&#x27;t have asked for better lashes and they are so cheap, just try them you won&#x27;t  regret it unless you aren&#x27;t good at putting on lashes</li>
            <li> my wife uses them for school. you get 20 pairs for less than 3.00 dollars u can&#x27;t beat that.i would recommend</li>
            <li> Only 2.60 just awesome ...</li>
            <li> They came in and I was a little disappointed because they are plastic and very shiny. They don&#x27;t look natural at all but for $2 I shouldve known.</li>
            <li> these were not 4 me i don&#x27;t wear eyelashes these were 4 my grand daughter  2 school i have done this review before</li>
            <li> There good there&#x27;s nothing special about them, there eyelashes. They work like any other type of eyelashes. So get some if you want some.</li>
            <li> These lashes were great and I wear them everyday. I received them three months ago and I still have plenty unused. They arrived on time too.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes look like s***. They look cheap and are to long, they don&#x27;t fit across your lash line. When you put them on its more then obvious that they are fake. They took forever to get here, and when they finally got here they were smashed in a mail envelope and had Chinese writing all over it and it was labeled as a cellphone case,  not eyelashes. I might as well have flushed three bucks down the toilet, they are a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Just received my eyelashes in the mail. I ordered these July 23rd, delivery estimate was August 18th, &amp; I got them today, August 4th. Packaging is cardboard &amp; a little crushed, but no worries. Eyelashes were intact. (: I&#x27;ve already tried on one of each style without glue to trim them. Each one has excess band on each end of the lash. I assume it&#x27;s to keep the lashes firmly in place. It&#x27;s tough to trim with my dull nail scissors, but only took 3 squeezes &amp; they&#x27;re trimmed. I imagine it&#x27;s much easier when they&#x27;re sharper. The first style looks dramatic, but it looks lovely on the eye. The crowd favorite is the second, more natural style. Very pretty. I&#x27;ll update this when I try them on with glue &amp; see how they wear. Overall, a great lash. Very happy so far. Only giving it four stars because I haven&#x27;t tried them on with glue yet. Hope you enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick Tip for Application:&lt;br /&gt;(I saw a lot of people complaining about how they don&#x27;t stick to the curve of the eye)&lt;br /&gt;- Make sure while you&#x27;re waiting the 15 seconds for the adhesive to dry, grab the lashes by both ends &amp; wiggle them back &amp; forth into a U-shape. It will help them apply much easier.&lt;br /&gt;- Always stick the middle to your eye FIRST, then the back, &amp; then the inner tear duct.&lt;br /&gt;- For more tips or how to apply them, check YouTube. There are hundreds of videos for applying eyelashes.</li>
            <li> They came on time but the boxes were squished inside of a package which I know wasn&#x27;t the shippers fault.But I bought three sets of theses(I got 6 boxes and 60 pairs in all) but I only got 1 box of the thick ones and 5 of the natural ones.When I should have gotten three boxes for each style.I also thought these were human hair but they appear to be plastic.Lets see how they look though...</li>
            <li> I guess quality is ok for what i paid.</li>
            <li> I liked the price the most and I do like the lashes. The strip is long which can be trimmed to fit any size eyelid. I would recommend this product bc you can&#x27;t beat the price and they look just like the ones you buy at department stores for 3 or 4 times the cost of these.</li>
            <li> These are great if you like having long eye lashes. They make your eyes pop.</li>
            <li> AWFUL, terrible quality. DO NOT bother putting these on your face. There are halloween brands that you can purchase at the corner store that are better quality than these. Also, by the time you receive them from overseas, you could have just driven and bought a better quality yourself. Dont be swayed by the price like I was. Sure, I got a lot for a little, but I got a lot of GARBAGE. Luckily for me, mine came in such awful packaging that all the lashes were crushed, so I couldnt attempt to use them even if I was desperate. They literally look like little pieces of bottle cap plastic.</li>
            <li> i like them they are okay i just wish they were more flexible and i wish that it also came with glue T-T but i love the thick one :D</li>
            <li> Horrible! The won&#x27;t bend so they don&#x27;t stay on because they&#x27;re to stiff. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I Love How They Are Packaged And That There Are So Many For A Nice Cheap Price.. BUT.. They Are Very Hard And Uncomfortable And I Do Not Like How You Have To Cut Off The Little Wings At The End.. Other Then That, They Were Okay..</li>
            <li> Not worth it. Pay for the good ones.</li>
            <li> they look and feel fake</li>
            <li> ive been telling others about theses lashes, they were such a great deal and im very happy with them I will definitely be buying these again!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy these unless you plan on giving them to a bunch of three year olds for dress up for a playdate they&#x27;re very poorly made they look cheap and they&#x27;re not worth even the effort of trying to put them on your eyes not worth my time and effort to try to return them I will just give them to my niece to play with</li>
            <li> Its okay for the price. I wear it when i can.</li>
            <li> The service is so great I wasnt expecting to get the lashes for about 30 days since they were shipping from Hong Kong, but I got i lashes today a week after my order, super fast was very pleased with that. The lashes are great, they even fit my eyes perfectly so i didnt have to cut them to size. overall im very happy with everything. ooh and the price is so amazing well worth it.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous!! Fashionable</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s pretty good. They arrived early and they are really cheaply made but considering your only paying a few dollars it&#x27;s not a bad deal. If your looking for high quality lashes these are not it. I liked them for just everyday use and use my other lashes for another time.</li>
            <li> Long dramatic lashes! Exactly what I wanted! These are perfect! Great buy for a good price for 20 pairs! I am very satisfied. They make me feel classy when I have them on. They are long and full. Very, very good! Thanks!</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are simple and easy to use, They are plastic feeling then the more expensive brands so you will have to bend them and work with them a bit before you apply them but overall they are good eyelashes. The shipping does take some time so if you need them in a hurry I would look for a different set of eyelashes.</li>
            <li> they are okay havent worn them yet becus I bought them because I am practicing putting my eyelashes on but the thick ones are really thick so i threw those away from the jump i dont even want to practice putting those on my face... NO SIR</li>
            <li> took along time to get! but also i couldn&#x27;t wear these because there made out of horse hair and im allegoric ! be careful if you have sensitive eyes. super cute though</li>
            <li> Love this!! I received my shipment in 4 days!!! Awesome lashes!!</li>
            <li> Wow, what a price. Arrived pretty fast. Easy to apply, they are a little thicker than I&#x27;d like but still very easy.</li>
            <li> They are very delicate to use</li>
            <li> I would give this product NO STARS if possible! Really long across and cheaply made and don&#x27;t stick well even with glue that normally sticks good with my walmart falsies. Look terrible</li>
            <li> These lashes are so tough to use. They are super low quality. Which explains the price. I&#x27;m disappointed, but I did some what expect them to be less than amazing. I didn&#x27;t expect them to be completely unusable. Not pissed over a couple of bucks, just don&#x27;t suggest you buy! DON&#x27;T BUY.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes. They&#x27;re pretty good quallity. I wear the natural for everyday and the fuller ones when going out. They&#x27;re easy to apply and last all day. I personally don&#x27;t reuse lashes, so for this price, it&#x27;s great for me to use them and toss them.</li>
            <li> They seem a little big at first and yes you have to cut the edges off because its held in that way. Its not a big deal for what you are getting. The shape of the lashes are beautiful.</li>
            <li> You Gotta trim em but they are great for on the go wear or evening wear.I ordered like 50 of them I like em</li>
            <li> these are pretty good lashes, for what i usd them for at least. these are not natural looking lashes at all, i use them for stage makeup, but they are cheap and pretty decent quality</li>
            <li> I mean their false eyelashes what else can I say,over all they come at a very great price and they serve the purpose.</li>
            <li> I got these lashes because they look really great but the shape of the lash where it attaches is just too straight.  I have had some issues attaching them because of the lack of a curve.  The Thicker ones look the best once you get them sized and on. The thinner looking ones (Style 2) really doesn&#x27;t do much unless you just don&#x27;t have eye lashes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently I am using these on clients as &amp;#34;throw away&amp;#34; lashes.  Just to see if they like to have false lashes on before I put the better ones on them.</li>
            <li> Im very unhappy. The box was crushed and smashed. There was no effort to protect the product. I like my bxoes to be neat and organized and its just a trainwreck that i dont want to deal w anymore</li>
            <li> But they&#x27;re plastic! The dramatic ones look extremely cheap, I used the natural ones and they looked nice. Also, the dramatic ones hurt your eyes...</li>
            <li> I did not like these at all!  They don&#x27;t look or feel like real lashes.  I will use them for holloween or allow the kids to play with them.  Dont wast your money on them.</li>
            <li> i like the thiner eyelashes but the thick onces are too hard and dont bend to fit your eyelash shape</li>
            <li> they sent me two of the thin eyelashes they dont give you what you see in the picture im not happy at all!</li>
            <li> These lashes shipped out super fast to me from HK and arrived about a week or two, almost three weeks earlier than what was estimated. Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had time to actually try the lashes themselves on but I did have time to take a pair from each style and test them out a bit in terms of how the lash band flexes and feels.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I&#x27;ll get more use out of the more natural pair but I think that the thicker set will be awesome for costumes, parties, special events or for fun in general for when I want an extra oomph to my eyes. From what I&#x27;ve observed, they will give a really &amp;#34;dolly&amp;#34; effect.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, quality and quantity this product was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside was the shipping method. It came in a package with the two sets stuffed together so the boxes were kind of crushed but the lashes themselves were still in perfect condition so NBD.</li>
            <li> Shipping came in earlier than expected !! No boxes were crushed. I love the thick eyelashes ! Makes your eyes really pop out ! My order was all correct and I think it is totally worth it for the price ! What more can you ask for?! It was very easy to put on. You just need to cut off the ends because thats the part holding the lashes in its spot. Looks very NATURAL .Its also good to reuse for a little while also! I am satisfied with my purchase and will DEFINITELY purchase these again in the future ! :) &amp;&amp; I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERY FALSE EYELASH LOVERS ! ;) *5 stars*</li>
            <li> I bought these because i wanted 20 eyelashes. I got them just in time for a photo shoot which came put perfect! They are a little hard to get on but other than that these eyelashes look natural and cute. If you want something cheap then buy them and they came all the way from Hong Kong!!! How cool is that !</li>
            <li> Horrible lashes are basically plastic. No real feeling at all</li>
            <li> worth the money were for five day and replace them the thicker ones are much better the the thin ones cant see them</li>
            <li> I love these eyelashes! I started buying them when they used to be 1.50, but now the prices are rising. It takes a little while to ship but it&#x27;s totally worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear the thick eyelashes and I love how they&#x27;re short near the corner or the eye and towards the outer part, it gets longer. Giving it a little flattering, cateye, look. I use the thinner lashes when I&#x27;m looking for a more natural look but the thick ones looks pretty normal for me. Haha. I always buy more when I run low, it&#x27;s a great price for 20 pairs! Super satisfied as a returning customer. Must buy if you&#x27;re looking for both kinds of eyelashes :-)</li>
            <li> The way they came in the mail was horrible all the eyelashes where out of place the box they came with was bent and smashed. One out of the 20 eyelash came out bad the lashes where not on right and fell off, 10 are thick and 10 are daily use eyelashes (thin) they arrived to Illinois in 16 days: I would had gave it 5 stars but the way they arrived was horrible. And it does not come with a glue or has any stickiness on the eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Lift up quickly on the eyelid, I feel like I need to super glue them haha. But you get what you pay for. Not for all day wear, I use these for short photoshoots on my clients.</li>
            <li> came on time. the eyelashes look just like the picture, all of them were there. the only thing is that theyre long and basically identical on both sides , so make sure you put the right eyelash on the right eye, and trim them right to fit.</li>
            <li> Really love these lashes. Just got them today &amp; they came almost two weeks early! Really excited to use them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so experienced with fake lashes, but I bought these because they were cheap and there is alot and I need some longer lashes for my first few cosplays. They look good, my only complaint is that when they were packed, the send put the two boxes ontop of each other crushing a few of the top lashes and making them deformed. I don&#x27;t throw out things like this, I&#x27;m just going to use the deformed ones as smaller single lashes and cut them up.</li>
            <li> Good eyelashes. They are big so I cut mine. Other wise I like them.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! They look so beautiful and so real. They are kind of long. You have to cut to adjust, but other then that, great lashes.</li>
            <li> The product itself is amazing. They are easy to place and this was the first time I used eyelashes and I&#x27;m glad it was these. The reason I gave it a four is because it took 1 1/2 months to come when it was supposed to be two day shippig.</li>
            <li> Sorry but they do not feel good on my eyes and are very hard to put on because of the plastic material feel to them. I still have all of the 19 pairs in a drawer...lol</li>
            <li> my goodness, these are dramatic! I&#x27;ve worn some of the thick pairs, after cutting the edges to fit they&#x27;re pretty great... just VERY dramatic lel</li>
            <li> a+ my girl friend loves them!!!</li>
            <li> These are my first lashes I&#x27;ve ever wore they feel good don&#x27;t bug u aren&#x27;t much longer than my lashes beautiful they make your lashes look flawless and even ! I cut them a little but looking back didn&#x27;t need to for my eyes I have almond shape and they are perf</li>
            <li> The eyelashes don&#x27;t look natural like you would want them to look. Not a great buy.</li>
            <li> Great value. I&#x27;m only giving a 4 star because I have not used the light lashes yet.</li>
            <li> Wow what a deal !! Why pay high prices in store these are great . The shipping was faster than expected!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for i guess. I found these hard to put on because they come pretty straight &amp; they really have no curve to them . So the corners would tend to lift almost immediately. Also they took forrrreevvveeerrr to arrive.</li>
            <li> They are OK but the eyelashes fall off easily.</li>
            <li> THERE OKAY FOR THE PRIZE</li>
            <li> These are terrible and they don&#x27;t look anything like the picture.</li>
            <li> Works well if you can stand the shipping time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay. it can look kind of cheap/ghetto/ratchet. the thinner ones look nice when you wear them with minimal makeup. if youre going for over the top drag then go for it, but if you want a classier look, just wear thin, wispy lashes. somtimes i cut the thinner ones in half to use them as demi lashes. if you treat  them well then they will each last 3 or 4 times. take them off with makeup remover and clean after wearing. dont leave the glue on them!&lt;br /&gt;also, the band is very thick. extra noticeable. wear thick eyeliner</li>
            <li> Cheap and easy to put on!</li>
            <li> Love them but they&#x27;re flimsy 😷</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the thick ones only the regular size. Not sure what happen but these will do for the holiday.</li>
            <li> They are as good as any otherfake lashes at such a cheap price, I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> For 20 pairs of eyelashes for under three dollars I am satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product! I have a choice of which pairs I want to use and have enough for later.</li>
            <li> So yes, you get a lot for the amount you pay but the lash bands are so stiff and thick that it was incredibly difficult to glue them on. Mind you, I softly bent each one I tried to put on for at least 2 minutes and STILL struggled with getting them to stick. I attempted to use 6 pairs overall (3 natural, 3 full) and never really got them to look right. I used both the Revlon Precision Lash Glue and Duo Eyelash Adhesive. None did the trick and I believe it was entirely due to the stiffness of the band. Not worth the purchase at all.</li>
            <li> Love these for my sfx makeup collection will buy again</li>
            <li> They are uncomtable. Looks and feels cheap right away. I wouldnt recomend these. They are not flexible. I thought i should buy them because of the price but i rather buy the ones from walmart.</li>
            <li> IF you are looking for everyday throw away lashes, then this is your item. they wer enot the best quality but for the price and the amount you receive its awesome.</li>
            <li> bought these as a gift for my granddaughter who is just starting to experiment with make-up. She loved them and even ordered another set recently....and what a great price!</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my niece and she loved them.  They arrived soon and I will recommend them for the quality and price.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes came in a pretty fair amount of time and although the package looked damaged the eyelashes were unharmed. They aren&#x27;t natural looking and take some getting used to the plastic band feel but other than that it is great to have a bulk of do able lashes ready for you at hand</li>
            <li> Just got these in today and they are a complete disappointment. First off, the eye lashes came in a squished up box and some of them were damaged and un-useable. And yes, they&#x27;re very cheap price wise but the pictures do not justify what the product actually look like in person. They look very plasticy, horrible quality and look horrible on the eyes. I don&#x27;t recommend anyone even wasting their time and waiting 15 days for their product to arrive. Pay a couple of dollars more, and get something better.</li>
            <li> Well made. Paid $2 and can&#x27;t go wrong here! If you are looking for cheap lashes, these are them! You do need to trim them to fit your eye though as they are a bit long.</li>
            <li> The 2nd set of eye lashes, (the lighter colored) did not work. However the 1st set did. I am glad I ordored and woll ordor again.</li>
            <li> Great price for the amount off lashes.</li>
            <li> Cute look. But they come weirdly packaged and have no shape whats so ever! 😟</li>
            <li> Great for outings and parties. Good cheap alternative and reusable! Not recommend for school and work.  You get a lot for your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m IN love with these eyelashes! They are so fun to wear. The only issued I had was the stiffness, but you can usually fix it with an eyelash curler. Definitely will order again in the future!</li>
            <li> these are the best eyelashes I love the price &amp;  quality if you use with proper care  pretty fast shipping from china to san Francisco</li>
            <li> I like so much with low price</li>
            <li> These took way to long to get processed and shipped!! They are nice looking lashes but were a little to lengthy- very easy to cut and shorten to fit my eyes. The packaging could have been better too, sent in a tight, non padded envelope, which allowed one side of the box to get smashed and ruined a couple sets of lashes. Over all it&#x27;s a decent deal for what you pay for.</li>
            <li> For the price I can&#x27;t complain but you get what you pay for.  Poor quality compared to higher priced lashes.</li>
            <li> Got Them Early (: Beautiful Eyelashes ♡</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually do reviews, but these lashes were an amazing deal!! Considering they were coming from overseas, shipping was pretty quick...the lashes were boxed up, but the box was smashed in shipping, this didn&#x27;t stop the lashes from still being amazing though, especially for the price...personally I love both sets and plan on grabbing a couple more...they definitely hold up well to multiple uses too</li>
            <li> Great for begginers looking to learn how to apply false&lt;br /&gt;lashes without having to spend so much money to get&lt;br /&gt;anywhere near the amount you get here.</li>
            <li> Great for theatrical use as well as daily wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this item because I wanted an inexpensive alternatives to buying individually sold false eyelashes which range from $1.50 to $4.00 in my local beauty supply stores. This was definitely the great buy especially if you don&#x27;t mind the fair quality.  I would definitely recommend this item. Absolute re-buy!</li>
            <li> Crap quality. They are definantly from china  with the material used. Never buying this ever again. That&#x27;s for sure. Thanks</li>
            <li> one set are cute ,long and simple.which i love for day to day wear but the other ones!! i love! they are more dramatic..easy to apply and im a newbie! just practice practice practice! :) they dont look fake but they dont look real neither but.way better than what i expected for so little money! must get!</li>
            <li> I ordered these lashes about 3 weeks ago and they are nowhere to be found! Why does it take so long to arrive?! Or are they even going to arrive!</li>
            <li> Cheap looking and flimsy, very cheap plastic but will work for photos. I will never recommend theses for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I have been waiting over a month for my lashes. Checked my order and I have another month. The worst. After having to order the lashes a second time and having to still wait. Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> very nice, good quality lashes---- came MUCH later than expected, though. otherwise very nice. last about 5 wears. great for price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that I dnt agree with any of the reviews I read that influenced my purchase. I find these lashes to be extremely stiff and itchy.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t like regular lashes with the glue. Im not even sure how to use these. There&#x27;s just like a string and it&#x27;s flimsy.</li>
            <li> I only wear these on occasions. They are very difficult for me as a newbie to put on, but the price is UNBEATABLE. Very happy with the quality for the price. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> eyelashes came in a timely manner....they look great!  My daughter wanted them because she was not blessed with long eyelashes and this came at a great time because she is graduating 8th grade and wanted a lil extra eyelash when she dresses for her graduation, not to mention they look full and beautiful, cannot wait till we use them and trust me, they can last more than a year with the set that comes together!  Happy as can be!</li>
            <li> I was supposed to receive 10 natural &amp; 10 dramatic. I received only the natural ones but nice quality 4 the price ! :-)</li>
            <li> They do not look nice at all. I will not be wearing them at all. They look very costume-y. The good thing is that they were very cheap.</li>
            <li> Very fake looking but good for the price.</li>
            <li> Horrible quality! Plastic material,  not worth it.</li>
            <li> They are nice lashes. The problem for me was the stiff band made it so they would pop up on the ends worse than most eyelashes do. The price was right so I am not complaining. I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> They are gorgeous! i like them a lot. totally worth buying. :) i got them so late though. I like how they look natural</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS BUY THESE LASHES, I LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li> Neither are real hair, in case anyone was wondering; but I&#x27;ve used fake eyelashes for years so these were fairly simple to use. If you are a beginner with false lashes I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend these because they are a little stiff to work with. I did take a star away because these didn&#x27;t arrive in a box of any kind. They simply put they lashes into an envelope and sent it. Thankfully they weren&#x27;t damaged but that might not always be the case. Overall it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Loved them! A bit plasticky but awesome! Love the natural style ones!</li>
            <li> I Love these lashes!!! Great lashes for dirt cheap!! You can&#x27;t beat that!!! I Love them!!!</li>
            <li> Stiff as hell save ur money or you will look like a broom</li>
            <li> Cheap so worth it but they are hard to work with because the band is a bit stiff and thick. But if you love dramatic lashes and are good at applying them then these are great! But since i suck at applying lashes and there a bit too dramatic i use these only to practice applying !</li>
            <li> The eyelashes work really well and I&#x27;m very pleased with them. The only problem I found wrong when it was delivered was that it was in an envelope so the boxes for the eyelashes were snooshed a bit . Other than that, it&#x27;s exactly how I expected it to be . The thin ones are for every day  use for me and the thick ones are for the nights I go out . Again, very pleased :)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re too straight.</li>
            <li> The eye lashes were all bent and messed up when I got them in mail and it took forever to get them. WAste of money. All of the lashes were messed up</li>
            <li> They box they came in was a little smooshed but other than that the eyelashes are okay for the price I paid. I will buy them again once im done using the others.</li>
            <li> OMG I love these. I REFUSE TO GO TO THE HAIR STORE TO BUY LASHES WHEN I CAN GET THEM WHOLESALE ON AMAZON FOR THE LOW LOW !!! I Get SOOOO Many Compliments on my lashes. If you wanna see them, follow me on instagram @therealmawilson</li>
            <li> A great set of lashes. The thinner set is perfect for everyday. Easy to put on</li>
            <li> For the price I paid I am really impressed! (Does not come with glue though) I bought some glue at walmart and put these on and they lasted all day. They are long so that you can trim them to fit your eyes which is good so I cut mine to where they looked natural. This is the first time I am using fake eyelashes and I am so glad it turned out good!</li>
            <li> I really like these for the very cheap price I wasn&#x27;t so sure about them but since they have a very thin band they are soo easy to apply. A little plastic looking but a little mascara fixes that. Can&#x27;t go wrong withe the price</li>
            <li> Like them a lot and very cheep</li>
            <li> Very pretty! . Awesome looking!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my granddaughter to use at college.  She does the makeup for her drama class.  Very good price and good quality.</li>
            <li> Love them! They are beautiful and wear just as good as a $14 pair of lashes! Such a great deal!</li>
            <li> they look good once you get them on! ONCE YOU GET THEM ON!</li>
            <li> S***tiest thing I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
            <li> Both packages were damaged and no matter what adhesive I&#x27;ve tried they will not hold form and stay in place. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear lashes but my friends do. They love them so i guess it was worth it. worth the price.</li>
            <li> The only thing i didnt like, was the thicker ones.&lt;br /&gt;They are too fake. doesnt look real,. unless you can pull it off.&lt;br /&gt;dont recc.</li>
            <li> box came a little smushed but the eyelashes are great !!! a great buy for only one dollar. buy while you can!</li>
            <li> I like these lashes; however, I&#x27;m a little disappointed in the texture of the lashes. I was looking forward to something more real-lash-like. But, I like them! And you also see in the picture exactly what you&#x27;re getting. Thanks, again!</li>
            <li> These lashes are exactly like the picture shows!!! The only problem I had is that it didn&#x27;t get shipped the day it said it was. Overall I love them and can&#x27;t wait to put them!! I recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> The lashes are poor quality and too thick. Ive tried several times to put them on but they will not stick. do not buy!!</li>
            <li> When I wear them they look natural and everyone believes they&#x27;re my real eyelashes. Although, some hairs off the lashes were missing, so I ended up throwing some away. Was very good for the price in the end.</li>
            <li> They were horrible! They are thick and plastic looking. Not at all like I expected. Ill never buy another pack. I&#x27;m not even going to use the ones I have.</li>
            <li> If you are experienced in using lashes then these lashes are wonderful. I had to cut off the excess material on the lash line but that&#x27;s about it. I thought they were going to be hair like but they ARE formable plastic. Outside of that they are a good buy. I never got a tracking number btw. They just showed up about 2 weeks after I ordered them. Orginal shipment date was supposed to be 2 weeks after I actually received them.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my granddaughter.  I just got an &amp;#34;Oh, grandma!&amp;#34; from her when she tried them.  I didn&#x27;t think they looked bad, but she didn&#x27;t really care for them.  But then, for the price....I think they&#x27;re fun.</li>
            <li> These are plastic and not fiber material.did not have a natural look to them at all. Would not purchase again</li>
            <li> Eyelashes were a little flimsy. Other than that it arrived right when it said it would. Also no glue or any adhesive come with it.</li>
            <li> the price is very affordable, but you do get what you pay for in a way, awesome for special makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this eyelashes they are easy to put in. the only negative is that it does not bring the glue but oh well</li>
            <li> cheaply made too plastic-y feeling dont look natural not really satisfied with this purchase at all. . . . . .</li>
            <li> This product took a very long time to get to me and the packaging was a little damaged but the actual product is fine and was what was needed.</li>
            <li> Lashes are ok. Hard to put on the dramatic ones so I just use the natural ones. You can kind of see the band of the lash though.</li>
            <li> They arrived before due date. I like the think set for going out and clubbing but the regular natural are a lil thin but I&#x27;ll still wear both sets...</li>
            <li> Well i actually got these for my niece , Who i have not sent them to yet they seem okay, great for the price, so hopefully they work out for her.</li>
            <li> I love this they are easy to put on and I have been able to recycle them lol I used one pair 3 times and they still look prettty &amp;#60;# them them I even told my sis to get some her self</li>
            <li> These are the worst false lashes I&#x27;ve ever seen or *tried* to use. They&#x27;re stiff and seem to be made of cheap plastic, like something you&#x27;d get out of a gumball machine. The glue slid right off. I never could get them to stick. The glue just wouldn&#x27;t get tacky. What a waste. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> When they arrived I was very please with the quality . Eye Savvy I must say if you are one that has to have her long eyelashes well order them here you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> The more subtle lashes are pretty nice and blend in really well. I like to cut them in half and just stick them on my outer corners. They bend to the curve of your eyelid. The dramatic lashes, however, don&#x27;t. They&#x27;re very stiff and don&#x27;t shape well to the lashline. The cut is very straight and all the lashes are the same length which makes them look very clownish, not beautiful and dramatic. I cut them in half and use them just on my outer because they definitely don&#x27;t look good whole. It helps to bend them and curve them before you put them on. Overall a pretty good deal, though!</li>
            <li> These are too stiff, but they are pretty. They take a little longer than usual to put on as they are stiff and straight. They don&#x27;t have the natural curvature that other lashes have.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give em another whirl and maybe this time they will be better.&lt;br /&gt;I have a neutral feeling towards these.</li>
            <li> The thick eyelashes would be great for Halloween or to possibly look like a Jersey Shore member....I would wear them out to a club, but prob not just going for a low key evening.  Cheap and worth the money...had no issues wearing/applying either.</li>
            <li> I love the eyelashes.  They&#x27;re perfect.</li>
            <li> I love them. Always order these!!! Can even be reused. Well worth the price. Took like 3 weeks to receive in Florida</li>
            <li> Perfect price! You will have to cut off the edges, but for this price who cares? Someone came up to me and asked me if they were real. Wear them with black eyelash glue! Wonderful. 10/10 do recommend.</li>
            <li> I like my pairs regular long and thick eyelashes by DPNY</li>
            <li> Loveeee Them ! I wear them everyday!</li>
            <li> Great deal on amazon as always,grwat qualit.</li>
            <li> For costume/ dress up only. Packaging all bent. Won&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> The lashes are plastic!</li>
            <li> Not the best quality I would recommend red cherry lashes!!</li>
            <li> Did not like them at all. They look really fake and cheap to be honest but they are cheap so I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> has a plasticy feel at first but with extended wear the shine goes down and the shape relaxes to your eye. the look gorgeous on me and everyone always compliments my eyes!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Style number two looked more realistic to me than style one. I you are looking or a good pair of cheap lashes then go for these or just pay more at a more popular store like Sephora or Mac.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get these since you really can&#x27;t beat the price. Huge disappointment. The lashes were super plastic. Did not look real at all. That is the point of fake eye lashes to look real and pretty. These were plastic and you can definitely tell against your regular eyelashes. I normally wear mascara over my fake eyelashes to make them blend better with my real ones... with these plastic eye lashes this was impossible to do.  Wore 1 pair and threw the rest in the garbage. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> cold not get them to stay on.</li>
            <li> You get what you see, and they are decent in quality. The price is very good for what they are and free shipping. I would have to say the best part is they are neatly boxed as in the picture.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty good and they look nice when put on and one pair can be used multiple times :3 haven&#x27;t had a problem yet</li>
            <li> As I don&#x27;t really know how to apply these eyelashes without the proper tools, I must say that I must wait to utilize them&lt;br /&gt;and then write the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renee Evers</li>
            <li> Very hard/stiff lashes. Can be cut to fit eyes. Won&#x27;t wear these daily because they are very costumey, instead I&#x27;ll be ok on Halloween lashes for the rest of my life!!</li>
            <li> I love the lashes. Not too thick. I have not used them however, I love what I see so far</li>
            <li> They look good in the picture but when I finally got them (3 months later)... They look cheap and horrible. I just threw them away, I didn&#x27;t even bother to put them on. They don&#x27;t look real, they look too shiny and hard and plastic. Fake eyelashes shouldn&#x27;t look fake on your eyes! They should blend in, otherwise you&#x27;d be looking pretty ratchet. DONT BUY THEM. Get the more expensive ones... they pay off in the end!!</li>
            <li> Stiff lashes... Which makes them pop up in corners of eye</li>
            <li> Cute natural and glamorous look! Great deal and quality. Will purchase these again and again :)</li>
            <li> So yeah, they weren&#x27;t that great but I guess that makes sense for the price that they were. Not a good buy</li>
            <li> The Strips are thick they don&#x27;t stay on well also they are heavy uncomfortable . I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money , take my word for it .</li>
            <li> I can alter these to fit my eyes, but they lay flat, and it&#x27;s hard to get them to stay put because they aren&#x27;t very flexible. But if you can keep them bent, maybe tie them around a ping pong ball or something until you&#x27;re ready to use them.. than it&#x27;s a great deal. Lol.</li>
            <li> very low price and so the quality is not very good.  may not purchase it any more. a a a</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received these, the lashes are just what I wanted. These lashes look great on me, I&#x27;d definitely purchase more!! love love love(;</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy again and very happy with the lashes even if you can only use them once they are worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victoria</li>
            <li> I bought these to help me practice putting on lashes. These are super long so you will have to cut them to fit your eyes just like any pair of lashes.I bought 2 sets of these lashes so I got 40 pair! The only con is that they shipped on June 22nd and arrived on July 21st. So it took 4 weeks to receive these. Great bang for your buck. These are also perfect for Halloween.</li>
            <li> They are the best investment I have made yet. No point on buying pair after pair when you can get them all in one shot. I was worried the thick lashes would be too dramatic for my little eyes but they look FAB !</li>
            <li> Best deal comparing that it&#x27;s $6 a pair in stores, they all came when expected, &amp; they all look perfect</li>
            <li> Terrible quality no wonder they were 2 dollars. They like plastic I won&#x27;t order these again. Afraid to even try them</li>
            <li> THESE EYELASHES ARE A LITTLE THICKER THAN I AM USED TOO, HOWEVER THEY ARE WORKABLE, I STILL LOOK GOOD IN THEM....</li>
            <li> I love these eyelashes. Since I have tried only one pair, they are comfy and feel like they aren&#x27;t there. They did come a lil cheaply made. Works for a great price through!!!</li>
            <li> These lashes are the best ever. Light weight &amp; easy to apply. It takes a bit of time for them to arrive but, it&#x27;s was well worth the wait. Definitely a great item to add to my personal &amp; professional makeup kits.</li>
            <li> Would have been nice....but they were all smashed up and distorted when they arrived. Only able to use half of them.</li>
            <li> These lashes are very stiff along the lash line, so they don&#x27;t contour to my eyes very well and are unconfortable</li>
            <li> I thought they were a bit stiff. But after I put them on I loved them! You can get multiple wears out of one pair. I would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I received them earlier and in good conditions. The only bad thing is that aren&#x27;t to flexible and where you put the glue is really hard. I don&#x27;t regreat buying it.</li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to eyelashes, I decided to try these because of the low price, well I was not disappointed I am wearing them to a very special event and can&#x27;t wait! They are plush, soft and very natural looking.</li>
            <li> are very suitable for me! Thank you for the affordable price and &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34;! Perfect for the &amp;#34;budget&amp;#34; my. Thank you again!</li>
            <li> Just as good as the MAC lashes... They look natural and for the price...perfect.  I recommend...</li>
            <li> shipping takes a while and unable to track were the item is at. Other than that its a great christmas gift for my friend.</li>
            <li> Felt like plastic  wouldn&#x27;t conform to my lid</li>
            <li> I get compliments on them, so that&#x27;s good! They thicker ones don&#x27;t bend well, but I guess I could cut them and attach them in sections. The other ones are so flimsy, i shared both with my sister, and she got a wear each out of them. definitely only a one use product. but that&#x27;s cool. for two bucks, and ten pairs each, that&#x27;s not too bad. but if you already have a favorite type, it can take some getting used too. they are fun to play around in though!</li>
            <li> The thicker lashes work really well for photos or events, whereas the more natural ones are suitable for daily wear. Although you have to tweak these lashes a bit before use, I am overall happy with the product.</li>
            <li> These lashes are tough to put on. They definitely need to be bent or at least held together end to end so that they curve to the shape of your eye.</li>
            <li> Utter garbage don&#x27;t look real. They look so stupid when u wear them.</li>
            <li> I got these earlier than I expected, I love them😄</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable, not useable..&lt;br /&gt;price is cheap.. you get what you pay for :( save your money</li>
            <li> It took for forever to ship but other than that theyre ok .. i kinda gotta cut them a lil shorter and theyre hard to bend but you just gotta work with them better than buying expensive ones</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter because she needs them when she has dance performances.  She likes style 1 slightly better because they are fuller.  She is pleased with them.  Only thing she wished it came with a tube of eyelash glue.</li>
            <li> I am not a pro at putting on lashes but I think I am good enough too figure out that these are not good. The band is very stiff and will not bend too your eyes. The lashes are very plastic feeling and melt when you get near anything hotter then summer temps. Shipping also took 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Just what was expected!</li>
            <li> The thicker ones felt heavy on my eyelids and the thinner ones were the same length as my actual eyelashes. But you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> Some used and smashed /bent/ cricket</li>
            <li> Eyelashes are poorly packaged in a box that  was shipped crushed. The eyelashes are poorly made, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> These were perfect. Shipping took forever but it&#x27;s to be expected coming from another country.</li>
            <li> The picture and the product don&#x27;t match the eyelashes look like the ones children get from a 99 cent store or like a old rusty baby doll .&lt;br /&gt;I put two layers of each to make them look  more realistic.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery time took long. Too long.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the price they advertise</li>
            <li> I love the lashes.  The lighter ones are very natural feeling, and look great.  The darker pair I can&#x27;t wear as every day use, but they will come in handy if I go to dinner or out. Overall they are made great! I was leery because it was saying that it would take a month and half to ship-but I received mine in 2 weeks!  I did e-mail the seller asking why it would take so long to be shipped, (before I received my order) and they promptly got back to me and explained that it was because they are being shipped from Hong Kong.  Happy overall!</li>
            <li> My favorite eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;thick, beautiful, natural. long lasting&lt;br /&gt;i buy these every time i need lashes</li>
            <li> Took a very long time to ship, overall satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, there is nothing wring with these, but they are cheap looking and being plastic makes it harder to get them to flow with your real lashes.  But again, you get what you pay for.  Quality isn&#x27;t that great, but with 10 of each pair, its worth it if you just want to wear them occasionally</li>
            <li> I was definitely pleased with this product. These are definitely easy to use. I would definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE LASHES SO MUCH!!! These lashes are great and they fit me perfectly. Sometimes i don&#x27;t even wear makeup at all, I just wear the lashes. Even when I go natural with just the lashes, I still get tons of compliments. They blend well with my own eyelashes because I already have long curly eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Not worth it, the packaging around the eyelashes themselves was all busted up and broken</li>
            <li> these are beautiful exactly like the picture they arrived fast and they last! my wife loves them only issue is they get a tiny bit heavy after a while of wear she says. definitely will order more later!</li>
            <li> terrible quality. it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations</li>
            <li> Poor quality they look super fake</li>
            <li> awesome, I love these! :)</li>
            <li> They are a tad long one set is for more like costume but the others look great</li>
            <li> Do not buy. beyond flimsy and not cute. My wife clients was not pleased at all.</li>
            <li> the lashes are very stiff and are not easy molded to the eye lid. they are also not finished on the ends. you can&#x27;t just take them out of the box and put them on. they will need trimming. with all that the price is really good and the shipping did not take that long. you get 2 different lashes which I like for different looks. These would be really good for a beginner that wants lots of practice or for the Pro that knows exactly what to do.</li>
            <li> I love these eyelashes, I really like the thicker ones I&#x27;m more of a dramatic eyelashes fan so I&#x27;m really enjoying those , the thinner ones are also nice especially if you&#x27;re  someone who just likes the simple eyelashes look these are perfect for you.</li>
            <li> I ordered this like, a month ago and they still aren&#x27;t here.. but the price is great, so thats the only thing that&#x27;s working in their favor.</li>
            <li> Order arrived fast, good quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that stacking two of the thinner lashes give them a better look than wear one by itself. The thick lashes are alright too.</li>
            <li> Too long and just had a fake look then again I might just have the wrong shaped eye mine are shorter and very circle like.</li>
            <li> I know a lot about eyelashes and these were not up to par! The thin ones had a white strip on them so when you put them on you have to put a lot of eye liner and mascara over the white strip so it won&#x27;t show. Secondly, the strips was so hard and rough that it wouldn&#x27;t curve around your eyes. Very disappointed! I would give this item zero stars if amazon would allow it.</li>
            <li> While the product arrived about a month and a half after amazon said it would, it arrived nonetheless.  The product was exactly what I expected, and for the price, it is of decent quality. I originally rated it one star, but now that the product has arrived and I can see the quality, I would change my rating to three stars.</li>
            <li> Exactly as shown and described only thing is not very sticking very hard to put on your eyes. You get what you paid for</li>
            <li> perfect! so easy to apply! I was hoping they would both be the thick variety but no matter! I will order from them again.&lt;br /&gt;just be careful when putting them on. not enough glue can make them feel scratchy.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes!! I swear even tho they take a month to come cause they are coming from over seas I don&#x27;t mind! They always arrive at the date that is given. I placed 14 orders of these lashes just so I wouldn&#x27;t be reordering and waiting a month for them to come. I took advantage and ordered a good 14x2&#x3D;28 boxes of eye lashes lol&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit upset that some of the boxes came damaged but at the same time heck I didn&#x27;t even mind. What can you expect when you order as much as I did lol.&lt;br /&gt;Overall these lashes are great! They are good quailty I love how they look. I love how you can cut them to the right fit&lt;br /&gt;I am a very happy costumer &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Came on time, no issues.</li>
            <li> great price for so many lashes that would cost so much more in the store!! just buy the glue separately</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the thicker lashes but the smaller ones are very nice :) I really liked how long they are also. Very good quality for how cheap they cost :)</li>
            <li> These are just what i wanted and these are very good quality and ALOT better andcheaper than the ones at walmart</li>
            <li> Shipping was the only problem i had with this product i still gave it 5 stars because for the low price you pay to receive 2 packs of lashes is a really good deal! I didn&#x27;t mind the wait for the product , they are exactly what i was expecting . I normally buy from a retail store and they are S10.00 for 10 pairs of lashes , here they are WAY cheaper plus you get double! These here also have the more full look that are thick and the thinner more natural look. Which is ALWAYS a plus so you can switch it up sometimes as well! Great Product , Great Price!! Already recommending friends and i Will definitely be ordering more soon!!</li>
            <li> I love these eye lashes i  bought them 3 times</li>
            <li> I never tryed to use lashes before. I got them and love useing them. Great deal and came on time. I already ordered more great deal love them !</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money! These lashes don&#x27;t go on easily and don&#x27;t bend very well. The material the eyelash is made out of is itchy on your eyes and all in all just feels horrible.</li>
            <li> i love these lashes. i first used them during a dance recital that i had to do, and then, i also used them on my one sister that does modeling. i was so excited when they finally came.</li>
            <li> The lashes are great for the price I just don&#x27;t like that the way they are packaged some get bent and it&#x27;s hard to put them on when they&#x27;re bent all crazy but for the price I believe they are great!</li>
            <li> Very cheap. You cannot expect the best lashes at such a low price, so I&#x27;m not totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes look so plastic. They are not good do not buy them . It&#x27;s better to buy them in the beauty supply store because these are very hard . They do not look natural at all . You can tell that it&#x27;s fake ! do not order them</li>
            <li> the most loveliest lashes this will be the only one I get now on. so happy that I got  them.... yaaay</li>
            <li> Good price. Lots of lashes for the money.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are nice, but you&#x27;ll have to cut or trim them before applying. It is pretty tricky getting them on, but probably easier with practice. They took quite awhile to be delivered though, as they came from China.</li>
            <li> They are cheap and plastic looking. But what can you expect for the price. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. I&#x27;d rather spend the money at a store for nice ones.</li>
            <li> Not as natural as I wanted them to look!! Now I&#x27;m stuck with them and I can only wear them out!!</li>
            <li> Came just like it looks.  Measure and trim to your desired length. Some came in all bent out of shape so I had to toss a couple of them. Other wise product works likebit should. Love the cheap price</li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM!!&lt;br /&gt;I HAD TO RE-ORDER&lt;br /&gt;SOME MORE TO GIVE OUT TO&lt;br /&gt;MY DAUGHTER. THEY LOOK&lt;br /&gt;SO REAL, I RECOMMEND&lt;br /&gt;YOU TRY THEM YOU WILL&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THEM!!!</li>
            <li> The lashes are great especially for the price.  Some were a little bent when I recieved them but I was still able to wear most of them.</li>
            <li> I love this eyelashes, They are great, for different occasion, for the party, work, and every day! Very nice , I will order again.</li>
            <li> They are Ok. You do get what you pay for. They aren&#x27;t human hair, which isn&#x27;t surprising. But they last of you know how to work with lashes. If yours are more so straight when you put them on, just take a eyelash curler to them and they look pretty even though they don&#x27;t look as natural</li>
            <li> It came about a few days before the date it was suppose to rang to come from, which was great because I had forgotten I ordered these &amp; my rough week was instantly improved!&lt;br /&gt;They were sealed nice and tight, the boxes inside were fragile so they were a little rough, but none of the eyelashes were harmed, and a little rough is great considering how far they had to travel, with heavier packages!&lt;br /&gt;Product itself is amazing, don&#x27;t be intimidated by the exess threads on the sides, you&#x27;ll learn it&#x27;s a huge bonus!&lt;br /&gt;Also, their reusable if you treat them well.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended &amp; worth the wait!</li>
            <li> Love these eyelashes they are super versatile and sturdy the natural ones are perfect for every day. Very great price and the shipping time wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> They were ok but the majority of them were bent..I dont care too much for the thin ones tho&#x27;.,,overall they were just ok.</li>
            <li> They look very fake and shiny won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to insert pics for the review...but the regular lashes look pretty natural...the thick ones are pretty much for parties or dramatic makeup. They were easy to use,I just snipped the extra strips on the side,applied the glue,and then the lashes. My order did take a while,but I understood that it was coming from overseas....but, my order did come earlier then the shipping date!!</li>
            <li> Great one-use eyelashes for dramatic effect, use with glue and they stay on all day! I shared these with my coworkers on halloween and we all looked awesome</li>
            <li> Bottom line is you get what you pay for... I dint like either . But the natural lashes are okay.</li>
            <li> I wish there was an option to give 0 stars. I received this product with high hopes. Don&#x27;t get be wrong I wasn&#x27;t expecting high quality lashes but as soon as I saw the first box, (the natural side) I was shocked at how s***ty quality they were. Then I thought to myself what if I just try them on, it couldnt be that bad..... worst idea ever. The lashes would not stick to my lid for more that 5 minutes and I did used a high quality lash glue. I&#x27;m not going to bother with the other ones. I&#x27;m afraid this product ended in the garbage for me...</li>
            <li> Came super fast, the thicker lashes are way to shiny and plastic looking for me personally. But the thin ones are beautiful for a natural sort of look.</li>
            <li> Great lashes for the price. Like most had to cut to fit my eye but other than that  love them. Some days they would stay on up to 3 days. Will be purchasing again soon.</li>
            <li> When I received the box it was empty!</li>
            <li> They came and the were all over the package but they were all there and none were damaged. They look really nice on.</li>
            <li> Hard &amp; stiff but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Good product and worth the price!</li>
            <li> Almost like plastic so I was very thrilled... The thin ones there&#x27;s a white line so when you put them on you can tell there fake. I had to put black glue on it to cover it up.</li>
            <li> You get exactly what you see. They were easy to apply but I did have to do some cutting to make them fit.</li>
            <li> It took a month for these to arrive, but for the price, this is a great deal. I ordered two sets for my teen daughter, and she was so excited to have them.</li>
            <li> Terrible and cheap. Doesn&#x27;t look nice on your eyes at all.</li>
            <li> Absolutely happy with these lashes and for the price :)</li>
            <li> Suuuuuuper satisfied  they&#x27;re not the best quality but certainly not the worst for that price you&#x27;re getting an awesome deal. I wish I knew how to post a picture</li>
            <li> they are too flimzy and too fake to wear.</li>
            <li> Do not buy these lashes. you are better off buying beauty supply lashes. These do not shape to your eye. They feel like cheap plastic, I couldn&#x27;t even get them on</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE LASHES!!</li>
            <li> i hate them they are super stiff</li>
            <li> I love the length and thickness, but they are very cheaply made. Because of its stiffness they don&#x27;t like to stay put, and end up peeling off in less than an hour.</li>
            <li> Very low quality lashes even compared to inexpensive drug store off brands my wife has bought in the past to do in a pinch.  We didnt expect MAC brand cosmetics quality she usually buys but did expect a reasonably middle of the road and usable product and these are neither and wont purchase any of these again without a doubt.  In all fairness, they did arrive fairly quickly so the seller did his part and quickly to boot !</li>
            <li> Love these ! My new favorite lashes!! Already repurchased !</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE! last about 4 wears depending how good you are to them. Shopping took some time but was well worth the wait for the price. These don&#x27;t  look like shiny plastic and feel pretty good when on. You do want to use a good amount of glue on the edges where lashes tend to lift first.</li>
            <li> These are junk. Do not waste your money or time. They took about a month to get here, and my wife hates them. When she put them one, you can see the white fabric strip that they are attached too, which makes them look really fake. Trying to cover the white with eyeliner didn&#x27;t work either. She wears fake eyelashes when we go out, and she said &amp;#34;These suck. I would rather just use the ones from WalMart.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> kinda weird thicknesses. probably wouldnt ever buy again.</li>
            <li> These lashes are not what I thought they were at all. The are really shiny, stiff and just look very fake on. Did not like them at all</li>
            <li> they are really shiny, they don&#x27;t really look too realistic ,and they also don&#x27;t bend very well ,i wont be buying these lashes again .</li>
            <li> the lashes are non flexible and do not stick with eyelash glue properly. a waste of money and will not buy again</li>
            <li> It took almost a month for them to arrive. And the thick ones aren&#x27;t as thick as they look in the photo. I usually loves these but I do not like these styles. I will not be reordering.</li>
            <li> Came early, and just as expected. Second time buying these. LOVEEEE THEMMMM :)</li>
            <li> too plastic for m taste. the thick ones were just too much on m face the thinner ones were okay but I think ill stick to the real deal when it comes to lashes.</li>
            <li> I ended up using these only once or twice then threw them away. They were harder to put on than the other drug store ones.&lt;br /&gt;That being said I don&#x27;t wear lashes a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Shipping was on time</li>
            <li> I never received this! I&#x27;m sure I would&#x27;ve loved them but I never got them so therefore giving them 1 star even though I wish I could rate ZERO!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got these lashes I never wear them so I wanted to try them and it totally enhances ur look so hey try a box and practice they&#x27;re only a $1 and some change and when ur ready get some more when u get good</li>
            <li> Horrible and not comfortable</li>
            <li> Because theyer Awesome! I really love these eyelashes thank you soo much for letting me buy these. Thank you again!!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it didn&#x27;t come with eyelash glue and it took forever to come to my house</li>
            <li> They are okay, but they really just don&#x27;t want to stay on for very long. maybe an hour at the most.</li>
            <li> My sister asked me to buy this product for her, i do not know anything of false eyelashes but when i saw her using it, it made me want to use them too, look beautiful.</li>
            <li> Received these and love the look, Need practice putting them on.  Wish me luck that I don&#x27;t glue my eyes shut.</li>
            <li> I got these and they were thin and they were short..... nothing like what the picture says. NEver again. Sorry</li>
            <li> Just wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting they looked really really cheap,I won&#x27;t be buying agin but thank you.. Dana Marie</li>
            <li> Great for the money. Cut to fit eyes and you have a ton of lashes two different styles but great deal.</li>
            <li> These are great for if you want a dramatic look one day, and then natural the next. These were my first falsies, and I think they themselves are great. My glue sucks, so I haven&#x27;t been able to wear them out yet, but I think with some quality glue these would be fine. The thinner ones look pretty natural in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Was not too impressed with these lashes! Very very cheap, obviously but I&#x27;ve gotten cheap lashes before but these I tried to work with and ended up throwing all the rest away! 😔 disappointed</li>
            <li> really easy to use just have to cut ends a little bit but they are great and great price as well</li>
            <li> I buy these lashes all the time and have been using them for a few years now. The price is incredible. They have to be trimmed to fit my eyelids But they always look great. The lash quality is Ok. The $10 each pair are obviously better lash hair But these look great and stay on wonderfully.. It&#x27;s nice to wear a pair once and throw them away and not feel like Ive wasted a bunch of money. I love how there are so many kinds to choose from also. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using them. They do need to be bent a little bit before putting them on to fit the curve of your eyelid other than that they&#x27;re awesome! Definitely worth the try!</li>
            <li> Ordered these on Christmas and they just got here.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like how I wasn&#x27;t able to track my order but that&#x27;s fine!&lt;br /&gt;The lashes feel like plastic But you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> its made from plastic. obviously</li>
            <li> best price. cheap quality</li>
            <li> Very stiff, hard to work with. Almost feels as if its made from plastic.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking...worth the wait</li>
            <li> Great lashes for a great price!! They come from China so expect a long ship time. I think it took almost a month that was the only drawback!</li>
            <li> These were great quality &amp; arrived earlier than expected; definitely worth ordering</li>
            <li> THESE ARE SO PLASTIC AND CHEAP I WASTED MY TIME AND MONEY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; IF YOU ARE READING THIS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> Item was in good condition</li>
            <li> Everyone says these are too stiff, but I find that with a good quality glue, these lashes are great. Opt for the Duo lash glue from Sally&#x27;s or a good adhesive from Mac. The ends do tend to lift after a few hours with the first couple wears and cheap glue. Cut the ends off and roll the lash along the arch to loosen the lash up a bit before applying glue. This helps a lot too. (:</li>
            <li> Very very cheap lashes</li>
            <li> The eyelashes were really cute</li>
            <li> A little long, but great if you go out a lot. My roommate and I had to trim them down a little bit, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> If you want a dramatic look these are great. Used these for photoshoots and going out to lounges and clubs. Not for everyday use but still received compliments.</li>
            <li> I loved the styles of them both, but the bands were very hard to bend over my eyelid to make them stick. They don&#x27;t come with glue so i bought some regular eyelash glue and the eyelashes are so heavy, that the eyelash would just pop off. I&#x27;m sad because I had to throw all of them away.</li>
            <li> I really need to buy another set! Mine came exactly as pictured; one set of the thicker and one of the thinner ones. I have yet to try the thinner ones, but I wear the thicker ones every day and they look amazing. This was my first time EVER trying out false eyelashes and I am far from professional at getting them on, but once I get them, they&#x27;re perfect. They last all day, I&#x27;ve even slept with them on AND reused them. Been wearing them for about a month and have only gone through like one pair!</li>
            <li> These are nice, cheap enough to use &amp; toss, can easily be trimmed to size.</li>
            <li> i didnt like the pairs</li>
            <li> nice lashes.  I clip them in half and apply them to the outside corners of my eyes.  roll them in your fingers to make them more flexible.  a nice line of eyeliner and black adhesive and pop them on.  they stay on until I take them off.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of the lash,,, really pretty</li>
            <li> Just received the lashes today and they look great! I believe the ETA was for August 8th or 12th. Only reason I&#x27;m giving them 4 stars is because I haven&#x27;t applied them. Once I apply them, I shall update.</li>
            <li> The dramatic ones are very nice but the subtle ones are a bit too natural can barely tell there on</li>
            <li> I love the lite ones, it looks close to human lashes.</li>
            <li> Took a while to come but there perfect !</li>
            <li> the thick lashes i personally think they are to bold for me but i&#x27;ll give them a shot on the other hand i&#x27;m almost out of the long thin ones they look extremely natural and i love the way it compliments me although the band is really thing and can be difficult to put on it the results are gorgeous</li>
            <li> Horrible product. Tried many times could not even get them to stay on so had to take them off and throw them away.. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> They were full and thick plus looked realistic, but i wish they would&#x27;ve come with eyelash glue. If i need more though i will order from this company.</li>
            <li> The dramatic thick lashes are a bit good but from the side looks hideous. I think if you have big eyes , like I do , the dramatic lashes wouldn&#x27;t be so bad. Now, the regular lashes work alright. You can&#x27;t really tell but if you curl them and put mascara they look so natural. I would recommend using tarte mascara on these lashes. And my other problem is that the lashes are too straight, which makes them hard to put on because one side goes up and then the other one which is extremely aggravating.</li>
            <li> These lashes are flat instead of curved to sit well on the eyelid so i cannot get them to stick.  What a shame!</li>
            <li> I sale this in my boutique but i decided to take a pair and wear them for my bday and i ove it. :)&lt;br /&gt;CSWBoutique.storenvy.com</li>
            <li> Good deal, these are my cheapy lashes good for backups. Came before expected time so that&#x27;s always nice.</li>
            <li> these lashes won&#x27;t bend, they don&#x27;t look good, I wanted them to look naturally. They look fake and ugly! they are very cheap. Don&#x27;t recommend to buying it. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really wish I didn&#x27;t buy these. I&#x27;ve been wearing eyelashes almost everyday for about 2 years and never had a problem with putting them on, even if my eyes are small. With these eyelashes I have not only wasted my money but my time on trying to put them on.</li>
            <li> Loved them they are awesome and the price is radically low</li>
            <li> Awesome will be getting more!</li>
            <li> I waited for 6 weeks for these and when they finally arrived they couldn&#x27;t curve to fit properly on my lash and the edges of each lash was sticking out weirdly. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Great deal, great price!</li>
            <li> not really bad ,but not that much good....</li>
            <li> I personally do not like the lashes because the quality seems cheap but you get what you pay for, so with that said they are worth what you pay honestly.&lt;br /&gt;(good for beginners)</li>
            <li> I order these a couple of times and I just love them😄😄💓 ......but they should try wrapIng them In a different way like n a bigger box cuz the last set in the box was smashed</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Hard to use... And also feel like straight plastic. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again... Thankfully they are so cheap you can toss them.</li>
            <li> Better quality than excepted.</li>
            <li> great price and very good product. I&#x27;d buy them again. and they&#x27;re reuse able if taken care of</li>
            <li> I wear them every day...beautiful!</li>
            <li> Not the most comfortable eye lashes, but should be expected considering the price. Look relatively real, and definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Was really excited to get these and after waiting 2 weeks for them to arrive, half of them were not in the box. The eyelashes are horrible! Can&#x27;t even use them!</li>
            <li> Took forever to get here. Cheaply made. You get what u pay for</li>
            <li> The thinner-looking ones make you look like you just have naturally long-looking eyelashes, and the bolder ones make you look fabulous. For being shipped from China, this got to me pretty quickly too. I really like them, and I&#x27;ll probably buy more!</li>
            <li> I was nervous about ordering this product online especially since I&#x27;m new to using false eyelashes. They were a decent quality and a very very low price considering one pair or slightly better quality ones can run anywhere from $4-$25 a pair. I only use mine on the corners of my eyes creating the cat eye effect so instead of 20 pairs I actually get about 40 pairs and even better if stored properly they can be worn up to 3 times!Shipping was fast and there was no damage to the product or packaging when it arrived.</li>
            <li> These lashes were well worth it! I absolutely loved the unexpected shipping time too! My expected delivery date was 11/13-12/2 and I received it 11/12 so that was the best for me because I was so scared it wouldn&#x27;t come until 12/2 because it was being shipped from China to Arizona. Maybe its just me but a day earlier caught me off guard and made me happy lol The lashes looked just like the picture so that plus good shipping is why I rated it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Decent for the price, lash band is really thin, lashes are straight; but you can bend them to fit more to your eye shape.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price! The styles are a bit dramatic for me, but they&#x27;re very good quality and the price is a steal.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! I will be ordering more:)</li>
            <li> honestly, for that price its actually really nice. the thick ones are really dramatic but its wearable like at clubs.</li>
            <li> Not really the best quality but you get what you pay for and these things were cheap... Had I seen them in person I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased them</li>
            <li> Some of the lashes did not look the same but I was able to work with them for the time being. The stems of the eyelashes were too thick and sometimes poked the ends of my eyes. The more natural looking lashes were the ones I preferred over the thicker ones.</li>
            <li> Waaaaaay too big for my eyes. Also, they are PLASTIC, so I wouldn&#x27;t wear them out in public. You get what you pay for w this one....there&#x27;s a reason its so cheap</li>
            <li> the lashes are way too long, very unatural looking&lt;br /&gt;also, they lay flat when you take them off the board, they dont stay curved for easy application&lt;br /&gt;i tried to trim a pair down, but they just looked worse</li>
            <li> I will buy this over an over there are all of that what a bag of chips&lt;br /&gt;Everyone would buy this!</li>
            <li> Great lashes, cant wait to use them.  They seem a little big I think I can cut them in half and they will still look awesome.  Shipping took a little long but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> If you look at these eyelashes to hard the lashes will fall out! However, they are pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes were pretty decent considering the price for it, PLUS it&#x27;s free shipping. I love the regular long lashes. I only needed to trim the ends where it&#x27;s held in place in the box and kind of \\&quot;wave\\&quot; it (so that it&#x27;s not stiff) before applying it. The thick lashes, however, is thick and too long for me. I ended up cutting them in half to apply on my outer eye for a doll look on Halloween. Depending on how dramatic you want a look, the thick lashes would be great for a night out to go clubbing. I did receive them about a week before the expected date. The packaging was okay. The box was kind of crushed inside the bubble envelope, but the products weren&#x27;t ruined. I gave this 4 stars because the thick lashes weren&#x27;t for me, but others may like. All in all, I would buy this again considering how cheap they are but be more likely to only purchase the regular long lashes.</li>
            <li> Came pretty quick, I wish it came with adhesive. Haven&#x27;t quite got the hang of putting them on yet, but for someone experienced in false lashes, I think these would be pretty good. Can&#x27;t complain about the price</li>
            <li> I love them they look nice not too expensive. At all because i pay like 5 buck for one. Pair at sallys and on amazon there soo cheap like 2 buck for 20 pairs .</li>
            <li> My selections arrived early and look just like the pictures I chose from. These also arrived a week before they were scheduled to be delivered. They are very sturdy and are a great length to cut to the appropriate size.</li>
            <li> I only received thick ones, no naturals so that sucked . Its really hard to get them to stay on due to the fact that theyre not even curled slightly they face downward because in the packaging they are layed completely flat agains the box. I know I didn&#x27;t pay alot for these but i at least expected to be able to wear them even if they weren&#x27;t of the best material.  &#x3D;\</li>
            <li> As someone who wears eyelashes everyday these are perfect!!!! i literally paid 2 dollars for all of these!!! Style 2 is definitely so natural looking and feel so real and look good. At first i thought it was strange because the part that you put glue on is made out of thread and i was sure i wasnt going to like them because of the quality but they are awsome and once you cut and adjust them to your eye shape they look just like any other lashed ive bought from the store. Style one would be fun to wear for pictures or halloween or some kind of fun party but for everyday style 2 is amazing. i will definately be buying again</li>
            <li> I personally love these lashes! i wear them on a daily basis and i get complimented on them all the time !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Stiff and rigid lashes....look very very fake!!  Like plastic.  I would NOT recommend this to anyone.  Very cheaply made.  I guess you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> These lashes were horrible!!!!!! They were plastic and unrealistic!!! please do not buy these lashes!!! Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> These took a longer amount of time to arrive. I almost thought they weren&#x27;t coming at all! But, I eventually received them in the mail. They are exactly how they look in the picture. I would recommend using these, both versions, for dress-up, costuming, or messing around. I prefer using more natural eyelashes for daily use or a night out. But, for the price, I don&#x27;t mind the quality.</li>
            <li> ( Chris Wife)  1-★ -- I give them one star cause they are synthetic lashes on a rope band and they came two weeks after I ordered them but I only paid $1.00 so yaa me but I will not order again .. !</li>
            <li> These came a lot earlier than expected and were so beautiful when I got them. I love them so much</li>
            <li> but i was in love with how thin and light they were on my eyes... usually lashes annoy me because of how heavy they are but these are not the case.. i would of given five stars but the band is so difficult to bend.</li>
            <li> The boxes were a bit damaged. Could have been packaged better, but good product. They didn&#x27;t fall apart and blended into my real lashes beautifully.</li>
            <li> Good deal but the glue is noticeable on these.</li>
            <li> Received before estimated delivery,  good quaitly had to cut to fit my eyes but overall they look wonderful. Thank you!</li>
            <li> These lashes aren&#x27;t completelu awful if you know how to work with them. The pairs that are less full look and feel like plastic there&#x27;s no working with them so you might as well throw them out. The full more dramatic lashes are amazing. The only thing is you have to remove one of the 2 lash bands for them to function like a typic lash. After you separate the bands and pull one off these lashes are great.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t even wear these lashes. Im a MUA and I thought maybe they were good because of the reviews. But trust me they&#x27;re not worth buying.</li>
            <li> These look very fake, but that&#x27;s what you get for buying super cheap eyelashes!</li>
            <li> you get what you paid for. very cheap poor quality. dont buy</li>
            <li> Pro: You get tons of lashes. The ones on the left are especially thick and very pretty when on the eye.&lt;br /&gt;Con: No glue...but, it doesn&#x27;t say it comes with glue, so I am not docking any review points for that.&lt;br /&gt;I used some Ardell glue I had laying around.&lt;br /&gt;They are &amp;#34;one size, fits most&amp;#34; but cut to size if need be.&lt;br /&gt;I wore these once so far, and had no issue.</li>
            <li> There cheap I understand why but no just don&#x27;t waste your Time or money</li>
            <li> These are really great for a makeup artist who goes through lashes quickly. The only downfall is that they don&#x27;t have any adhesive on them, so they are difficult for trying on clients; you can&#x27;t show them in the mirror how they will look because they don&#x27;t stay along the lash line, as if they had been glued. You also need to cut off the long ends, but most makeup artists clip the lashes to fit their client&#x27;s eyes, so a little extra trimming doesn&#x27;t matter. They are worth the cost.</li>
            <li> great product and super fast shipping!! love it!!</li>
            <li> These are great, arrive quickly from China via USPS, very full, and I&#x27;ll never buy retail for fake lashes again. You do need to buy glue seperately.</li>
            <li> Get more compliments on the thicker pair than the too-perfect skimpier pair. Maybe they could be cut down and used for lower lashes.</li>
            <li> Super hard and fake couldn&#x27;t even get them off the board they arrived on.</li>
            <li> My first time buying eyelashes. They seem to be of good quality. The thick eyelashes are nice and very thick, and I haven&#x27;t tried the other ones yet. Good product for the price I payed. Didn&#x27;t like how I had to buy eyelash glue separately though.</li>
            <li> They look like plastic. If your a newby to lashes then yeah. But I like mines full and fabulous baby.</li>
            <li> would not buy again poorly maid!!!!!!!!!!!!1</li>
            <li> Very cheap quality. They are good as disposables. The section that attaches to the eye, is very stuff. It actually lifts off the lid, as it is too rigid.</li>
            <li> Great, the only thing is that it took forever to get delivered.</li>
            <li> I like both of these but i use the thick lashes because they look better and arent hard to put on. i bought the clear lash glue seperately and im glad they look like the picture!</li>
            <li> Poor quality, too stiff</li>
            <li> I ordered these a while back and won&#x27;t again. Such a cheap quality I still haven&#x27;t used them.</li>
            <li> dont even waste your money</li>
            <li> this is not what i expected all kinds of glues dont even stick...boo</li>
            <li> They came in a good amount of time. They don&#x27;t really work well though because they aren&#x27;t fitted to the curved eye shape.</li>
            <li> The estimated delivery (~1 month) seemed a little bit long; yet I received the package within 2 weeks! Very efficient considering the handling time plus the time to ship internationally. I had no experience for eyelashes before; therefore tried to find a low price ones for practice. I just tried to put them on today. My friends complement the effect the eyelashes brought out. :)</li>
            <li> First off it took a month to get here and I live in the U.S., second it looks fake going to have to cut extra hair off! If your doing a fashion show or going to a event then get it, but a everyday look which i was looking for not good unless u cut it and make sure it blends with your natural eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Good price, good lashes. Definitely recommended on if you&#x27;re looking to save money and look fabulous!</li>
            <li> Really bad quality...horrible</li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews before I bought them and even though some were bad, I couldn&#x27;t resist the temptation for cheap lashes. These lashes are so soft. I believe they are hand-made. 10 of the lashes are super thick and the other 10 are thin but longer. These lashes don&#x27;t come with glue (but a lot of lashes don&#x27;t). I had some handy anyway. I had to cut off the ends of the lashes (the bits keeping them in the box) but otherwise they&#x27;re ready to go. I had to do a couple of coats of glue because the part that you glue basically fabric. Nothing glue couldn&#x27;t handle though. At first they were hard to put on because they are not pre-curved to fit your eyelid. That also is fixed with the extra glue coats. I had to apply eyeliner around them to make them look at least a little more natural. The thin lashes could look natural but the thick lashes are total desu manga lashes. For me, I found that as a plus. I love them. The thick lashes can get heavy (so if you&#x27;re looking for desu manga &amp;#34;come hither&amp;#34; bedroom eyes they are perfect). I do like the thin lashes better. Further down in the review, I&#x27;ll be posting pictures and I used the thin lashes on the bottom lash line just to see how the two different lashes would fit together. If you&#x27;re looking for a natural look but lengthy lashes, this is a pretty good buy just for the ten thin lashes. I personally will probably end up using them all (not together though and you&#x27;ll see why) and having to buy more because they really are great. The shipping was as expected. It took about two weeks. Full makeup review with pictures can be found here: http://tatsuusan.tumblr.com/post/110365855409/okay-so-i-promised-a-review-like-forever-ago-so</li>
            <li> i love these! they come without glue and you need to cut the lashes but they are EXACTLY AS SHOWN!!!! I loved them!!!</li>
            <li> I dont know what to say other than my sister puts them on all the time and i doubt she would do that if she did not like them.</li>
            <li> Well i brought this for my sister and she was hooked! She loves fake eyelashes and these wont disappoint! No they wont!</li>
            <li> Low quality and very stiff ... Very plastic looking when you apply them</li>
            <li> Enjoy those fake lashes they really bring me out</li>
            <li> Although I cannot complain about the price, these are very long, and non-natural. Nevertheless, I think it&#x27;s worth it in the long run if you are a fan of false eyelashes in general.</li>
            <li> Thier plastic. And I tried. like they say you get what you pay for. I guess they would be great for Halloween or just to practice for the real deal.</li>
            <li> too long, flimsy and poorly made. i trashed them</li>
            <li> Too fake looking and hard to put on</li>
            <li> Came destroyed! the packaging was horrid and the lashes down the left side are all bent with hairs poking in every direction. They can&#x27;t be salvaged. What a waste of money! Very cheap, You&#x27;re better off buying from a dollar store at a buck a pair, than trying to save this way. I can MAYBE use 2/20 pairs if I am lucky. Wish I could try them on and review them, but I can&#x27;t....</li>
            <li> these are plastic lashes. not what i am use to, and sure as hell do not stick on with normal eyelash glue. And when they do, they fall off half way through my night. Was quite embarrassed when this happened at a party! haha. But i should have expected it for how inexpensive. Thank you though!</li>
            <li> I received this item about a 10-12 days after I ordered it, rather than the month after as advertised. So far I havn&#x27;t tried then on but they feel like natural lashes. But I will have to see just how dramtic the look really is.</li>
            <li> I love the natural lashes but the thick ones....not so much. I don&#x27;t females where them. They caste a shadow over my eye and they made my eye lid so heavy I could barely blink right. Natural....YES PLEASE. Thick....I&#x27;ll pass.</li>
            <li> they work good and with a whole dozen to myself, I don&#x27;t have to be saving them because I still have to rest.</li>
            <li> not what I expected, material is to hard, not easy to mold, but you get what you pay for.. i guess</li>
            <li> I love these. They are so easy to put on. Plus, for 20 pairs, you cant beat that price. &amp; the quality is amazing.</li>
            <li> Lashes look too obviously fake and plastic, packaging came bent up, shipping took forever I&#x27;m just very disappointed in the product. BUT you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> These are ok, the thicker sets look really fake though.I don&#x27;t wear false lashes all of the time but, if I did I would probably choose something of a higher quality. That being said you get what you pay for so cost&#x3D;quality</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t what i expected, I expected real or fake hair not plastic although they are pretty lashes it just wasnt anything that i suspected</li>
            <li> they look extremely fake and theyre stiff, not flexible enough to lay on your eyelid to glue. i dont recommend that you buy these</li>
            <li> Exactly like the picture.  All though my pup got to a few there are still plenty I can rock and show off.  Theres no glue but again worth the price. I will not be buying lashes for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved my lashes, both styles ! The thinner ones look so natural, people didn&#x27;t even know I were wearing false lashes. The package was neat and simple, good for putting away after using a pair . The price is AMAZING ! I did have to clip the sides in order for them to fit my eyes, but I do that with all lashes I buy.</li>
            <li> even those these are so cheap in price they should be charging more! these are gorgeous on after you trim them to your size. they look so good that my step mother had me order them for her too.</li>
            <li> I must say they aren&#x27;t that bad considering how much u pay but u can definitely tell the difference that these look way to fake. Other than that they stay on pretty good.</li>
            <li> I had to wait nearly a month for these lashes, and after reading all the other reviews I was so excited to get them. But when they came in the mail, like I said before, a month later, the boxes were smashed and torn, damaging a few of the lashes. This would&#x27;ve been fine by me, since they were still very cheap and pretty good quality. But instead of getting the two styles (I really just wanted the natural looking ones, but I couldn&#x27;t just order one,) I just got two packs of thick ones, which I didn&#x27;t even want in the first place! Due to the quality of the other reviews, I would say that you could still buy this, but it&#x27;s a gamble. You might get what you want, but there&#x27;s a high chance you won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Took a month to arrive. I was excited because they looked like great quality eyelashes, when arrived package was squashed, handled with no care at all. Feels like fake plastic barbie doll hair and were not curly like other store brand falsies. WOULD NOT BUY EVER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> The picture on the right is NOT what came in the mail... They had more of a \\&quot;spider lash\\&quot; effect.. Also they are reallllly long. I think of these of more as a clubbing/party lashes than everyday use lashes. Other than that i love these lashes.</li>
            <li> $2 eyelashes sucked bad :/ I mean I only paid two dollars so I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much but damn they were Horriable! Do not recommend</li>
            <li> I expected a lower quality because of the price but they were great ! Style 1 look glamourous and style 2 look natural but really nice. It was also a really fast shipping i received them wihtin a week. they PERFECT!!!</li>
            <li> defintley cant complain the price is amazing! they are a little long so you have to cut them . they look really good on i always where style 2 . they stick to your eye just fine . took awhile to arrive but i defintley going to order more when i get low . very happy with product.</li>
            <li> I recieved these..but no type of glue with them whatsoever.  Now I have to wait another week for glue too? I mean its bad enough I have to trim all of them because they look terrible length is not even..they came in a half cushed box and all that can be said is you get what you pay for. I will NOT be making the mistake of ordering from these people again</li>
            <li> Item came on time, you can create many looks with the different thickness of the eyelashes,ease to applying the eyelashes once you have gotten the hang of it, if it your first application your gonna make a mess so be patient keep practicing</li>
            <li> These lashes were the worst quality lashes I ever could&#x27;ve bought. They weren&#x27;t even worth the little amount of money that I paid for them. They were too thick and didn&#x27;t stick to my lids at all. I even bought a very high end expensive glue to try to make it work, yet it didn&#x27;t. I also waited way too long for this product. But hey, gotta give it a shot.</li>
            <li> These are terrible. They are not realistic at all, not that false eyelashes usually are, but these are exceptionally bad. The lashes are hard plastic, and they are too long for my eyes. The shape is alright but a few got crushed in the shipping process and I couldn&#x27;t bend it back. Maybe I&#x27;m just picky about what I glue on to my face but these are straight up awful.</li>
            <li> I love the thick full eyelashes , the only problem with these eye lashes is that they feel so fake but once you  put them on with eye shadow and all that glamourous make up you will be good to go !!</li>
            <li> The eyelashes when received in the mail were a little crushed because they were in an envelope, if you&#x27;re looking for more real textured eyelashes these are not the ones to buy. The eyelashes do well there is no problem, the only thing I did not like was the fact that they are synthetic. Overall they are fake eyelashes and get the job done.</li>
            <li> the lashes were way too thick</li>
            <li> these were hard to shape to my eye&lt;br /&gt;they come off pretty straight&lt;br /&gt;once i got em on they looked very nice and full&lt;br /&gt;for the price i would buy them again and i do recomend them for people who have the patience to work with them</li>
            <li> This product is not a bad buy! The lashes look amazing and they stay put on the eyes. The only thing I dislike is the packaging. Some of the lashes were damaged and bent due to the packaging. Also you have to snip off the ends of the lashes because of the excess strip.</li>
            <li> My everyday go to looks! Absolutely in love!</li>
            <li> I bought these on a whim and figured if they weren&#x27;t good at least I didn&#x27;t lose much $. I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived and have since ordered 4 more sets!</li>
            <li> They turned out to be pretty good  eyelashes I like the way they fit on me and easy to put on</li>
            <li> hard to mold them so the inner corner part keeps coming up. cutting in half helps</li>
            <li> these are felt not lashes. what a rip off. im disgusted at the cheapness of them. why make them? they are that bad. !!!!!!!!!!!!! all i can say is WOW. the seller should be ashamed</li>
            <li> the material could be a lot softer and it doesn&#x27;t bend with the eye as well as it should. if there&#x27;t not enough glue the eyelash starts to unglue and straighten out :(</li>
            <li> Not flexible at all have to trim ends before use and I&#x27;ve tried a few differen types of glue but the corners never go down because the lashes are too stiff</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re great. they make my eyes look lovely. not too difficult to get on.</li>
            <li> They were good. I wish the thicker ones were a little more natural looking, also the thinner ones to be longer. They came in earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> more for smaller eyes, I have big eyes so I usually like longer lashes. overall a good deal for 2 bucks I mean cmon ?!</li>
            <li> Great lashes for the low price! The don&#x27;t feel as nice as more expensive ones but for this price I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good for first falsies, definitely use with mascara!</li>
            <li> Really terrible quality</li>
            <li> The thick ones make you look like a drag queen and the thin ones are barely noticeable. Also they&#x27;re flat so they&#x27;re very difficult to put on. If you look good in big eyelashes and you&#x27;re a pro at putting them on, I&#x27;d recommend them but they&#x27;re not for me and they&#x27;re not for beginners</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this but then they arrives stuffed in a envelop . They are kinda stiff &amp; hard to glue on but hey they were are a dollar ! . 👎✋ I like the natural looking ones but the big spider looking ones are to dramatic ! Maybe good for Halloween !</li>
            <li> Very cheap quality but you get what you pay for. Won&#x27;t purchase from company again.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  They are very false looking. If you are going for that non-natural in your face false these are for you. If you are looking for a natural is she or isn&#x27;t she wearing them these definitely are NOT for you.</li>
            <li> Loved The Lashes, Great Price.&lt;br /&gt;Third Time Buying Them.</li>
            <li> Not made out of hair ! Feels and looks like plastic... Doesn&#x27;t form to shape ur eye. Waste of money !</li>
            <li> I believe that all the negative comments come from girls who do not know how to apply lashes, first of all your suppose to trim them down to fit your liner line, then after the lashes feel comfortable your suppose to still apply mascara so it blends in with your natural lashes. hence the reason i have not had any issue with these lashes i love them and in fact all my co workers liked them i bought a total of 40 pairs of lashes</li>
            <li> Beautiful but they are straight and do not fit to your eye without a fight</li>
            <li> I love my eyelashes they are awsome...I am a eyelash freak I just love how they make my eyes look</li>
            <li> Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new.. if it is missing they replace it.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with the product received, there just was not much indication when it was ordered that product was being sent from china.  Took a very long time to get them</li>
            <li> Great for the price. These lashes are easy to use and easy to put on the eye. The casing is a little cheap but they are great for the price paid</li>
            <li> These lashes look and feel great however the only issue I had was the line to apply the glue was super slim.</li>
            <li> Love them, been using them for a while and can&#x27;t get enough of them.</li>
            <li> I thought these lashes were incredible! I love both sets, natural and thick, natural for every day use and the thick for a night out or a special event. False lashes are an essential to completing a make up look and putting it all together. These are quality lashes and cheap also!</li>
            <li> Came before it was suppose to which is always a plus. These are okay lashes i woud suggest these for someone who is just learning out to apply them.</li>
            <li> I loved the thiner lashes not a fan of the thicker ones great product though</li>
            <li> I knew immediately that I would have to donate the boxes, unopened. The false eyelashes could probably be worn at Halloween and by stage performers, but that&#x27;s about it. They do not look like lashes, and are too thick, too long, and extremely unnatural. The thick set looks more like eye brows. Imagine wearing eye brows on the lash line. If Amazon is going to let any seller post products, there should be attention to how out of hand some merchants have become in pushing unusable products.</li>
            <li> Delivered quick. Daughter loves them</li>
            <li> These are very cheap. Which is understandable for the price they are just sitting in the package still because they are not worth trying to put them on.</li>
            <li> The longer thicker eyelashes are very dramatic, and with some patience the thin ones are a more natural alternative.</li>
            <li> My daughter always wears fake eyelashes for work.  This has a nice selection.  They will definitely will come in handy.  The only thing is I expected the eyelash glue to come with them.</li>
            <li> love these lashes..the fit perfect...all your have to do is cut the extra string that&#x27;s on the ends and put them right on! I always get compliments on my lashes!!</li>
            <li> These were the first experience I had with fake eyelashes and the first time I tried to put them on I thought they were ineffective and hated them; however, I bought a better eyelash adhesive and looked up a tutorial and finally got it. They can be hard to get up to your lash line but tweezers come in handy for that kind of stuff. They also are slightly flimsy but once they&#x27;re put on they stay. I also love that the smaller lashes are actually very natural looking and if applied correctly you can&#x27;t tell whether they&#x27;re real or not. The dramatic ones do their job: to be dramatic. Therefore I can&#x27;t see myself using them unless they&#x27;re for a costume or a really crazy party. Other than that, I totally love them and I definitely recommend watching a tutorial if you&#x27;re not super fake eyelash savvy. It comes in handy!</li>
            <li> I didnt like the lashes because they dont bend like the other brands and the hair felt very &amp;#34;plasticy&amp;#34; i never got to wear them i just threw them away.</li>
            <li> Awesome ! Looks natural. However a bit to long I needed to cut them a bit. Great for the price . Im happy I got them</li>
            <li> I wear false eyelashes almost every day. Although the ones from the store (Andrea and Ardell Brand) are more expensive, they feel much nicer, are easier to apply and look more natural. I would not buy these again, even though they are a good deal. The feel and look synthetic and plastic-y. I am pretty good at applying false eyelashes as I wear them daily, and these wouldn&#x27;t stay put very well, it took a lot of coaxing to get them to stick in the right spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend spending a little more and getting a better product.</li>
            <li> Not only are the bands white so you have to color them in with eyeliner or marker, but the bands are so stiff that you can&#x27;t form them to your eye and they stick straight out.</li>
            <li> eyelashes are in good shape and look good, if only i can figure out how to apply them! thats my fault tho lol</li>
            <li> This product was not as expected. The eyelashes were to short and they are not easy to stay on because the crease of the eyelashes is to hard. When glued on it would come out easily.</li>
            <li> Although they are very pretty lashes. They were a little too stiff and didn&#x27;t quite bend and mold to my eye. I would glue one side of the lash and the other side would unstick. These are by far the hardest lashes to put on in my experience.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes! do not listen to the bad reviews. 20 pairs for about a buck fifty when in the store it can be as high as 10 dollars for one pair, Yes, they are plastic but that just means you can reuse them, there&#x27;s enough pairs to wear as is, or you can experiment with them and make demi lashes or can cut them shorter. They shipped pretty quick. They came in 2 different packages. One package had the less thick lashes and the other had the insanely thick lashes. the writing was in chinese but it didn&#x27;t come with instructions anyway, thankfully i&#x27;ve use lashes before. I use these weekly and love them. I suggest using lash grip glue for these lashes. Before applying the lashes be sure and hold them up to your eyelid and see how they fit to make sure you don&#x27;t need to cut the ends shorter or anything, i usually have to cut a little off the ends. Applying the glue with a Q tip or a bobby pin would probably be the best option. LOOOOVEE these lashes.</li>
            <li> these are amazing and a good buy for your first time.  You can learn how to use these and then move on to ones you buy in the store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really satisfied when I wear it .. they look cheap and some of them were crushed because they were delivered in a envelope.</li>
            <li> They look great I got them for my daughter and myself.  They were at a great price.  We love them. I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> They did take a bit to arrive, but I understand because they ship from overseas. Yes, they&#x27;re not real hair, but they don&#x27;t look bad at all! They formed great to my eyes and stayed in place even when my glue was failing. They are big, but that&#x27;s the look I go for. Best used with weave glue (yes this is totally safe and it holds better than eyelash glue). I love these and there are just soooo many of them!</li>
            <li> You may have to cut to size, bend them to hit the corners perfectly but you&#x27;ll be able to conquer it divas! For the price... what are you waiting for??? Great deal. ←PERIOD</li>
            <li> I have nothing more to say about these eyelashes but awesome! I love love love the thick long ones, and the thin ones are nice to just more natural.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality. They don&#x27;t stick at all. The band is thick and hard. I threw them out. I couldn&#x27;t even put them on so I couldn&#x27;t tell you what the look like. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> These are phenomenal eyelashes. All different sizes, depths, hair amount, and length. Looks real when on, even the thick lashes, no mascara is needed. I gave them as a stocking stuffer to one of daughters and she LOVES them!! Will more than likely buy from them again.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive these lashes. The thicker ones were perfect for my performances and the thinner ones were great for going out, they had a natural look to them. I&#x27;d buy them again!</li>
            <li> They were to theatrical and fake looking. Too thick and fluffy. They were way over the top nothing that you can wear everyday.  I trashed them.</li>
            <li> They are adorable but the fit is awkward</li>
            <li> The shipping was on time and the lashes look great the only thing I hate was they look cheap and plastic but besides that they look reuse able. I give this product a 4 out of 5</li>
            <li> style 1 lashes looked to thick and fake to me but style 2 looks way more natural and looks great makes lashes look amazing.</li>
            <li> These lashes are a great quality. I can reuse them at least 3 times! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> What can I say. they do the trick but they&#x27;re definitely cheapies and I feel them falling off my eyelids pretty early into the evening!</li>
            <li> gave the thick ones to a friend who loved them.  Easy to apply  and they looke great  would definitely reccommend</li>
            <li> I personally like the much fuller lashes, Style 1 but they are extremely long and dramatic I ended up having to cut and trim them a lot. As for Style 2 they are also dramatically long and not as full you also have to be careful on how you trim them, if you do.</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED THESE LASHES ON AMAZON. ALTHOUGH THE SHIPPING WAS SLOW--IT EVENTUALLY CAME. I SHOULD HAVE SENDED THEM BACK--BUT INSTEAD THREW THEM OUT. THEY ARE DEFINITELY &amp;#34;FAKE LOOKING&amp;#34;! I LIKE REVELON AND ARDELL--BUT THESE ARE TERRIBLE--DONT BUY!!! DOESNT MATTER HOW CHEAP IT IS.</li>
            <li> eyelashes were stuck on plastic and very hard to remove, they were sticky and very weak, ripped apart very easily, not at all like the eyelashes i buy from the store, i will never buy eyelashes from amazon again</li>
            <li> I received these in less than two weeks, and in great condition!&lt;br /&gt;They are soft. I would recommend cutting them in half if you don&#x27;t like the dramatic look.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great product!&lt;br /&gt;Update; the dramatic lashes are super dramatic and harder to stay on, you need a really good glue.</li>
            <li> They look like they are made of plastic versus faux hair. Really bad. The rim that the hairs sit on are white, so it looks horribly fake if you wear dark shadow or eyeliner. Not worth the $5 I paid haha.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. hoping they would be slightly more lifelike. very stiff and plastic feeling. I will probably use them for practice.</li>
            <li> I bought these to try because they were so cheap, I figured what do I have to lose? Anyways the lashes came in and the packaging was all dented. But more importantly the lashes themselves were TERRIBLE. They looked like plastic hooker lashes. Way to cheap looking and didn&#x27;t fit for my lash line or any humans lashes lol.</li>
            <li> Bought them for my girlfriend and she loved them. She was very satisfied specially for the price they sell it for!</li>
            <li> very light weight and shipped fast. package is sealed. The style 2 is good. I was expecting something different with the style 1 lashes. They are more of a anime lash but kinda fun. The price is sneaky tho. Its aprox $3 for style 1 and $3 for style 2 then shipping and tax I paid $11.98 all together. I would not wear them.</li>
            <li> Came exactly as pictured, but packing is flimsy so I take a star away. It actually shipped fast too. It was a gift to my sister when she came from college and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Love them. I don&#x27;t mind if they&#x27;re too long because I can always cut them, and have plenty more to use! Don&#x27;t forget to buy your own glue while you&#x27;re at it. The natural ones look good on any girl looking for something to amp up on.</li>
            <li> showed up way faster than i thought they would. the less obnoxious ones are nice haha. i wear very very very very dark makeup and even i think theyre crazy haha. they aren&#x27;t super comfortable but i paid like... a dollar for them so i cannot complain</li>
            <li> i was very disappointed when this item arrived. the lashes look so fake and when placed on the eyes, it looked even worse. i thought these would look more natural looking judging from the picture, but i was wrong. not happy.</li>
            <li> I love eyelashes and this set is the deal deal you will ever find. I love to have both styles and make things different. They are high quality and last me forever just one pair. I always tell everyone I know about them</li>
            <li> These lashes were nicer than I expected them to be, and had a very good price! However when I got the package about half of them were dented because it wasn&#x27;t packaged properly. Still I love these lashes and I reuse them by wiping off the glue and swabbing alcohol on them when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> Awesome and inexpensive. It doesn&#x27;t come with eyelash glue, but you can get tht at target for a dollar not a big issue.</li>
            <li> These lashes are so affordable! They look great and cheap!  I love that they came in 20 pairs and varies from natural to thick.  They are so easy to apply, its effortless.  On days that I dont&#x27; have time to put mascara, I just applied these lashes and go.  They&#x27;re actually faster to applied than mascara!  I don&#x27;t really know if they&#x27;re longer lasting than other false eyelashes, because I tend to throw them away after every use.  Since they&#x27;re so cheap, I don&#x27;t really have the time to clean them to reuse, I just use a new one each time.  The dramatic lashes is perfect for nighttime.  The lashes is even noticing in the club and show up in pictures.</li>
            <li> I ordered these back in November, and I never wrote a review, so here it goes! I originally bought these for cosplay, but I&#x27;ve found myself wearing them even on a daily basis. They really do accentuate your eyes amazingly, and don&#x27;t even feel like they&#x27;re there. I really wish they would stay on for longer periods of time, but that might just be the glue I&#x27;m using. They are a bit stiff and quite long after opening, so I roll the lashes between my fingers and cut the ends off a bit before I put them on. Though, the price is something you can&#x27;t beat. I&#x27;ll be buying from this seller again!</li>
            <li> I liked the first set and it took 2weeks to get here /-\ but other than that they were nice c:</li>
            <li> They worked great look very good on my eyes &amp; everything planning on doing business with you in the future thanks very much</li>
            <li> I chose rating because delivery took long price was good but once I got these I tried to put them on to see how natural they may look but instead neither design had any shape so they wouldn&#x27;t curve to the eye and was impossible to glue on my eye lid.  I tried each several times but did not work.  I have no use and will throw them away im not even going to bother asking anyone if they want them.&lt;br /&gt;and I also have experience with eyelashes and I can put them on easily , not theses!</li>
            <li> Luv them and I will be ordering some more soon!!! 💞💞💞I have my co-workers wanting them! 💞💞luv them luv them</li>
            <li> no tracking but they came and i paid the price of 1 for 20! its worth the wait and they look lovely</li>
            <li> These are an EXCELLENT VALUE for as strong and pretty as they are and for as many pairs as you get.&lt;br /&gt;The persons who are wearing them are pleased and still have several to wear and last for many months to go.</li>
            <li> nice and neat pack of eyelashes, cant wait to wear them. they look like they are wider then what im used to but look forward to using them on a hot date night</li>
            <li> They are hard they have paper on them like cardboard they DONT LOOK NATURAL  they hurt only good thing is you get a lot of them</li>
            <li> I really like how you get both dramatic and natural in one to vary, depending on the occasion. I also like how inexpensive they are.</li>
            <li> The natural type is thin, but long and the backbone of the lash isnt hard but molds to your eye perfectly. There is a bit extra on the ends but cutting them off was no issue.  If you position it right, it can be the curve for eye liner. The lashes blend perfectly with natural lashes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thicker ones have a nice feather fringe type look and feel. They do have the little bit extra backbone, but once again, it&#x27;s not a big deal. They look really nice, big and dramatic for a night out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was really fast, recieved a week ++ before estimated shipping time.&lt;br /&gt;would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I liked this, it took no time for them to arrive: all fully in tact. I like that they were long for every size fits any length of eye. I disliked that it didn&#x27;t include glue.</li>
            <li> The thin lashes are great they are very natural looking and I have gotten so many compliments on them. However, I ended up just throwing away the thick ones. They are to plastic like and are difficult to form around the eye. Once they are on as well they look very fake. They may be good for Halloween but other than that they are a waste.</li>
            <li> The dramatic lashes are a bit harsh for normal day use, but the regular ones are perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my eyelashes, and either no one has noticed or doesn&#x27;t mention it, but nobody has asked if they were fake! Great price, great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little dislike: They are very plastic, but that&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> Shipping was was on time. For the price these lashes are ok. If you&#x27;re looking for red cherry, ardell type lashes these aren&#x27;t it but they&#x27;re not too shabby for backup affordable synthetic lashes.</li>
            <li> I love them they was perfect</li>
            <li> Cheap yet nice quality. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Theyre a little too big and they don&#x27;t come with glue</li>
            <li> excellent product at a great price. the two styles are very cute and look change much spectacular. arrived in the estimated time</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re made of material that&#x27;s a lil bit harsher than i expected , there made of plastic. They look great  though and they&#x27;re at a great price.</li>
            <li> These lashes are fun to play with. Looks good at night with the heavy ones and wonderful for day with the lighter lashes.  Can use over and over again.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve tried on the really thick ones for my cosplay and they look great! (:</li>
            <li> Love love love these eyelashes. Great &amp; especially for the price if you wear eyelashes all the time then these are best I&#x27;ve yet to have to buy an eyelashes. Only bad thing was took awhile to get but still great buy for the price!</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are awful. I know they are fake, but you can tell from across the room that they are not real. I would not recommend these to anyone. :(</li>
            <li> the price is great but the product is so so...not so easy to apply...doesn&#x27;t really curve to stay put on your eyes</li>
            <li> I think the lashes was great. I love them and it beats paying 3.99 for one pack at the beauty supply.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous after reading reviews about these lashes but I went ahead and got em anyway and I LOVE THEM!! Easy to apply and Look Great!!</li>
            <li> This is totally cute if you&#x27;re going for the &#x27;dramatic&#x27; or &#x27;natural look.&#x27; The eyelashes can be used over and over again and I could not be any more pleased. It did take a while for it to get here, but for the price it was absolutely no big deal. These lashes are perfect for anyone starting out (like me.) Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> They are like plastic, which makes them heavy.. but they&#x27;re super cheap too so if you want to try them out you&#x27;re not gonna lose much lol.</li>
            <li> The thick lashes are great but the thin ones are like synthetic. i dont know if i will use the thin ones</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something that looks natural these lashes aren&#x27;t the best, even the less thick ones. If you are planning on using them for dances, cheer, etc. they are perfect. Great deal for the prices. Just a little cheap.</li>
            <li> They were very nice and looked really good in person but they took a long time to arrive other than that they were nice</li>
            <li> I have never really had a problem with the product, though sometimes some of the lashes come bent into odd shapes. However, you can buy so many for a cheap price that it doesn&#x27;t really affect you. I ordered three sets, and only had a few wonky lashes out of sixty. The only reason I did not give this product a five star rating is because shipping takes FOREVER. Other than that, it is totally worth the buy, but if you can&#x27;t wait I would suggest getting some at the store while you wait for these.</li>
            <li> I have ordered the thicker ones separately before and they were borderline PERFECT. Excellent price and durability i ordered them almost three months ago and still have like 4 pair left. They clean off easily and apply without much hassle. After returning home my family gave me so many compliments and my Grandma just had to have a box at that price. lol But she wanted something a little less dramatic so I found this set-up with the box i like and one a little thinner and got them yesterday and they look great!! I suggest these to all my friends and even buy them for them. I love them and hope they never go away. :)))))</li>
            <li> The thick lashes were very soft and pretty, and the thin ones were more separate, but still nice. A little hard to get out, but the packaging was safe that it came in. Worth the price, just get some good glue.</li>
            <li> The thick eyelashes  are perfect for going out and the thin ones you could wear everyday! Great deal for price!</li>
            <li> Love these! Cut the ends and they fit my eyes perfectly and stay on pretty good. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> These took a little while to arrive but I was in no hurry to get them. These are not bad at all and especially for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of pairs but they are very plasticky feeling! Have to trim them no biggie that&#x27;s normal but they don&#x27;t hold well with the lash glue(not included). I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> The darker ones are the ones I like, and they look real when I use it I am satisfied and I do recommend it</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these!! They look amazing and are perfect for such a great price!!</li>
            <li> So easy to put on made my eyes look so much better.</li>
            <li> This is lovely I love them u must believe me it worth it</li>
            <li> hate it! lashes are horrible</li>
            <li> Arrived before expected date and in perfect condition! beyond happy with this purchase. i will for sure be buying again!!</li>
            <li> Terrible ... I don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone these lashes have such poor structure 😒</li>
            <li> Arrived before time. A bargain!</li>
            <li> Took quite a long time for shipping, but I received them just as pictured. They do feel much more &amp;#34;plastic-y&amp;#34; than the lashes I am used to, but that&#x27;s to be expected for this price. You really can&#x27;t beat the price and to get this many sets all at once is a huge bargain.</li>
            <li> I have only used 1 pair of the 20 pairs of false eyelashes, but it was perfect. I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> this product is great cheap got my moneys worth along with long eye lashes !  they did come in a wobbly box but none were smooshed so im happy these are perfecttt !! perfer these over name brand  they cover up and go on well i dont even have to wear eyeliner with these one they look clean an not messy ! thanks (:</li>
            <li> You pay for what you get! The deal seemed too good to be true! And it WAS!!! These are the cheapest eyelashes EVER!</li>
            <li> Super hard to apply. Still need to trim even if it fits the eye size because the plastic strip sticks out.</li>
            <li> Love the mi could go full out dramatic,or girl next door. they didn&#x27;t seem like they were human hair but the pulled the look off.lol. Kisses</li>
            <li> Although I was excited about the quantity of the lashes for the price I paid, I am not impressed with the quality. The bands are thick and stiff and took a lot of coaxing just to get one pair on. Most of the lashes are still untouched and I bought this months ago (around 6 I believe).</li>
            <li> These lashes were good! Stayed Nice For Many weeks!I Would buy them again once i need more. Awesome for dramatic or casual looks!</li>
            <li> Gave me an eye infection! These lashes suck and don&#x27;t look like the lashes in the picture</li>
            <li> I didnt excpected them to be very nice and natural!! they are really great for the price.. I will buy them again. thank you</li>
            <li> I think this item is o.k. but I thought and saw another kind of lashes becouse they are not very good, they are so so.</li>
            <li> These 20 pairs of hand-made eyelashes look amazing, and all 20 pairs for just $2.70 and no sales tax?!?!  that came out just $0.14 per pair. where in the world can you get a marvelous deal like that? I guess only on AMAZON!!!!  Super Awesome!!!</li>
            <li> This was the second order I brought because I loved it very much. It was worth it. An il probably buy more</li>
            <li> I love these lashes. I&#x27;ve always had issues putting on lashes but these were the easiest by far. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve perfected by skill or if it&#x27;s the actual lashes, but either way I WILL REPURCHASE!!!</li>
            <li> I am used to buying individual specialy lashes so these were alot different but not bad. Before you apply bent back and forth many times so they shape to your eyes easier! Great for dramatic length!</li>
            <li> I love my lashes one thing wish naturals were a little fuller thick ones r vere nice good price too!</li>
            <li> Love the length and very easy to put on!  The thicker ones are a bit hard to put on, but with a little bit of work, they look good for a night out!</li>
            <li> It comes in 2 separate storage boxes which i love. If you are looking for long and bold lashes i would get these. But a warning if you have glasses and wear them 24/7 i wouldnt get them ; every time you blink they will hit the lenses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.. If ur a beginner in putting eyelashes this is not for u.. Band is too thin but for a price this is surely a win..</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE THEY ARE SOOOO NICE</li>
            <li> Very rough. They feel like wire.</li>
            <li> The product wasn&#x27;t of good quality but what do you expect from the price? Still received multiple compliments from people every time I wear them. Definitely just a one time use. The eyelashes can be worn for everyday looks.</li>
            <li> The lashes are very nice and for the price I got it for was a total bargain!</li>
            <li> Love love love very pretty</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved these. The price was low and it seemed too good to be true at first, but when I received them they met my expectations beyond. They were so easy to apply, and the material was so real. They looked like my real eyelashes. I get so many compliments on my eyelashes asking me what I use to make my eyelashes look so good and full and long. When they find out that they are false eyelashes they are in complete shock, they say that they are amazing. I also love how there are two different kinds of eyelashes. I like the two different styles because I feel like one I can wear on a night out, and one I can wear on a daily every day to day basis. Easy to apply and works well with mascara, doesn&#x27;t clump up. Although I do wish it came with some adhesive/glue.  Overall I would definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> Great deal!!! Cheapest eyelashes in good quality.  And you get a whole bunch.  I like the thinner one it doesn&#x27;t look fake.  The thicker ones are mostly for dressing up customes.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the thicker ones, but the thinner ones are plastic and not very noticeable. Still good for the price though.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as described. Shipping was within the time frame.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> I think the best eyelashes</li>
            <li> Terrible quality. Rubbery and incredibly fake looking. Awful. Would not purchase again or recommend to anybody else. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love them, if you that kind of person that loooove being notice then wear the tick ones, i use them almost everyday, and i use the natural ones when i only wear eyeliner, they are handmade &amp; free shipping.</li>
            <li> I got it before time ! It&#x27;s a good deal I love them both, are good! I would be purchasing again !</li>
            <li> These were fine, and there&#x27;s not much to say about eyelashes. I got what I paid for. I only really had 2 problems.&lt;br /&gt;1. The box was really squished, and not all of they eyelashes were in their designated spots.&lt;br /&gt;2. They are veeeery long. (the width, not the actual eyelashes) They go past the length of my eyes. They look kind of ridiculous if you don&#x27;t cut them. I have been cutting them into thirds and halves, so they will last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, they work fine and were very cheap.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are terrible to work with.  Although they are of good quality and are plenty long enough even for the largest eyes the way that are packaged leaves them straight as a board when you remove them from the box.  I&#x27;ve worked and worked with each one to try and get them to contour to my eye lid but find myself constantly having to reapply glue and/or adhesive to one end or the other in hopes they will stick.  Doing this then messes up my eyeliner and that must be straightened out.  No way would I order them again or recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waist you time..BAD BAD PRODUCT.IS good only if you want add on dolls,because if you actually wear,make sure to look like a fool.</li>
            <li> I bought these as Christmas gift for my sister and I wish I bought them for myself! They said it would arrive after Christmas, possibly mid January. I was bummed because I wanted them for the holidays but they arrived right now! Nothing was damaged, came earlier than expected. Great service. Will be purchasing again in the future from them.</li>
            <li> There were diffedently a lot of eyelashes in the box, but one thing that&#x27;s kind of essential is the glue which is not included.</li>
            <li> They are actually really difficult to put on. They come with this peice of paper that peels off. The band is really hard. Slightly uncomfortable. If you can get over all of that &amp; just trim them to your eye size, not terrible.</li>
            <li> I bought these mainly for practicing and they were such a cheap price,  they did take awhile to come... they&#x27;re fun to wear. I like to wear the normal ones but the dramatic ones are nice to depending on the occasion. I believe this are really nice quality lashes.</li>
            <li> I got these and was super disapointed.  They are plastic and just crap.  But hey... I was not mad at all! What do you expect for 1 to 2 dollars.  :)</li>
            <li> Oh, I was so swayed by the cheap price.  Lesson learned.  These are made out of some sort of cheap plastic and are just bad.  They look terribly fake and are not that easy to work with.  You get a lot for your money which is why I gave them 2 stars instead of 1.  But yeah, I certainly got what I paid for here.</li>
            <li> So cheap they&#x27;re literally unwearable ! if you&#x27;re thinking about purchasing them don&#x27;t! Spend a couple extra bucks and get a better quality one.  The TERRIBLE , tried to put a couple pairs on ended up just throwing them all away</li>
            <li> these suck! luckily they were cheap or i would be livid they look nothing like the picture the thin ones are ok but the thick &amp;#34;FULL&amp;#34; ones are terrible and look like construction paper glued to your eyes bad bad bad! dont buy!!!</li>
            <li> These were awful. Hard to apply and looked unnatural.</li>
            <li> They took a little bit of time to get here but they are amazing durable and re useable. I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> Very thick and hard to put on. The lashes have absolutely NO curve to them and they are so stiff which makes it even more difficult to apply. I notice with the thinner set of lashes they tend to show a white strip when I put them on. I tried to cover it with liner but it still shows. My fault for buying cheap lashes! Never again.</li>
            <li> Producto tal como lo describieron, buena calidad, fue entregado a tiempo el comprador cumplió con los tiempos de entrega ofrecidos</li>
            <li> The lashes are big and great to work with, just what I was expecting...I just forgot about the glue lol</li>
            <li> I suppose for stage use or costume they are ok. But for evey day wear you can tell very easily they are fake</li>
            <li> I was able to reuse these several times. Everyone loves the one that isn&#x27;t as thick. the thick ones are very glamorous! I used those in the nights with very little make up and it looked wonderful.</li>
            <li> They are reusuable and easy to use!</li>
            <li> This will be my second time ordering these lashes and I must say, I looooved them! I wear falsies almost every day and they can get expensive but these are very inexpensive and well worth the buy. The only problem is how long they take to get here but considering they come from China I guess I can&#x27;t complain. Overall great lashes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super thin and hard to put on. The price is excellent for the amount of eyelashes you get but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth the actual product.</li>
            <li> They are easy for fashion show or photoshoots</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s OK the eyelashes are made poorly but 20 pairs of eyeleyelashes are good and for the price good</li>
            <li> Wish they already came with glue and the thicker lashes look too fake</li>
            <li> Cheap plasticky eyelashes! Hate them</li>
            <li> A little unconfirtable to wear cause their a little to hard but on it looks really nice</li>
            <li> These were so plastic and unprofessional I couldn&#x27;t fathom putting them on my face. There needs to be hygienic guidelines for selling products like this on this site to keep people from using something like this</li>
            <li> Extra long and form fitting</li>
            <li> LOVED THESE!! they are amazing the only thing is if you get the free shipping it takes quite a while to get them but they are so worth it</li>
            <li> great! i love the product n i cant beat pricing!</li>
            <li> Bad quality, didn&#x27;t like them, can&#x27;t wear them, makes u look like a cheap doll.</li>
            <li> CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP. Do not waste your time or your money. They aren&#x27;t even for real eyes. Maybe dolls or something. What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> when did i buy these? let&#x27;s just say i&#x27;ve still got like 1/2 left over and they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> thks for all atentions.</li>
            <li> Too stiff and do not feel good on your eyes. They&#x27;re almost too heavy for an eyelash.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  Looks very cheap</li>
            <li> Plenty to choose from !</li>
            <li> please don&#x27;t waste your money like i did</li>
            <li> they are plastic.. I jus threw dem away</li>
            <li> i got these almost 4 days after ordering them and they arrived perfect. seems like its for people with larger eyes but i just snipped the end a little. not human hair,thats forsure but for 20 pairs its a deal</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love wearing these lashes.  Easy to put on. Just have to cut a very little off to fit. Great product, GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li> These lashes came in 2 weeks from asia to US which is really quick to me. I like these alot. the thick ones are a really dramatic and huge. Like double the size of those big katy perry lashes. The \\&quot;natural\\&quot; pair were a little too much for me still. I definitely like the way the lashes are made and how easy they are to work with. Recommend these to those who just wanna try out or play around with false lashes.</li>
            <li> The lashes looked like plastic and when I put them on they are very stiff. The inner corners were coming off and after 10-15 minutes they started to stand out straight. They are also way too long that it looks weird from the side views. I&#x27;ve had cheap drug store brands that worked way better.</li>
            <li> I like my lashes, they looked neutral. Haven&#x27;t tried the thick ones yet but I just don&#x27;t like the fact that the hair isn&#x27;t real hair. Real hair is my prefrence though. But overall it&#x27;s not too bad either. :)</li>
            <li> It looks really fake and they are very hard. I could have went to local beauty supply store for a better pair. Oh well...that&#x27;s what you get for cheap.</li>
            <li> did not know they were plastic</li>
            <li> I like them ! not bad. ill have to see how well they hold up.</li>
            <li> The place on the eyelash were you put the glue is so thin so it was hard to apply. Also They weren&#x27;t real eyelashes they were like plastic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these eyelashes</li>
            <li> Lash line is really thick making them hard to stick and they look really fake, kind of a waste to still have so many</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the more natural style and they were super pretty and easy to apply. I plan on using the bold ones for my boyfriend&#x27;s 21st birthday bash. Super excited.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thin hair and lashes so I used the more natural, thinner lashes and they look great!  I gave the thicker ones to my niece who has naturally thick hair and she likes them too.  The price is right and the lashes are reusable.  A great buy for people who wear eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Other than needing to adjust for my left eye they are great. Almost seems like they are all made for the right eye.</li>
            <li> I deff don&#x27;t know why I purchased these.. I could never wear them&lt;br /&gt;their too stiff and hard.. look so fake.. but whaever.. it was okay for the price&lt;br /&gt;for Halloween or to play dress up if I was 5</li>
            <li> As a mkeup artist, these definitely make life a bit easier! I go through lashes alot, and found myself buying these two styles in the single packs. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about rushing to store, unless I need a different style! Thanks!</li>
            <li> The 4 stars is for style 2 lashes only. Style 1 lashes look nice in the picture but are actually quite difficult to wear only because of the poor quality of the plastic lash strip. It&#x27;s not flexible at all and hard so it makes for a very uncomfortable fit. Surprisingly I loved the style 2, their comfortable and cute for daily use like work or school. Their slightly better looking than natural looking fake lashes which is sometimes all I want.</li>
            <li> I really like the natural looking lashes. I guess the thicker ones would be better for night time when going out. I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> My wife told me that only about 2 of these were actually usable, unless she got into stripping, which she isn&#x27;t. So, 5-stars if you&#x27;re a stripper?</li>
            <li> They r way to waxey and plastic looking I would never wear these I&#x27;m very unhappy with these</li>
            <li> dont waste your money and time waiting for these lashes</li>
            <li> First of all, it took a LONG time to ship, and they looked really fake. They&#x27;re supposed to be stick on, but they don&#x27;t stick. I had to buy eye glue for it to actually stick.</li>
            <li> Lashes were extremely long. Length and width. I even tried cutting them down and they were still way to long. I don&#x27;t even have that big of eyes either. I wear lashes alot and these I would not recommend to anyone or buy them again. I wasn&#x27;t pleased.</li>
            <li> These were terrible, to this day have not been able to make them stick. Very cheap, not natural, took forever to arrive. Save your money. This is not a steal.</li>
            <li> These are great!! I perform a lot and it&#x27;s great to have a ton of these on hand. They&#x27;re so cheap!  I&#x27;ve already used one pair 3 times. So they are durable. Way better than expected.</li>
            <li> The lashes are for a great price. but you get what you paid for. The lashes are hard to put. You have to let the glue sit longer. When I got my package the box was crushed thank goodness the lashes were not damage.</li>
            <li> Lashes for days what more could a girl ask for!  I even got my mommy to wear them! Love It xoxo</li>
            <li> Not human hair poor quality</li>
            <li> These will do the trick and photograph fine/look fine in person if you cover the band well enough. Theyre good if you&#x27;re needing to stock your kit and just need lots of lashes. But the band is definitely an..almost paper-y plastic that is not totally black (and not totally clear). Theyre a bit pinchy and odd because of this. Not very comfortable for models (or me).</li>
            <li> They are perfect for the makeup jobs that i do on my clients. I do a lot of beauty makeups so a dramatic lash is great and perfect!</li>
            <li> I love the darker, more thicker ones.  I didn&#x27;t care too much for the thinner ones, which I am going to give to my sister, since she doesn&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; look for eyelashes.  The thick ones are kind of hard to master at first but I love that they are solid and so they never look lopsided after you put them on, as other lashes.  I usually put glue on the whole lash then apply outside-in, this way the outside of the eyelash dries a little bit first before I apply the inside of it, making them look very equal and proportioned.</li>
            <li> Not wht I was looking fot</li>
            <li> I dont like these at all</li>
            <li> I just got the product I like this and the  fact that it didn&#x27;t take that long to get it here for the price is good</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these lashes yet, but I will once I purchase an eyelash glue.&lt;br /&gt;These lashes are so soft when you brush your fingertip over them.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time using lashes so I will be practicing with these.&lt;br /&gt;They feel super soft and are apparently made with real hair!</li>
            <li> I found these to be a wonderful &#x27;Bang for you buck&#x27;. I have yet to try the thick ones, but the regular ones were perfect for a more natural makeup look. I can&#x27;t wait to try out the thick ones.....hmmm, maybe for Christmas or New Years Eve! :)</li>
            <li> i didnt like that it didnt want to stay on my eyes n that it wasnt shape rite.. so as of rite now they r just sitting in my make up box not being use..</li>
            <li> i chose this rating because ive been waiting for this product for almost 4 weeks now&lt;br /&gt;i didnt think it would take this long&lt;br /&gt;i would probably recommend once they come to some of my friends but hvnt came yet which sucks !!</li>
            <li> Everyone complaining about these are right they are a little stiff, to help that you need to flex them first (grab them by both ends and kind of keep bending/rolling them side to side to stretch them) they aren&#x27;t real hair they are kind of doll like but curl them first or while you have them on and they look more natural. They could be better but they are sooo worth saving all the money than paying 5-10 dollars for just one pair! Also I bought this twice, both times I got different styles so I have 4 DIFFERENT STYLES you dont know what they are going to send so I say buy them again!</li>
            <li> the shipping was earlier than said but it did took long , but you can understand when they shipping from china to united states , but either way the packaging didn&#x27;t took 100% of care with these items i received it wasn&#x27;t the outer packaging but the inner bubble rap was the one who caused a little damage to the eyelashes pack, based on what i saw i think that it is because they rapped the bubble rap too tight on the eyelashes box, and well i order 2 packs so i received 40 pair of eyelashes with the boxes kinda damage . Luckily the eyelashes turned to be in good conditions . and well i like smokey looks so am in love with the #1028 eyelashes and i will reccomend them to the people who love smokey eyes as well , the other pair which is #118 i will be using for like school days , day at a park , mall , places where you want a have more like a natural long eyelash look . also you will have to buy your own glue since its not provided with the eyelashes .</li>
            <li> It was fast, had really good quality to the product, and it came in a reasonable time frame. It was Awesome. Thanks.</li>
            <li> YES!! Wore them for the first time today and I love them they are awesome and great price and got here fast thank you</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re pretty good lashes overall, the only issue with mine was that a couple of the lashes were pretty messed up and unusable. other than that they&#x27;re good quality and look awesome!</li>
            <li> I loved it! The eyelashes were great quality. I&#x27;m not too good with putting them on but I have many to practice with for such a cheap price. It says 17-18 BUSINESS days and I got mine in less 15 days, which is great because I&#x27;m super impatient. Can&#x27;t wait to enjoy them!!</li>
            <li> I know that the eyelashes were sapposed to come in after a month and that is quite a while.... But it&#x27;s been a month and a half and it still hasnt come in.... This was sapposed to be a cool Christmas present and it never came in the mail.</li>
            <li> Glue was not included but, that was okay. The only thing that I did not like was that I had to cut some plastic off ends of the lashes. If not cut correctly the lashes ended up hurt my eyes.</li>
            <li> Took forever with the shipping but it was well worth the wait.. honestly for the price and what i got.. iveonly worn one pair so far, of the thicker ones but i love em. :3</li>
            <li> i love them soo much!! the quilty is veryyyy good and the price is not bad. i think ill buy more.</li>
            <li> good buy. cheap and look really good. cant tell they are fake if you use the ones on the right</li>
            <li> They were alright. Look really cheap.</li>
            <li> I ordered these and was so excited! But After opening them and trying to apply them, I&#x27;m frustrated and disappointed. The lashes aren&#x27;t like KISS lashes, the blend is synthetic.. Thin like paper. I use latex eyelash glue, and the lashes are too heavy for the glue to bond them to my eye. Also, my eyes are almond shape and these do not bend to shape your eye very well.</li>
            <li> These lashes were okay I mean you get what you paid for I thought they would look a little more natural but not. Do not recommend unless you don&#x27;t want to spend a bit more on some more real-looking ones.</li>
            <li> Bought for a show and the actresses loved them.  The price is incredible.</li>
            <li> They look pretty nice</li>
            <li> I love these due to quantity and style of lashes but I don&#x27;t love the stiffness of the material.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like them there very cheaply made but there good to just play make over with!.</li>
            <li> The thick lash are way to hard to put on and the thin lashes are easier and look better.</li>
            <li> have only used one pair so far, when i ordered them i was i a make up craze wearing lashes nearly 24/7 but it took a while for these babies to get to me and by the time they got here i wasn&#x27;t so crazy, the lashes were bent and twisted and some fallen out of slot once they arrived but that wasn&#x27;t too big of a problem for me. they weren&#x27;t really curly but they did give my eyes more definition i guess you could say. for the price and 20 pairs i wasn&#x27;t too bad of a buy.</li>
            <li> Gave it one star for the price. But yes it&#x27;s definitely not what I expected. It&#x27;s plastic, like not soft at all it&#x27;s so hard and doesn&#x27;t bend accordingly to your lash line glue doesn&#x27;t help cause it&#x27;s so hard it pops off your eyelid. Will never order it again I threw it away. Made my eyes watery and it hurts. I totally messed up my make up trying to use it for the first time! But you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> They are plastic and you get what you pay for.  Will not order again.</li>
            <li> I think it is good but I still not try it</li>
            <li> These eye lashes are great, and Im pretty sure the people who say they&#x27;re so flimsy to use, just don&#x27;t know how to apply eyelashes correctly. I&#x27;ve ordered these a few times and they&#x27;ve always been great!(:</li>
            <li> Price is good for the quantity, obviously, but they&#x27;re annoyingly cheap. Good thing is -- no one looking at you can tell.</li>
            <li> I love my eyelashes, I did have tO wait a while for them but well worth it. Only bump On this was tht twO sets Of eyelashes wer smashed in :( but other then that they wer amazing</li>
            <li> All I can say is tey feel like plastic, they are not even wearable.</li>
            <li> Love the item and the quality and price. Will shop again. :-)</li>
            <li> Not worth the time &amp; money spent. Most of them broke with first application. Would advise on a different product.</li>
            <li> Arrived crushed, but everything was still ok.  The lashes had slipped from the allotted slots, but my daughter was still happy.</li>
            <li> The items are set for a day and night type.. they are long and heavy and the other is ok for an every day look</li>
            <li> These lashes are very fun.  Didn&#x27;t expect much from reading the review, but when I got them, I actually liked it. You&#x27;ll never know unless you try it yourself, right? I didn&#x27;t have to cut them because they fit my eyes perfectly. Also I didn&#x27;t have to use any eyeliner because they were dark enough, giving a wide eye effect.  I wouldn&#x27;t wear them on a daily basis because it&#x27;s too dramatic, but I would use them for events or just put them on when I feel like going for a playful look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who said they look too fake, what do you expect from a false lash.  They aren&#x27;t real of course. So if you&#x27;re looking for a natural kind of lash, these aren&#x27;t for you, but if you feel like being adventurous, you could give it a try. Can&#x27;t go wrong with the price :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave a 3 stars because the package arrive pretty squashed up making some of the lashes bent out of shape.</li>
            <li> I like to use fake eye lashes for photoshoots&lt;br /&gt;These work out wonderfully for that.&lt;br /&gt;And if you remove them slowly, you can reuse</li>
            <li> THESE LASHES ARE COMPLETELY HORRIBLE! THEY HAVE WHITE STRIPS GOING THROUGH THEM THAT MAKES THEM COMPLETELY UNWEARABLE. THE OTHER STYLE IS WAY TO THICK AND LONG FOR EVERYDAY WEAR. I KNOW THAT PRICE IS CHEAP BUT PLEASE DO NOT BUY THESE EYE LASHES. I CONTACTED THE SELLER LIKE I WAS ASKED AND THEY ARE GIVING ME THE RUN AROUND. SAVE YOUR MONEY. DONT GET THIS GARBAGE.</li>
            <li> They were alright the small ones are great size, but the large ones are a little to dramatic for my taste.</li>
            <li> They were alright. Not for everyday use, better for costumes. You also need to trim them. They aren&#x27;t a natural shape.</li>
            <li> Good for the price.. actually better for the price</li>
            <li> i got no thick lashes, they&#x27;re all thin. Slightly disappointed</li>
            <li> Arrived very early and look amazing!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these lashes, I&#x27;m a makeup artist, and honestly these are better than some of the expensive lashes I&#x27;ve had to buy. They are very durable,  you can wear them several times. I wish I could just buy style #2 because those are my personal favorite</li>
            <li> Perfect combo of lush lashes for elegant affairs and simple lashes for regular nights out</li>
            <li> These are just awful. Big pieces of crap plastic! Honestly, you&#x27;re better off getting lashes from the 99 cent store!</li>
            <li> These work good! A little stiff but they go on just fine.</li>
            <li> These suck so hard to put on I guess u get what u pay for</li>
            <li> Ridiculously thick lashes. Very noticeable. Didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> I love them they are super long and awsome!</li>
            <li> not what i expected they look and feel plastic</li>
            <li> Best price on the internet.  Will purchase from again. Item was on back order, shipper kept in contact when product was to ship. Good communications</li>
            <li> When my order finally arrived, my sis took a quick look at them and said they look so cheap, fakeish and dramatic. I am gonna have to admit they do when I took a glance at them too, but when I tried them on they look so natural they totally blended with my natural lashes. I can even curl them together and they wont rip. Looks amazing and really affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I love natural neutral make up so the lashes totally go with it. My opinion hope it works for you if you decided to buy them :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Eli</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried them yet but they look okay and you get alot</li>
            <li> i love these lashes. they are reusable and durable and will continue to purchase them again and again. best value ever!</li>
            <li> Package came with eyelashes un even</li>
            <li> Nice product, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Those lashes were nice had to cut the corners for them to fit my eye, but besides that they look great and the price is excellent.</li>
            <li> I love the lashes, they look amazing. I never usually wear fake eyelashes because I myself have long eyelashes but their perfect for when you don&#x27;t feel like really applying eye make up. It&#x27;s always a pleasure to receive items you want in a promptly matter.</li>
            <li> Flemsy. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I go through alot of eyelashes so when i came across this product i figured I try them out at first I thought it was too good to be true but once i applyed them I loved them I love the different lengths on the lashes much like how I get them designed at the spa very flattering I will be re-ordering this product shipping takes a while which is okay because its worth the wait so be patient!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price! Pretty standard quality for falsies. Snipped the ends to fit my kids.</li>
            <li> The lashes are real hard to manouver, They are real stiff, and feel like plastic on my lids. Thanks- Have a great one.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made and dont apply easy.</li>
            <li> Amazing product for the price! Shipping is a couple weeks but these last for months!</li>
            <li> Amazing for the price! Of course you have to cut them to be your size but I am happy with the product. It&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Item took forever to come in and was damaged.</li>
            <li> These lashes are a really affordable purchase. The thinner ones on the photo give a much more realistic style, and the thicker ones are probably ones I&#x27;d wear on Halloween or something. Overall they are really nice lashes and great for the price.</li>
            <li> I really like the thicker ones. I find they&#x27;re much easier to put on. The thin ones feel like plastic and I don&#x27;t really use them much but I guess all in all its a good bang for your buck. I recommend these for &amp;#34;go out&amp;#34; lashes. Not everyday ones.</li>
            <li> I bought this last week. I found it useful because you can use one for the day and the ticker ones for night. For the price you are paying it&#x27;s actually a good buy.</li>
            <li> Nice eye lashes for use in performing and wanting to enhance the eyes. The eye lashes are natural and beautiful.</li>
            <li> They were okay. I was expecting them to be a bit prettier, but i could work with them. One thing i did not like about this, was the way it was shipped. When i received my product, one of the boxes it came in was squished. Luckily, the eyelashes weren&#x27;t squished or ruined. Overall, they are very nice false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes were very nice for the price but not all of them were the exact same length but its not really an issue, they came earlier than expected but my one issue was i was never able to track this product which is alittle annoying seeming as i&#x27;d like to know were all my stuff is</li>
            <li> for the price I can&#x27;t complain, but the lashes look more like plastic. What can you expect though? It&#x27;s coming from china. I wouldn&#x27;t where these out ever.</li>
            <li> these things feel like plastic, not worth it even though it was $1. It also took over a month to get to my house! No bueno. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> should have known i would have gotten what I had paid for. They are plastic and impossible to use. Just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Its Just what it said. Enough lashes to last a long time. Great find Great price. Would order from again</li>
            <li> It took a sometime to receive the package but the lashes are perfectly organized and well placed in position no damages what so ever! Great buy! I will be coming back for more!</li>
            <li> Looks better in the picture, they look cheap in the package and break apart upon contact. I tried various types of methods of application, each one failed</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive these are… And they actually came! I&#x27;m impressed by this purchase and item. I even thought that the shipping sounded too good to be true… It&#x27;s REAL… and a REALly good deal!</li>
            <li> cant even know when there coming,  and no tracking and the gonna take foreer im sure since there only 2 $</li>
            <li> The thick one was a little intense but the thinner one looked natural! (as natural as fake eyelashes can look)</li>
            <li> So obviously, your buying in bulk for really really cheap, meaning one or two eyelashes occasionally in the box may be stiffer, or not in place when your package arrives, but overall for the price you cant complain, they are easy to bend to the shape of your eye, and re-usable which is even more great! I have been using these for about 2 years now, every couple of months i order another box :)</li>
            <li> its okkkkay but for the price? cmon guys!! under 3$!?! these lashes look amazing on - i cut them to my size becase they are pretty long (not the lashes, the base where the glue goes) ***box came all smashed up but no damage done.*** NO COMPLAINTS. would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;if u wear falses alot! this is a pretty good find!!!  like i said WOULD BUY AGAIN :)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!! They look just like the picture!! Case&#x27;s were smashed a little but that was because of shipping (came in bubble wrapped envelope) ,they have to be trimmed a little but they are soft and the band is small !!!:) :)  I will be purchasing more!! The lashes DO NOT fall apart !! :)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay.... They took so long to ship I even forgot I ordered them... The day look is equivalent to my normal lashes... Haven&#x27;t worn the nighttime look yet but they are very dramatic I don&#x27;t mind though. They are made out of plastic not actual hair like most false lashes in the us...and they do not come lined with the little sticky strip of light adhesive that other eyelashes sometimes come with... But for the price I can work with them.</li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend these eyelashes unless you are in some masquerade ball or circus. These are not for the average person who wears false eyelashes these were too big and flashy.. Price was not bad so I will give to someone who doesn&#x27;t mind wearing huge lashes.. Not for me</li>
            <li> After reading all the bad reviews about these lashes I almost didn&#x27;t buy them, but I thought what the hell, they&#x27;re only $2. I&#x27;m glad I did, I would&#x27;ve been mad if I listened to what others&#x27; said. So I don&#x27;t know what all the bad reviews are about, saying these are hard and plastic-y and poke your eyes, these are freaking awesome! For like $2 I get 20 pairs of natural AND thick lashes, and they are just as good if not better than store bought $6 single pair lashes. These are great!! When you pull them out of the container, the end parts have no lashes and are longer so you just do a quick trim of the ends, then put your glue on and apply. The only thing is they are straight to begin with, not curved to your eye like store bought lashes, which is no biggie, they still go on the same. They AREN&#x27;T hard or pokey, they are soft and stay on great. The glue line on these are a little thicker than store bought lashes so it gives you a little extra room for glue, so if anything they last longer. I love these and will never buy from a store again. I won&#x27;t even have to order more of these for a loooong time because there are so many. So anybody thinking about not buying these because of reading bad reviews, DON&amp;#34;T LISTEN, give them a try, you&#x27;ll love them!!</li>
            <li> They look nice online but are very hard to put on and a plastic, not worth it would rather pay more for better quality</li>
            <li> they are thin...plastic looking...doll-like eyelashes. too thin to even really get glue on...I am extremely disappointed as I did wait weeks for them to get here. Go to Wal-Mart or Sally&#x27;s and buy some from there, they are better than these.</li>
            <li> I know I ordered these from abroad and paid next to nothing for them but they definitely missed a step on the assembly line.  They are very lightweight which I like but I have yet to trust them to stay in place for long periods of time without an excessive amount of DUO.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product.  It fit exactly as I expected. I plan to order more in the near future.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> These eyelashes look great on and are also good quality for the price. This pack also gives you a day and night look.</li>
            <li> Great bang for your buck, but you get what you pay for. the lashes can be flimsy and you have to have scissors for the end of the lashes, as the band extends further than the lashes do. Not good for more than one use, unless you are very careful with them.</li>
            <li> They came sooner than expected. Yes they were  slightly longer than expected but it was a small snip to adjust. I will be buying more in the future. The price is just unbeatable.</li>
            <li> the lashes are plastic/nylon, impossible to wear, really bad quality.&lt;br /&gt;I didnt returned them since they were so cheep, basicly a waste of money</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase. Would order again from this seller.</li>
            <li> not so esay to install ...</li>
            <li> Not usable lash rim is like card board</li>
            <li> they where so good better than expected :)</li>
            <li> I love these lashes. I get soo many complements. My fav is style 2 but style 1 is pretty nice as well.</li>
            <li> They are awesome! I&#x27;m one who wears them all the time! reasoning for 4 out of 5 is that they are a little difficult to apply with the current adhesives i have. They don&#x27;t form to the eyelid as well as i would like. But still an awesome buy for the price i paid</li>
            <li> They came in much earlier than they were meant to which was a plus on it&#x27;s own. But they were rather man handled, just the boxes though the lashes were perfectly fine</li>
            <li> I thought I tried it out , but no way. They are stiff and hurt your eyes, and don&#x27;t even make that much of a difference with your eyelashes, they are horrible!!!</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic made. If you&#x27;re looking for a everyday use then I would NOT recommend you buy this. If you&#x27;re like me and enjoys playing with makeup everyday then these are perfect for practice and throw away. Definitely not to wear out if you&#x27;re going somewhere with it on. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> They look too fake and weird. I&#x27;ll stick to the &amp;#34;Handmade Natural soft falsies&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very good service. Definitely recommend their services. Eyelashes were good too but I wish it came with the glue.</li>
            <li> Not the best, but pretty nice &amp; for the price,  only thing is, they&#x27;re Kinda straight so you have to curl them .other than that, they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li> I just love these lashes they arrived very quick and there are so many of them, natural, dramatic and fullness. They are long lasting, reusable (for weeks), very thick lash line not flimsy. I even like the box they came in there is nothing negative about this product. Would definitely recommend it to females.</li>
            <li> Plain strung together lashes in a natural and a thick density are perfect for embellishing. Great price and service. thanks</li>
            <li> was exactly as listed and arrived quick very happy with this purchase would use them again.love the amount of product at such low cost.</li>
            <li> Came sooner then what I thought everything was fine the boxes where a little bent but the eyelashes where perfect 👌</li>
            <li> I use false lashes a lot so I enjoy having the option of full or sparse. the full ones aren&#x27;t so full that you look like a drag queen either. and of course you have to cut them to fit your eye seeing as no one has the same shape eye. I love them use and reuse them all the time! great for the price!</li>
            <li> I so love them I want more lol, my sis in laws fall in love they want me to share lol no no no there all mine</li>
            <li> THESE FALSE EYE LASHES LOOKS GREAT ON!...VERY VERY NATURAL LOOKING, I RECEIVED MANY MANY COMPLIMENTS ON THEM. I WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN..</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and lovely!  Shipped really fast, and look great on!  They are easy to apply, but you probably need to trim them a little at the lash line to fit if you have smaller eyes.</li>
            <li> I love these. I can cut them to fit properly and they last a very long time! I will surely be buying again!</li>
            <li> Cheap is not just the price.  They are basically plastic eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I loved the thick styled one. It took me quite a while to managed the lashes. I wore it to school twice and I got a lot of compliments. I would repurchase the thick ones. \\&quot;The regular long\\&quot; well, I had problems with that one. It was shorter than my actual lashes. I was kind of upset. I recommend this product to people who have really short lashes.</li>
            <li> I love the lightweight lashes.However these were bent and in terrible condition when I received them.And I noticed that some were pretty nice but they are actually almost like a plastic which was kind of weird.Not so satisfied with the product. Should have made it more flexible.</li>
            <li> better than i was expecting. you nay have to clip the ends because they are a little bit too long and careful taking them out the box part cause some will split in half</li>
            <li> When I bought these I didn&#x27;t realize that I was getting both styles but I&#x27;m super glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly small eyes and the lashes are very long (across the eye) so I was actually able to cut each individual lash in half and use it as a pair, therefore doubling the use on each set! They are also very easily reusable! They clean up easily (you can just us your fingers or tweezers to pull off any adhesive) and then use a little alcohol if you&#x27;re worried about bacteria. They were such a low price I was expecting a cheap product but I was very pleasantly surprised, they&#x27;re soft and don&#x27;t stab the eye and aren&#x27;t heavy either! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product, will for sure be purchasing again-whenever I run out of the first batch that is! :)</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in these-they dont stick at all-Ive tried various glues and only the inner tend to semi stick and from the center out they just flip up! I even cut them shorter and that didnt help either. They look nice but dont work.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and she was thrilled !&lt;br /&gt;  She loves them.....thankyou !  She thinks she&#x27;s a star. Wow !</li>
            <li> Exactly as described! Great for makeup artists to use and dispose. Purchased for my daughter as she is a freelance makeup artist and these make her life much easier. Will definitely purchase in the future! Shipping was pretty goid too coming from overseas so no complaints!</li>
            <li> The lashes are completely straight.  I&#x27;ve tried everything to make them curve more to better fit the curvature of my eyelid (including pinning the ends together and let them sit for 48 hours.) After applying them, it was only a matter of time before they started to straighten out again, lifting off of my eye at the corners.  My husband said that the thicker set looked like &amp;#34;something fuzzy was on my face.&amp;#34;  If you&#x27;re looking for Halloween lashes, this might do the trick.  But this was not the everyday solution I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This do look fake and are a little hard to put them on but they are pretty and reusable.</li>
            <li> Went straight in the trash</li>
            <li> Nothing to complain about, good lashes.</li>
            <li> love these and they are cheap and look natural</li>
            <li> These are strictly training lashes. If you are trying to learn how to apply eyelashes, these are the lashes for you. Otherwise, Girl you better bag up out of here and find you some velour lashes!!!</li>
            <li> Gotta love the deal on these!  Cut them to fit - they look great!</li>
            <li> The texture of the lashes are light weight and enhance your look nicely these are my go to lashes and the best thing is you can reuse them up to 4 times if you want to make them last longer.</li>
            <li> Great lashes for an awesome price!</li>
            <li> Took forever to come but worth it</li>
            <li> 5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Thank you very much Looking forward to cooperate</li>
            <li> I loved them..you may have to cut them a little around the edges but you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> love these lashes this is like my sixth time reordering and i was never steered wrong and the price is definitely right</li>
            <li> So inexpensive for so many eyelashes! The thick ones are performance perfect and the thin ones make a great everyday eye enhancement. Can&#x27;t beat this great deal!</li>
            <li> They are ok the thin ones but they are cheap so you get what you paid for, but they are ok.</li>
            <li> Great communication great lashes.</li>
            <li> I paid $1.87 for these 40 lashes and I absolutely got more than my $$ worth!  In fact, I feel like the fair and righteous thing to do would be to send seller a bit more $$!&lt;br /&gt; If you remove them VERY carefully and remove any mascara with a mild oil or make up remover, you will get several uses out of them.  (which you should be doing these things anyhow to prevent damage/trauma to natural lash)&lt;br /&gt; If you treat them with the same hands most woman Ive personally known, treat their false eye lashes with...these will be &#x27;disposable&#x27; for you.  AND FOR A BUCK AND SOME CHANGE, THEY&#x27;RE STILL A FANTASTIC DEAL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super , SUPER lightweight.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the band on these.!!  Two hair thin bands running parallel but I do this, and I believe it is the intent-i snip the end  knot off of the INNER band and pull it out.  It comes out smoothy, like a thread.  When you do this...the band on these lashes is virtually UNdetectable!  Unless you glue them to the middle of your lid or natural lash!  lol&lt;br /&gt;I am so tickeled with this purchase, I simply can NOT say enough good things.  DO NOT HESITATE.  Not only are these fantastic, but no other way to go for a beginner!</li>
            <li> Pretty good. Plastic though</li>
            <li> Loved it!  Also came with a great price! Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I love my lashes, &amp; yes I will buy more. The mailing process took a while but it got to me as what they promised. Am I happy? Yes. Thank u! ;-)</li>
            <li> Love it will order again</li>
            <li> The lashes are so soft and realistic. Not heavy like the ones I&#x27;ve bought from stores. I really love these lashes.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like these, they aren&#x27;t like real eyelashes, they are hard plastic pieces. I know the price is great but I wouldn&#x27;t order them again.</li>
            <li> The way they looked in the photos looked nicer online. These lashes are so heavy and thick and don&#x27;t stay on. I guess you get what you pay for but these were absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> Stay away from this item not worth it</li>
            <li> These are sooo pretty and much more natural looking than they are in the photos. They are very soft to the touch, for this price you can&#x27;t beat it! I wasn&#x27;t expecting my shipment until mid October and they got here today, I believe I ordered them the 16th of September. Overall, I am very happy with them and have more coming!</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and work great. I reuse a pair 2-3 times. They do need trimmed but they look great and arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> i love them! i dont have to go to the beauty supply every week to get more! these last for at least 2months! they are reuseable!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using them I am not that great on putting them on but with the price and I get to look good</li>
            <li> They mess up in the box only a few are still usable</li>
            <li> plastic eyelashes look weird and unnatural i wasnt expecting them to be plastic i guess they are great for halloween know better that if the deal seems too good to be true...it is</li>
            <li> They are great lashes, they do their job well!! Awesome prices, only a couple of bucks for 20 pairs!! were as you&#x27;ll pay 7 or more dollars at drug stores or makeup stores. One can definitely tell that you can get two look from them, a natural &amp; dramatic look. I personally prefer style2 for everyday use(since my lashes are very small &amp; sparse) style1 is a more dramatic look for night out etc. I get about 5 uses for each pair, only if take really good care of them, especially when your taking them off. Over all a great product, definitely get your self some lashes!! Now the packaing itself isn&#x27;t that great, but hey your only pay 2-3 bucks so I understand.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. They were easy to apply and for the price you just cant beat it. They stayed on all day.&lt;br /&gt;Looked great! I hardly ever write reviews but these were worth the couple bucks</li>
            <li> I have been told to hold off on buying any more for the time being, I think she&#x27;s running over with these lashes, but she still loves them all, and they are not all the same type, I think that part was a big hit also, Thanks.</li>
            <li> they are perfect either for everyday wear or the &amp;#34;dramatic&amp;#34; look, the only thing is you have to trim the sides to fit because they have long edges. That is the only reason for 4 stars otherwise they are perfect!!!</li>
            <li> This eyelashes are great, I can choose if I want a more dramtic or natural look. I have even reused them a few times.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes look and feel fake.....and not in a glamorous way. Yes you get what you pay for and i should haave paid more.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful and I have used them and get complicated on them!! I will use them again to order!</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are perfect for beginners practicing putting lashes on for the first time they&#x27;re definitely cheaper then the lashes you get from the drug store but they&#x27;re worth it</li>
            <li> Love them. A little bit long but just cut the edges and cut them in half when applying to make sure you get them on your lash line accurately. Will be buying more once I run out.</li>
            <li> Are awesome  quality.&lt;br /&gt;love them&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll order more for my clients</li>
            <li> These lashes seem of pretty decent quality, especially for the price which is vital for me being a makeup artist. While they did take awhile to ship, I knew how long it would take when I ordered them and for the crazy good price I figured it was worth waiting for. They did get to me on the first day estimated so that was pretty awesome. All in all, I would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> horrible , super stiff the glue was ok. couldn&#x27;t even put on my lashes. waste of money. hard to cut the lashes to fit your size</li>
            <li> for practice, it worth the price!!!one pair is more than the money I pay for 20!! pairs&lt;br /&gt;definitely I will buy more again</li>
            <li> I wear the thin ones and my daughter wear the thick ones, we&#x27;re happy so far.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes! They look amazing and very nice. I didn&#x27;t have any smashed boxes, all the lashes are there. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I could not get these on my eyes. They are just too stiff and wonky. Don&#x27;t get these. Buy some red cherry lashes and just tale care of them. A much better investment.</li>
            <li> These lashes last longer than the ones I buy in retail stores. Worth it</li>
            <li> they are stiff n don&#x27;t lay well on the eye lids.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the product at all!</li>
            <li> Came on time and packaged very well but I personally didn&#x27;t like these eyelashes. they are not real hair so it is very hard to put on and make them look natural. but I guess for the price they aren&#x27;t too back. you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Super quick delivery and for the price worth buying</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price</li>
            <li> Hated the thick lashes they were hard to but on. The strip was very hard and would not contour to my eye shape. the more natural lashes were ok but I honestly would not repurchase these.</li>
            <li> Love how many I got and love the price! Harder to put on but I put lashes on daily and take care of mine and know how to deal with difficult ones. But I love them! Don&#x27;t need to worry about buying lashes for awhile!</li>
            <li> Seriously, I will never use falsies again. I started using younique moodstruck 3D fiber mascara from www.lashalert.com and OMGoodness! I can seriously not describe how awesome this stuff is. It&#x27;s only $29 and is so much better than falsies, plus its 100%natural &amp; hypoallergenic and you just put it on like mascara!</li>
            <li> Better quality than I expected for an awesome price. Will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> these are huge and cheap.  Just spend a few more dollars and go to the drug store.  These are so cheap and not worth a penny.</li>
            <li> took  forever to come. just waste of money</li>
            <li> I got them for really cheap. If you are looking to practice how to put false lashes on definitely buy these.</li>
            <li> I really like these better than any of the ones I have gotten at the store that cost way more for just one pair. I use the thinner ones only and I give the thicker ones to my friend and she just loves them. I will keep buying these for sure.</li>
            <li> Love it looks really great on..</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try them.  They are just as described and I think they will be fun to use.  Took a bit to receive them because they had to go through customs.  But if you&#x27;re not in a hurry a pretty good buy for the amount you receive.</li>
            <li> Okay so I love to have really dramatic false lashes so I mostly used style #1. And I loved them to death! I have been wanting to order these again for the longest time. I got 5 or 6 uses out of them before I couldn&#x27;t wear them any more so that was a definite plus.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried out style #2 that much but I&#x27;m sure I would love them to. I have big blue eyes so I don&#x27;t need to cut them short but if one had to then it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem at all. Love them so much and I can&#x27;t wait to order again! Also I would recommend Revlon&#x27;s lash glue, it works the best for me.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look real at all, complete plastic and thick, better for cosplay or costume instead of everyday life. Really difficult to stick on as well, they are so plasticy and hard and non-flexibile that they will poke you in your eye.</li>
            <li> Theyre VERY easy to form to the eye!!!! ATTENTION For those who may have thought the same as me:  One box is ALL thick and the other is ALL regular.... I thought maybe there would be a variety of regular and thick.. but they&#x27;re all the same.. But still super good deal and super awesome product:)</li>
            <li> I assumed that inside the packaging there would&#x27;ve been one of those tiny glue tubes that you need to have the eyelashes stick, but I guess it was something I needed to buy separately. Ah well. I enjoy using these none-the-less. Had to trim the ends a bit so they wouldn&#x27;t poke in my eyes, but they look great and the price is great too for how many you get in a box.</li>
            <li> They are big enough for anyone that I know and have done their makeup, they are good to take down to size, I just went to walmart and got some clear adhesive. And that works great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is the package said it was a phone case! Lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a great product if you do people&#x27;s makeup like I do.</li>
            <li> Not too bad for the price. The only problem would be the band but if you wear eyelashes im sure u can work with it.</li>
            <li> love them very good quality!! i will be buying them again and the price is great i really love these lashes!</li>
            <li> These lashes are awesome! They were just a little long for my eyes but that was an easy fix. With the proper adhesive these are the best for your money and the greatest part is that you can reuse them! These lashes will last me a while!</li>
            <li> Thick paper Stay Away Do not waste your money.. I would never order these again that&#x27;s why there so cheap</li>
            <li> Looks very fake u get what u pay for</li>
            <li> -The eyelashes are way too long&lt;br /&gt;-Very plastic and fake looking&lt;br /&gt;-The eyelash strip part is also too long for your eyes&lt;br /&gt;These eyelashes should be 99 cents.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very comfortable and I&#x27;ve been able to reuse the same pair a few times. The less dramatic ones are my favorite!</li>
            <li> Could have been packaged a lot better... when I received it I was super excited but then I saw they weren&#x27;t that amazing</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get the thick lashes, they look horrible, too short and stubby. Go more natural and get reg. lashes or thinner. or then use a lil eye liner. good price for 20 lashes, than buying one pair for 5 bucks!</li>
            <li> This product took about 4 weeks to ship. However the product did come in good condition and I was very excited to use them. Some lashes have an uneven stitch, but besides that this was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Very cheap but plastic. Literally! Not worth it. Save your money not worth your money. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> The thicker lashes are easier to apply. Which is kind of bad because they&#x27;re hooker lashes, hands down.</li>
            <li> I purchase these for my friend who lost all her hair during chemo.  Not only did they take forever to get to my house after ordering, the boxes they come in were smashed up.  They are cheap and there is no way I am giving these to a friend going through cancer.  They went into the garbage.  Would not trust these on my eyes, who knows what you would catch.</li>
            <li> For the price there great....first couple of times I hated them , they always seemed to come off at corner of eye or at the end...and glue I use is good.but after I realized cutting them into 3 pieces was better for me. They stay on through out the day,and I never have to wonder if there still in place...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great quality, they come just as pictured, they&#x27;re hand made.&lt;br /&gt;They came a whole month early, i love these.</li>
            <li> took a while to get to me but they work splendidly, the thicker ones look a bit fake more fake then i thought but they are fake so w.e, i do love the product though</li>
            <li> I love style 1, and style 2 looks good as well. I get a lot of compliments on these lashes. Best deal I&#x27;ve found on Amazon, and I will definitely but more.</li>
            <li> I love these eye lashes definitely buying more (:&lt;br /&gt;I would have put 5 stars but the only reason why i didnt is because they took about almost 3 weeks to get to where i live and i understand why it takes so long , they are shipped all the way from hong kong but anyways i love them (:</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to work with for beginners. Good price ifnyou know how to work with them. Lots of different styles</li>
            <li> At first i was a little skeptical to purchase these eyelashes because they were just so increadibly cheap..but i thought to my self, well $5 isnt much to loose, specially when one pair of eyelashes cost about $4. So i bought these..it took a while for me to recieve them but when I did I was very pleased and excited and wish id bought more!</li>
            <li> These eye lashes were decent for both a natural or more bold look. It was a great bargin for two packs of eyelashes. I will definatly order more when I run out. (: (: (:(:</li>
            <li> for the price you really cannot beat it.. the only downfall is that you have to trim both sides. because they are too long. they are pretty stiff. but a good deal!! you cant beat it!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap and very hard to bend to the shape of your eyes. They look very fake on</li>
            <li> love these falsies :) it&#x27;s easier to work with than other eyelashes for some reason :) I love it :)</li>
            <li> this is real cheap and so i purchase them.&lt;br /&gt;they&#x27;re ok. you still need to cut a small section at the end in order to fit with your eyeline. yet this is pretty common for all the lashes i think.&lt;br /&gt;i prefer that thicker version. but i&#x27;m thinking to combine 2 of the simpler one in order to bring up the volume.&lt;br /&gt;you can go and find something nicer, if you wanna have a higher quality.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes will not stay on with adhesive. The material is very hard, do not recommend it. The star is for the shipping process, the item was delivered a week before the estimated time.</li>
            <li> For the price, these lashes are aaweeesome. They adhered perfectly well. I used Duo adhesive. I tried both kinds and they look fabulous for a night out or a more casual/dressy event. I have even been able to reuse them several times without issues.</li>
            <li> These lashes are gorgeous in pictures (meaning when you are wearing them). The only complaints that I had were that they were very stiff and very shiny. In order to make them less shiny, I soaked each pair in a little cup of laundry softener overnight and rinse them THOROUGHLY before applying. I also used a maximum strength eyelash glue to apply them to keep the corners attached to my eyelid. After all that, they were perfect! The thicker ones are great for Cosplay, and the thinner ones are great for every day wear. :)</li>
            <li> Great lashes for an even greater price.</li>
            <li> the thicker ones look funny on and have a very fake look but the other ones have a very natural look and aren&#x27;t to bad they are wearable. rather of got 20 pair of the natural ones then have 10 that I am going to throw away.</li>
            <li> I honestly loved these lashed. I was able to keep 16 pairs and give 4 pairs to my mother. They look like my real lashes and they&#x27;re very easy to apply and to remove. Awesome for the price! P.S I love how they&#x27;re two types of lashes to chose from for under $2</li>
            <li> I really like these lashes for the price. I&#x27;ve had to trimmed them down a little, but other than that they are good for about two uses each.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how beautiful these eyelashes looked. I did by these for gifts and I know the recipients are gonna love them! Thank you, sincerely, Juanita Wilson...</li>
            <li> cheap, dont waste your money. they look sooooo fake!&lt;br /&gt;the fakest lashes i had ever seen! and the mailing time was AWFUL!</li>
            <li> I occasionally wear lashes and this was a bargain for the quantity and quality, better than most retail store brands Love the product</li>
            <li> Not worth one Pennie ..!!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my always eyelash wearing diva sister. The eyelashes came sooner than expected and my sister loved them (and she&#x27;s picky about lashes)</li>
            <li> Not what i expected.. too cheap .. save your money.. they look too fake it&#x27;s worth to pay more. dont buy</li>
            <li> Though I usually don&#x27;t wear eyelashes and am quite inexperienced with them, these were pretty easy to apply. I found that flexing them a bit before applying the glue and putting them on works much better in fitting the curve of your eyelid.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ll give these lashes A three out of five for the natural - due to the fact that they are really fake plastic looking, not to bad but they are stiff...but for the price it&#x27;s worth it and I&#x27;ll purchase again!&lt;br /&gt;Now the big full lashes 5 out of 5!!! They are big and full beautiful lashes, totally worth the purchase. Very dramatic and sexy!</li>
            <li> Great value for the money! With careful care i was able to reuse lashes a 2nd time .I will purchase these lashes again.</li>
            <li> These just arrived in the mail today. LOL what are these things? They&#x27;re terrible.  Good thing I only paid about 3 bucks including shipping. No big deal. They look like horse lashes that grow straight down HAHA. Gotta have a good sense of humor, though. Oh, and they&#x27;re made entirely out of stiff plastic. Yes, even the lashes themselves. All different shapes and sizes, none of them match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy these things, and I suggest you don&#x27;t either :p&lt;br /&gt;Jokes on ME ha ha</li>
            <li> The are what they say they are. The only reason I didn&#x27;t do a higher rating was because they are sent in a water proof bag and soft boxes. So although they stayed dry (it&#x27;s WA State after all) they were squished. I suppose a little care, the structure will go back into place.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for. However I like the variety that you are given in this set. the more natural lashes aren&#x27;t as bad</li>
            <li> cheap and beautiful lashes with a large quanity of them too! Super happy with my purchase could live off these for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like them at all maybe they work for others but totally not for me. I gave them to my sister and she didn&#x27;t like them either</li>
            <li> These are fantastic and you  get ten sets of day lashes and ten sets of night lashes all for less than $5.00!!  I also ordered the other set of 10, ao now I have 30 sets of lashes for less than $10.00.  You&#x27;ll probably have to cut the lashes to size them for a perfect fit, but for this price, it&#x27;s worth it!  Especially since my last set of lashes cost me $6.00 for one set!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be ordering these again.</li>
            <li> It was a great price, but the lashes are too shiny and look plastic. I would not purchase these again.</li>
            <li> Love the eyelashes. Packaging sucks though, it said &amp;#34;phone case package&amp;#34; and smushed the eyelashes:/ it also arrived like a month and a half later. BUT The price is amazing. Would definitely recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> This item arrived early, I am very pleased with the outcome they don&#x27;t feel cheap or look cheap I recommend this item if your a big fan of long lashes greatly satisfied</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the thick ones! They give you a sexy, exotic look. The others are good too but there is a white lining in the track. Takes away from the realistic look</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed with these lashes. Very stiff and impossible to apply. I threw them away. Glad they were cheap and I didn&#x27;t lose a lot of money.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> They are good lashes for the price. I am a lashes newbie and these are great lash to practice aapplying lashes.</li>
            <li> I dnt think these eyelashes are made from human hair, one, two, for some reason they are so hard to stick from the corners. Third, you have to cut the edges because they are extremely long and when you remove them from the package part of the cartboard is stuck to the eyelashes. I haven&#x27;t tried the thin ones only the thick fuller ones and once I actually have them on after struggling to put them on (which is never an issue with other brands) they actually look decent. Good luck keeping them on for hours though.</li>
            <li> I find these a little too heavy. The thicker lashes are the heavy ones, the thinner ones are just horrible, they&#x27;re plastic lashes. Yes.,.. Plastic!</li>
            <li> Came at the expected time because it was sent from a didferent country. For the price I paid it is a great deal for my girls to play with when they do their cosplay.</li>
            <li> These were awful.They were for a baby doll not a live person.I will never buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> There is a White band on back of the lashes and it is a big no0o0o0!! They aren&#x27;t realistic at all</li>
            <li> I like them they are fine. But I can feel they are not human. U can&#x27;t beat the price tho. I&#x27;ll never run out with these bad boys.thanks!</li>
            <li> Lots of lashes for little money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see why these lashes get bad reviews they only cost $1 and you can always cut and reshape them to fit your eyes.</li>
            <li> They would not stay on no matter what they are really long u will look funny when wearing them so don&#x27;t get them it will be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic lashes. Used for models for a runway show ... Ok since models were far away but would not recommend for photo shoots or every day or special event use. These are crappy.</li>
            <li> Great product, takes a while to shop from China here to the USA though.  Also this kit does not come with the adhesive glue so you will have to buy some in order to use the lashes.</li>
            <li> Def gonna buy this again.</li>
            <li> it is silly to buy eyelashes at the retail stores when this double tray can do the job.  I am not the greatest at applying them of keeping them a long time.  The price point and the quality of the lashes for as often as I wear them is great.  Now I can wear them more often and hopefully get better at the application.</li>
            <li> These lashes would probably work if I have right glue, and another thing is I cannot get these to blend in with my real lashes.</li>
            <li> These are the absolute worst eye lashes I have ever seen! They feel like they were made from the stuff that you use for spiral book binders</li>
            <li> the 20 Pairs Regular Long and Thick Eyelashes Style 1 and 2 arrived as advertised and as pictured&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> If you often wear fake eyelashes this is perfect. They give you two sizes, thick and thin. They both are equally long and the quality is nice for what you pay for. They are plastic and they aren&#x27;t irritating to the eyes. I tend to prefer the thin ones, since the thick ones are very dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall they are a good quality fake eyelash.</li>
            <li> I like them a lot, might just end up ordering another set. :) I read a couple reviews saying that theirs were smashed but mine were neat &amp; perfect!!&lt;br /&gt;-Leah</li>
            <li> These lashes are actually pretty great for the price.  The package comes with two sets, I used the light set for every day use and I used the heavy set ONLY for costumes (Ballet &amp; Cosplay).  The heavy lashes are perfect when you want to make an impact - Like - drag queen impact.  :P</li>
            <li> Looks good. haven&#x27;t used yet.  Not much else to say about this product. Glue doesn&#x27;t come with it. so have to get the glue to start using it.</li>
            <li> Love the way they look and you cant beat the price.  Cant go wrong with these so give them a try.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes are not human hair! They will not hold glue to put them on. I will bit order these again.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for the price! Nice real look to them. Only wish they were a bit more bendy. They work well but takes a little practice</li>
            <li> so many compliments AND THOUGHT THEY WHERE REAL I WLD RECCOMEND THESE.... I WOULD BUY THESES AGAIN AND AGAIN YES</li>
            <li> So pretty for the nights you just want to doll up. You can&#x27;t beat the price. The quality is great. they spend money on the quality of the lashes and not the packaging, which is perfect and great from my point of view. I bet that&#x27;s why the price is able to stay low. Now me and my friends have lashes when we decide to Cleopatra ourselves up on fun girls nights. I always wanted to try fake lashes and now I bought a whole bunches for less than one pair I can purchase from the local drug store. I really recommend. Thank you so much. The lashes are gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who has small, thinner eyelash and wants a blinged out dramatic eye look.Its Packed With Full eyelashes and it gives a variety of eyelashes to try.</li>
            <li> I really like them! I would suggest to cut them in half and only apply them to your outer corner for a less dramatic look. They are great for only 2 dollars!</li>
            <li> They are plastic, and they are very long, you will have to cut them to fit your personal needs but other thab that, they are okay! I&#x27;ve had better but for the price AND FREE SHIPPING, you get a bargain for sure!</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are of good quality, concidering the price. The thickest set might look a bit like plastic, but with a little mascara, the problem is solved. The more natural looking set are really beautiful and wearable, both for parties and regular days when you feel like looking a little bit luxurious!</li>
            <li> I got more then I for a great price. I will be buying more for my cousin who is a make up artiest.</li>
            <li> Even after cutting them to the correct length, and using eyelash glue I&#x27;ve never had issues with, these will not stick to my eyelid. They seem to want to spring back into an almost straight line.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Good product.</li>
            <li> My girl friend loved it!</li>
            <li> In this product, they sent me two types of eyelashes. One box looked sort of natural and the other box looked like snooki eyelashes (not natural at ALL). So I only wear the sort of natural ones for length. I am pretty satisfied with those, because I didn&#x27;t spend so much money on them. My first day wearin them, they fell off and wouldn&#x27;t stick. So after a couple coats of my glue on them, they work fine. I just wish they were made from human hair and weren&#x27;t synthetic :/</li>
            <li> These lashes are light and flexible which is an awesome quality in lashes. They are cute and come in a large enough size that they can fit my eyes.</li>
            <li> These lashes came on time but they are cheaply made and do not sit on the eyelid at all.&lt;br /&gt;They are a good deal if you have time to mess with them but by no means are they user friendly.</li>
            <li> Too long and kinda looks plastic when your eye lids are lowered.</li>
            <li> They are really shift&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need A LOT of glue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth it if you wear these a lot</li>
            <li> Perfect! The item was a little damaged but other than that it was perfect</li>
            <li> they are ok to learn with but but are very thin</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Threw it away. Very bad quality.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!!</li>
            <li> Light weight and perfect for &amp;#34;night time&amp;#34; lashes and also &amp;#34;day time&amp;#34; lashes.</li>
            <li> The lashes are very nice. Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> i love these lashes. Came earlier than expected and also stay on all day ... and i like how dramatic they are.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the thinner lashes they look so natural but make my lashes look great. And they are soo cheap. The thicker ones are definitely more dramatic you would need to cut them but you can&#x27;t go wrong with the price I&#x27;ll definitely be buying these again! They did take awhile to come in but not any longer than the estimated time of arrival.</li>
            <li> Awesome price great value! These will give me time to practice and not worry about waisting my money. Very Happy</li>
            <li> Only order if you have experience with false eyelashes.  Otherwise, great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> the title is pretty self explanatory. Im satisfied with this product and I&#x27;m satisfied with the seller. We&#x27;ll be ordering more after I use these bad boys up</li>
            <li> It is very nice useful stuff - It is very nice useful stuff - It is very nice useful stuff</li>
            <li> My wife loved them and said they were better than wat she use to buy thank u ...satisfied customer</li>
            <li> Horrible. Worst product ever. They are pure plastic.</li>
            <li> I was surprised on how well the lashes hold and look. They feel a little plastic but once I wore one set I&#x27;m hooked. Definitely buying more.</li>
            <li> Perfect eyelashes for any occasion. Packaged beautifully!!! The only thing that I wish was different would be including lash glue!</li>
            <li> liked it, it was easy to practice on how to used lashes so i will recommmend this product to everone</li>
            <li> I bought these false eyelashes just for fun. Are they the greatest ever? No. But the work fine and they don&#x27;t look ridiculous. Definitely worth the few bucks I spent on them. Shipping was quick. I would buy from this seller again for sure!</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my glamorous daughter....she gave them a thumbs up so that made me feel good about the surprise purchase....</li>
            <li> They have to be modified a bit, and the lash line is thick, but other wise, good steal, especially if you wear falsies a lot and don&#x27;t re-use them</li>
            <li> i ordered this and it came a week later and they are very realistic. they come just as seen in the picture. very impressive.</li>
            <li> This is another overseas product that takes 2+ weeks to come in.  They are very plastic looking and feeling and almost impossible to attach (for me- this is my opinion).  After trying multiple pairs of the thicker lashes (the thinner ones on the right look too fake/plastic to even bother with), I tossed these in my closet and forgot about them.  I&#x27;ll stick with the name brand lashes from here on out.</li>
            <li> This was a very good price for 20 pairs of eyelashes. I used the thin one on a daily bases and the thicker ones when im on a night out to add a little glam. The strips, however; was very difficult to manage because it was so thick and hard to bend and form to the eye lash lines.</li>
            <li> These are ok.  They aren&#x27;t the best quality but for the price you can&#x27;t complain too much.  I would get them possibly again.  I could only wear a pair one time and then throw it away.</li>
            <li> The quantity and quality of the eye lashes is great. Wish they came with the glue and instructions for applying .</li>
            <li> i would def buy these again, these are def ones you cant re use over and over.they are one use only they look good on.</li>
            <li> Love the Price, Love the Natural looking lashes they blend easily with my natural lashes. The bolder lashes are not easily blended with natural lases and they are not as flexible. They are not for everyday wear.  I have used all of the other lashes except the bold ones. Ill save those for Halloween to create some really dramatic looks!</li>
            <li> These are just as good as the ones I buy at Walmart for $5 a pair. I love these and it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
            <li> Really cheap of course, but totally not what I was expecting, not the everyday false lashes I as hoping for. These would be perfect for drag queens though! Beware: very very longggg!</li>
            <li> do not buy them they are very stiff and difficult to put on plus shipping took forever but I would recommend not to purchase</li>
            <li> Only received HALF of my order,  and these eyelashes are for someone with huge eyes. Also, lashes are way way too long,  and do not adhere well.</li>
            <li> My lashes came in a basic white box. It was smooshed from shipping, but all the lashes were in tact. They are very straight so you will need to spend a little bit of time bending them to adhere better to your eye shape. With a good quality lash adhesive, these aren&#x27;t bad! And the price is a steal.</li>
            <li> The thick ones are a bit too dramatic, the small ones are great as long as you curl them with a pencil and trim them appropriately.</li>
            <li> I thought they would have been okay with the thick bands but they were terrible, they kept popping off. I absolutely hate putting bad news and I didn&#x27;t even bother returning because they were only $2 still would not bother purchasing save your two bucks and use it towards buying two ice teas.</li>
            <li> These are a great buy. They are exactly what you would expect them to be. They don&#x27;t feel or look cheap. They are just very big. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that they took a month the to ship. They came from China though so makes sense but is annoying for impatient people.</li>
            <li> They were okay , they both look very plasticky but they were 2$ so i guess it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I like them just need to buy new glue</li>
            <li> These are too thick and just poorly made. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> They are too hard to put on your eyes. Cheap but couldn&#x27;t use at all. Waste my time.&lt;br /&gt;Did complain&amp; they said they r gonna return my money, but then they never did it.&lt;br /&gt;Poor quality, poor service.</li>
            <li> The lashes are nice but I wore them for stage and not for normal daily wear.  I had to &amp;#34;stack&amp;#34; 2-3 pairs for the play that I was in but for daily street wear they are ok, the lashes are made more out of  plasticky material rather than actual hair. PRO TIP: After removing these from container cut off each end tab and wiggle/roll that lash to conform it to the shape of the eye, some trimming may be needed as all lashes come standard and you may have to adjust to fit your own eyes.</li>
            <li> they are awsome! best $2 purchase i couldve made</li>
            <li> Omg I love these lashes I would recommend them to my girls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I ordered and is fine.</li>
            <li> Very thin band. Lashes feel like plastic. Disappointed in the product overall</li>
            <li> They are very long which is fixable and they also looks very fake especially the thick ones.  I did not use them and might give them to someone.  But since it was cheap I am not worried about it.:)</li>
            <li> I love these! I do have to trim them slightly, but they are great otherwise. They do not come with glue. I got them for show choir because the thick black ones look great on stage, but i wore the more natural ones on a daily basis!</li>
            <li> They look and feel like barbie doll lashes. Theyre uncomfortable and dont fit well... But i mean what can you expect when you spend so little?</li>
            <li> I only paid less than $4.00 for these lashes which it great! They only lasted about half the day but thats what to expect for cheap eyelashes! Great maybe for pictures but a full day of working they fall out.</li>
            <li> Love these.  Delivered fast too.  They stay on all day. N reusable for days.  I get so many complements on them......:-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used false eyelashes before so i really liked this, easy to put on and use and very pretty on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the thick eyelashes it looks so fake but the other ones are ok but I&#x27;ll recommended ones that I brought it omg I love them I got two pair of them you can put 10 pairs handmade natural soft eyelashes the best I love them I&#x27;m this type of girl that doesn&#x27;t like fake things but this eyelashes are the best ;) I love them it looks so natural people think that they&#x27;re my own I&#x27;m in love with them ;)</li>
            <li> The eyelashes are great!!!! So worth every penny i paid for them and I will be back to buy more !</li>
            <li> For the price you get a lot of lashes and they are great. I love the option of thickness and the darkness. Would recommend and would buy again.</li>
            <li> The strips have to be trimmed and the bases are pretty thick. Not for any type of natural look. I used small scizzors to taper the thicker set and they looked fun for a night out. The lashes themselves are plastic-y and not very hair like.</li>
            <li> These are just the most cheap, uncomfortable, unnatural lashes ever.  They look super plasticy, fake, silly, the lashes are stiff, and the corners will poke and irritate your eyes.  I wear lashes almost everyday and these just collected dust for months until I finally threw them out.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to anyone, don&#x27;t get pulled in by the low price and high quantity &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> I got these a little then what the seller said, but I actually like these lashes at first when it opened them they didn&#x27;t look so great then I shaped them to my eyes and trim them a little and they look great, I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t even fit on my eyes. I used eyelash glue, glued them on, held it and waited for it to dry, and then they would just pop right off. I ended up throwing them out.</li>
            <li> Haha well, I suppose you get what you pay for. Complete crap. The price was great but the box in the mail was crushed and the eyelashes were misshapen</li>
            <li> The natural ones were great! Loved them. However the thick ones were a waste. They were Huge in length and looked extremely ridiculous. If they were a bit shorter they would have been fantastic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like them at all. I guess you get what you pay for. They&#x27;re very bad quality and I&#x27;d be suprised if anyone could get these glued to their eyes.</li>
            <li> These lashes are not what I thought they were at all. The are really shiny, stiff and just look very fake on. Did not like them at all!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I dont wana give astar at all !!!!!!!!!!!!!!Lashes look too obviously fake and plastic, packaging came bent up, shipping took forever I&#x27;m just very disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> I bought expecting the photo BUT instead I receive these worthless thick costume set. I am not pleased!</li>
            <li> They are so stiff they hurt when I blink 😑</li>
            <li> there pretty but style 1 looks really shiny and does make it look even more fake. but for the price i would definetily repurchese them.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time buying these eyelashes and they are amazing! Great quality lashes, I would definitely recommend these to a friend. Which I have suggested these eyelashes to a few of my co - workers. I was skeptical at first but very happy with my purchase. I will continue to buy these. Although I dont think i will need to buy any for a while they last me more than one use and thats what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I mean the lashes were cute and all. I liked them and the way they looked on me, but the way they were organized in the box. I didnt get which lash matched which lash. That threw me off.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes arrived like 2 weeks earlier before time which is great , the natural looking eyelashes are great . The thick eyelashes kind of came a little bend but just kind of curl them by bending and they will be fine. At first i was nervous on getting them due to all the negative reviews but they are fine , totally recommend them.</li>
            <li> My lashes are in! Wonderful product, I would absolutely reorder this product in the future!&lt;br /&gt;Also the lashes are neatly secured to prevent damage. Thanks!</li>
            <li> recieved this in the mail boxes were all bent up and the lashes are terrible they r on this hard strip that is way longer than your eye and when i tried to cut the excess it was not cutting very well dont recommend theses i guess you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> like the different kinds of lashes in this product both are very beautiful on and they are both sturdy so I was very happy!</li>
            <li> Best quality for such a small price, it comes with the exact picture, before you put them on, cut the ends off and they are perfect.! Came WAYYY sooner then expected (:</li>
            <li> At this price this is a great buy. The lashes are great and full . I would buy them again and again!!!</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for. The good great price for 20 pairs of lashes. The bad: chuncks of lashes easily comes of the strip. If you want lashes that are not reuseable than this is a good purchase for you.</li>
            <li> I bought these because of the price and free shipping. however, they are super poor quality, the plastic is tough and doesnt bend well to the curve of the lid, making application very difficult. Had to hold lash in place for glue to dry for waaaaay to long. NOT RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> These lashes are pretty flimsy, but they don&#x27;t look cheap and are easy to put on with weave glue. They are also a bit extended so u&#x27;ll need to cut them in order for them to fit.</li>
            <li> I bought these because it was a great price for a lot of lashes. I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be too satisfied, and I wasn&#x27;t. They felt too fake. I just didn&#x27;t like them. I was taking a chance.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are very stiff, almost plastic-like. Once I&#x27;d struggled to apply them, which I did three times, they made my eyelids itch terribly. I tried them again to make sure &amp; again they itched. Even after I removed them, the itching &amp; eyelid sensitivity lasted a couple more days. On a positive note; very cute packaging. Just don&#x27;t wear them. Make art or something.</li>
            <li> They are very nice, the thinner ones are very natural looking. The thick lashes were too thick and did not stay on my eyes for more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li> looks great nice long eyelashes to look good every day. wear every day for the best look, easy to use</li>
            <li> I like them the price it good and I can totally recommend it to my friends but the packaging was not so good they came back wet but the lashes were good</li>
            <li> I wouldnt waste my time buying this again,they look horrible on and feel like pastic.Not worth the 2 or so dollars I paid for them</li>
            <li> I do not recommend these lashes. Just a few dollars more you are able to get lashes that actually glue onto your eye lids. These do not stay on.</li>
            <li> Nice lasted more on others than myself. I really didnt like the plastic material. But for the price they were pretty cool. I worked with them. Would purchase again for fun my boyfriend like them, I dont always wear these... but overall they were fun nice price.</li>
            <li> so freaking AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE SIZE OF LASH I BOUGHT FIVE PACKS GOOD DEAL LOOK NATURAL GO ON GOOD GOOD PRICE FOR LOOK</li>
            <li> These are so cheap, and a waste of your money. Just buy the regular ones! They&#x27;re waxy and plastic. Gross!</li>
            <li> They want stick. I&#x27;ve tried both pair and they keep falling off. I&#x27;ve never had this problem and its very upsetting. I will never order theses again!!!! I&#x27;ve ordered and used the Red cherry brand and they work great!!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible super plastic looking lashes. Threw them straight into the trash. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Save your money! Zero stars</li>
            <li> Was very happy with this purchase! Was just what I needed because I am a hula dancer and we use false lashes all the time, but they can b so expensive:( I was a little scared too because it was so cheap I wasn&#x27;t sure how the quality was going to be, but I am soooo happy with it! thanks amazon!!!</li>
            <li> The lashes are a little hard to apply at first, but once you get them to stick, they are firm and give you a glamorous look! The darker set is very bold, while the thinner one is more of an accent. I would totally buy again. :P&lt;br /&gt;They are great for cosplay as well. It&#x27;s good for getting that big-eye look.</li>
            <li> I love them! Their sooooo freakin cheap but actually work awesome. Second time I buy and I will continue too.</li>
            <li> It should have been sold with a glue to complete the package. Made from cheap plastic. Better buy from walmart lol for better quality</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these. They are by far the best lashes that I have used. Sturdy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> great lashes for the price</li>
            <li> these were my first lashes to ever buy and try to wear they&#x27;re pretty comfortable and there&#x27;s many so if i messed up i wouldnt really care. they look very nice and im very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Cute, easy to apply and remove. I use them to add a little volume &amp; thickness for going out. For special occasions I love to go for that doey-eyed look, these do the trick.</li>
            <li> These have lasted me ages and look fantastic! Will definitely be buying these again!</li>
            <li> Oh goodness why did I buy these haha. The band is too thick and you have to use so much glue to keep it in place. The thick ones are way way too thick they look like caterpillars but I knew that&#x27;s what I was buying. The thick is too thick and the thin is too thin. They&#x27;re pretty unwearable unless you want INSANE DRAMA like for drag or competition or something of that. As everyday wear, no not at all. The thin I wore to homecoming but I had to double stack them. All night though I didn&#x27;t cut the band short enough and an end kept poking my eye all night and I just wanted to rip it off. The thick would look pretty cool during Halloween??? Lol they&#x27;re good to play around with and stuff but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> cheap and must have for all lash lovers</li>
            <li> When you first see the lashes they look very cheap ( kinda expected based on the price) but once they&#x27;re applied they actually look good.</li>
            <li> These are made completely of semi hard plastic including the part you are to glue to your lid. They hurt to wear.</li>
            <li> Cannot really get these to glue or stay on...</li>
            <li> Cheap ass eyelashes very plastic like and the strip is hella hard, do not buy this crap</li>
            <li> Amazing, especially for the price. They&#x27;re perfect.</li>
            <li> Good if you starting out with falesie</li>
            <li> Not the best quality of lashes, but they definetly don&#x27;t look bad. Also for that price it&#x27;s an amazing deal!</li>
            <li> I could never get them on and poked in the corner plus felt horrible in my eyes</li>
            <li> Great price for good quality - can&#x27;t beat the value of this!</li>
            <li> What is good, it is too long, with you very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Overall is good.</li>
            <li> Very cheap... Wouldn&#x27;t shape to my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes took almost 2 months to arrive and the lashes wasn&#x27;t what I expected and used to.</li>
            <li> I mean they are $2 so I didn&#x27;t expect them to be that great. I may use the regular lashes if i run out but the thick lashes look ridiculous. I&#x27;m not mad I bought them but wouldn&#x27;t buy from here again.</li>
            <li> Tryd the regular look and I&#x27;m IN LOVE!! shipping took too long but you get what u paid</li>
            <li> I hate it I guess you get what you paid for</li>
            <li> I absolutely hated these. Waste!  These deserve no stars.</li>
            <li> They take forever to arrive, but they are really great false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> They give you two different types of false lashes for a pretty good price!. Slow shipping though,but other then that I love it !</li>
            <li> I like it only down side is it doesn&#x27;t come with glue</li>
            <li> As eyelashes they were ok but they don&#x27;t stay on your eyes they straight and no flexibly bend .... I will not spend money on this product again</li>
            <li> they are stiff and hard to put on</li>
            <li> I liked them. They are good and come in a bunch. The band is pretty thick and they stay nicely on my lashes. I like them a lot for going out or just to work.</li>
            <li> They look so fake, I ended up throwing them away because of it! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, such a disappointment</li>
            <li> they are okay i mean they look so plastic but i excepted so it is fine</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommend these lashes to me because she knows I&#x27;m starting to get more females asking me to do their makeup. They worked out grate! Some girls want the thick looking ones and others like the more natural look so getting both set for this price is a deal! I look at them as disposable, one time use type of lashes.</li>
            <li> Really wish I didn&#x27;t buy this. it looks nothing how it looks in the picture. it&#x27;s not a band on the lashes , it&#x27;s string to keep the lashes together. it&#x27;s horrible. not worth buying at all.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes!  Especially the dark, pointed ones!  Look great!  Great what you pay for them..  they are a little hard to get out of the box, but a little tug and you&#x27;ll be fine. You do have to trim the threads off the end and bend to fit your eye.  I love them, and I will definitely be buying them again.</li>
            <li> Just lke they look in da pic.they or soft &amp; supa easy to apply ad take off as well .they last a lil min too. Hold up gud in anyweather.no problem in the winter WIND..I live in chicago soo U no Hw it gets.WINDY CITY....LOL FOR REAL If u get them wet its OK they will still stay in place ladies. I lke to wear two sets at a time..I love dat BIG BOLD GLAM LOOK.YASSSS GOD.</li>
            <li> They are too thick and they don&#x27;t look natural at all. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s alright for some faces but they surely don&#x27;t go with mine</li>
            <li> That is what I want. It is not too bad. I will buy other one if I run out this.</li>
            <li> The price and delivery rate were better than expected.  I was pleasantly surprised with how fast they came in the mail (within a couple of days) and how little I had to pay (a few dollars).  There are plenty of lashes for me to use and I like that I have the choice for dramatic or more natural looking.  They are organized nicely which makes them easy to store.  I&#x27;ve been using these for quite some time and I&#x27;m still very happy with this product.  It&#x27;s great that I can reuse the lashes a few times if I clean them properly.  I highly recommend this product.  When I run out I most definitely will get more from them.  The only downside (if I had to make one) is this product didn&#x27;t come with eyelash glue but that didn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Love it. They are as they say and for cheap too! Don&#x27;t miss out of a wonderful pair of lashes and A LOT OF THEM!</li>
            <li> As described, arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> Only giving it three stars because the more dramatic eyelashes don&#x27;t really stick on &amp; aren&#x27;t super dramatic when their on. But the natural looking ones are great!! :)</li>
            <li> Some are good, some are mehhhh</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re perfeft other than the strings I have to cut off</li>
            <li> Plastic not human hair as I expected, the don&#x27;t stick to eyelashes very well</li>
            <li> They took about three and a half weeks to arrive, no surprise being that they came from Hong Kong. (They don&#x27;t come with glue so make sure you order some or pick it up somewhere.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people didn&#x27;t like the thick ones, but they&#x27;re everyday to me. They&#x27;re less thick than the picture depicts. I&#x27;m very happy with them, they&#x27;re perfect and for that price, I&#x27;m considering ordering another shipment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to know how to apply false lashes to make them look good. Anyone complaining they don&#x27;t fit - cut them to size. They aren&#x27;t really &amp;#34;ready to wear.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> these are awesome!! you cannot go wrong for the price..i cut them in half and only wear them in the corner to create a cat eyeliner and ive gotten SOOO MANY COMPLIMENTS.</li>
            <li> The customer service in this company is incredible kind, this eyelashes are so nice for two dollar the only problem that I had is that it took so long to send, I&#x27;m very impatient person, but again it&#x27;s 2 dollars, highly recommend them, easy to put on if you have put eyelashes before, I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> The lashes are very stiff and hard to get them to stick on an stay.  Granted they were only a few dollars, so I don&#x27;t feel too bad they didn&#x27;t work as good as expected.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend  these.&lt;br /&gt;Poor quality/&lt;br /&gt;Not easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The thicker ones are impossible to work with because the &amp;#34;seem&amp;#34; of the eyelash does bend enough to shape to the eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;The thinner ones are better but the extra lining is pointless and makes it hard to attach.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend cutting the ends.&lt;br /&gt;Ive had these for months and I do not even use them.</li>
            <li> I loved this package.  The less thick and dressy looked natural, and the big black were great for costumes or dressing up.  I love false eye lashes, so it was convent to buy a set of 40 natural and bold lashes.  They were both made with synthetic material, if the items were made with real-human hair not synthetic, this would be perfect.  To ladies (and men) who are just starting to wear lashes, or don&#x27;t wear lashes regularly, purchasing some lashes made of either real human hair or mink fur(very expensive) is a better transition.  This lashes are synthetic, and if you are not used too falsies, this product (especially the thick lashes) are INTENSE, BOLD, TOTALLY GLAMOUROUS, but can over whelm some people. It depends on a person&#x27;s personal preference, if anything try em&#x27; and you&#x27;ll end up loving them.</li>
            <li> They where shipped promptly and arrived almost two weeks before it was supposed to be&lt;br /&gt;The eyelashes are great for the price and arrived in great shape&lt;br /&gt;Overall its good :)</li>
            <li> really cheap plastic material and really long. Dont recommend them. But they are cheap so i guess its what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Ok, I am absolutely in LOVE with false EYELASHES!!!!! These lashes are ok!! They do the job when I can&#x27;t make it to the beauty supply store to purchase my normal brand lashes. The thing that make these lashes just ok, is the fact that it&#x27;s just too stiff and not flexible enough when you want  to apply it to your eyes. It&#x27;s VERY STIFF!!!! But hey, look at that amazing price you paid for them! You get what you pay for!!! I also didn&#x27;t like how long it took for me to get them. But otherwise then that, they are in fact &amp;#34;Doable&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> they were came perfectly packed and just on the date said! they look beautiful all though you do have to cut the ends to fit your eyes they still work and look great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so happy with the packaging. It was cheaply made the bold lashes are a little bolder than my taste. But I do love the natural lashes, they&#x27;re so nice.</li>
            <li> These are awesome!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this exactly what is shown in pic!!</li>
            <li> this product is pretty much plastic. I don&#x27;t really like the texture of this product, but hey you get what you paid for. Im just used to falsies that have real hair and this was a step back for me. some people can get away with these kinds of eyelashes and unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t able to pull it off.</li>
            <li> I like the thicker ones besides for the fact they tend to come off at the ends after a while, the thinner ones look horrible, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> These lashes are awesome. The ones I get in stores are way more expencive and uncomfortable. I do a living doll dress up at least twice a week, and these are perfect. I love them so much but u do have to buy your own adhesive which I&#x27;d suggest getting black so it mixes better. But I LOVE them</li>
            <li> Although i loved the price of these and you got alot pairs. I wasnt expecting them to be so plastic.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are great except for a couple of thing. You have to be able to put eyelashes on pretty near perfect. And the width of them you have to cut to fit your eyes, which I&#x27;ve never had to do before with my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> i use these for doll lashes on my B.J.Ds and they are so awesome  and so much cheaper then one pair !! so YAY!!</li>
            <li> over all I liked my eyelashes it just took them forever to get here but the product was good and they give you so many at a decent price!</li>
            <li> It can be a little too long but I cut the lashes in half and put the long ends on each eye so essentially i have 40 pairs and its great. Those are my tips to those who buy them. Great Demi lashes!</li>
            <li> LOVE the lashes came exactly as shown in the picture love being able to change my lashes whenever i want</li>
            <li> Love these! They are so cheap too!</li>
            <li> Eyelashes are horrible, 1, took to long for them to arrive. 2, when I recieved them, they were too fake looking even the natural ones. 3 so plastic can&#x27;t even put them on. Do Not Purchase these, they are a rip off, Do Not Waste Your Money......</li>
            <li> these eyelashes are horrible so stiff so hard to put on ugh! big mistake ordering... never again! ugly ugly ugly!!</li>
            <li> They came just on time, a but squished, but not ruined. Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The price of my twenty eye lashes was pleasantly suprising!!! I couldnt believe how inexpensive they were for as many of them there were!!!</li>
            <li> These are worth the price, dirt cheap because they are dirty poor in quality, I&#x27;ll give you that much. I tried to give them a chance, but they are so stiff it is hard to keep them on because they do not take the natural curve form of your eye, so they like to pop off or maintain a real awkward and unsightly position. Not worth it, move on.</li>
            <li> do not buy if you have big eyes they will not fit, they are also really short in length they look like normal lashes</li>
            <li> girlfriend didnt like them, she said they were too stiff.. but i really don&#x27;t care cause they weren&#x27;t for me</li>
            <li> I ordered my lashes months and months ago, and never got a thing. I kept emailing the providers and they said it may have got lost in the mail. I asked for my money back and they said they will give it back and they never did. A few weeks ago I got a plastic bag ripped open with nothing in it. Im assuming my lashes were sapost to be in there. there is no urgency with these people. Id recommend not buying from them because if this happens to you, they probably wont do anything about it. No lashes no money !</li>
            <li> I like these so much cause they really last me a long time, they&#x27;re long for my eyes so I cut each strand of lashes in half, and use one half of a strip on the outer ends of my eyes instead and it&#x27;s an awesome process so far, couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything better for the price</li>
            <li> I loved getting these, they look great with my lolita looks. They came just as shown in the picture, depending on how big your eyes are you will probably have to trim off some of the lashes to fit your eyes.</li>
            <li> these are not as advertised...definately not real looking, they look like plastic actually. and they arrived all bent up from poor packaging. i cant find anyone who will even take them for free. i dont think anyone would want these lashes. the worst ive ever seen..honestly</li>
            <li> These lashes are kind of a pain to put on.. I would rather spend the extra money on walmart lashes.</li>
            <li> Waste of money! They don&#x27;t stay on to save your life. And they are very itchy! Save the MONEY! Don&#x27;t buy these pieces of crap!</li>
            <li> I like these lashes although they come with the other type of lashes I don&#x27;t use. I like em anyway</li>
            <li> so worth the $$. I don&#x27;t wear lashes often but if you like to this is the best way to get them- three cute styles too! lots of lashes!! Great quality, cuter than the more expensive ones that i find in stores.</li>
            <li> Took a month to get n when I finally recieved the lashes where sooooo hard felt like sythenthic hair. Didnt like n neva use again</li>
            <li> They look like plastic its not what I expected</li>
            <li> Product came in a little over two weeks, they are very nice.</li>
            <li> So first, the product was delivered pretty fast considering the fact that it ships from China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about the product..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thinner ones are not that long. To me, it looks very thin and quite short, but it is great for bottom lashes or layering!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thicker ones are a little thick to me, but it&#x27;s great for parties and also great for demi-lashes if you cut them in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of the lash has a thick lining and it&#x27;s quite stiff. Even though the lining is thick, it wouldn&#x27;t show when you put them on. If you like softer lashes, it will get softer after you use it repeatedly. But, if you want it to be soft right away, I suggest to kind of bend the lining a little bit or use eyelash curler softly so that it&#x27;s a little bit more flexible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite way to wear these lashes are combining the thinner ones and then layer it with the thicker ones as a demi-lash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is manageable and can be flattering when used the right way. But i&#x27;m not giving this 5 star because of the stiffness and the thick lining.</li>
            <li> the thin ones aren&#x27;t that great but in love with the thick ones always a fun time</li>
            <li> They are made of plastic and are really harsh on the eyes. They don&#x27;t bend, so I had to put a lot of glue to stick it to my eye and it wasn&#x27;t natural at all. I don&#x27;t recommend it, cause even though it&#x27;s cheap, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try some falsies on. So I had to get in on this deal. What a steal</li>
            <li> They are good for the price i payed! I realy do enjoy them</li>
            <li> I have used all sorts of lashes my favorite being Ardell but too expensive. These are cheap and the same material as the more expensive Ardell lashes. I got my within 2 weeks as well which made the even more worth it!</li>
            <li> they took a while to ship, and theyre hard to shape on your eye. but once you get them on they look really good!</li>
            <li> Full, long, thick lashes are always in style, but applying false lashes daily isn’t always practical and is very time consuming.  So finding a way to get the look of fake lashes without actually having to take the time to glue them on is life changing! I think that this would be a really smart buy for anyone who craves really dramatic lashes but either can’t wear false lashes, or don’t have the time to apply falsies in their daily routine. Visit my site and message me for details, I am more than happy to share my before and afters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youniqueproducts.com/maggiePaquette/</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed 2 see that the shipping would takea month, also when I got them they looked really plastic. . Not good. . Next time I will look further into what I am purchasing. ..</li>
            <li> if you are buying these have a pair of scissors on hand because the have this part on each side of the lash that needs to be cut off .</li>
            <li> They are a really hard to do anything with. Stiff and plastic! But delivery was quick</li>
            <li> They feel plastic and they are difficult to keep in place.</li>
            <li> Love these and they were a great deal.</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality considering the price</li>
            <li> I love them there light and looks good it took a long time to get them but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVED THEM GREAT LENGTH &amp; THICKNESS</li>
            <li> They are nice lashes. The lighter ones can be for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;Please expect lashes to be delivered in more than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not great with false lashes (just started using them) but so far really good just need more practice!</li>
            <li> They are good if you are looking for a lot of quantity at a good price. They look a little cheap, but once applied they look great!</li>
            <li> A very nice collection,</li>
            <li> I did not like the thicker eye lashes however the thinner ones were awesome!</li>
            <li> Yes these are awesome. Great lashes especially for the price. Will be purchasing more</li>
            <li> They look incredibly fake</li>
            <li> Very synthetic and hard to apply</li>
            <li> Poor quality, I&#x27;d stick to Red Cherry #43 lashes, amaaaazing price and value, these ones are just...two thumbs down. :(</li>
            <li> 3/10 for these lashes, terribly uncomfortable, they won&#x27;t stay concaved like lashes are supposed to be so I&#x27;m constantly having to re-glue my inner corner of the eyelash, they feel very plastic like and are itchy if not trimmed to tailor fit to your eye shape. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> The band was so hard. You can not keep them on your eyes and they hurt. I do not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> I ordered these false lashes because I thought, hey, why not! since they were very cheap and I wanted to try them out. They weren&#x27;t anything special; personally I would never wear them for anything serious or formal. The most I would do is wear them for a costume party or festival or halloween. The lashes feel very plastic and flimsy and do not retain their shape at all. They are also very long so you have to trim them unless you have exceptionally long eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I would not order again but I still have many of them left. They are okay if you want something cheap in money and quality, but I would not recommend them for serious or daily use. You are better off seeking other false lash products.</li>
            <li> Love love love!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must have!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only &#x27;con&#x27; is that it took a very long time to arrive, I live New York, but I was told it would take about 15-20 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it was worth the wait!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great lashes!</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are GREAT!!!!!! This is one of the best deals that I have received from Amazon. I will definitely be ordering more of these lashes!!!! I have being wearing and sharing them since I got them in the mail. I just wish their were more choices.</li>
            <li> Came in quickly, and they are nice</li>
            <li> Very economical way to buy false eyelashes.  I cut mine down a little, as I usually do and they worked fine.  They are not tapered , but you can do that yourself.  These are a good deal.  The shipment was very fast too.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like them as not looks good.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these lashes</li>
            <li> Love bulk lashes! I really order these for myself as i like to create artistic looks with makeup. I sometimes use them on client and i find they  wear well.</li>
            <li> Love them! Really I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much from them but they are pretty good they last long, you can reuse them, they are easy to put on, looks great. I&#x27;m just living them right now!</li>
            <li> They fit well and look natural</li>
            <li> They came in way before the due date. They&#x27;re really nice for the price! If you&#x27;re just wanting to experiment or don&#x27;t want to spend too much money on false eyelashes than I recommend these! I had no problem with packaging or any other problems. Definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this pack. It has enabled me to practice and makes the eyes snap!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these lashes. They are the only ones I will buy! I can shape them for my eye and they are perfect length and look I&#x27;m going for!</li>
            <li> you honestly get what you pay for. they dont stick to eyes regardless of glue used. the packaging was bent and out of shape. they are plastic eyelashes. its completely terrible. NOT WORTH THE BUY!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> Took very long for them product to arrive. I had actually forgotten that I had even purchased them. They look very nice.</li>
            <li> Love these. Came in faster that what I had thought. And looked great im the box. Had to cut a little to fit but thats like most lashes! Will deff be ordering again!  :)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay wouldn&#x27;t get them again and I haven&#x27;t used one but they&#x27;re use able lol.</li>
            <li> I love these. I ought Revelon Eyelash Adhesive and add that to these lashes and they last to about 2-3 days even with showering. I use false lashes a lot and these are pretty good especially for they&#x27;re price. I recommend these. You just need good glue. The thicker ones are more dramatic but the thinner ones look more fake. I use both on a daily basis and am ordering more. 20 pairs of lashes for $2 is great. 10 cents a lash compared to $5 dollar per lash.</li>
            <li> Got a lot of lashes for a small price, Great deal.</li>
            <li> The ugliest lashes ever</li>
            <li> Not all that. The lash strip is really stiff Wont bend that well to glue the corners of the eye</li>
            <li> perfect perfect perfect</li>
            <li> Horrible horrible horrible.</li>
            <li> All the same wish had more of a variety</li>
            <li> Really cute and nice looking :)</li>
            <li> let me make this plain and simple... They are awful and don&#x27;t stay on your eye</li>
            <li> Love then they don&#x27;t even look fake once there on</li>
            <li> One set of the lashes have a very unattractive white band. Other than that the lashes are usable and fairly easy to put on.</li>
            <li> The lashes arrived on time and in perfect condition. They are great for the price. Highly recommend. I will buy again when I run out</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be plastic..nor how long it took...However with time they last and held their form..I will reorder them for sure.</li>
            <li> Loved the thicker, darker ones. The thinner onea didn&#x27;t look normal. But good product!</li>
            <li> For the price of $3 it&#x27;s really worth it for the 20 pairs. The lashes don&#x27;t come with adhesive so you will have to buy your own, the lashes are kind of flat but if you wrap the lashes around a pencil and hold them like that for several seconds then the shape becomes more rounded, and you will have to cut off the ends with scissors. This takes a few tries before you get really efficient at it but the lashes look beautiful when you have them on and I would recommend them to people who frequently use lashes.</li>
            <li> lashes are so worth more. love them!</li>
            <li> Where do i begin? Well first of all, the lashes look so plastic. The band of the lashes is very stiff feeling and kind of feels like a wire. The lashes did not conform to my lid at all, the end of it kept sticking up no matter what i did or how much glue i used. They just look terrible. The thick lashes on the other hand, i did not even try on. They are so ghetto looking, looks even more plastic then the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ones. The thick lashes are hands down UNWEARABLE, unless you want to look like some sort of cheap hooker. You really get what you pay for, for these lashes. Save yourself a few dollars and do not buy these horrible quality lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good deal for the price. I&#x27;ll have fake lashes to last me for months.</li>
            <li> These were so terrible they looked like plastic!! save your money and do not buy these!! i really don&#x27;t know why i did!!</li>
            <li> These are more stiff than lashes I&#x27;ve tried before &amp; therefore harder to put on, as well as stay on. Just carry some lash glue with you in case you need to reapply. Mine came up on the sides after a few hours &amp; I had to add more glue.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different lashes but these are by far the best And the price is amazing</li>
            <li> The eyelashes felt like plastic. They were warped and didn&#x27;t stick with eyelash glue. Will never purchase again.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes are plastic like costume lashes I thought they were real lashes the worst. They are absolutely tacky I thought I was being pranked when I opened tge case so I threw them away.</li>
            <li> I wrote into the company and you said you would fix the problem, and ive been waiting but nothing has ever been done</li>
            <li> was very excited to wear these. Not so pleased with how stiff they are!you need to apply a lot of glue in order for them to stick,and you have to wait a little longer for the glue to become tacky. Took a few weeks to ship and some of the lashes were all bent and ruined in the package. decent eyelashes but dont plan on ordering any more of these in the future</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are great for the value. I would recommend them to anyone who likes to wear fake eyelashes  either daily, or for costumes.</li>
            <li> What a great price for such a large supply!</li>
            <li> they look just like the picture, but i havent use them, but i guess its only for 1 use per eyes lashes... anyway the price its good</li>
            <li> These are the worst lashes I have ever bought.  They are poor quality and a horrible design!!! They literally look like plastic lashes.</li>
            <li> The lashes come in a box where they lay flat, so they don&#x27;t mold to your eyes the way they should. Because of that they do not stay on all day, always coming off in the corners.</li>
            <li> The hair looks so fake.</li>
            <li> Trim off the ends as they are a little long...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works perfectly with Ardell invisible or black glue.  Love buying these in bulk as I never like to rewear them</li>
            <li> They packaging wasn&#x27;t so ooo and aahhh although the lashes themselves are. They work when doing Lolita style as well.</li>
            <li> Very soft and they look strong got them in a few hours ago. No glue but I don&#x27;t think it said it would include that so really good! Super excited to use them for sakura-con THANK YOUUUU!!</li>
            <li> Good price for amount - they r well made. Only drawback it does ship from China so it takes a very long time to get.</li>
            <li> i glue them with hair glue... i love them. they r the easiest i have ever been able to apply.. i used the dramatic looking ones and they looked good and not too crazy. i reccommend. good price. u have to cut off the ends cuz they have tabs like at the end for storage purposes. but i removed them and resused them. they r great!!</li>
            <li> These lashes a bit bit rough since the bands are dark plastic.&lt;br /&gt;I really think these are great, and they arrived way earlier then the &amp;#34;estimated time&amp;#34; and they arrived in tact. For a cutesy look, day or night.  They have no flare, and are not super reusable, but they&#x27;re cute and cheap.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried them out yet, but they are more plastic so I&#x27;m not overly impressed as of yet.. But they were cheap so no complaints there!</li>
            <li> Took longer than expected but so worth the wait! I love them!!! I didn&#x27;t have to cut them or anything they fit fine. I just glue them on and GO! Very durable lashes usually if I wear lashes after awhile they start to fall apart and so on but I&#x27;ve worn two different pairs well over 12 times all day at work to the gym whatever! They are still together and I clean them and place them back I still have 18 freaking left so I have no need to buy anymore anytime soon! Awesome lashes I would purchase them again most definitely</li>
            <li> These are great false lashes.. for the price (and in general). I notice some of the review pics don&#x27;t sell the product and some reviews were terrible too. I bought type 5 and they took about 4 weeks to arrive. One pair looks really subtle and the other very bold. If you don&#x27;t have great lashes then curl your lashes before you apply the falsies. Don&#x27;t be disappointed if they aren&#x27;t what you like, they were a great deal at $2</li>
            <li> Affordable, but not really happy with my purchase. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. Sometimes you get what you pay for and thats all there is to it.</li>
            <li> I love love love!!!!!  ThEse eyelashes</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain about the amount of lashes for the price however the material reflects the price of the item, but i still get great use out of them.</li>
            <li> Too flimsy and wouldn&#x27;t latch on to my eyes weren&#x27;t curved enough to wrap around my eyes. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the thinner lashes, they glue on easy and blend in nicely!&lt;br /&gt;The thicker ones on the other hand....ehhhhh.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s just say I don&#x27;t like to look like tweety bird.&lt;br /&gt;The price is amazing so just try them for yourself :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this item twice now. Both sets of lashes have a bit excess band on the edges which keep them in the packaging, but those can easily be snipped off. Occasionally the band will come off my eye a bit, even though I glue and apply them well. When I apply them as demi lashes, however, they stay on perfectly. Overall, I&#x27;d say the product is very good for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thicker lashes (Style 1) can look pretty fake, and I don&#x27;t really use them because of this. They look quite shiny. Also, dramatic lashes like these ones aren&#x27;t what I personally prefer. However, if you&#x27;re into dramatic lashes and you are looking for some cheap ones, these are a good option for you. Just make sure to glue them well and possibly bring your glue with you to prevent them from falling off.&lt;br /&gt;The thinner, more natural lashes (Style 2) are my absolute favorite. I use them as demi lashes on the corners of my eyes, so I&#x27;ll cut the bands in half (or even 1/3 of the length of the band, for a more natural look) and use each half for each eye. These lashes are great for wearing as demi since they don&#x27;t fall off and look incredibly natural. I wear these on an almost daily basis since these are so much easier to apply rather than layering on coats of mascara. Also, since I&#x27;m asian and my lashes are pretty puny, these are a great item to really enhance your eyes. I don&#x27;t apply mascara to these false lashes and so for me, they last a very long time. The 20 pair of the natural lashes have lasted me for months when I use them as demi lashes.</li>
            <li> Finally received my lashes. Was not pleased the lashes do not hold once applied. I use DUO LASH GLUE which is very good glue, but not very good with these type lashes. The plastic on the lashes I think is to hard and thick to bend and this is what cause the lashes to lift. Far as the looks they are great. just disappointed they don&#x27;t hold :0( . but for the price what do you expect. Looks can be deceiving. YOU GET WHAT U PAY FOR</li>
            <li> I really love these fake eyelashes whether it&#x27;s the thick ones or thin ones they are both awesome. My only concern is that once in a while the thick ones are defective.</li>
            <li> oh my gosh i was so surprised when i got these!!! they are STUNNING quiality for the price! they look so cute and are VERY comfortable! The only thing is they did come crushed in the mail but besides that im so impressed like holy cow!! these are perfect! i never have to buy eyelashes ever again!! and the different styles and they dont look too long, nor too thin, nor too thick, nor too fake, They&#x27;re absolutely perfect!! can i give them 10 stars?!?</li>
            <li> PLASTIC these are no good</li>
            <li> These were pretty nice but they are actually almost like a plastic which was kind of weird. For the price it was an excellent purchase but I will have to do a followup once I actually use them on a client.</li>
            <li> the lashes were like barbie doll eyelashes. they looked fake. i have not wore them them simply because they do not look natural</li>
            <li> i love them very soft touch</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t come in the most protected cases. So I had to throw out a pair that was ruined. The other pairs were sustainable.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read seem to give these such a negative review. I have purchased this twice now for my daughter. She loves them. She has had to cut a few down to size, but that is pretty much with any of them. If you&#x27;re looking for eyelashes that look completely real then these are not for you. My daughter has her own unique look. He hair is aqua and lime green. Her clothes are her own personality and her makeup is a little too edgy for some people. When we go to the store she gets a lot of good compliments and a lot of stares and whispers from other people. The point it, these go well with her look. I couldn&#x27;t go wrong for the price. Once we received the first shipment and she me how much she likes them I just ordered two more. It takes a while to make it overseas but I&#x27;ve always gotten them way before the predicted delivery timeframe. Oh and by the way, if you are wanting an even thicker, longer look. but not a big thick look you can layer two thin pairs and it gives you a nice look.&lt;br /&gt;In closing, if you are looking for extravagant, fabulous quality package of eyelashes, these are NOT for you. They work for some and not for others. I know I got tired of paying $6 a pair from Sally&#x27;s because she goes through them so much. These hold up much better than t Sally&#x27;s lashes because of what my daughter wants them for. So, I give them 5 stars. I couldn&#x27;t go wrong for the price with a girl that goes through lashes like crazy. These hold up longer. I really don&#x27;t know why those that are giving negative reviews thought that for $2 or less these lashes were going to be wispy, realistic looking lashes.</li>
            <li> These were horrible!  They look like some hacked up hair on a piece of thread. Will never order again.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> worked great for cosplay daughter</li>
            <li> LOVE IT STILL WEARING THEM ABOUT TO ORDER SOME MORE</li>
            <li> these are good practice lashes but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for a professional finished look</li>
            <li> it looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> I actually love these</li>
            <li> Very pretty and they look so real. Love them</li>
            <li> the long eyelashes are beautiful! they look super natural on and i can wear them to family events and sometimes when i&#x27;m out and about shopping and such and whatever BUUUT the thick eyelashes are crazy thick. like DAYUM, you can tell they be fake! i can&#x27;t pull them off personally but they&#x27;re still beautiul! definitely worth the price. :)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with applicator or glue, just lashes. They worked well And stayed on all day and night. Take good care of them if you want to get multiple wears out of each pair.</li>
            <li> For it&#x27;s price, pfft this is BUENO for sure. I remember before I bought a pair lashes for prolly $5 and they were basically the same quality as these ones. Get them they&#x27;re nice. ESP for $3!</li>
            <li> They are perfect. I  like the fact you left the edgeslonger than the lashes itself i use that to put on even better. These eye lashes are soft and beautiful on. Great product to keep buying and using.</li>
            <li> Why did I buy this? Lol I knew it was going to be of bad quality. The thick lashes look like caterpillars, nothing I would EVER put on my eyes!! They are itchy and look extremely fake (both the thin and the thick).</li>
            <li> Everything was really wonderful except that I have no clue how I am going to manage getting them on, cutting them to size and gluing them by myself! LOL Shipping time and the writing was in Japanese or Chinese, are the negatives.</li>
            <li> Other than the fact that these did NOT come with any glue or some kind of adhesive, and some of the eyelashes were messed up (and hidden). But other than that, It was a good buy, I got 20 eyelashes for $3. You can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price... Shipping however took forever! They go on pretty easily</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are hard to use because they aren&#x27;t pliable. And the fibers looked like pressed leather so they didn&#x27;t look like they could potentially grow out of my eyelids if I wanted them to.</li>
            <li> There nice. Gotta work with them a little bit.</li>
            <li> arrived way before expected looks exactly like the picture and these are so durable you could even wash them in water and reuse them since they are synthetic lashes</li>
            <li> They worked great! I hate paying a lot for lashes because I always lose them and get them so gunked up. It was nice just being able to just replace as needed. These are not thick. I prefer them like that so they look a bit more natural. If you are wanting a dramatic look I would reccomend finding a different product.</li>
            <li> They work and great price. Shipping takes way too long. Eyelashes weren&#x27;t harmed but the presentation of how it was set up was not the best. Eyelashes were falling off from its place and the cases holding the lashes were bent. Other than that no issues with the eyelashes themselves</li>
            <li> My product of eye lashes came exactly as I ordered and on time, 10 pairs of regular and 10 thick. Shipping time was to be expected. I personally don&#x27;t need fake eye lashes since my eye lashes are so long, and because of that I was worried the natural looking lashes weren&#x27;t going to make much of a difference, but they actually give it a nice hime-sama look.&lt;br /&gt;These are cheap but still good quality and if you&#x27;re use to wearing lashes you can buy your own glue (or just go to target/or any drug store or supermart that sells makeup and accessories--you&#x27;ll find lash glue easy). These do not come with glue as stated, but that&#x27;s just fine with me since I like to know where the glue is coming from. Mostly I use lashes for cosplay or just a nice evening out. Thick for cosplay, thin for everday, and they really do work nicely.&lt;br /&gt;So all and all I&#x27;d recommend if you want tons of lashes for different make up styles and looks to pull off for a cheap price get them! I really like them a lot! ヽ(*≧ω≦)ﾉ</li>
            <li> Really pretty! Love these lashes.</li>
            <li> These were cheap so they were worth that $$.</li>
            <li> Packing was all jacked up came with a little tree of life leckless the track is long that&#x27;s how there held on to the package so u got to do some trimming but all in all for the coast there great pretty much u get ur day lashes and ur going out lashes</li>
            <li> I only used 1 pair so far. It&#x27;s great just a little harder to put on in my opinion without the sticky residue that already come on most lashes. You can&#x27;t beat the price. Took about 1 month to arrive</li>
            <li> I am so in love with these lashes and so glad I bought them. They come exactly like in the picture in 2 boxes and they were packaged very well. I knew they were coming from China so I was expecting to wait at least 15 days, I was amazed when they arrived at my door step in 7 days. The quality is really good they can be worn just like other lashes. They don&#x27;t have the perfect for but just bend them a little before putting them on and they&#x27;re fantastic. I wish they&#x27;d come up with more styles because I&#x27;d buy them all. AMAZING PRODUCT FOR SUCH A CHEAP PRICE. Im impressed.</li>
            <li> I was nervous because of the price, but these actually turned out better then expected, great for the price and reusable</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet but I can&#x27;t wait! They are very well made!</li>
            <li> Big user of lashes and these are great if you are needing a large amount for a cheer or dance team. Good for first time lash users as well. But the lashes are kind of hard and uncomfortable on the lid. Only drawback.</li>
            <li> These were shipped much faster than I expected them to be to begin with. I have bought a few sets of lashes from my local drug store that cost the same price for one pair that I paid for all 20 pairs. I wasn&#x27;t really going for super quality as much as I needed plenty of pairs to practice learning how to apply them correctly to my eyes.  I have always had to trim lashes and I never get them on right the first time so I thought what better price to pay to have 20 pairs to play with. Better than that 10 sets of each so if I mess a single lash up here and there I dont have to throw away an entire set, I can just grab another one and move on.  I will be buying a few more sets of these.  The darker ones right now seem to dramatic for me but who knows in time and still you cant even beat the price ( I paid 3.50 with free shipping) for 10 pair, even if I end up not using the darker ones all of the time.</li>
            <li> i was not to happy they just didnt feel as natural as i would have wanted</li>
            <li> Horrible quality wayyyyy to stiff not real feelings or looking hate I bought them</li>
            <li> these falsies are perfect! you can tell they are synthetic when you look at them in the box, but when they are on, they look perfect! you get SOO many of them for extremely cheap. i would highly reccommend!</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t human hair....don&#x27;t like synthetic eyelashes...not please with it at all...it give &#x3D;s me a false look not happy</li>
            <li> This is great for beginners, but if your looking for some Great Lashes this isn&#x27;t it. There are more some practice lashes. But still great for the price.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are the worst eyelashes I have ever seen. I couldn&#x27;t even put them on necause they are so cheap.</li>
            <li> Well I was excited for these lashes because I love lashes but these? Sorry they didn&#x27;t work so great, I ripped half of them just trying to take them off the thing their on because they are glue tied on the back and they are cheaply made. Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> wonderful product! I feel so luxurious wearing these, and they&#x27;re good quality and an incredibly cheap price. Delivered quickly as well. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> THESE LASHES WERE HARD TO APPLY.MAYBE I NEED A DIFFERENT KIND OF GLUE,OR SOMETHING.I WILL NOT ORDER THESE AGAIN SO.SORRY</li>
            <li> Hard to apply.  But great for practice</li>
            <li> These lashes are most definitely worth the price. It&#x27;s very inexpensive you get 20 pairs for so cheap! Regular eyelashes cost $6-$10 in stores for just one pair. These eyelashes came three weeks before they said it would. The eyelashes are absolutely beautiful. The only downside is that the eyelashes don&#x27;t come with glue. I will definitely buy this product again. :)</li>
            <li> Quality meets the standard of the price.</li>
            <li> I love them! I wasn&#x27;t supposed to get them until the second week of March and got them the last week of February ! They are perfect ! The light ones for a regular natural day and the thick ones for a night out !!💁</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very satisfied with these lashes. they look great and are easy to apply. i enjoy the two different options for a more or less dramatic effect.</li>
            <li> These lashes are easy to apply and feel light, like they&#x27;re not even there. They are also easy to take off and are reusable.</li>
            <li> unfortunately they are bad quality like doll&#x27;s lashes...I can&#x27;t use them :( . I think they could work for other things like a performance at school or something like that.</li>
            <li> They are beautiful and look amazing on the eye with out being too over dramatic! ♡</li>
            <li> Shipped on time and I love the more natural looking ones really make your lashes look fuller</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised! I expected for the price, that these lashes would not be good. I am so happy to report that they are very nice. The less dense ones are great, very natural looking. I have not used the fuller set yet but I don&#x27;t expect them to be too different.</li>
            <li> It took 6 wks to come then every last one was crushed to pieces.  I cant use any of them there all messed up.  I will never buy these again.  I tried and it was fail.  Would have been nice if they were not messed up.</li>
            <li> The lashes came in on July 11 and were expected to come in on July 20, so I was happy about that.  The box was a little crushed, but only one eyelash was harmed and I figured I could use that for practice.  I figured that I would use the eyelashes as practice anyway because I&#x27;m not very good with fake eyelashes. The actual product is not bad, it has pretty good quality and I am happy with the price.</li>
            <li> Both thin and thick pack of lashes came bent and the packaging was horrible but you get what you pay for. Not all of the lashes were bent but majority were. First time impression I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> Great! Took me a while to realize there is two layers!</li>
            <li> Great deal!! Love it. Affordable price can&#x27;t beat!!</li>
            <li> They are not human hair.. Synthetic eyelashes are difficult to apply and do not look natural.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be a little smaller .</li>
            <li> This product can be purchased .... fast .... seller and good quality .... I am satisfied .................</li>
            <li> To rigid, uncomfortable !</li>
            <li> So beautiful lasted me a long time and came in a little earlier highly recommend them going to buy more that&#x27;s for sure √(:</li>
            <li> They look like plastic but they work</li>
            <li> I love them! You have to shape them with your finger for a few seconds before and cut them so they fit your eyes. I am very happy with these, just make sure you have a great glue. I will be ordering more! They do not look cheap in my opinion. Good luck!</li>
            <li> 20 Pairs of LASHS for a couple bucks is a great deal, but as Makeup-Artist &amp; Makeup Junkie. I didn&#x27;t like these at all. I didn&#x27;t like the look, feel, shape or styles. They also aren&#x27;t natural human hair which is ok, but they look too &#x27;CHEAP&#x27; REALLY REALLY CHEAP.  SO CHEAP looking I had taken them off once applied. Ill spend the extra dough on the other lashes. I will keep them in my lash stash but won&#x27;t be my first pick.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how many eyelashes you can get at such a wonderful price...have finally gotten the hang of it--so will re-order again, Thankyou Jennifer</li>
            <li> The shipping took a while but it is understandable. However, the actual lashes are cheap and somehow twisted in the track. When i took one out and tried on my eye lid, the lash is not fit to the eye lid. They are difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I just love false eyelashes... these are great.</li>
            <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;-CHEAP&lt;br /&gt;-decent quality; the thinner lash set looks pretty natural&lt;br /&gt;-good for day/evening wear&lt;br /&gt;-can reuse lashes if well cared for and cleaned&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;-a bit long...will have to trim ends, but that is expected for many false lashes&lt;br /&gt;-kind of plasticky. need to bend before applying, and use a good glue</li>
            <li> I got them when they said they would. I am actually very happy that I got what I wanted and I&#x27;am happy that they look exactly in the picture.</li>
            <li> Received the lashes the day it was supposed to come. Though all the lashes were there, the box was a bit smashed up. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but it looks good.</li>
            <li> Came over a week earlier than expected &amp; the eyelashes are absolutely lovely! will definitely be purchasing again :)</li>
            <li> These lashes were stiff and had thick veins, not too mention they were not human hair. application was difficult and longevity was compromised.</li>
            <li> Gotta know what your doing with these. I don&#x27;t so I wasted a few dollars.</li>
            <li> I like the regular ones.. but I hate the thick ones. Their terrible. They don&#x27;t curve at all and they feel like plastic. I tried curling them with an eyelash curler but it only made it worse. I gave these lashes 3 stars because the regular eyelashes were OK....not the best lashes in the world but they look half way decent with some mascara and a thick black winged liner/cat eye. But if it were for the thick eyelashes alone I would have given it one star (zero if possible)</li>
            <li> To hard to put on, it doesn&#x27;t come with a holder for storage or for travel. And there not really that attractive. Ew.</li>
            <li> I love, love,love this product! I just wish I would have ordered WAYYYY....more than I did! I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking! This set is get not only for my clients but for me as well! Woe is me....</li>
            <li> How stylized can you get? These bump up your style, pop the eyes open wide, go well for almost any occasion!</li>
            <li> At first we were not happy that the packing was poorly done. All the eyelashes were tossed up everywhere in the box but aside from that we were able to communicate with the Seller and were happy with the outcome.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> It came pretty fast but it irritated my eyes pretty badly and they were even puffy and pink on my lids</li>
            <li> The lashes have nice length and are easy to use. I really like them I think you will get lots of use and you can share them with a friend and split the cost</li>
            <li> The eyelashes were what I expected for the price I got, the cover and packaging were very cheap, However I did like the product, it came in great condition and excatly how I pictured it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the thin ones but not so much the thick. They feel so stiff and are hard to use. I&#x27;m not really feeling it. Maybe I just need more practice but it was worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> They are easy to put on the thinner ones were thinner than they looked in the picture - But it is a great deal and they will all be worn - good buy !</li>
            <li> The boxes arrived a little smooshed, but considering that I spent less than $2.00 on them, not including the shipping, I wasn&#x27;t all that surprised or concerned. These lashes are perfect for those special occasions when my lashes need a little more oomph. As with all lashes, I had to trim them to fit my eyes. The naturals give my own lashes just a little boost, and the thick ones give my eyes a va-va-voom needed for nights out on the town and costuming. They are easy to clean and are suitable for 2-3 uses per pair. The band is also of a paper like quality material that makes it easier to flex around the eye, apply glue, and give the eye a bit of breathe-ability while wearing them. Because they are cheap I don&#x27;t worry about if I don&#x27;t get as many uses out of 1 pair as I do with others, I can always get more and I will be getting more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> These are great products, really do recommend them. I did have to get glue but their really well made and quality. I always get so many complements!</li>
            <li> Love the lashes , they&#x27;re a little to long for me .</li>
            <li> I bought these because of the price and I&#x27;m pretty happy with them... haven&#x27;t used them for their intended purpose yet (on stage) but you can&#x27;t beat them for the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the &amp;#34;Style 2&amp;#34; lashes and they work amazing. They look natural and I constantly get compliments. I can use each pair about two to three times then I toss them. For the price, they&#x27;re definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> They were a plastic! Didn&#x27;t like them</li>
            <li> Took a while to  arrive. However, they were good quality just needed to be trimmed a little bit. They are very dramatic. they don&#x27;t look cheap. Really good quality. Seems like I could get a couple uses out of them. I would order them again</li>
            <li> My daughter loved them said the are very easy to put on. Just took a long time to get them.</li>
            <li> The nice thing about these is that they make them long enough for personalization. You can trim them down, and they work just fine.</li>
            <li> I loved my eye lashes the box wasnt handled with care and they got beat up a bit. Other than that I was pleased. I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> Hate it hate it the edges are to thick to glue on I will never buy these again nor recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> I like them..at first I didn&#x27;t think I would like them bc they looked plastic but TRY THEM ON BEFORE YOU REVEIW they looked great when I put them on. they looked better when I put on mascara and almost natural. they are a little long to fit my eyelids but I just trimmed the ends but still a great product</li>
            <li> BUY IT! best deal ever</li>
            <li> i finally got these, and i love these.</li>
            <li> When i first read the reviews i thought well maybe it might not be worth it to get it but i decided to get them and when they finaly came i was supper excited. And the lashes are beautiful and i will be purchasing more</li>
            <li> These lashes are amazing for the price. They can be manipulated into the shape u need easily and look great on !</li>
            <li> Received these and love them. I like the more natural looking ones. Great price, the only thing you have to do is cut the edges that is holding them in place when they arrive. I have re-used the same ones for over a month just adding clear glue and pealing them off. Only reason I have to switch them up is if I brake one or get them wet. Overall great buy!</li>
            <li> Just exactly what I wanted. Good product. I used these for doll eyelashes...worked perfectly!!! It took a while to get them but was well worth the wait!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> arrived and ready to use them</li>
            <li> This eyelashes are the good quality and god price ,good communication with the seller thank you I</li>
            <li> I was so scared to try these out because of the price but they work perfectly!!&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing is they come with no glue but I use the Duo glue and it works fine&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I absolutely ♡love♡ them!!!!! You can&#x27;t beat the price. The leashes are bold and beautiful!!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really like how the lash line where you glue was really think so if u don&#x27;t wear liquid eyeliner you can totally tell but they worked alright. Also even medium thick ones were little heavy on my eyes</li>
            <li> They are very pretty, just a bit stiff. Still like them a lot</li>
            <li> Very hard, not easy to bend. Not a fan.</li>
            <li> Looks plastics but once you have them on there ok if you like a fill look</li>
            <li> For the price there great definetly recommend them ....</li>
            <li> I love these eyelashes!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love they came early and there is so many different choices in sizes was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great buy for the price.  They are a little stiff, but they are perfect for costume wear, cosplay or even just playing around.  They are beautiful and look very nice.</li>
            <li> I liked the amount of eyelashes for this price. My critic would be the photo they were less quality then I thought they would be. It was still worth it though and I&#x27;m glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li> Cheap manmade material.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay . You get what you pay for .</li>
            <li> Slow shipping but really good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I love these eyelashes hands down! Super easy to apply and so natural looking. I was surprised at how natural the thicker lashes looked. They are absolutely perfect for everyday wear in my opinion. And the are super easy to clean. I just use cold cream that you would use for removing makeup  off of your face and rub the cold cream on the eyelashes in the palm of my hand gently. I do this gently because the eyelashes are handmade and I do not want to damage them.The thicker style also remind me of the Japanese Dolly Wink eyelashes. Both styles are absolutely beautiful. Thank you soooo very much! (:</li>
            <li> Great lashes for the price</li>
            <li> I just got these today &amp; they are super fake! , I hate them! , Don&#x27;t Waste your money on this product!!! they are so fake and thick .</li>
            <li> The lashes are nice ans shiny and they last.  My favorite part is the price. They are very affordable. Great product.</li>
            <li> I got these in Style 2, which is the regular long ones and I must say THEY ARE AMAZING! I must say I was a bit skeptical at the beginning since the box looks ehhh, and the lashes look a little fake. However they just look sooo real once you put them on. Just as good as the expensive ones I got from Sephora for $15.&lt;br /&gt;I would totally get these if:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. You have dark color hair/lashes. They fit just right.&lt;br /&gt;2. You have fairly long to long lashes already. These just exaggerate them by making them thicker and longer.&lt;br /&gt;3. What I do is cut the lash in half, and use each half on each eyes. This way you dont need to trim them and they still have that uneven natural length of lashes.&lt;br /&gt;4. I can just toss the used ones away, because there&#x27;s like 20 in a box and I use just 1 pair everytime anw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of cheap lashes and thus buying only from sephora, but I must say I was amazed at how good these are. I&#x27;m prbly just gonna switch to using these from now on because they are soooo cheap and still do the job, if not better.</li>
            <li> Look great and arrive early</li>
            <li> I got a great deal and a great laugh out of these. I am a pretty simple gal. :) But, their perfect for when I get dressed up.</li>
            <li> shipped fast and as described</li>
            <li> The thick ones are plastic, and they do not glue very well. When you cut them to make them shorter, they fall apart.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are a lil hard to put on since it is more straight than angled to match your eye but overall i really love them especially the fuller lashes. This is a great price and product I would not pass up. Recommend:)</li>
            <li> I got these in less than 2 weeks and wasn&#x27;t supposed to receive them until over a month from now. I was surprised and when I saw them I was even happier. Too happy actually to wait until I&#x27;ve tried them to write a review, I just couldn&#x27;t help it. These were very cheap for 20 pairs but are nicer than most that I&#x27;ve bought in stores for $4 a piece. They are not thick and plasticky I am sure they will go on just fine and if I need help I will try cutting them in sections and putting them on instead of in one whole strip but I dont think I will need to.&lt;br /&gt;At first I was worried about buying the thicker pairs but I almost like them more than the natural set. They both suit me depending on how much make up I am wearing that day one makes my eyelashes thicker and the other pair just makes them look longer. They may be too long when I go to put them on but I can always trim them down if that is the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never written a review before and I was so thrilled with the timely manner these arrived and the quality of them that I had to write a review immediately. Maybe I am just not an eyelash snob but I love these and excited to wear them.</li>
            <li> Very nice except did not come with the glue</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them ... took a little while to come but it wad worth the wait. They last long. Great for an every day look I was very pleases with the lashes.</li>
            <li> Fantastic lashes..nothing can beat the price.m using duo adhesive to stick it...not so heavy on eyelid..it&#x27;s the best for beginners..and the shipping was pretty fast</li>
            <li> Cheep.  Stiff but so worth the price</li>
            <li> The package is weared but its cheep and the lashes are beautiful.</li>
            <li> The lashes are great. Weight wise though it seems like they are a bit heavy on my eyes but they look great.</li>
            <li> Very stiff hurt eyelids feel like you lifting up weights with your lashes!!!!!</li>
            <li> i love the product, make my eyes sparkle</li>
            <li> Lashes were very hard!</li>
            <li> Would have given it 5 stars; but one pair of lashes got smashed in the packaging and was ruined:(</li>
            <li> These things are HORRIBLE! No wonder they cost so cheap! Its wiry and course. They didnt look natural at all. I didnt bother to apply them because I already know they would look a mess. DO NOT BUY! Spend more money and get a better quality!</li>
            <li> Product was worth the purchase price and the quality was good enough, although I was not impressed when I received in the mailbox crushed.  The packaging was cheap, and although this purchase was very inexpensive, I had to toss half due to damage.</li>
            <li> love them they are exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li> Best lashes ever. Takes FOREVER to come buts its way in China. Worth it all!!</li>
            <li> I Like the thicker ones the thin ones I feel you can tell are fake because the white thread that holds it together is visible and no matter&lt;br /&gt;how much eyeliner I put over I just cant seem to cover it all maybe use black thread,yeah. I had never used false eyelashes before these weren&#x27;t TOO difficult to get on just takes a little practice</li>
            <li> The darker, thicker ones are pretty much of no use to me, unless I cut them in have and use the halves on the outer corner of my lashes for extra fullness. The strips for the darker thicker ones are too rigid and it is hard to work with the whole strip. The thinner, lighter ones are a little more malleable and I really like them I would give five stars if it came with two packages of the lighter, thinner kind.</li>
            <li> Very hard to put on, they are not real, they are plastic. If it were to fall in your eyeball, it would scratch it.</li>
            <li> mywife love these awesome and a good price</li>
            <li> They look cheap, and have a hard time shaping correctly around the eyelid.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes, my only complaint would be is that you have to make them for your eye, they aren&#x27;t shaped already for your eye...other than that they are a great deal and reusable!</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting but still decent.</li>
            <li> They suck! I ended up tossing them out.</li>
            <li> the lashes look plastic, very bad quilty</li>
            <li> I bought these to add some volume to my not-so-full eyelashes and they are perfect. If you want a more natural look, then go for the thinner eyelashes, but if you want some very voluminous lashes.....then the thicker ones are perfect for you. I love both of them, especially for the cheap price. They are very easy to put on, but make sure you snip the ends since there are little pieces on each side to make them stay in the cases they are in. They have a nice curl to them as well, and can be definitely used more than once. I&#x27;ve used one pair of each so far in the two weeks or so that I&#x27;ve had them.</li>
            <li> Loved them but took too long to get here but thanks(;</li>
            <li> SO GOOD! I recommend them I love the first style not so much the second for me but other than that it&#x27;s a five</li>
            <li> I loved my lashes, I would continue to purchase this item each time I run out of them!</li>
            <li> good product at low price</li>
            <li> These are sturdy and fun!  You do have to cut them, of course, but they are awesome, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Not gna complain too much considering the price, so I&#x27;ll just say two stars bc they took FOREVER to come</li>
            <li> instructions not in English but just YouTube it, ok-ish quality, I didn&#x27;t get them damaged in anyway like others complained, however doesn&#x27;t come with adhesive</li>
            <li> Package was bent torn. Not what I expected. Tumbs down. Eyelashes are hard plastic won&#x27;t even stay on.</li>
            <li> reordoring my 3rd pair</li>
            <li> These take a little bit to get here because they are from China but well worth the $3.00. Mine lasted me a good 5 months or so. I would spend $7.00 or more on one set. I love this because you have a natural long look or dramatic lashes.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t the best quality, but they will get the job done.  If you need practice applying these than I definetly reccommend you buy these to start practicing.</li>
            <li> Favorite eyelashes! love them</li>
            <li> Everything was good only thing was shopping took forever but I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Got the lashes sooner than expected the packaging was fine despite the long journey the lashes fit great  I used the darker ones and they look natural and are really cute  so for 3 bucks I think I did good. I read plenty of the reviews before I decided to buy these  and please don&#x27;t listen to the negative ones try it for yourself I love these lashes.  Ps  I wear lashes daily if you don&#x27;t know how to apply lashes watch a YouTube video</li>
            <li> I love these lashes. They are very light and not heavy like the plastic band lashes</li>
            <li> Received these absolutely crushed. They were un usable.</li>
            <li> Loved these lashes. They take some time getting used to but other than that they are great!</li>
            <li> these are not what was expected they are glued in to the package. but i guess you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I love the quantity &amp; quality for such a low price. These lashes have lasted me awhile now. They&#x27;re easy to cut to adjust to your eyes, &amp; paired with a good glue will stay on all night!</li>
            <li> The thinner eyelashes aren&#x27;t very good but the thick ones are amazing. Very plastic look until you put mascara on them!</li>
            <li> Not a very good quality of lashes.</li>
            <li> Very cheap quality. Made out of plastic. Don&#x27;t stick on ur eyes. Hate them</li>
            <li> I never git my eye lashes</li>
            <li> They did the job , I&#x27;m new to using eye lashes but my fiance liked the look of them and he usually doesn&#x27;t like this kind of stuff .</li>
            <li> They are nice but it&#x27;s hard to put them on</li>
            <li> For the price, I think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought &amp;#34;20 Pairs Regular Long and Thick Eyelashes Style 1 and 2&amp;#34;  I guess I didn&#x27;t realize just how DRAMATIC one of the sets is.  Thick pretty much to the point of absurd, unless you are going for &amp;#34;doll-like&amp;#34; or cartoonish, you probably won&#x27;t use them.  They won&#x27;t really pass in day to day life.  The other set however is reasonable to add a little extra *plink plink* lashes for a night out.  Work them a little before proceeding so they are a little more pliable as they are pretty stiff out of the package, trim them to fit you, &amp; use a good glue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that I&#x27;ve spent more on a single pair, I think it&#x27;s worth it even if one set might need to be handed to someone who is performing a drag show.  :)</li>
            <li> Cheap in quality but that&#x27;s okay because they are cheap in price as well! I easily make these work because I use professional glue.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain with the price I paid for.</li>
            <li> Bought them for my girlfriend. They shipped pretty fast, and for the price, these lashes are not that bad</li>
            <li> These lashes were rubbery and would not stick on, even with the most professional and expensive glue! They reminded me of something made for a DOLL- extremely unnatural looking and feeling! The hair itself is plastic! I wanted to save money since fake eye lashes are so expensive in the drugstore, but this product was a total flop!</li>
            <li> these lashes came around 11 days early and i am so happy!  they are so cute and the natural ones look great, and i am definitely using the larger ones for parties and events&amp;#60;3 i am so happy with this product. they do not come with gkue as expected, and they do need to be trimmed. the are straight and not eye conformed but it doesnt make a difference :) on my picture, my left eye has the larger lashes, and my right eye has the more natural ones</li>
            <li> Ok for the price definitely not human hair they are man made but still ok for the price I still got to use them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item I have eyelashes that our great quality and alot cheaper ! if u want to stock up on eyelashes I would buy this package :)</li>
            <li> They are great!! Stil have my first pair on</li>
            <li> cheap. I mean it costs cheap. if you are a starter, you won&#x27;t learn anything anyway because they don&#x27;t work like they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> Just got them haven&#x27;t used them yet so we should see but I paid 2$ for them so who can really complain about it. They look great just like the picture</li>
            <li> They are thin, flimsy , and look very cheap! You get what you pay for. Perhaps I will  use them for costume  purposes .</li>
            <li> Great customer Service. Quick email replies. Very cheap and good quality. Multiple uses.</li>
            <li> The thicker ones look different than what the image displays. But still, great lashes and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Eh a little hard to shape to the Wye and a little cheesy looking but hey great for how cheap they are</li>
            <li> Not the most amazing-quality lashes I&#x27;ve ever used, in terms of their lash dispersal and how &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; they look - in fact, they look to be made of plastic - but for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it. Shipped pretty quickly considering they came all the way from China.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes are all there but some of the lashes are stuck together and have a plastic-y quality rather than a hair like feeling.</li>
            <li> Not all that great, I won&#x27;t buy them again</li>
            <li> GREAT !  Incredible price . Good quality</li>
            <li> Love these lashes. Will reorder again and again. Well made product. Reusable. You get more than what you pay for. I will definitely reorder when the time comes!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping! Super cute ! Looks just like the picture! Super soft and wear well! Would def buy more of these! They even wash out pretty good for multiple wears.</li>
            <li> These are great for an evening out, but not for all day ... good product.</li>
            <li> Well you get what you pay for so I can&#x27;t complain. They&#x27;re nice. Glad I got two different styles.</li>
            <li> they are super inexpensive, so they are not as flexible as you may need them to be, but I needed them for a costume, so they worked out fine.</li>
            <li> They are nice eyelashes they look amazing on my friends nd I like them I still have them nd will be a long time until I buy more</li>
            <li> Great Price for Great lashes. Shipped fast. No hassle, I wear every day! I love both of the styles. Awesome!</li>
            <li> Great deal i received sixty pairs of lashes for 9 bucks like wow! The quality wasn&#x27;t great very plasticky but good for short time wear</li>
            <li> Seriously I do not have sensitive skin or eyes what so ever, these turned my eyes scary red and itched my skin so bad!! Could not bare the pain past 15 minutes. There is definatly some crazy non fda approved chemical in there.</li>
            <li> Very nice, fast shipping</li>
            <li> so far so good. i have&#x27;nt worn them yet. so i dont know they look on. i&#x27;ll have to see.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my kit, and i&#x27;m glad I did.  I like the feel of the eyelashes. They have that doll look to them but I think I can makes these work. Arrived well packaged an earlier than estimated. Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product so far.</li>
            <li> So I bought the eyelashes to try something new&lt;br /&gt;I always buy them at Mac .&lt;br /&gt;And I will continue too&lt;br /&gt;I would say not to get it&lt;br /&gt;The eyelashes feel like plastic&lt;br /&gt;No shape , very straight&lt;br /&gt;They look very cheap on&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy</li>
            <li> It was worth the wait fir the lashes. i love the long lashes and the natural lashes are ok. the natural lashe&#x27;s look really natural; i get a lot of complements on them</li>
            <li> i had orderd and when it came in the mail some of the lashes where messed up lashes wernt attached right and lashes where in pieces! they said for me to email them a photo n i did thety said if i removed the feedback they would replace them!so i did and never got the items replaced!</li>
            <li> I love these. It&#x27;s nice to not have to go to the store to buy eyelashes when I&#x27;m going somewhere important. They are easy to cut to fit my eyes and they look great. I would recommend these to anyone. I have even given away a couple of pairs to my niece. They came in the mail very quickly.</li>
            <li> Lashes are not of good quality.  I would not recommend them.</li>
            <li> Super cheap, fast shipping! Can&#x27;t get any better very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Not really as luxurious as I thought they would be they end up popping off at the side no matter what type of glue you use, these can only be used for 1 time then you must throw away great for things like show choir, dance recitals, cheer-leading competitions ect something you need lashes for but cannot afford to spend more money. I ordered these late Jan 2015 and they arrived Feb 26th 2015.</li>
            <li> I like that you get so many eye lashes for what you would pay for one one pair!!! These are those plastic crummy ones that do not bend to the eyelid even with the glue save yourself the time and money</li>
            <li> Thin lashes were good not thick</li>
            <li> Fast shipping for international. Great prices. Love it.</li>
            <li> you cant go wrong with a couple bucks for 20 pairs of lashes!&lt;br /&gt;these are really common within the Asian community when it comes to selling, and you can usually get one pair for $1-$2... and look here! 20 for like $2! :D it&#x27;s a steal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly don&#x27;t be scared to use the thicker ones :p they add such a powerful look to the eyes (can be dramatic or innocent) XD it makes the eye just pop out more than usual... ouuuuuuu and try using it for your bottom lashes too! very sexy.</li>
            <li> Good for beginners but the quality is on the cheap side</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how quickly my order was shipped.  all smiles when opening my package and it was exactly how it was described.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the chance to wear then but they feel so real and are so beautiful.</li>
            <li> Its ok i love it because it is affordable what i didnt like is when i close my eyes it looks so fake lol. But i still like it</li>
            <li> They were pretty Good fake eyelashes, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that they were a little hard to shape other than that nice product..</li>
            <li> Total garbage, who would wear these? They&#x27;re not even made of fiber, they&#x27;re literally cut plastic.</li>
            <li> it is not my favorite eyelashes and i didnt like it compared with what i usually use.. but for this price.. it was okay to give a try</li>
            <li> Lashes do not stick. No matter how expensive the glue is or how long I wait. They are rubbery. Not a good buy. Waste.</li>
            <li> WHEN GOING TO THE BEAUTY SALON CAN BECOME EXPENSIVE, DOING IT YOURSELF CAN BE WORTH IT.  MY MOM LIKES PUTTING ON EYE LASHES AND NOW SHE HAS A WHOLE COLLECTION</li>
            <li> I always had to trim false eyelashes before place them on...the lashes I received fit my eyes and look great and were very comfortable I actually forgot I had them on...love them and the price I love the length of time needs work but overall I do love these lashes</li>
            <li> the eyelashes are plentiful, but clearly fake and plasticy.The black paint also rubs off very easily. Not worth the very little they cost.</li>
            <li> I kind of knew that these were going to be awful but I bought them any way... Big mistake, way too long on the edges, awful bands on them, so hard to glue and I wear false lashes every day. Just a bad product overall.</li>
            <li> I use these lashes when I&#x27;m going out for special occasions. They are easy to use and work well with my Ardell Lashgrip adhesive. I don&#x27;t have a problem with them falling off. and the thin style looks absolutely real!!</li>
            <li> Not great in quality, but I needed some to practice with, and they were the right price. They held together fine. I&#x27;ll wear them when I go out, no problem.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my 18 year old granddaughter and she loves them!</li>
            <li> I really thought they came with a glue or something</li>
            <li> They were really big and i trimmed the corners even i have really good glue they dont stick because they are firm and doesnt shape..it is going to trash....</li>
            <li> Looking at the low price, I honestly thought the quality wouldn&#x27;t be that great but the natural style lashes are awesome! They look very beautiful!!! But you do have to cut the sides of the lashes a bit but other then that it&#x27;s awesome and I would buy it again!!</li>
            <li> Didnt really like these they look too fake</li>
            <li> not best quality but for a beginner who is learning to use them like me they are good! i rather learn and get the hang of it on something cheaper then go buy the good ones when im a pro!</li>
            <li> I mean its okay for the price that I purchase it i guess, I&#x27;ll use them for more everyday style than anything. they feel fake but at the same time it was cheap and I did get 20</li>
            <li> They have NO curl to them...they look completely fake!  :-(</li>
            <li> really pretty . sometimes to dramatic but there great. style 2 is my favorite they&#x27;re very long and have a lot of volume</li>
