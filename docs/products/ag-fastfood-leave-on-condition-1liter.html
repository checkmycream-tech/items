            <li>The sweetist part of this fast food is it&#x27;s incredible smell, it&#x27;s somewhere between a mix of jolly ranchers and a fruit bowl .Over</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using FastFood for years now, and I love it.</li>
            <li>and then the AG curl bomb on the top.  </li>

            <li>ever love love love love this product</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad to have it.</li>
            <li>Like me, she doesn&#x27;t usually love anything, because she&#x27;d rather not deal with her hair.</li>
            <li>If you feel you need more product to re-moisturize it during the week, dampen your hair and add it in.</li>
            <li>With time, I plan to see more hair growth and permanent hair health.</li>

            <li>With time, I plan to see more hair growth and permanent hair health.</li>
            <li>Especially good for those with long hair.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, the way it makes my hair feel, and how easy it is to use it.  </li>
            <li>I love AG Fastfood, best leave in conditioner, hands down!</li>
            <li>Now her hair is brushable and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and goes on easy.</li>
            <li>This product has a strong fragrance to it.</li>
            <li>Works just fine</li>
            <li>many good reviews of AG, using fast food first</li>
            <li>Works fantastic on kids fine hair as well.</li>
            <li>This bottle is huge, and I used it every time I washed my hair</li>
            <li>You know how you find a great hair care product, but after a while you just don&#x27;t get the same results anymore?  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s light but controls frizz and brings out my curls as well as anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d have to use a different product for my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; hair, but this works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t seem to cause build up on your hair.  </li>
            <li>Smooth.</li>
            <li>But, the odor doesn&#x27;t last and it works great on my hair.</li>
            <li>Its smell is nice and lasts whole day.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product for type 4a,b,c hair.  </li>
            <li>this cheap, lol.th</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel good but not heavy like</li>
            <li>As a child, my hair was soft, could moisturize itself well, had a good pH balance, and an even looser curl pattern that looked so silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy with long, curly hair and this stuff works great for preventing frizz and helping to prevent my hair from froing out during the humid summers in NJ.</li>
            <li>It helps on dry hair with fly aways.  </li>
            <li>In this product category, there aren&#x27;t that many conditioners that do much of anything to my hair except be in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Add more to your ends; not too much to your scalp.</li>
            <li>Add more to your ends; not too much to your scalp.</li>
            <li>I love it right at the first time using.</li>
            <li>This was delivered quickly and packed well.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to fast food leave in conditioner at the salon and fell in love..</li>
            <li>It is also good to use when u transitioning between stlyes and wanna rock the wet look without the crunchy feel of gel..</li>
            <li>all this product is well worth</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>It also has a number of natural ingredients and is not tested on animals :)</li>
            <li>Let it dry IN your hair and do it before you go to bed, so that you can unbraid it, un-bun it, or etc when you wake up and have a nice, silky style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>, I have fine hair and just some natural wave.  </li>
            <li>And it was working as well for me after 2 years as it did the first day</li>
            <li>So glad that after two years of using my current bottle it is still here.</li>
            <li>I first used this because it was in the spa level rooms of the cruise</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth &amp; soft</li>
            <li>I put this is my hair everyday and does a good job conditioning my hair.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this size because I love this product and it is much cheaper than buying the smaller tubes.</li>
            <li>I have looked high and low for this product which I was first introducted to many years ago</li>
            <li>works perfect for me  doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy layer  like other products</li>
            <li>My curls are shiny and my hair is super soft.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t need much, but still...  </li>
            <li>Costs much in the salon...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>just squeeze out as much of the water as you can.</li>
            <li>The I use a pick to comb it out a bit (not too much).</li>
            <li>My hair dresser recommended Fast Food to me and I have never regretted it.</li>
            <li>This item arrived much faster then I expect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Dominican and have really curly hair and this product</li>
            <li>sometimes not, do not know if I am using too much product sometimes</li>
            <li>I like to shampoo and put this on after I get out of the shower and really brush it through my hair.</li>
            <li>Heals and feeds my hair very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Heals and feeds my hair very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>makes hair feel so soft, only problem is I don&#x27;t always love the smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, took a little long to ship 7 days</li>
            <li>After straightening my hair to cut the split ends this year, my mother&#x27;s sweet hair dresser recommended this to me in order to reduce split ends since I only wear my hair straight once a year now, and need to wear something to protect it when it&#x27;s wavy, which is what I&#x27;ve never done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair gets weighed down by most products</li>
            <li>I live in very humid area and this helps with taming it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t review products; most of them don&#x27;t deserve any hype, because even when they don&#x27;t necessarily damage your hair, they don&#x27;t necessarily improve anything either.</li>
            <li>surely buy this again since it&#x27;s proved to actually do something for me when I use it properly.</li>
            <li>surely buy this again since it&#x27;s proved to actually do something for me when I use it properly.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I was totally sketched out buying it online for such a cheap price compared to what t normally is at salons, but this is the real deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>fine hair is a combination between straight roots, loose waves and curly ends; body has to be manipulated by separating waves into tinier, individual strands.</li>
            <li>The curls are voluminous, the texture is cotton-soft, the detangling gets easier over time, the light hits it in all the right places, I have less breakage at the ends of my hair, and it&#x27;s grown longer within only three months.</li>
            <li>leave-on ultimately brought my hair back to the way it was when I was a little girl, which I find surprising.</li>
            <li>just makes it soft and I can run my fingers through my hair!</li>
            <li>I tend to use more then what they say because I have very thick but fine long hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and well conditioned.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft, manageable, &amp; not sticky or oily.</li>
            <li>Probably the only conditioner that really works for me.  </li>
            <li>My hair frizzes out big time in humidity, and this really tames it.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft and not greasy or oily looking.  </li>
            <li>it leaves my hair soft</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and moisturized  all week.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Dedicate yourself to the 1 liter, or at least a good sized bottle; everything comes with time when you have a bit of leftover heat damage, but one to two uses was enough for my fingers to feel a big difference.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone with frizzy hair, especially if you live in a humid/foggy climate.</li>
            <li>definitely calms the frizz in humidity, and takes care of it all together in normal weather.</li>
            <li>i like simple, natural smells though!</li>
            <li>This leave in really does make u hair managable and help stop breakage when combing ur wet hair...</li>
            <li>Wanted to put away the straightening iron and go back to a bob with my natural wave.  </li>
            <li>Since using this it has left my hair extremely soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I use about a quarter in my hand the days I dry and straighten my hair, a little more on the days I scrunch and leave to dry curly.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft even with very dry, ultra highlighted, overly dyed AND highlighted, not always properly trimmed hair.  </li>

            <li> But, the odor doesn&#x27;t last and it works great on my hair.</li>
            <li> Its smell is nice and lasts whole day.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product for type 4a,b,c hair.  </li>
            <li> this cheap, lol.th</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel good but not heavy like</li>
            <li> As a child, my hair was soft, could moisturize itself well, had a good pH balance, and an even looser curl pattern that looked so silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with long, curly hair and this stuff works great for preventing frizz and helping to prevent my hair from froing out during the humid summers in NJ.</li>
            <li> It helps on dry hair with fly aways.  </li>
            <li> In this product category, there aren&#x27;t that many conditioners that do much of anything to my hair except be in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Add more to your ends; not too much to your scalp.</li>
            <li> Add more to your ends; not too much to your scalp.</li>
            <li> I love it right at the first time using.</li>
            <li> This was delivered quickly and packed well.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to fast food leave in conditioner at the salon and fell in love..</li>
            <li> It is also good to use when u transitioning between stlyes and wanna rock the wet look without the crunchy feel of gel..</li>
            <li> all this product is well worth</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> It also has a number of natural ingredients and is not tested on animals :)</li>
            <li> Let it dry IN your hair and do it before you go to bed, so that you can unbraid it, un-bun it, or etc when you wake up and have a nice, silky style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let it dry IN your hair and do it before you go to bed, so that you can unbraid it, un-bun it, or etc when you wake up and have a nice, silky style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I have fine hair and just some natural wave.  </li>
            <li> And it was working as well for me after 2 years as it did the first day</li>
            <li> So glad that after two years of using my current bottle it is still here.</li>
            <li> I first used this because it was in the spa level rooms of the cruise</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smooth &amp; soft</li>
            <li> I put this is my hair everyday and does a good job conditioning my hair.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this size because I love this product and it is much cheaper than buying the smaller tubes.</li>
            <li> I have looked high and low for this product which I was first introducted to many years ago</li>
            <li> works perfect for me  doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy layer  like other products</li>
            <li> My curls are shiny and my hair is super soft.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t need much, but still...  </li>
            <li> Costs much in the salon...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> just squeeze out as much of the water as you can.</li>
            <li> The I use a pick to comb it out a bit (not too much).</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended Fast Food to me and I have never regretted it.</li>
            <li> This item arrived much faster then I expect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Dominican and have really curly hair and this product</li>
            <li> sometimes not, do not know if I am using too much product sometimes</li>
            <li> I like to shampoo and put this on after I get out of the shower and really brush it through my hair.</li>
            <li> Heals and feeds my hair very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heals and feeds my hair very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> makes hair feel so soft, only problem is I don&#x27;t always love the smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, took a little long to ship 7 days</li>
            <li> After straightening my hair to cut the split ends this year, my mother&#x27;s sweet hair dresser recommended this to me in order to reduce split ends since I only wear my hair straight once a year now, and need to wear something to protect it when it&#x27;s wavy, which is what I&#x27;ve never done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair gets weighed down by most products</li>
            <li> I live in very humid area and this helps with taming it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t review products; most of them don&#x27;t deserve any hype, because even when they don&#x27;t necessarily damage your hair, they don&#x27;t necessarily improve anything either.</li>
            <li> surely buy this again since it&#x27;s proved to actually do something for me when I use it properly.</li>
            <li> surely buy this again since it&#x27;s proved to actually do something for me when I use it properly.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I was totally sketched out buying it online for such a cheap price compared to what t normally is at salons, but this is the real deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> fine hair is a combination between straight roots, loose waves and curly ends; body has to be manipulated by separating waves into tinier, individual strands.</li>
            <li> The curls are voluminous, the texture is cotton-soft, the detangling gets easier over time, the light hits it in all the right places, I have less breakage at the ends of my hair, and it&#x27;s grown longer within only three months.</li>
            <li> leave-on ultimately brought my hair back to the way it was when I was a little girl, which I find surprising.</li>
            <li> just makes it soft and I can run my fingers through my hair!</li>
            <li> I tend to use more then what they say because I have very thick but fine long hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and well conditioned.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft, manageable, &amp; not sticky or oily.</li>
            <li> Probably the only conditioner that really works for me.  </li>
            <li> My hair frizzes out big time in humidity, and this really tames it.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your hair soft and not greasy or oily looking.  </li>
            <li> it leaves my hair soft</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and moisturized  all week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Dedicate yourself to the 1 liter, or at least a good sized bottle; everything comes with time when you have a bit of leftover heat damage, but one to two uses was enough for my fingers to feel a big difference.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone with frizzy hair, especially if you live in a humid/foggy climate.</li>
            <li> definitely calms the frizz in humidity, and takes care of it all together in normal weather.</li>
            <li> i like simple, natural smells though!</li>
            <li> This leave in really does make u hair managable and help stop breakage when combing ur wet hair...</li>
            <li> Wanted to put away the straightening iron and go back to a bob with my natural wave.  </li>
            <li> Since using this it has left my hair extremely soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I use about a quarter in my hand the days I dry and straighten my hair, a little more on the days I scrunch and leave to dry curly.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft even with very dry, ultra highlighted, overly dyed AND highlighted, not always properly trimmed hair.  </li>
            <li> I live in the south where it&#x27;s hot and humid and have thin hair that curls with the humidity.  </li>
            <li> After damaging it with heat throughout middle and high school, it became coarse, rough, had no silkiness to it, and absolutely no pattern.</li>
            <li> When I ran out last spring, I thought I&#x27;d try a few other brands, but nothing seemed as right for my hair as Fastfood.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to tell my friends and family about this stuff, and that&#x27;s pretty rare, since I&#x27;m the type of person who automatically lowers their expectations so that the disappointment won&#x27;t be too strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I left my hair wet when I came out of the shower before towel drying it a bit (not rough but just do it as if you were squeezing the water out of your hair).</li>
            <li> AG&#x27;s Fastfood leave in conditioner doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and leaves it soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Since I started using it many years ago, my hair has gone from thick and curly to thick and wiry (and</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t like it ,not working at all even in my little daughter 3 years old</li>
            <li> grey).</li>
            <li> Then I style as necessary or you can just leave it wet and go...</li>
            <li> I have long, curly, frizzy hair and FastFood</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s price and stands way above any other I&#x27;ve tried..</li>
            <li> It even helps to keep it styled the way I style it when I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> My dry, curly hair was a bit unruly until I started using Ag Fastfood Leave on Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I used this product before and it helps your hair if dry and damaged</li>
            <li> I even bought microfiber towels to dry my hair as I read that they help reduce frizz.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you get some frizz once it&#x27;s dry (which I do with long thick hair) I add in a little bit more onto those ends and no more frizz!</li>
            <li> For the past 4 years I have used this product plus a hair gel (Ouidad Climate Control) and my curls are soft and defined.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product since approximately 2005 (first time was for a wedding).</li>
            <li> Over-use will only make your hair heavy with this, and it might dry it out faster.</li>
            <li> Over-use will only make your hair heavy with this, and it might dry it out faster.</li>
            <li> and my hair needs a little extra help.  </li>
            <li> Then I used a few paper towels to do the same thing...</li>
            <li> Shipped as expected.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It makes my very dry hair become smoother, shiner, manageable, and not weighs the volume down.</li>
            <li> other leave in conditioners.  </li>
            <li> every other wash and my hair hasn&#x27;t been happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can even put a dab in it when my hair is dry just to get a little frizz out.</li>
            <li> I have found that AG Fast Food is a difficult product to get</li>
            <li> Do NOT put this in your hair daily; this stuff is thick, and a leave-on is a leave-on until you&#x27;ve washed it out.</li>
            <li> Do NOT put this in your hair daily; this stuff is thick, and a leave-on is a leave-on until you&#x27;ve washed it out.</li>
            <li> It was a rat&#x27;s nest of abused mess.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> it does wear off after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Too bad there&#x27;s no referral program for doing so ;)</li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my thick waivy hair.  </li>
            <li> and I have thick and curly hair and used it everyday.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m buying another liter bottle and playing the field no more.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
            <li> , I do not leave home without it, no more frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, course hair.  </li>
            <li> I have some SERIOUS thick wavy waist length hair.</li>
            <li> The only other product I use now is a serum for the days I straighten and it&#x27;s just nasty humid</li>
            <li> It is my secret to my hair growth.</li>
            <li> i have thin hair and this product  </li>
            <li> This stuff has shockingly made her hair look looser, much shiner, and softer to both the touch and the eye.</li>
            <li> My youngest daughter also had horrible hair before I started using this in her hair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> makes hair feel so soft, only problem is I don&#x27;t always love the smell. It smells nice, but almost more overpowering than i want in my hair. i like simple, natural smells though!</li>
            <li> I ordered this size because I love this product and it is much cheaper than buying the smaller tubes. I have long,thick hair and get a spiral perm once a year.  My hairdresser used this on my hair and I&#x27;ve been using it now for over 3 years. I also use their recoil product to touch up my perm and it works great too.  This was delivered quickly and packed well.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product at my salon and LOVE IT!!!  I will never go back!  It helps on dry hair with fly aways.  I live in very humid area and this helps with taming it.  It is a must try!</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to fast food leave in conditioner at the salon and fell in love.. This leave in really does make u hair managable and help stop breakage when combing ur wet hair... It is also good to use when u transitioning between stlyes and wanna rock the wet look without the crunchy feel of gel.. The sweetist part of this fast food is it&#x27;s incredible smell, it&#x27;s somewhere between a mix of jolly ranchers and a fruit bowl .Over all this product is well worth it&#x27;s price and stands way above any other I&#x27;ve tried..</li>
            <li> My hair gets weighed down by most products and I can&#x27;t use them, but AG&#x27;s Fastfood leave in conditioner doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and leaves it soft and silky. It even helps to keep it styled the way I style it when I blow dry it. I love it! The sale price is a great price. I&#x27;m stocking up. My youngest daughter also had horrible hair before I started using this in her hair. She would always get that big nappy dreadlock/rats nest in the back from just sitting in her car seat. Now her hair is brushable and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> My dry, curly hair was a bit unruly until I started using Ag Fastfood Leave on Conditioner.  For the past 4 years I have used this product plus a hair gel (Ouidad Climate Control) and my curls are soft and defined.  I love this product and could not do without.  I recommend it all the time to curly-haired ladies I meet. Too bad there&#x27;s no referral program for doing so ;)</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I bought this for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I have looked high and low for this product which I was first introducted to many years ago and it is the best to me.  I love the smell, the way it makes my hair feel, and how easy it is to use it.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I love AG Fastfood, best leave in conditioner, hands down! Service from this vendor was efficient</li>
            <li> I Love Fastfood leave on condition!!! Glad to be able to buy the 1 liter size. I use it everyday on my thick waivy hair.  It works really well and keeps my hair very healthy!</li>
            <li> I used this product before and it helps your hair if dry and damaged&lt;br /&gt;Its best buy a liter it last me about 4mons so its a great and smells good too.</li>
            <li> Love this for my 4a/4b hair.  Definitely a staple item in my hair care regimen.  Leaves my hair soft and well conditioned.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it smells great and it lasted for two years and I have thick and curly hair and used it everyday. You only need a quarter size..</li>
            <li> You know how you find a great hair care product, but after a while you just don&#x27;t get the same results anymore?  That doesn&#x27;t happen with this leave-in conditioner.  This bottle is huge, and I used it every time I washed my hair (2-3x/week) for almost 2 years before I ran out!  I had short hair so I didn&#x27;t need much, but still...  When I ran out last spring, I thought I&#x27;d try a few other brands, but nothing seemed as right for my hair as Fastfood.  It never makes my hair greasy, it&#x27;s light but controls frizz and brings out my curls as well as anything I&#x27;ve tried. And it was working as well for me after 2 years as it did the first day I tried it.  So I&#x27;m buying another liter bottle and playing the field no more.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Since I started using it many years ago, my hair has gone from thick and curly to thick and wiry (and grey). I thought I&#x27;d have to use a different product for my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; hair, but this works great. Can&#x27;t live without it. So glad that after two years of using my current bottle it is still here.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!  It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t seem to cause build up on your hair.  It&#x27;s great for static control in the winter.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair products I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!!!! It&#x27;s an awesome product and I get a better deal ordering it on-line. Costs much in the salon...</li>
            <li> Good stuff. This leave in conditioner does my hair good!  I have thick, course hair.  I can wear it curly or straighten it.  This conditioner works well on both. I especially like how I can reapply it into my hair at the end of the day and revitalize it for the evening.  Just a dab will do.</li>
            <li> I live in the south where it&#x27;s hot and humid and have thin hair that curls with the humidity.  Frizz control needed most summer days!  I first used this because it was in the spa level rooms of the cruise we went on and my hair looked great every day!  I use about a quarter in my hand the days I dry and straighten my hair, a little more on the days I scrunch and leave to dry curly.  The only other product I use now is a serum for the days I straighten and it&#x27;s just nasty humid and my hair needs a little extra help.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Perfect for hair. Smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. A little goes a long way. Smells very nice, no stinky perfume smell. Leaves hair soft, manageable, &amp; not sticky or oily.</li>
            <li> Works just fine but the smell is kind of alkaline??  I&#x27;ve bought this item before and it smelled much better.  But, the odor doesn&#x27;t last and it works great on my hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner! Makes hair silky and shiny! Works fantastic on kids fine hair as well. Highly recommended! I only use AG products now, there is just no comparison.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since approximately 2005 (first time was for a wedding). I left my hair wet when I came out of the shower before towel drying it a bit (not rough but just do it as if you were squeezing the water out of your hair). Then I used a few paper towels to do the same thing...just squeeze out as much of the water as you can. Once that is finished, use leave-in-conditioner as necessary for your hair. I tend to use more then what they say because I have very thick but fine long hair. The I use a pick to comb it out a bit (not too much). Then I style as necessary or you can just leave it wet and go... Also, if you get some frizz once it&#x27;s dry (which I do with long thick hair) I add in a little bit more onto those ends and no more frizz! I LOVE IT!!!      I have found that AG Fast Food is a difficult product to get and I&#x27;m not sure why. That&#x27;s why once I saw it on Amazon &amp; thatit was sold by Amazon, I got it immediately. My bff is also hooked on it!    Debbie in NJ</li>
            <li> Probably the only conditioner that really works for me.  My hair frizzes out big time in humidity, and this really tames it.  I can even put a dab in it when my hair is dry just to get a little frizz out.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for many years.  I gave it 4 stars because no pump was provided.</li>
            <li> I put this is my hair everyday and does a good job conditioning my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t smell great but works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with long, curly hair and this stuff works great for preventing frizz and helping to prevent my hair from froing out during the humid summers in NJ. It also has a number of natural ingredients and is not tested on animals :)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It is my secret to my hair growth. I use it everyday. I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended Fast Food to me and I have never regretted it. Not greasy and goes on easy. Especially good for those with long hair.</li>
            <li> works great as a leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> I love AG Fastfood.  Makes my hair feel good but not heavy like other leave in conditioners.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Love AG Fastfood. Shipped as expected.</li>
            <li> This item arrived much faster then I expect. The package was excellent. The product is perfect. It makes my very dry hair become smoother, shiner, manageable, and not weighs the volume down. Its smell is nice and lasts whole day. I love it right at the first time using.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smooth &amp; soft</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t like it ,not working at all even in my little daughter 3 years old</li>
            <li> i have thin hair and this product  works perfect for me  doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy layer  like other products</li>

            <li> This product is great!! Luv it!</li>
            <li> Great leave in makes blow drying time faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using FastFood for years now, and I love it. I have long, curly, frizzy hair and FastFood definitely calms the frizz in humidity, and takes care of it all together in normal weather. I highly recommend it to anyone with frizzy hair, especially if you live in a humid/foggy climate.</li>
            <li> works great! I&#x27;m Dominican and have really curly hair and this product just makes it soft and I can run my fingers through my hair!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I use it after every shower and when I am done swimming for the day. Definitely helps control my frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> Wanted to put away the straightening iron and go back to a bob with my natural wave.  I did a lot of research and&lt;br /&gt;saw many good reviews of AG, using fast food first and then the AG curl bomb on the top.  I am still experimenting on the best way to use all the products I bought to get the look I want, some days I get that beach tossled look without a big effort and sometimes not, do not know if I am using too much product sometimes, I have fine hair and just some natural wave.  I even bought microfiber towels to dry my hair as I read that they help reduce frizz.  I will say with the AG products you DO NOT get friz, so I am saying YMMV, everyone&#x27;s hair is so different.  Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years now and I highly recommend it.  I especially recommend it for people who have processed their hair and maybe even fried it, like I have.  It leaves your hair soft and not greasy or oily looking.  It leaves my hair soft even with very dry, ultra highlighted, overly dyed AND highlighted, not always properly trimmed hair.  I also like the smell.</li>
            <li> Love this product  it leaves my hair soft helps with frizz best product ever love love love love this product</li>
            <li> I have some SERIOUS thick wavy waist length hair. Since using this it has left my hair extremely soft and shiny. I was totally sketched out buying it online for such a cheap price compared to what t normally is at salons, but this is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to note that this is a LEAVE IN conditioner. It is not meant to be washed out. You will be wasting product if you do. I like to shampoo and put this on after I get out of the shower and really brush it through my hair. I use a deep conditioning mask every other wash and my hair hasn&#x27;t been happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE - be prepared to lose some of the conditioner in transit. The cap was definitely not screwed on all the way and some leaked out.</li>
            <li> great price, great product, I do not leave home without it, no more frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I use this to roller set my hair. It leaves my hair soft and moisturized  all week. It&#x27;s great, took a little long to ship 7 days but I&#x27;m glad to have it.</li>
            <li> This product has a strong fragrance to it. it does wear off after a few hours. I wouldn&#x27;t say it does anything wonderful for my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t review products; most of them don&#x27;t deserve any hype, because even when they don&#x27;t necessarily damage your hair, they don&#x27;t necessarily improve anything either. In this product category, there aren&#x27;t that many conditioners that do much of anything to my hair except be in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fine hair is a combination between straight roots, loose waves and curly ends; body has to be manipulated by separating waves into tinier, individual strands. As a child, my hair was soft, could moisturize itself well, had a good pH balance, and an even looser curl pattern that looked so silky. After damaging it with heat throughout middle and high school, it became coarse, rough, had no silkiness to it, and absolutely no pattern. It was a rat&#x27;s nest of abused mess. After straightening my hair to cut the split ends this year, my mother&#x27;s sweet hair dresser recommended this to me in order to reduce split ends since I only wear my hair straight once a year now, and need to wear something to protect it when it&#x27;s wavy, which is what I&#x27;ve never done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leave-on ultimately brought my hair back to the way it was when I was a little girl, which I find surprising. The curls are voluminous, the texture is cotton-soft, the detangling gets easier over time, the light hits it in all the right places, I have less breakage at the ends of my hair, and it&#x27;s grown longer within only three months. My mother, who has kinkier, tighter-coiled hair, loves it, too. Like me, she doesn&#x27;t usually love anything, because she&#x27;d rather not deal with her hair. This stuff has shockingly made her hair look looser, much shiner, and softer to both the touch and the eye. This woman hasn&#x27;t worn her hair curly for decades, but this makes it easier to deal with. I wanted to tell my friends and family about this stuff, and that&#x27;s pretty rare, since I&#x27;m the type of person who automatically lowers their expectations so that the disappointment won&#x27;t be too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best method I&#x27;ve used with this leave-on is to braid the hair after you&#x27;ve put it in your damp strands. It works as a protective seal, and truly milks the benefits of all the texturizing this stuff does to your mane once it&#x27;s seeped into your drying strands. Add more to your ends; not too much to your scalp. Do NOT put this in your hair daily; this stuff is thick, and a leave-on is a leave-on until you&#x27;ve washed it out. Over-use will only make your hair heavy with this, and it might dry it out faster. You don&#x27;t want to suffocate your hair, you want it to breathe while being fed at the same time. If you feel you need more product to re-moisturize it during the week, dampen your hair and add it in. It works best on damp hair; not dry hair. Not for me, anyway. Let it dry IN your hair and do it before you go to bed, so that you can unbraid it, un-bun it, or etc when you wake up and have a nice, silky style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dedicate yourself to the 1 liter, or at least a good sized bottle; everything comes with time when you have a bit of leftover heat damage, but one to two uses was enough for my fingers to feel a big difference. With time, I plan to see more hair growth and permanent hair health. I include this conditioner with my egg hair mask regimens and etc. Heals and feeds my hair very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will surely buy this again since it&#x27;s proved to actually do something for me when I use it properly. I just hope the price stays this cheap, lol.th this leave-on is to braid the hair after you&#x27;ve put it in your damp strands.
