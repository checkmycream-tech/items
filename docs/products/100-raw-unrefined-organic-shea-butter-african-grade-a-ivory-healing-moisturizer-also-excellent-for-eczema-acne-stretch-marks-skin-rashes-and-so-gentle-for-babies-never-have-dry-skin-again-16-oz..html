            <li>I was sold this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>I liked the packaging, the consistency of the butter, the smell and the RESULTS.</li>
            <li>and you have to take it and soften it on your warm skin before it melts into it.  </li>
            <li>I have used shea butter before and liked it.</li>
            <li>It feels so nice when you put it on your skin.</li>
            <li>I love love love it!!  </li>
            <li>Then the amount that comes with the purchase, it&#x27;s a 16 oz jar filled to the top, a great value!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to have an amazing replacement that is so much better.</li>
            <li>So far this is the best organic unrefined Shea butter I have tried.</li>

            <li>It smells great, feels wonderful going on &amp; it&#x27;s much better than any other Shea butter I&#x27;ve used.</li>

            <li>I love the customer service that they give you</li>
            <li>This Shea Butter is so smooth!  </li>
            <li>I realize since I got it that when in the kitchen I wash my hands many times.  </li>
            <li>It will take me a while to get through the jar, but I will buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;â€¢1 teaspoon argan oil (I love this one:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a versatile product &amp; the quality is wonderful!</li>
            <li>I love this Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>It works better than lotions.</li>
            <li>but the fragrance comes mostly from the peroxide value in the shea butter.</li>
            <li>(  not greasy at all) I&#x27;m  in love  with this product</li>
            <li>I love this shea butter.</li>
            <li>This feels SO smooth and moisturizing!</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried many Shea Butters over the years.</li>
            <li>My hands are doing so much better.</li>
            <li>the family needs it :)</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s organic with nothing else added to it.</li>
            <li>It took me about a minute to fall in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I have asked many questions to assure this.</li>
            <li>I am also finding so many uses for Shea Butter that I had not considered.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a light natural smell, very pleasant.</li>
            <li>First of all, the jar hold a LOT of shea butter, so I was firstly impressed with how much you get for your money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot for that amazing product!</li>
            <li>I love that the jar it literally filled to the top.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to have found the right Shea Butter which I can order right from my home at any time and trust its natural great smoothing effects on my skin.</li>
            <li>And the jar was filled to the top and sealed.  </li>
            <li>compared to other shea butter, I would say this is the best thing I&#x27;ve seen!</li>
            <li>and it melts and easily smooths onto my skin.</li>
            <li>It also has that beautiful nutty smell that only unrefined Shea butter has.  </li>
            <li>Slathering shea butter and covering in gloves and socks overnight makes a huge difference in their pliability and softness.  </li>
            <li>Also, since I handle a lot of paper I tried putting it on my hands then putting on latex free surgical gloves while I did my paperwork.</li>
            <li>This is so effective because it stays on the surface much longer.</li>
            <li>1/2-3/4&#x27;s of the way filled these days.</li>
            <li>I probably would have liked your product if it had been shipped with reasonable care.</li>
            <li>The jar was filled to the rim as stated.</li>
            <li>It puts a nice barrier between my skin and the environment while really penetrating my skin.</li>
            <li>This product is smooth in texture and creamy.</li>
            <li>I like to trust that what I put on my skin, is healthy as it is absorbed into my body.</li>
            <li>The price was right &amp; will get more when I run out.</li>
            <li>Nowadays most of the body product we buy are highly toxic and more a liability than a benefit to put on our body.</li>
            <li>I am so grateful when I find a genuinely clean, toxin-free skin care product.</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly and easily, and absorbed quickly with no sticky or greasy residue, not even on my fingers.</li>
            <li>So I would have to say this is the best smelling thing I would put on my skin that doesn&#x27;t feel too oily or sticky... and I am extremely particular about what I put on my skin, careful to use nothing with any sort of chemical.</li>
            <li>This product is not only the most powerful and effective moisturizer I have ever used</li>
            <li>The container is filled to the brim - which I LOVE, it&#x27;s a pet peeve of mine that many containers only come</li>
            <li>The Shea Butter is not greasy, absorbs nicely, and my hands feel noticeably softer all day despite frequent hand washing.</li>
            <li>For the nighttime treatment the shea butter has time to soak in for super moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this in the future :).</li>
            <li>I am really excited that I discovered this right before the summer sandal season</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been creative and life affirming to find and create new healing uses as well.</li>
            <li>To the touch it feels very soft, spreads easily and leaves a nice soft feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li>I personally enjoy the scent of Shea butter but can&#x27;t really explain it to someone who hasn&#x27;t smelled it before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shea butter has many uses but so far I am using it on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>It almost seems sticky but that is what makes it so powerful.</li>
            <li>Thank you yet again for this treasure and best kept secret.</li>
            <li>This product has no scent, so it is perfect if you have other scent things you want to put on (like essential oils)  </li>
            <li>Fully sealed but easy to open, and the jar was filled right to the brim with shea butter - no wasted air space as many products have.</li>
            <li>and I noticed improvement almost right away.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I liked about this Shea Butter is that the only ingredient is &amp;#34;Organic Shea Butter&amp;#34;, that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>It may sound odd but it is really effective.</li>
            <li>it is really a super great product, especially if you have dry feet (with callouses) and elbows.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I can say that is not so great, is that it is very solid</li>
            <li>&amp; there was a huge difference; my left hand looked hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>the coconut oil and shea butter together (a measuring cup in a saucepan of hot water works well)&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when the jar arrived was the list of ingredients.</li>
            <li>The quality of this Shea butter is outstanding and instantly hydrates and moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li>it was my first time using it.</li>
            <li>The product is completely odorless, which is important to me.</li>
            <li>Thanks for replacing the product and making things right.</li>
            <li>However it made my right hand that didn&#x27;t have the Shea Butter look older and dry:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Living in Colorado, the air is so dry I need something super moisturizing but found myself not using the shea butter I had on had because it wasn&#x27;t very creamy or easy to spread.  </li>
            <li>I like to make my own deodorant, and I can see that mixing this with a little baking soda will give me exactly the product I want.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t melt into my skin easily and had tiny particles that didn&#x27;t melt at all and had to be removed from my skin.</li>
            <li>...seller certainly didn&#x27;t skimp out on the amount~</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for massaging and stays wet but not too wet when applied</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very oily because after all it is butter</li>
            <li>I have never used Shea Butter Before, but I really like it, and I am going to try and use it with coconut oil as well.</li>
            <li>I wish it had been creamy white and smooth as your picture depicted.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Shea Butter on my whole body since I received it</li>
            <li>Customer service has been very helpful.</li>
            <li>But I guess I&#x27;m just not crazy about the natural smell of shea butter.  </li>
            <li>I opened the jar right up and used some on my left hand and then compared it to my right hand</li>
            <li>sure there are tons of other DIY recipes for skin that include Shea butter online.</li>
            <li>I put the jar in a cool area and checked it the next day.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely use this company as my source for shea butter in the future. :)</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to sample the Shea butter first and instantly knew I had to order some.  </li>
            <li>Long story short, I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Definitely high quality butter.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Shea Butter and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li>No other moisturizing product I have ever tried has worked so effectively as this one to make my skin sooooo soft, and in such a short period of time as overnight!  </li>
            <li>through clean, dry hair and let sit for 20-30 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Rinse hair and shampoo as normal</li>
            <li>This product is from an organic source, which is very important to me, it is unrefined, it&#x27;s raw.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact it is raw and without additives.</li>
            <li>I like to apply it to my chap lips, it leaves them very soft.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>In the morning, the shea butter had soaked into my skin and it felt as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom, no kidding!  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>he commented that his hands were super soft and the rough chapped parts of his hands did not hurt anymore.</li>
            <li>I also called the company with a question and found them very responsive and helpful which further enhanced my WOW!</li>
            <li>You need to know that this is not like other moisturizers that quickly soak into your skin.</li>
            <li>After using this Shea Butter for a few days my hands were soft and had a smooth feel and the cracks began to heal.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this I actually didnâ€™t pay much attention to the size thinking it would be packaged like the others.</li>
            <li>and there is so much in the container that I expect it to last all summer and beyond.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and moist.</li>
            <li>I waited awhile prior to doing this review as I really wanted to see how it did on my blemishes over a period of time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told by the seller latex naturally occurs in shea</li>
            <li>After a couple weeks of using this product, the itching has stopped and the skin is soft again.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to anyone wants softer smoother skin.</li>
            <li>I like this product as far as the moisturizing properties go.</li>
            <li>I was looking for Shea Butter which could assist my skin in feeling much softer and moisturized specially for rough areas of my skin, like for example, the heels, which tend to get dry, at times.</li>
            <li>mixture cool slightly then add Argan oil&lt;br /&gt;Whip</li>
            <li>Putting the cream on feels nice, eventhough it is not as liquid as other body lotions, so you have to work on it for a few seconds.</li>
            <li>It has a very-very subtle, vanilla-like smell that I love.</li>
            <li>This Shea butter really does the trick on dry skin</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly in the hand,  a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because technically it&#x27;s not 100% raw or true primal, but as far as a natural product you can by &amp;#34;off the shelve&amp;#34; or</li>
            <li>The rough, dry areas, like elbows or heels of the feet, were left smooth.</li>
            <li>has finally done the trick, now my elbows are soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>I am a professional landscaper and a handyman and work with my hands a lot my hands were cracked and dry from working outside.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s such a versatile product &amp; the quality is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love this Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> It works better than lotions.</li>
            <li> but the fragrance comes mostly from the peroxide value in the shea butter.</li>
            <li> (  not greasy at all) I&#x27;m  in love  with this product</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter.</li>
            <li> This feels SO smooth and moisturizing!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried many Shea Butters over the years.</li>
            <li> My hands are doing so much better.</li>
            <li> the family needs it :)</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s organic with nothing else added to it.</li>
            <li> It took me about a minute to fall in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I have asked many questions to assure this.</li>
            <li> I am also finding so many uses for Shea Butter that I had not considered.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a light natural smell, very pleasant.</li>
            <li> First of all, the jar hold a LOT of shea butter, so I was firstly impressed with how much you get for your money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot for that amazing product!</li>
            <li> I love that the jar it literally filled to the top.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to have found the right Shea Butter which I can order right from my home at any time and trust its natural great smoothing effects on my skin.</li>
            <li> And the jar was filled to the top and sealed.  </li>
            <li> compared to other shea butter, I would say this is the best thing I&#x27;ve seen!</li>
            <li> and it melts and easily smooths onto my skin.</li>
            <li> It also has that beautiful nutty smell that only unrefined Shea butter has.  </li>
            <li> Slathering shea butter and covering in gloves and socks overnight makes a huge difference in their pliability and softness.  </li>
            <li> Also, since I handle a lot of paper I tried putting it on my hands then putting on latex free surgical gloves while I did my paperwork.</li>
            <li> This is so effective because it stays on the surface much longer.</li>
            <li> 1/2-3/4&#x27;s of the way filled these days.</li>
            <li> I probably would have liked your product if it had been shipped with reasonable care.</li>
            <li> The jar was filled to the rim as stated.</li>
            <li> It puts a nice barrier between my skin and the environment while really penetrating my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is smooth in texture and creamy.</li>
            <li> I like to trust that what I put on my skin, is healthy as it is absorbed into my body.</li>
            <li> The price was right &amp; will get more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Nowadays most of the body product we buy are highly toxic and more a liability than a benefit to put on our body.</li>
            <li> I am so grateful when I find a genuinely clean, toxin-free skin care product.</li>
            <li> It went on smoothly and easily, and absorbed quickly with no sticky or greasy residue, not even on my fingers.</li>
            <li> So I would have to say this is the best smelling thing I would put on my skin that doesn&#x27;t feel too oily or sticky... and I am extremely particular about what I put on my skin, careful to use nothing with any sort of chemical.</li>
            <li> This product is not only the most powerful and effective moisturizer I have ever used</li>
            <li> The container is filled to the brim - which I LOVE, it&#x27;s a pet peeve of mine that many containers only come</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter is not greasy, absorbs nicely, and my hands feel noticeably softer all day despite frequent hand washing.</li>
            <li> For the nighttime treatment the shea butter has time to soak in for super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this in the future :).</li>
            <li> I am really excited that I discovered this right before the summer sandal season</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been creative and life affirming to find and create new healing uses as well.</li>
            <li> To the touch it feels very soft, spreads easily and leaves a nice soft feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li> I personally enjoy the scent of Shea butter but can&#x27;t really explain it to someone who hasn&#x27;t smelled it before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shea butter has many uses but so far I am using it on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> It almost seems sticky but that is what makes it so powerful.</li>
            <li> Thank you yet again for this treasure and best kept secret.</li>
            <li> This product has no scent, so it is perfect if you have other scent things you want to put on (like essential oils)  </li>
            <li> Fully sealed but easy to open, and the jar was filled right to the brim with shea butter - no wasted air space as many products have.</li>
            <li> and I noticed improvement almost right away.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I liked about this Shea Butter is that the only ingredient is &amp;#34;Organic Shea Butter&amp;#34;, that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> It may sound odd but it is really effective.</li>
            <li> it is really a super great product, especially if you have dry feet (with callouses) and elbows.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I can say that is not so great, is that it is very solid</li>
            <li> &amp; there was a huge difference; my left hand looked hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> the coconut oil and shea butter together (a measuring cup in a saucepan of hot water works well)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when the jar arrived was the list of ingredients.</li>
            <li> The quality of this Shea butter is outstanding and instantly hydrates and moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li> it was my first time using it.</li>
            <li> The product is completely odorless, which is important to me.</li>
            <li> Thanks for replacing the product and making things right.</li>
            <li> However it made my right hand that didn&#x27;t have the Shea Butter look older and dry:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Living in Colorado, the air is so dry I need something super moisturizing but found myself not using the shea butter I had on had because it wasn&#x27;t very creamy or easy to spread.  </li>
            <li> I like to make my own deodorant, and I can see that mixing this with a little baking soda will give me exactly the product I want.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t melt into my skin easily and had tiny particles that didn&#x27;t melt at all and had to be removed from my skin.</li>
            <li> ...seller certainly didn&#x27;t skimp out on the amount~</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for massaging and stays wet but not too wet when applied</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very oily because after all it is butter</li>
            <li> I have never used Shea Butter Before, but I really like it, and I am going to try and use it with coconut oil as well.</li>
            <li> I wish it had been creamy white and smooth as your picture depicted.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Shea Butter on my whole body since I received it</li>
            <li> Customer service has been very helpful.</li>
            <li> But I guess I&#x27;m just not crazy about the natural smell of shea butter.  </li>
            <li> I opened the jar right up and used some on my left hand and then compared it to my right hand</li>
            <li> sure there are tons of other DIY recipes for skin that include Shea butter online.</li>
            <li> I put the jar in a cool area and checked it the next day.</li>
            <li> and I will definitely use this company as my source for shea butter in the future. :)</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to sample the Shea butter first and instantly knew I had to order some.  </li>
            <li> Long story short, I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Definitely high quality butter.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Shea Butter and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> No other moisturizing product I have ever tried has worked so effectively as this one to make my skin sooooo soft, and in such a short period of time as overnight!  </li>
            <li> through clean, dry hair and let sit for 20-30 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Rinse hair and shampoo as normal</li>
            <li> This product is from an organic source, which is very important to me, it is unrefined, it&#x27;s raw.</li>
            <li> and I love the fact it is raw and without additives.</li>
            <li> I like to apply it to my chap lips, it leaves them very soft.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> In the morning, the shea butter had soaked into my skin and it felt as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom, no kidding!  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> he commented that his hands were super soft and the rough chapped parts of his hands did not hurt anymore.</li>
            <li> I also called the company with a question and found them very responsive and helpful which further enhanced my WOW!</li>
            <li> You need to know that this is not like other moisturizers that quickly soak into your skin.</li>
            <li> After using this Shea Butter for a few days my hands were soft and had a smooth feel and the cracks began to heal.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this I actually didnâ€™t pay much attention to the size thinking it would be packaged like the others.</li>
            <li> and there is so much in the container that I expect it to last all summer and beyond.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and moist.</li>
            <li> I waited awhile prior to doing this review as I really wanted to see how it did on my blemishes over a period of time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told by the seller latex naturally occurs in shea</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks of using this product, the itching has stopped and the skin is soft again.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone wants softer smoother skin.</li>
            <li> I like this product as far as the moisturizing properties go.</li>
            <li> I was looking for Shea Butter which could assist my skin in feeling much softer and moisturized specially for rough areas of my skin, like for example, the heels, which tend to get dry, at times.</li>
            <li> mixture cool slightly then add Argan oil&lt;br /&gt;Whip</li>
            <li> Putting the cream on feels nice, eventhough it is not as liquid as other body lotions, so you have to work on it for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> It has a very-very subtle, vanilla-like smell that I love.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter really does the trick on dry skin</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly in the hand,  a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because technically it&#x27;s not 100% raw or true primal, but as far as a natural product you can by &amp;#34;off the shelve&amp;#34; or</li>
            <li> The rough, dry areas, like elbows or heels of the feet, were left smooth.</li>
            <li> has finally done the trick, now my elbows are soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> I am a professional landscaper and a handyman and work with my hands a lot my hands were cracked and dry from working outside.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just been using this product for a few days now mainly for dry cuticles.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin very very soft after using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> I even put some on my face, which I normally don&#x27;t do, even though I always use organic and raw.</li>
            <li> I will be using this for a long time......</li>
            <li> I have been doing massage for roughly a year and have tried a lot of different products.</li>
            <li> I used this on my feet which have had a chronic itching, flakiness, and hardness of skin on the bottom of my feet and between the toes for a long time.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> After that, my skin remained hydrated all day long which simply doesn&#x27;t happen with other creams, ever.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and this jar will probably last me a year with daily use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as creamy as butter -- it is definitely not grainy like other shea butters I have ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have battled both extremely dry hands and feet for decades.</li>
            <li> No wonder they are dry all day.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dry, flaky skin on my palms and fingers anymore.</li>
            <li> My husband is going to start using the Shea Butter also for his dry and cracked hands.</li>
            <li> I tried some immediately on the dry skin of my neck.</li>
            <li> On the upside, it smells better than a lot of the 100% raw and natural products a primal dieter might use on his skin... except cold pressed coconut oil!</li>
            <li> /&gt;â€¢A few drops of essential oil</li>
            <li> But this shea product is certainly not as greasy as coconut oil.</li>
            <li> , I got a bit carried away and put it all over my body when I got it, and every other night since then as well....</li>
            <li> When I unboxed the jars, they were liquid due to the summer heat.</li>
            <li> I am a hard core primal dieter and this comes as close to primal as you can get without making it yourself from natural raw sources.</li>
            <li> I love shea butter and sometimes ordering on the internet is a crap shoot.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry elbows and just a small amount of this Shea butter</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the heavy perfumes they put in other butters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no graininess like with other raw shea butters that i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is usually a superlong list on other products.</li>
            <li> Im not  happy with the smell, but i mixed it with a little bit of  coconut oil and applied  to my hair.</li>
            <li> It took a few applications to get used to the essence it emits, but my boyfriend and I have grown to like the scent.</li>
            <li> I have even had a few who would like to purchase some for their home use.  </li>
            <li> once my hair dried  my curls looks so healty and shiny. ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Shea Butter for the past week and a half on my hands and lips every night.</li>
            <li> I am a farmer and my hands and feet really get in bad condition.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked at how much you get for this price.  </li>
            <li> Usually shea butter is sold in very small containers and pricey.</li>
            <li> hard as a rock</li>
            <li> It was difficult to apply.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was looking for Shea Butter which could assist my skin in feeling much softer and moisturized specially for rough areas of my skin, like for example, the heels, which tend to get dry, at times. I can also use it anywhere on the body as a moisturizer. This product is from an organic source, which is very important to me, it is unrefined, it&#x27;s raw. I feel safe using it. To the touch it feels very soft, spreads easily and leaves a nice soft feeling on the skin. I am happy to have found the right Shea Butter which I can order right from my home at any time and trust its natural great smoothing effects on my skin. I love the customer service that they give you and I can trust them.</li>
            <li> Wow! I&#x27;m impressed. This Shea butter is amazing.  I have really dry elbows and just a small amount of this Shea butter has finally done the trick, now my elbows are soft and supple.  I had my husband try this because he has the roughest sand papery hands (he does construction) he rubbed about a pea size all over his hands and this morning when he woke up he commented that his hands were super soft and the rough chapped parts of his hands did not hurt anymore. It also has that beautiful nutty smell that only unrefined Shea butter has.  I love that the jar it literally filled to the top.  A little goes a long way and this jar will probably last me a year with daily use.</li>
            <li> Wow! This product is not only the most powerful and effective moisturizer I have ever used but it is also a very good bargain. Usually shea butter is sold in very small containers and pricey. When I ordered this I actually didnâ€™t pay much attention to the size thinking it would be packaged like the others. I was shocked at how much you get for this price.  I have battled both extremely dry hands and feet for decades. I have tried all kinds of products and all kinds of techniques. Shea butter has many uses but so far I am using it on my hands and feet. I had the BEST SUCCESS EVER by putting the product on my hands and feet at night then putting on cotton gloves and cotton socks. Also, since I handle a lot of paper I tried putting it on my hands then putting on latex free surgical gloves while I did my paperwork. It may sound odd but it is really effective. I buy a big box of the surgical gloves and toss them after each use. They act like a second skin. You can use your cell phone, text, and type with them on. After awhile I take them off then wash just my palms and fingertips with a soap that can cut grease as the product is still on my hands. For the nighttime treatment the shea butter has time to soak in for super moisturizing. You need to know that this is not like other moisturizers that quickly soak into your skin. This is so effective because it stays on the surface much longer. It almost seems sticky but that is what makes it so powerful. I am really excited that I discovered this right before the summer sandal season and there is so much in the container that I expect it to last all summer and beyond. I will buy it again and I gave it the highest recommendation. I also called the company with a question and found them very responsive and helpful which further enhanced my WOW!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just been using this product for a few days now mainly for dry cuticles.  This Shea butter really does the trick on dry skin and I noticed improvement almost right away.  I also used it on the heels of my feet and that is quite a challenge because the dryness I experience has gone on for years.  But, in just the short time that I have used it, I have noticed some change.  It&#x27;s very oily because after all it is butter so you&#x27;ll definitely need socks at night so your bed sheets don&#x27;t get stained.  I was sold this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Great Stuff here! It&#x27;s great for massaging and stays wet but not too wet when applied</li>
            <li> This is a great product!! I have never used Shea Butter Before, but I really like it, and I am going to try and use it with coconut oil as well. The container is filled to the brim - which I LOVE, it&#x27;s a pet peeve of mine that many containers only come 1/2-3/4&#x27;s of the way filled these days. I received excellent service from the seller too!</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is so smooth!  It lasts also.  I realize since I got it that when in the kitchen I wash my hands many times.  No wonder they are dry all day.  Now with this moisturizing Shea Butter I don&#x27;t have to contend with that.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  My skin is soft and moist. It smells a bit like party balloons. It took a few applications to get used to the essence it emits, but my boyfriend and I have grown to like the scent. We chuckle about it because every time one of has it on we think of birthdays! I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> The first thing I liked about this Shea Butter is that the only ingredient is &amp;#34;Organic Shea Butter&amp;#34;, that&#x27;s it. Then the amount that comes with the purchase, it&#x27;s a 16 oz jar filled to the top, a great value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light natural smell, very pleasant. I don&#x27;t like the heavy perfumes they put in other butters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I applied it to my skin it left it totally moisturized. The rough, dry areas, like elbows or heels of the feet, were left smooth. It instantly repaired the cracked areas, to my surprise. I like to apply it to my chap lips, it leaves them very soft. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I just received this today and I love it!  First of all, the jar hold a LOT of shea butter, so I was firstly impressed with how much you get for your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I secondly really love it&#x27;s texture!  It&#x27;s as creamy as butter -- it is definitely not grainy like other shea butters I have ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in Colorado, the air is so dry I need something super moisturizing but found myself not using the shea butter I had on had because it wasn&#x27;t very creamy or easy to spread.  None of this is an issue with this product...I love love love it!!  Thank you and I will definitely use this company as my source for shea butter in the future. :)</li>
            <li> I waited awhile prior to doing this review as I really wanted to see how it did on my blemishes over a period of time.  I am happy to say that I can see a difference from when I started using the butter until now.  I liked the packaging, the consistency of the butter, the smell and the RESULTS. It will take me a while to get through the jar, but I will buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for moisturizing your skin after the shower. It doesn&#x27;t just sit on your skin, it actually soaks in without feeling greasy. I personally enjoy the scent of Shea butter but can&#x27;t really explain it to someone who hasn&#x27;t smelled it before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this as an ingredient in a DIY deep conditioning treatment that makes my hair feel amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the recipe (serves 1) -&lt;br /&gt;{ingredients}&lt;br /&gt;â€¢2 tablespoons coconut oil&lt;br /&gt;â€¢1 tablespoon of Shea butter&lt;br /&gt;â€¢1 teaspoon argan oil (I love this one: Argan Oil - Beauty by Earth https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I134Y82/ref&#x3D;cm_sw_r_awd_.V2yvb1909M2M )&lt;br /&gt;â€¢A few drops of essential oil (good ones for hair are lavender, peppermint, rosemary, geranium and clary sage)&lt;br /&gt;{Instructions}&lt;br /&gt;Melt the coconut oil and shea butter together (a measuring cup in a saucepan of hot water works well)&lt;br /&gt;Let mixture cool slightly then add Argan oil&lt;br /&gt;Whip together for 3-5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Comb through clean, dry hair and let sit for 20-30 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Rinse hair and shampoo as normal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure there are tons of other DIY recipes for skin that include Shea butter online. It&#x27;s such a versatile product &amp; the quality is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I tried this organic Shea Butter because I heard a lot of good things about it and I am very happy I did. It is very pleasant and feels wonderful on the skin. I will continue using it and also give it to my daughter to help with her acne. Nowadays most of the body product we buy are highly toxic and more a liability than a benefit to put on our body. This product is a blessing and I love the fact it is raw and without additives. Thanks a lot for that amazing product!</li>
            <li> I love this Shea Butter. The smell is so pleasant and it melts and easily smooths onto my skin. There is no graininess like with other raw shea butters that i&#x27;ve tried. It works better than lotions.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I know that Shea butter is the best moisturizer for your skin.  And I also will only buy Organic, because I don&#x27;t like having chemicals and fillers in the products I put on my skin (or in my body).  This product did not disappoint me at all....it is really a super great product, especially if you have dry feet (with callouses) and elbows.  I have to admit, I got a bit carried away and put it all over my body when I got it, and every other night since then as well....In the morning, the shea butter had soaked into my skin and it felt as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom, no kidding!  This product has no scent, so it is perfect if you have other scent things you want to put on (like essential oils)  No other moisturizing product I have ever tried has worked so effectively as this one to make my skin sooooo soft, and in such a short period of time as overnight!  I will be using this for a long time......also helps to preserve my tan and keep it from looking cracked as the skin starts to shed.  The only thing I can say that is not so great, is that it is very solid and you have to take it and soften it on your warm skin before it melts into it.  Superior Product for sure!  I love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have been doing massage for roughly a year and have tried a lot of different products. I was fortunate enough to sample the Shea butter first and instantly knew I had to order some.  It heats up very quickly in the hand,  a little goes a long way and it gives a smooth glide but still allows for a great kneading.  Another upside is that Shea butter is amazing for the skin.  It is a win win and clients seem to love it. I have even had a few who would like to purchase some for their home use.  I will be buying more of this in the future :). THANKS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rolando W&lt;br /&gt;MA 76191</li>
            <li> Just received it yesterday and I already love it!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I am a hard core primal dieter and this comes as close to primal as you can get without making it yourself from natural raw sources. It smells a bit like latex. I&#x27;ve been told by the seller latex naturally occurs in shea but the fragrance comes mostly from the peroxide value in the shea butter. On the upside, it smells better than a lot of the 100% raw and natural products a primal dieter might use on his skin... except cold pressed coconut oil! But this shea product is certainly not as greasy as coconut oil. So I would have to say this is the best smelling thing I would put on my skin that doesn&#x27;t feel too oily or sticky... and I am extremely particular about what I put on my skin, careful to use nothing with any sort of chemical. I gave it 4 stars because technically it&#x27;s not 100% raw or true primal, but as far as a natural product you can by &amp;#34;off the shelve&amp;#34; or compared to other shea butter, I would say this is the best thing I&#x27;ve seen!</li>
            <li> I have used shea butter before and liked it. I probably would have liked your product if it had been shipped with reasonable care. When I unboxed the jars, they were liquid due to the summer heat. I put the jar in a cool area and checked it the next day. It had solidified and was a gray/brown color. I rubbed some on my skin. It was difficult to apply. It didn&#x27;t melt into my skin easily and had tiny particles that didn&#x27;t melt at all and had to be removed from my skin. I wish it had been creamy white and smooth as your picture depicted.  Thanks for replacing the product and making things right.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when the jar arrived was the list of ingredients. It goes: &amp;#34;Organic African Shea Butter&amp;#34;. Period. Nothing else. WOW! This is usually a superlong list on other products. Then I opened it and smelled it. It has a very-very subtle, vanilla-like smell that I love. Putting the cream on feels nice, eventhough it is not as liquid as other body lotions, so you have to work on it for a few seconds. After that, my skin remained hydrated all day long which simply doesn&#x27;t happen with other creams, ever. It does leave a silky residue for maybe a minute but it is not oily so you can get dressed immediately. Long story short, I love it and highly recommend it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Firstly, I was impressed by the packaging for this Shea Butter, in it&#x27;s brown jar, I appreciate that. I opened the jar right up and used some on my left hand and then compared it to my right hand &amp; there was a huge difference; my left hand looked hydrated and smooth. However it made my right hand that didn&#x27;t have the Shea Butter look older and dry:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Shea Butter on my whole body since I received it &amp; I like it a lot!  I was sent an instruction sheet with different uses for it which is great.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product &amp; I definitely will purchase it again. Now, I can&#x27;t imagine being without it. It will make a great gift for my friends &amp; family too. Thank you, Jenna Ringle</li>
            <li> The quality of this Shea butter is outstanding and instantly hydrates and moisturizes my skin. I even put some on my face, which I normally don&#x27;t do, even though I always use organic and raw. So far this is the best organic unrefined Shea butter I have tried.</li>
            <li> I used this on my feet which have had a chronic itching, flakiness, and hardness of skin on the bottom of my feet and between the toes for a long time. After a couple weeks of using this product, the itching has stopped and the skin is soft again. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Im not  happy with the smell, but i mixed it with a little bit of  coconut oil and applied  to my hair. OMG .... once my hair dried  my curls looks so healty and shiny. .. (  not greasy at all) I&#x27;m  in love  with this product it was my first time using it.</li>
            <li> I received this a shea butter at the time that was stated. I love this shea butter. The jar was filled to the rim as stated. I will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Great product for great price! Definitely high quality butter. The container was packed to the brim, as well...seller certainly didn&#x27;t skimp out on the amount~</li>
            <li> This feels SO smooth and moisturizing! It puts a nice barrier between my skin and the environment while really penetrating my skin. I&#x27;m a dancer and it feels particularly nice at night on my feet before bedtime. :)</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  I love shea butter and sometimes ordering on the internet is a crap shoot.  This stuff was on the money!!  And the jar was filled to the top and sealed.  I often wonder how products are packed when there is no seal.  This was definitely superior quality shea butter.  I have used shea butter for years and this is one of the nicest and smoothest I have tried.  I am a farmer and my hands and feet really get in bad condition.  Slathering shea butter and covering in gloves and socks overnight makes a huge difference in their pliability and softness.  Kudos to the supplier - job well done!  Good value, good product, what more could I want???</li>
            <li> hard as a rock I cant even the  butter out and it don&#x27;t smell good either.</li>
            <li> This product is smooth in texture and creamy. It feels so nice when you put it on your skin. It makes my skin very very soft after using it for a few days. I like the fact that you get a lot - 16 oz. It lasts a long time. I highly recommend this Shea Butter and will be buying it again. We&#x27;ve tried many Shea Butters over the years. If you have too you&#x27;ll like this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Shea Butter for the past week and a half on my hands and lips every night. My hands are doing so much better. I wash my hands A LOT and I had been using something recommended by a doctor for years prior to this Shea Butter (it was greasy and didn&#x27;t have lasting results). The Shea Butter is not greasy, absorbs nicely, and my hands feel noticeably softer all day despite frequent hand washing. I am thrilled to have an amazing replacement that is so much better. I don&#x27;t have dry, flaky skin on my palms and fingers anymore. My husband is going to start using the Shea Butter also for his dry and cracked hands. He works with his hands and has to wash a lot also. I&#x27;ll update the review with his results soon and will definitely butter up anywhere else the family needs it :)</li>
            <li> The transaction was very quick &amp; I love the product! It smells great, feels wonderful going on &amp; it&#x27;s much better than any other Shea butter I&#x27;ve used. I love that it&#x27;s organic with nothing else added to it. I will tell my friends they should get it from this company. The price was right &amp; will get more when I run out. :) thank you!</li>
            <li> I am a professional landscaper and a handyman and work with my hands a lot my hands were cracked and dry from working outside. After using this Shea Butter for a few days my hands were soft and had a smooth feel and the cracks began to heal. I definitely recommend this product to anyone wants softer smoother skin.</li>
            <li> It took me about a minute to fall in love with this product. The packaging is great, to start with. Fully sealed but easy to open, and the jar was filled right to the brim with shea butter - no wasted air space as many products have. I tried some immediately on the dry skin of my neck. It went on smoothly and easily, and absorbed quickly with no sticky or greasy residue, not even on my fingers. The product is completely odorless, which is important to me. I like to make my own deodorant, and I can see that mixing this with a little baking soda will give me exactly the product I want. Great pricing too!</li>
            <li> Thank you! Thank you.....to the manufacturers of this product. I am so grateful when I find a genuinely clean, toxin-free skin care product. I like to trust that what I put on my skin, is healthy as it is absorbed into my body. I am confident that this company is looking out for my best interests. I have asked many questions to assure this. Customer service has been very helpful. I am also finding so many uses for Shea Butter that I had not considered. It&#x27;s been creative and life affirming to find and create new healing uses as well. Thank you yet again for this treasure and best kept secret.</li>
            <li> I like this product as far as the moisturizing properties go. But I guess I&#x27;m just not crazy about the natural smell of shea butter.  It smells &amp;#34;smokey&amp;#34;.</li>
