            <li>I get so many compliments  </li>

            <li>This kits is fabulous!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite eye shadow collections is the Natual Eye.</li>
            <li>My favorite mixture is Silk Teddy all over my eyelids, Pushup on the crease, and Honeypot towards the end of my lids.</li>
            <li>I know they will love them.  </li>
            <li>The bottom two rows of eyeshadow are shimmer, and the top row (the \\&quot;daytime\\&quot; look) is all matte.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I love the shimmer as I feel it brightens my eye and makes me look more</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this palette.</li>
            <li>What I love more than anything the color you will use the most comes in the largest pan.  </li>
            <li>My niece will love this set of neutral eye shadows.</li>
            <li>Still, it is fantastic!</li>

            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to see that the box it comes in is slimmer, which makes it easier for me to pack in my makeup bag for trips.</li>
            <li>I really, really love these colors.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Too Faced cosmetics, Naked eye palette is the best palette you could ever have.</li>
            <li>I love them and don&#x27;t know how I managed before I got it...</li>
            <li>All of the colors are incredibly pigmented, and the shades are perfect for me since I only ever use neutral and natural colors.</li>
            <li>Will to buy more shadow colors.</li>
            <li>I  love this pallet.</li>
            <li>She likes it , so I love it.</li>
            <li>People are making very poor/low quality copies of what should be a great product.</li>
            <li>I love these colors and feel they work well on just about anyone.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better if you use it with their primer.</li>
            <li>but the top row is what I use more often in the daytime.</li>
            <li>Faced eye shadows and enjoyed them.  </li>
            <li>I love the cards detailing how to do the make up.  </li>
            <li>My favorite colors are Honey Pot and Cocoa Puff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>This has been my stand by and favorite for years.</li>
            <li>We both love this palette.</li>
            <li>Love the color pallettes and the sturdy case.  </li>

            <li>i absolutely love this product.</li>

            <li>and I just love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy more from too faced because of its look and quality.</li>
            <li>We all love these products.  </li>
            <li>Love too faced</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase more Too</li>
            <li>My favorite is \\&quot;honey pot\\</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than purchasing from Ulta!!!!  </li>
            <li>The warm earthy tones are rich and compliment any eye color and outfit.</li>
            <li>Faced seems to be a great brand, and thus far I am pretty happy with everything I&#x27;ve gotten from them.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful, and I think its great for medium/dark skin tones but this set has a few drawbacks.    </li>
            <li>(well, in all fairness, my dog loved the first one when I was *</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>Beautiful natural shimmer</li>
            <li>I love that it is easy for travel.  </li>
            <li>I am glad to have bought this because it is so easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My love for VR in particular is just how SMOOTH it goes on and how great of a cappuccino color it is.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; set when I travel, and I don&#x27;t have to lug along my whole makeup box to look good.  </li>
            <li>this is a little compact that is perfect to put in your purse, the colors are great especially for someone older, not all that glitter stuff they sell these days, I am very happy with my choice...</li>
            <li>That being said, if you aren&#x27;t and you are looking for nice colors and willing to pay some more money for them, then i am sure these will work fine for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this pallette is awesome and I highly recommend it to anyone that likes sexy, natural eyes. :)</li>
            <li>However, it came early and in great condition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise they are very pigmented and gorgeous</li>
            <li>I received it as a gift, and I loved it so much</li>
            <li>Though these colors do go on easily and are quite complementary, i think that the shadow tones are not as pigmented as I wanted them to be.</li>
            <li>3 Easy Steps.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t blend as easily as hers.</li>
            <li>They also apply easily.  </li>
            <li>All three of the sets of colors are easy to wear.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this pallet it has neutral colors perfect for an everyday wear but also shimmery colors for a night out.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow glides on so smoothe and easy and lasts all day (with my sahdow primer).</li>
            <li>but the second row is beautiful too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my second favorite palette out of about 20 that I own!</li>
            <li>When I received the product in the mail, however, the tin case had dents, but the palette was fine.</li>
            <li>I think you have to know what works for your individual look, but I use a light hand with the darker colors and they wear just beautifully.  </li>
            <li>All the colors are beautifully pigmented - especially velvet revolver, and the top right chocolate shade.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when i first saw this palette of colored eyeshadow at sephora, and eager to add this collection of colors to my own makeup at home.</li>
            <li>These shadows are even more pretty in person!</li>
            <li>The DISCOUNTED PRICE + FREE SHIPPING + NO SALES TAX(state of TX)&#x3D; SAVED</li>
            <li>Great for a girl that&#x27;s just starting to use makeup.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow pallet cost $48.00 and came with free shipping.</li>
            <li>Since it is secure and doesn&#x27;t ruin your skin , it is for all ages.</li>
            <li>The brush that comes with it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I wanted just an every day kind of smokey eye pallet but much of this group is just too glittery for me.</li>
            <li>Such great neutrals and blend well with any color.</li>
            <li>Give a smooth look.</li>
            <li>The ones for after hours, I could not get to go on smooth even with a brush or with my finger tips..</li>
            <li>I absolutely cannot say enough about this product, I love it!!!!</li>
            <li>very satisfactory, person gifted liked it very much</li>
            <li>Also, all but the top row is very, very very sparkly.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, if you are as picky about eye shadows as i am, then i would suggest not wasting you time trying any of Too Faced eye shadows, because there are better shadows out there for a comparable price that have a higher pigmentation, and wear for longer.</li>
            <li>So I was excited to try this.  </li>
            <li>Worth every cent!</li>
            <li>The first 3-row of colors are perfect for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall though, this was a huge success to Too Faced</li>
            <li>Too faced natural eye is amazing.</li>
            <li>I saw the beautiful colors and the promise of the makeup lasting all day and it was for real.</li>
            <li>The colors are very complementary and the variations allow for light weekend beachy glow to smoky eyed evening vixen!  </li>
            <li>Was apprehensive to pay this much but so glad I did.</li>
            <li>For those fair, I would instead recommend Too Faced Naked Eye collection, they aren&#x27;t as brown.    </li>
            <li>Africa American and the neutral palette looked good on me also.</li>
            <li>Too faced cosmetics, Naked eye pallet is a good way  to spend your money.</li>
            <li>Bought as a present and my daughter loved it.</li>
            <li>My happiness was short lived however</li>
            <li>I think the third row is a bit sparkly for me and my age (and conservative workplace) but the shades are still gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Colors are true to what is shown.  </li>
            <li>and they quickly became a staple in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>Came quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li>However that was quickly remedied by using Too Faced Shadow Insurance.  </li>
            <li>Luckily it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, its my favorite palette because the colors are really pretty, and it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected it to be, goes on great</li>
            <li>Btw, I would suggest using your own full sized brushes as the one that comes with the kit is only about 3 inches</li>
            <li>This is the palette that will make getting ready for work easy.  </li>
            <li>I really like this eyeshadow because it is easy to follow the eye cards that come with it</li>
            <li>The look cards that it comes with are very helpful and easy to follow.</li>
            <li>but if it isnt here i want my money back for sure! ..</li>
            <li>I love that you can create many looks from a single compact.  </li>
            <li>The colors are true, rich in pigments, and stay put for a whole day.  </li>
            <li>Great for day wear to nighttime and glamorous occasions when you want a little sparkle.</li>
            <li>These colors are great because not only can you get a natural look to go anywhere</li>
            <li>Its worth the money</li>
            <li>Love the natural eye colors.</li>
            <li>a Look (Day, Fun, Night)</li>
            <li>Love these earthy browns for a natural look.</li>
            <li>She is picky too as I suspect most young women are.  </li>
            <li>The cards with tutorials are also really fun.</li>
            <li>By far my favorites are the top row (matte shades)</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>I am an african american woman and the colors look good on me and even my hubby like them!</li>
            <li>I have had no trouble with creasing and they are super easy to blend.  </li>
            <li>The colors are so pretty with great little tutorial cards with diagram for how to looks.  </li>
            <li>You will never have to worry about not having the right color.  </li>
            <li>just right    </li>
            <li>The second combo is what I use the most often - it&#x27;s a classy look that has a more bronze, golden, but pinkish look to it</li>
            <li>The colors are all really pigmented and with Two Faced Shadow Insurance, the shadow stays gorgeous all day long!</li>
            <li>I was not wearing eye shadow much except for special occasions.  </li>
            <li>But in general I still gave this 4/5 stars because I really do love Too Faced products.</li>
            <li>I use these shadows everyday the top colors are perfect for day wear, you can go heavy on the liner if you want for night as well...</li>
            <li>I have to take a dark color and blend it with one of the lighter/sparkly colors to get a good shade for my skin</li>
            <li>The good news is that the most often used colors are large so for the price the set should last a long time.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this kit, but if you like a REALLY natural eye, go easy.  </li>
            <li>The only problem i have is there is no eye brush with it., but overall great.</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d heeded a previous reviewer when she warned fair skinned folks away.  </li>
            <li>Several of them are \\&quot;iced\\&quot; and I prefer more matte formulas.  </li>
            <li>The colors are actually quite potent.</li>
            <li>I wear the first 2 rows all the time, but for the most part the 3rd is untouched.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more color combinations.  </li>
            <li>I thought that this would be an ice alternative, smaller, more colors</li>
            <li>she&#x27;d be interested in, and a bit cheaper.  </li>
            <li>and I even used it for her wedding makeup yesterday (my sister got married).  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this for those who like one package with all the eye shadow/liner you need for many different occasions.</li>
            <li>I love too faced products, especially their shadow palettes.</li>
            <li>It seems like you don&#x27;t get much of each color but trust me these last and are well worth the money :)</li>
            <li>so you have to be aware of that.</li>
            <li>The first two lines of colors might be ok, especially the first set.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the colors are really pretty.</li>
            <li>Worth the price &amp; fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the second line, as they go with just about anything.  </li>
            <li>i did end up purchasing the product from a local ulta and love it</li>
            <li>This is the first palette I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
            <li>but I think it can work pretty well with any warm-toned look.</li>
            <li>Being cheap in nature...i&#x27;m still surprised that i purchased this shadow.</li>
            <li>It is exactly how it was described and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pretty</li>
            <li>It is an adorable kit especially for a present and the sender was very sweet because she left me a note and a mini eye liner &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I found that by following the instructions, my eyes really looked more defined and pretty.</li>
            <li>however, it&#x27;s not hard to get one or two good natural looks by mixing different colors, not just using them as the cards say.</li>
            <li>This has been my go-to palette for a few years--great colors and with the instructions, it&#x27;s really easy to do a nice, natural eye for day or night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to go from day to night with a few quick changes and it comes with instruction cards on how to apply, which makes it virtually mistake proof.</li>
            <li>and I still wore pretty much every color in the box.</li>
            <li>The Neutral Eye set is my go-to for pretty much any occasion.</li>
            <li>but the top row is more subtle.</li>
            <li>very smooth and \\&quot;a little\\&quot; goes a long way!!  </li>
            <li>These are nice colors, although I do wish there was less sparkle.  </li>
            <li>consistency.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a buy for anyone looking for a quick, streamlined natural look.</li>
            <li>Pretty natural colors with a bit of shimmer for fun.  </li>
            <li>And even \\&quot;how to\\&quot; cars to show you how to achieve a certain look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Large color use from eye lid to brow line&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>The colors in this set are very pretty and look natural.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and the color pigments are very vibrant, and will last all day.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows give a beautiful subtle natural eye look just as promised.  </li>
            <li>Its a very versatile and nice little palette.  </li>
            <li>This cute package has three different sets of eyeshadow combinations and comes with cute little instruction cards to explain how to apply them.</li>
            <li>It has a pearl finish, but nothing with actual sparkle, so it is great for everyday wear (literally.</li>
            <li>Great palette for everyday looks, it has three cards for three different looks</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s very shimmery</li>
            <li>IT REALLY SHOULD BE PURCHASED IN THE STORES</li>
            <li>This palette goes with much everything.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>You could go through a whole day without the colors fading, or having to redo them.</li>
            <li>I paid $28 for this, which I thought was reasonable.</li>
            <li>It had all the neutral colors I was looking for and was also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>the &#x27;how to&#x27; cards are very helpful for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t wear much make up.</li>
            <li>im real worried</li>
            <li>I really like color combinations in this eye shadow collection.  </li>
            <li>I expected more matte</li>
            <li>so I would really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Only I wished it came in smaller case , as nice as it was, but takes up alot of space.</li>
            <li>Too Faced also included three simple to follow instruction cards for a &#x27;range of soft and sexy looks&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of weird that this is suppose to be &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look yet most of the shades is glittery.</li>
            <li>I am going to buy the other Two Faced Eye Shadow Collections pallets with other beautiful colors in them.</li>
            <li>There is so many looks that can come right from this one little palette.</li>
            <li>The third one is very pretty and is a little more glamorous and I use it for special occasions.</li>
            <li>, my personal or signature look with this palette is silk teddy on the lids, a little honey pot in the inner corner Erotica in the crease and coco puff for the outer corner, love it!!!</li>
            <li>The top row is a bit too bland for me personally, but I do use the top dark color to put on top of my eyeliner sometimes to set it.</li>
            <li>other then that i love it</li>
            <li>is that it has a bit more fallout than other shadows I have</li>
            <li>I use it more often than other eye shadow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read a few other reviews that say this set isn&#x27;t for the fair-skinned, but I am very fair skinned with dark hair, and I&#x27;ve never received more compliments than when I wear these colors.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting (especially when used with an eye primer), nicely pigmented, rich colors, versatile color combos for a variety of looks.  </li>
            <li>I like that there are three different options to suit whatever need you may have-whether it is work, a night out, or a special occasion</li>
            <li>so I just ordered a new one!</li>
            <li>It is great for everyday wear and can be used for a more dramatic look also.</li>
            <li>I actually like the way they blend more than my Urban Decay 3 pallet.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy it on amazon or online even, I purchased this at ulta for about the same price and totally fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I do wish it had come with an applicator/brush as older versions did.  </li>
            <li>makeuP. Colors are so vibrant and stay on all day.</li>
            <li>I have used just about every brand out there from drugstore to high end</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this palette if you are looking for something that will help you look pulled together without looking like you over</li>
            <li>that are high end.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li>These are high quality eye shadows.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>all day wear without a doubt and high quality shadows.</li>
            <li>Also, the instruction cards could be a little bit better.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a little more creamier consistency</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s so easy to mix and match the colors, as everything compliments each other.  </li>
            <li>I really like the first and second row of colors for every-day wear.  </li>
            <li>I use most of the Colors as everyday look all the time.</li>
            <li>Tucked into the packaging is a guide that easily details how to use the different colors to create different looks (&amp;#34;classic&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;day&amp;#34;...)</li>
            <li>: Go from left to right.</li>
            <li>Whenever I use this palette, I always get compliments - particularly with the first and second color sets.  </li>
            <li>I am personally not really a fan of matte eyeshadow at all, so the reason that i was so excited was that i saw 6 options that were not matte.</li>
            <li>I have also had this forever, and still do not need to purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li>I am having all kinds of people complimenting me on my new eye look.</li>
            <li>The first eyeshadow combo is a daily look that is subtle but enhances and brightens my eyes, just lovely!</li>
            <li>The Too Faced Natural Eye Palette is 9 colors divided into 3 looks - Daytime, Classic, and Fashion.</li>
            <li>The daytime look consists of matte colors which aren&#x27;t shimmery and look very natural.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using Too Faced Cosmetics Natural Eye Shadow Collection.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten so many complements on my makeup; I won&#x27;t use any other brand!!!</li>
            <li>, she was interested in the UD Naked Palette.  </li>
            <li>I also bought this at Sephora, this is second time I ordered it, my daughter took the first one</li>
            <li>-Last line of colors is pretty sparkly.  </li>
            <li>I have never spent this much money on eye shadow before.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had a Sephora gift card sitting in my purse waiting to be spent.</li>
            <li>Overall this is not a very natural palette, (definitely could&#x27;ve had a better name)</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented, generally.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of natural looking makeup, and this collection of shadows really does the trick.</li>
            <li>all honesty, as I do not have 20-year old skin anymore</li>
            <li>complete the look with Too</li>

            <li>an example of what you can do with Too faced natural eye palette.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to the Too Faced Natural shadow collection after viewing a YouTube video and just knew I had to have it.  </li>
            <li>If you like a natural look, I recommend this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pigmented, and I ended up buying the Naked palette too.</li>
            <li>Finally someone who really understands how you use eye shadow.  </li>
            <li>The last (bottom) seems to have a bit too much sparkle</li>

            <li>Here is my review for the Too Faced Natural Eye Palette.</li>
            <li>I hope you like my Too Faced Natural Eye Palette review.</li>
            <li>The colors are really pigmented and have lasting power.</li>
            <li>making the overall look very sparkly.</li>
            <li>GOOD!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin/eyes, and this product does NOT agitate or bother my face, skin, eyes, etc...</li>
            <li>I have had this product for over a year, I wear some of the colors nearly every day.</li>
            <li>So I was kind of worried after I ordered this that with it being eye shadow that it would show up all broken.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this palette because the photos showed it was the older natural eye palette which was the actual palette I wanted</li>
            <li>very pretty nueteral colors that you can dress up or down.</li>
            <li>, I have noticed that eye shadows often show wrinkles and can actually make me look older.  </li>
            <li>If you use Urban Decay&#x27;s \\&quot;Primer Potion\\&quot; before you apply, THIS product will stay on up to 3 days strait, even in HIGH humidity!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>You can add an extra little glamor by putting the sparkle of the light shadow on the cheek bones.</li>
            <li>You can be more dramatic or natural!  </li>
            <li>Mostly I&#x27;m just writing this to address a few things other reviewers said.</li>
            <li>The tool that comes with it is useful, I like the little brush that allows me to line my eyes</li>
            <li>Too Faced Shadow Brushes Essential 3 Piece Set) and sweep Nude Beach lightly across each lid to add brightness and a little sparkle to the final look.  </li>
            <li>Faced makeup in general</li>
            <li>and I barely made a dent in the palette, even after using it every day.</li>
            <li>It may seem like a lot of money to spend on a small eye shadow set, but it will last long and you will be pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re looking for a palette that&#x27;s got more natural colors that still give you a classy, expensive look definitely buy this palette!</li>
            <li>and I really think I might purchase other items from the company</li>
            <li>Plus a bunch of more dramatic ones.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for myself last year and did not open it until last week because I was waiting to get rid of all my old MAC eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>However, I still wore Push-Up (2nd row) and Honeypot (3rd row) every day, and I didn&#x27;t think it was overly dramatic, but more than the average person might like (VERY shimmery</li>
            <li>Case is metal and a little on the large size.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my new everyday staple collection for natural eyes.</li>
            <li>, the colors are a little more pink and have a lot less shimmer.</li>
            <li>I love this palette, my only complaint is that all these colors have shimmer, which is a little strange for a natural palette.</li>
            <li>I really love this product, my only complaint would be there is one eye shadow that is a little too glittery for my liking but</li>

            <li> I know they will love them.  </li>
            <li> The bottom two rows of eyeshadow are shimmer, and the top row (the \\&quot;daytime\\&quot; look) is all matte.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I love the shimmer as I feel it brightens my eye and makes me look more</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this palette.</li>
            <li> What I love more than anything the color you will use the most comes in the largest pan.  </li>

            <li> so I don&#x27;t use it often, but the middle is just perfect!  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to see that the box it comes in is slimmer, which makes it easier for me to pack in my makeup bag for trips.</li>
            <li> I really, really love these colors.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Too Faced cosmetics, Naked eye palette is the best palette you could ever have.</li>
            <li> I love them and don&#x27;t know how I managed before I got it...</li>
            <li> All of the colors are incredibly pigmented, and the shades are perfect for me since I only ever use neutral and natural colors.</li>
            <li> Will to buy more shadow colors.</li>
            <li> I  love this pallet.</li>
            <li> She likes it , so I love it.</li>
            <li> People are making very poor/low quality copies of what should be a great product.</li>
            <li> I love these colors and feel they work well on just about anyone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even better if you use it with their primer.</li>
            <li> but the top row is what I use more often in the daytime.</li>
            <li> Faced eye shadows and enjoyed them.  </li>
            <li> I love the cards detailing how to do the make up.  </li>
            <li> My favorite colors are Honey Pot and Cocoa Puff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This has been my stand by and favorite for years.</li>
            <li> We both love this palette.</li>
            <li> Love the color pallettes and the sturdy case.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> it goes on so nicely and feels so smooth.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy more from too faced because of its look and quality.</li>
            <li> We all love these products.  </li>
            <li> Love too faced</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase more Too</li>
            <li> My favorite is \\&quot;honey pot\\</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than purchasing from Ulta!!!!  </li>
            <li> The warm earthy tones are rich and compliment any eye color and outfit.</li>
            <li> Faced seems to be a great brand, and thus far I am pretty happy with everything I&#x27;ve gotten from them.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful, and I think its great for medium/dark skin tones but this set has a few drawbacks.    </li>
            <li> (well, in all fairness, my dog loved the first one when I was *</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> Beautiful natural shimmer</li>
            <li> I love that it is easy for travel.  </li>
            <li> I am glad to have bought this because it is so easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My love for VR in particular is just how SMOOTH it goes on and how great of a cappuccino color it is.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; set when I travel, and I don&#x27;t have to lug along my whole makeup box to look good.  </li>
            <li> this is a little compact that is perfect to put in your purse, the colors are great especially for someone older, not all that glitter stuff they sell these days, I am very happy with my choice...</li>
            <li> That being said, if you aren&#x27;t and you are looking for nice colors and willing to pay some more money for them, then i am sure these will work fine for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this pallette is awesome and I highly recommend it to anyone that likes sexy, natural eyes. :)</li>
            <li> However, it came early and in great condition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise they are very pigmented and gorgeous</li>
            <li> I received it as a gift, and I loved it so much</li>
            <li> Though these colors do go on easily and are quite complementary, i think that the shadow tones are not as pigmented as I wanted them to be.</li>
            <li> 3 Easy Steps.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t blend as easily as hers.</li>
            <li> They also apply easily.  </li>
            <li> All three of the sets of colors are easy to wear.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this pallet it has neutral colors perfect for an everyday wear but also shimmery colors for a night out.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow glides on so smoothe and easy and lasts all day (with my sahdow primer).</li>
            <li> but the second row is beautiful too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second favorite palette out of about 20 that I own!</li>
            <li> When I received the product in the mail, however, the tin case had dents, but the palette was fine.</li>
            <li> I think you have to know what works for your individual look, but I use a light hand with the darker colors and they wear just beautifully.  </li>
            <li> All the colors are beautifully pigmented - especially velvet revolver, and the top right chocolate shade.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when i first saw this palette of colored eyeshadow at sephora, and eager to add this collection of colors to my own makeup at home.</li>
            <li> These shadows are even more pretty in person!</li>
            <li> The DISCOUNTED PRICE + FREE SHIPPING + NO SALES TAX(state of TX)&#x3D; SAVED</li>
            <li> Great for a girl that&#x27;s just starting to use makeup.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow pallet cost $48.00 and came with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Since it is secure and doesn&#x27;t ruin your skin , it is for all ages.</li>
            <li> The brush that comes with it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I wanted just an every day kind of smokey eye pallet but much of this group is just too glittery for me.</li>
            <li> Such great neutrals and blend well with any color.</li>
            <li> Give a smooth look.</li>
            <li> The ones for after hours, I could not get to go on smooth even with a brush or with my finger tips..</li>
            <li> I absolutely cannot say enough about this product, I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> very satisfactory, person gifted liked it very much</li>
            <li> Also, all but the top row is very, very very sparkly.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, if you are as picky about eye shadows as i am, then i would suggest not wasting you time trying any of Too Faced eye shadows, because there are better shadows out there for a comparable price that have a higher pigmentation, and wear for longer.</li>
            <li> So I was excited to try this.  </li>
            <li> Worth every cent!</li>
            <li> The first 3-row of colors are perfect for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall though, this was a huge success to Too Faced</li>
            <li> Too faced natural eye is amazing.</li>
            <li> I saw the beautiful colors and the promise of the makeup lasting all day and it was for real.</li>
            <li> The colors are very complementary and the variations allow for light weekend beachy glow to smoky eyed evening vixen!  </li>
            <li> Was apprehensive to pay this much but so glad I did.</li>
            <li> For those fair, I would instead recommend Too Faced Naked Eye collection, they aren&#x27;t as brown.    </li>
            <li> Africa American and the neutral palette looked good on me also.</li>
            <li> Too faced cosmetics, Naked eye pallet is a good way  to spend your money.</li>
            <li> Bought as a present and my daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> My happiness was short lived however</li>
            <li> I think the third row is a bit sparkly for me and my age (and conservative workplace) but the shades are still gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Colors are true to what is shown.  </li>
            <li> and they quickly became a staple in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Came quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li> However that was quickly remedied by using Too Faced Shadow Insurance.  </li>
            <li> Luckily it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, its my favorite palette because the colors are really pretty, and it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected it to be, goes on great</li>
            <li> Btw, I would suggest using your own full sized brushes as the one that comes with the kit is only about 3 inches</li>
            <li> This is the palette that will make getting ready for work easy.  </li>
            <li> I really like this eyeshadow because it is easy to follow the eye cards that come with it</li>
            <li> The look cards that it comes with are very helpful and easy to follow.</li>
            <li> but if it isnt here i want my money back for sure! ..</li>
            <li> I love that you can create many looks from a single compact.  </li>
            <li> The colors are true, rich in pigments, and stay put for a whole day.  </li>
            <li> Great for day wear to nighttime and glamorous occasions when you want a little sparkle.</li>
            <li> These colors are great because not only can you get a natural look to go anywhere</li>
            <li> Its worth the money</li>
            <li> Love the natural eye colors.</li>
            <li> a Look (Day, Fun, Night)</li>
            <li> Love these earthy browns for a natural look.</li>
            <li> She is picky too as I suspect most young women are.  </li>
            <li> The cards with tutorials are also really fun.</li>
            <li> By far my favorites are the top row (matte shades)</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> I am an african american woman and the colors look good on me and even my hubby like them!</li>
            <li> I have had no trouble with creasing and they are super easy to blend.  </li>
            <li> The colors are so pretty with great little tutorial cards with diagram for how to looks.  </li>
            <li> You will never have to worry about not having the right color.  </li>
            <li> just right    </li>
            <li> The second combo is what I use the most often - it&#x27;s a classy look that has a more bronze, golden, but pinkish look to it</li>
            <li> The colors are all really pigmented and with Two Faced Shadow Insurance, the shadow stays gorgeous all day long!</li>
            <li> I was not wearing eye shadow much except for special occasions.  </li>
            <li> But in general I still gave this 4/5 stars because I really do love Too Faced products.</li>
            <li> I use these shadows everyday the top colors are perfect for day wear, you can go heavy on the liner if you want for night as well...</li>
            <li> I have to take a dark color and blend it with one of the lighter/sparkly colors to get a good shade for my skin</li>
            <li> The good news is that the most often used colors are large so for the price the set should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this kit, but if you like a REALLY natural eye, go easy.  </li>
            <li> The only problem i have is there is no eye brush with it., but overall great.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d heeded a previous reviewer when she warned fair skinned folks away.  </li>
            <li> Several of them are \\&quot;iced\\&quot; and I prefer more matte formulas.  </li>
            <li> The colors are actually quite potent.</li>
            <li> I wear the first 2 rows all the time, but for the most part the 3rd is untouched.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more color combinations.  </li>
            <li> I thought that this would be an ice alternative, smaller, more colors</li>
            <li> she&#x27;d be interested in, and a bit cheaper.  </li>
            <li> and I even used it for her wedding makeup yesterday (my sister got married).  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this for those who like one package with all the eye shadow/liner you need for many different occasions.</li>
            <li> I love too faced products, especially their shadow palettes.</li>
            <li> It seems like you don&#x27;t get much of each color but trust me these last and are well worth the money :)</li>
            <li> so you have to be aware of that.</li>
            <li> The first two lines of colors might be ok, especially the first set.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the colors are really pretty.</li>
            <li> Worth the price &amp; fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My favorite is the second line, as they go with just about anything.  </li>
            <li> i did end up purchasing the product from a local ulta and love it</li>
            <li> This is the first palette I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
            <li> but I think it can work pretty well with any warm-toned look.</li>
            <li> Being cheap in nature...i&#x27;m still surprised that i purchased this shadow.</li>
            <li> It is exactly how it was described and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so pretty</li>
            <li> It is an adorable kit especially for a present and the sender was very sweet because she left me a note and a mini eye liner &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I found that by following the instructions, my eyes really looked more defined and pretty.</li>
            <li> however, it&#x27;s not hard to get one or two good natural looks by mixing different colors, not just using them as the cards say.</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to palette for a few years--great colors and with the instructions, it&#x27;s really easy to do a nice, natural eye for day or night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to go from day to night with a few quick changes and it comes with instruction cards on how to apply, which makes it virtually mistake proof.</li>
            <li> and I still wore pretty much every color in the box.</li>
            <li> The Neutral Eye set is my go-to for pretty much any occasion.</li>
            <li> but the top row is more subtle.</li>
            <li> very smooth and \\&quot;a little\\&quot; goes a long way!!  </li>
            <li> These are nice colors, although I do wish there was less sparkle.  </li>
            <li> consistency.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a buy for anyone looking for a quick, streamlined natural look.</li>
            <li> Pretty natural colors with a bit of shimmer for fun.  </li>
            <li> And even \\&quot;how to\\&quot; cars to show you how to achieve a certain look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Large color use from eye lid to brow line&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> The colors in this set are very pretty and look natural.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and the color pigments are very vibrant, and will last all day.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows give a beautiful subtle natural eye look just as promised.  </li>
            <li> Its a very versatile and nice little palette.  </li>
            <li> This cute package has three different sets of eyeshadow combinations and comes with cute little instruction cards to explain how to apply them.</li>
            <li> It has a pearl finish, but nothing with actual sparkle, so it is great for everyday wear (literally.</li>
            <li> Great palette for everyday looks, it has three cards for three different looks</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s very shimmery</li>
            <li> IT REALLY SHOULD BE PURCHASED IN THE STORES</li>
            <li> This palette goes with much everything.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> You could go through a whole day without the colors fading, or having to redo them.</li>
            <li> I paid $28 for this, which I thought was reasonable.</li>
            <li> It had all the neutral colors I was looking for and was also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> the &#x27;how to&#x27; cards are very helpful for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t wear much make up.</li>
            <li> im real worried</li>
            <li> I really like color combinations in this eye shadow collection.  </li>
            <li> I expected more matte</li>
            <li> so I would really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Only I wished it came in smaller case , as nice as it was, but takes up alot of space.</li>
            <li> Too Faced also included three simple to follow instruction cards for a &#x27;range of soft and sexy looks&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of weird that this is suppose to be &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look yet most of the shades is glittery.</li>
            <li> I am going to buy the other Two Faced Eye Shadow Collections pallets with other beautiful colors in them.</li>
            <li> There is so many looks that can come right from this one little palette.</li>
            <li> The third one is very pretty and is a little more glamorous and I use it for special occasions.</li>
            <li> , my personal or signature look with this palette is silk teddy on the lids, a little honey pot in the inner corner Erotica in the crease and coco puff for the outer corner, love it!!!</li>
            <li> The top row is a bit too bland for me personally, but I do use the top dark color to put on top of my eyeliner sometimes to set it.</li>
            <li> other then that i love it</li>
            <li> is that it has a bit more fallout than other shadows I have</li>
            <li> I use it more often than other eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a few other reviews that say this set isn&#x27;t for the fair-skinned, but I am very fair skinned with dark hair, and I&#x27;ve never received more compliments than when I wear these colors.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting (especially when used with an eye primer), nicely pigmented, rich colors, versatile color combos for a variety of looks.  </li>
            <li> I like that there are three different options to suit whatever need you may have-whether it is work, a night out, or a special occasion</li>
            <li> so I just ordered a new one!</li>
            <li> It is great for everyday wear and can be used for a more dramatic look also.</li>
            <li> I actually like the way they blend more than my Urban Decay 3 pallet.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it on amazon or online even, I purchased this at ulta for about the same price and totally fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I do wish it had come with an applicator/brush as older versions did.  </li>
            <li> makeuP. Colors are so vibrant and stay on all day.</li>
            <li> I have used just about every brand out there from drugstore to high end</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this palette if you are looking for something that will help you look pulled together without looking like you over</li>
            <li> that are high end.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> These are high quality eye shadows.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> all day wear without a doubt and high quality shadows.</li>
            <li> Also, the instruction cards could be a little bit better.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a little more creamier consistency</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s so easy to mix and match the colors, as everything compliments each other.  </li>
            <li> I really like the first and second row of colors for every-day wear.  </li>
            <li> I use most of the Colors as everyday look all the time.</li>
            <li> Tucked into the packaging is a guide that easily details how to use the different colors to create different looks (&amp;#34;classic&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;day&amp;#34;...)</li>
            <li> : Go from left to right.</li>
            <li> Whenever I use this palette, I always get compliments - particularly with the first and second color sets.  </li>
            <li> I am personally not really a fan of matte eyeshadow at all, so the reason that i was so excited was that i saw 6 options that were not matte.</li>
            <li> I have also had this forever, and still do not need to purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li> I am having all kinds of people complimenting me on my new eye look.</li>
            <li> The first eyeshadow combo is a daily look that is subtle but enhances and brightens my eyes, just lovely!</li>
            <li> The Too Faced Natural Eye Palette is 9 colors divided into 3 looks - Daytime, Classic, and Fashion.</li>
            <li> The daytime look consists of matte colors which aren&#x27;t shimmery and look very natural.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using Too Faced Cosmetics Natural Eye Shadow Collection.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten so many complements on my makeup; I won&#x27;t use any other brand!!!</li>
            <li> , she was interested in the UD Naked Palette.  </li>
            <li> I also bought this at Sephora, this is second time I ordered it, my daughter took the first one</li>
            <li> -Last line of colors is pretty sparkly.  </li>
            <li> I have never spent this much money on eye shadow before.</li>
            <li> Luckily I had a Sephora gift card sitting in my purse waiting to be spent.</li>
            <li> Overall this is not a very natural palette, (definitely could&#x27;ve had a better name)</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented, generally.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of natural looking makeup, and this collection of shadows really does the trick.</li>
            <li> all honesty, as I do not have 20-year old skin anymore</li>

            <li> an example of what you can do with Too faced natural eye palette.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to the Too Faced Natural shadow collection after viewing a YouTube video and just knew I had to have it.  </li>
            <li> If you like a natural look, I recommend this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pigmented, and I ended up buying the Naked palette too.</li>
            <li> Finally someone who really understands how you use eye shadow.  </li>
            <li> The last (bottom) seems to have a bit too much sparkle</li>
            <li> (I wear contacts), but overall, I really like the formulations and the textures and</li>
            <li> Here is my review for the Too Faced Natural Eye Palette.</li>
            <li> I hope you like my Too Faced Natural Eye Palette review.</li>
            <li> The colors are really pigmented and have lasting power.</li>
            <li> making the overall look very sparkly.</li>
            <li> GOOD!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin/eyes, and this product does NOT agitate or bother my face, skin, eyes, etc...</li>
            <li> I have had this product for over a year, I wear some of the colors nearly every day.</li>
            <li> So I was kind of worried after I ordered this that with it being eye shadow that it would show up all broken.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this palette because the photos showed it was the older natural eye palette which was the actual palette I wanted</li>
            <li> very pretty nueteral colors that you can dress up or down.</li>
            <li> , I have noticed that eye shadows often show wrinkles and can actually make me look older.  </li>
            <li> If you use Urban Decay&#x27;s \\&quot;Primer Potion\\&quot; before you apply, THIS product will stay on up to 3 days strait, even in HIGH humidity!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> You can add an extra little glamor by putting the sparkle of the light shadow on the cheek bones.</li>
            <li> You can be more dramatic or natural!  </li>
            <li> Mostly I&#x27;m just writing this to address a few things other reviewers said.</li>
            <li> The tool that comes with it is useful, I like the little brush that allows me to line my eyes</li>
            <li> Too Faced Shadow Brushes Essential 3 Piece Set) and sweep Nude Beach lightly across each lid to add brightness and a little sparkle to the final look.  </li>
            <li> Faced makeup in general</li>
            <li> and I barely made a dent in the palette, even after using it every day.</li>
            <li> It may seem like a lot of money to spend on a small eye shadow set, but it will last long and you will be pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for a palette that&#x27;s got more natural colors that still give you a classy, expensive look definitely buy this palette!</li>
            <li> and I really think I might purchase other items from the company</li>
            <li> Plus a bunch of more dramatic ones.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for myself last year and did not open it until last week because I was waiting to get rid of all my old MAC eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> However, I still wore Push-Up (2nd row) and Honeypot (3rd row) every day, and I didn&#x27;t think it was overly dramatic, but more than the average person might like (VERY shimmery</li>
            <li> Case is metal and a little on the large size.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my new everyday staple collection for natural eyes.</li>
            <li> , the colors are a little more pink and have a lot less shimmer.</li>
            <li> I love this palette, my only complaint is that all these colors have shimmer, which is a little strange for a natural palette.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, my only complaint would be there is one eye shadow that is a little too glittery for my liking but</li>
            <li> Although small, this palette really has a lot of pigment for its size.  </li>
            <li> however I ordered it becuase my roommate has had the same one for a long while</li>
            <li> Second, its lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> It is long lasting.  </li>
            <li> This pallette also came with a little sample of their eye shadow primer which was also really nice, but sadly ran out in just a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just so natural looking yet brightens and enhances your eyes, it&#x27;s subtle makeup that looks classy and expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has decent pigmentation &amp; my only complaint</li>
            <li> -The makeup brush that comes with the set is cheap and useless.  </li>
            <li> They also did not stay on my eyes as long as i would have hoped.</li>
            <li> The title says &amp;#34;natural eyes pallete&amp;#34; but the picture shows colors from the &amp;#34;natural matte palette&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m curious about which product it actually is.</li>
            <li> Later on I have found myself mixing and  matching colors with other brands to make them stay put longer, and look brighter.</li>
            <li> Like what the other reviewers mentioned, the last row does have a lot of sparkle in it.</li>
            <li> I buy other eye shadows and use them for awhile, but I either come back to this one or use some of the colors with my newer palettes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t  dry out your eyes, or crease your eyes.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed the natural colors for the base of the eye.  </li>
            <li> but so far she has only had it a few days and is using it everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m interested in buying this, but I am a bit confused.</li>
            <li> I use it every single day!</li>
            <li> Now I wear it everyday and get compliments almost daily.  </li>
            <li> U HAVE TO BE CAREFUL</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d recommend leaving them partially out for easier access.</li>
            <li> but I nix colors around and change up looks to create different everyday looks</li>
            <li> A little went a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going</li>
            <li> Definately plan on purchasing other pallettes of this brand.</li>
            <li> Fallout can occur if you don&#x27;t tap your brush before applying, but other than that no issues.</li>
            <li> DUE</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase for a Too Faced product and unfortunately I won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I like it and am wanting to try other colors.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected it to be!</li>
            <li> This pallete is slightly deceiving, I thought the shadows were going to be slightly bigger and was hoping a little less chalky!</li>
            <li> The classic look has a base that is shimmery and the colors are slightly darker so the look is more dramatic.</li>
            <li> I think the colors would be too dark, too bronze, and come off too brassy/gold.  </li>
            <li> I have an olive complexion and the dark ones are extremely dark, even for me.</li>
            <li> I have been searching forever for a natural eyeshadow that doesn&#x27;t make you look tired and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> However, I wish the base would have more coverage so it doesn&#x27;t take so long to put it on (me being lazy).  </li>
            <li> then hers slightly</li>
            <li> There is also a brush for application hidden in a drawer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a year and a half</li>
            <li> A little flashier than expiated (lots of glitter)</li>
            <li> - I might be a little off on the name of the looks</li>
            <li> I was not let down by it!</li>
            <li> how-to look cards are hard to get out of the box, I leave mine partially out to make it easier.  </li>
            <li> It is way too glittery and heavy.  </li>
            <li> It is not for everyday use or people.  </li>
            <li> and I still use this palette nearly everyday</li>
            <li> I think I use it just about everyday mixing and matching with my UD book of shadows IIV.</li>
            <li> and my sister has green.</li>
            <li> The cost is a bit expensive, they should offer coupons or discounts for frequent buyers.  </li>
            <li> Be very careful, this item I purchased was a total fake.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m VERY pale, and my friend is WAY dark, but it&#x27;s ALL</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey but it lasts about 9 months with excessive use (3 - 4 times per week).    </li>
            <li> Lasted all day with very little wear.  </li>
            <li> I wear it all the time as an everyday look!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday!</li>
            <li> I literally use this collection everyday!</li>
            <li> &amp; i usually meet the mailman at my door when he comes.</li>
            <li> I am usually a drug store makeup buyer.</li>
            <li> Its color is subtle, and an everyday look.</li>
            <li> The brush the kit comes with is not very good, but the packaging of it, the shadows and the instruction cards is convenient.</li>
            <li> For one, I&#x27;m VERY pale</li>
            <li> The darker colors you will want to slowly build up because they are very heavy.</li>
            <li> No more searching for all the colors needed, because they are all in one!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll like it, but if you want something subtle you might not like it.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to any age looking for subtle colors.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this and have gone through two palettes already</li>
            <li> I personally like the balance between the shimmery and base tone colors.</li>
            <li> The shadows are pigmented and last all day (I use Mac&#x27;s neutral eye paint as a base) without any creasing or fading.</li>
            <li> Aside from these small disappointing factors it does the job.</li>
            <li> I would have ordered that one off the website &amp; not make things worse there was a imprint of a finger in one of the eyeshadows!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong , Its a must have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> , ill give it a week</li>
            <li> The cards can be slightly difficult to remove from the packaging</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t like shimmer, you might be disappointed with this.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet with any Too Faced purchase.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I received my order from amazon.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great pallette of eye shadow colors !!! I would recommend this product to everyone. Only I wished it came in smaller case , as nice as it was, but takes up alot of space. Definately plan on purchasing other pallettes of this brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed with this product, I bought it for a present and I liked for me so I just ordered a new one!</li>
            <li> Very  nice pallet, beautiful colors. A little flashier than expiated (lots of glitter) but the top row is more subtle. Very good quality, I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this shadow collection!  It&#x27;s buildable and stays put.  The colors are very complementary and the variations allow for light weekend beachy glow to smoky eyed evening vixen!  I like that Too Faced also included three simple to follow instruction cards for a &#x27;range of soft and sexy looks&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all honesty, as I do not have 20-year old skin anymore, I have noticed that eye shadows often show wrinkles and can actually make me look older.  Especially those that are matte.  What I love about Too Faced makeup, especially this collection, is that the shadows seem to &#x27;float&#x27; on the lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finish my look, I take my Too Faced &#x27;teddy bear&#x27; hair shadow brush (see Too Faced Shadow Brushes Essential 3 Piece Set) and sweep Nude Beach lightly across each lid to add brightness and a little sparkle to the final look.  I find that Nude Beach, Push-Up and Honey Pot (because they&#x27;re silky) are all great for adding the finishing touch and setting the look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a bronzy and golden palette for the eye which includes three excellent darker pigments for a smokey eye (Sexspresso, Erotica and Cocoa Puff) - you will love this collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I complete the look with Too Faced La Creme Naked Dolly moisturizing lipstick (brush Nude Beach over the lip for some kissable sparkle) and Too Faced Milk Chocolate Soleil Light/Medium Matte Bronzer on the face, neck and d&amp;eacute;colletage.</li>
            <li> Delivery was a day or two before the estimated time of arrival, which is always great to have as a customer.  The product is top quality and the colors are magnificent and I use this every day.</li>
            <li> I do not like this eye shadow at all.  It is way too glittery and heavy.  It is not for everyday use or people.  Natural...I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, my only complaint would be there is one eye shadow that is a little too glittery for my liking but other then that i love it and i bought two. Yes i know what a greedy hog but it is really great.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2WLNWJZNOBQGT]]Just an example of what you can do with Too faced natural eye palette.</li>
            <li> These colors are great because not only can you get a natural look to go anywhere but there&#x27;s also colors to put on if you want to be more flashy when going out to a party/club. Plus the colors blend great and it is Not chalky. It is an adorable kit especially for a present and the sender was very sweet because she left me a note and a mini eye liner &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Loveeeee loveeee loveeee this palette Everytime I Put it on I get so many compliments  I wear it all the time as an everyday look!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to the Too Faced Natural shadow collection after viewing a YouTube video and just knew I had to have it.  Luckily I had a Sephora gift card sitting in my purse waiting to be spent. I had to view the colors up close and in person before making the purchase. The colors are beautiful...colors for both daytime and nighttime looks. And even \\&quot;how to\\&quot; cars to show you how to achieve a certain look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new everyday staple collection for natural eyes. I am an african american woman and the colors look good on me and even my hubby like them!</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow is beautiful and easy to use with instructional cards.  You can be more dramatic or natural!  I&#x27;ve  been complimented on all the colors.</li>
            <li> These are nice colors, although I do wish there was less sparkle.  Several of them are \\&quot;iced\\&quot; and I prefer more matte formulas.  The tool that comes with it is useful, I like the little brush that allows me to line my eyes w/ the darker colors.  I would recommend this kit, but if you like a REALLY natural eye, go easy.  The colors are actually quite potent.</li>
            <li> Long lasting (especially when used with an eye primer), nicely pigmented, rich colors, versatile color combos for a variety of looks.  One of my favorite eye shadow pallets I own!</li>
            <li> I really like the first and second row of colors for every-day wear.  The third is obviously for night-life, but even then it just seems way too glittery.  I wear the first 2 rows all the time, but for the most part the 3rd is untouched.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday! Its easy to put on, perfect for that natural beauty look, stays on all day! I have never found eyeshadow that is as true to the colors as this or that looks this good. I love too faced! Its worth the money</li>
            <li> Love the natural eye colors. The only problem i have is there is no eye brush with it., but overall great.</li>
            <li> I want to say that I absolutely love these colors!! No more searching for all the colors needed, because they are all in one! They go on very nice and stay on. Definitely sold on this product! It is a must have now for me:)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eyeshadow!!  The neutral colors have \\&quot;depth\\&quot; and do not look washed out. I am most impressed with the application of the product.  It goes on very smooth and \\&quot;a little\\&quot; goes a long way!!  My eye makeup lasted all day and did not need to be refreshed.  I will definitely be buying more color combinations.  The price was great too!!!  This vendor discounted the price and included free shipping!!  The DISCOUNTED PRICE + FREE SHIPPING + NO SALES TAX(state of TX)&#x3D; SAVED A LOT OF MONEY PURCHASING THRU AMAZON!!!  Much cheaper than purchasing from Ulta!!!!  UPDATE 1/18/2012:  I have been using this eyeshadow exclusively since I purchased it in November 2011.  I have gotten so many complements on my makeup; I won&#x27;t use any other brand!!!</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed with this purchase. Item was used and there were finger prints in the makeup! Went to ulta and bought and the product itself is amazing!!!  Just don&#x27;t buy online.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother.  I knew she&#x27;d like it, she was interested in the UD Naked Palette.  I thought that this would be an ice alternative, smaller, more colors she&#x27;d be interested in, and a bit cheaper.  She loves it!  I will probably experiemnt with it as well soon but so far she has only had it a few days and is using it everyday and I even used it for her wedding makeup yesterday (my sister got married).  Its a very versatile and nice little palette.  Definitely would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when i first saw this palette of colored eyeshadow at sephora, and eager to add this collection of colors to my own makeup at home. I am personally not really a fan of matte eyeshadow at all, so the reason that i was so excited was that i saw 6 options that were not matte. Though these colors do go on easily and are quite complementary, i think that the shadow tones are not as pigmented as I wanted them to be. They also did not stay on my eyes as long as i would have hoped. I even used an eye shadow primer I bought at sephora before I applied them. Later on I have found myself mixing and  matching colors with other brands to make them stay put longer, and look brighter. Bottom line, if you are as picky about eye shadows as i am, then i would suggest not wasting you time trying any of Too Faced eye shadows, because there are better shadows out there for a comparable price that have a higher pigmentation, and wear for longer. That being said, if you aren&#x27;t and you are looking for nice colors and willing to pay some more money for them, then i am sure these will work fine for you.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for myself last year and did not open it until last week because I was waiting to get rid of all my old MAC eyeshadows. I have always been a fan of MAC cosmetics but was looking for a kit that offered neutral/natural colors. This kits is fabulous! 3 Easy Steps. Btw, I would suggest using your own full sized brushes as the one that comes with the kit is only about 3 inches long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pick a Look (Day, Fun, Night) - I might be a little off on the name of the looks but there&#x27;s 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: Go from left to right. Large color use from eye lid to brow line&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: Middle color on lid&lt;br /&gt;Step 3: Last color in the crease (I use an angle brush for this step)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viola! That&#x27;s it. I get compliments on my eyes everytime I use this kit.</li>
            <li> I was not wearing eye shadow much except for special occasions.  Now I wear it everyday and get compliments almost daily.  I love the instructions, very easy to follow.  I would recommend this for those who like one package with all the eye shadow/liner you need for many different occasions.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eye shadow! It is great for everyday wear and can be used for a more dramatic look also. Fallout can occur if you don&#x27;t tap your brush before applying, but other than that no issues.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d heeded a previous reviewer when she warned fair skinned folks away.  Also, all but the top row is very, very very sparkly.</li>
            <li> I like this product however I ordered it becuase my roommate has had the same one for a long while, I used it, loved it, and decided to buy it. This product colors are different then hers slightly, the colors are a little more pink and have a lot less shimmer. Aside from these small disappointing factors it does the job. It also doesn&#x27;t blend as easily as hers. I would recommend going to their homepage to ensure you get the quality you are playing for. Don&#x27;t skimpy on the $4 difference because it makes a world of difference.</li>
            <li> I started using Too Faced products a couple years back, and they quickly became a staple in my makeup bag. I have their face primer, mascara, eye primer, multiple eye shadow collections, lip plumping gloss and bronzer. One of my favorite eye shadow collections is the Natual Eye. I am a big fan of natural looking makeup, and this collection of shadows really does the trick. There are three instructional cards that come with it as well, and the tips for achieving the look you want are great to have. My favorite mixture is Silk Teddy all over my eyelids, Pushup on the crease, and Honeypot towards the end of my lids. When I got out, I like to sweep Nude Beach over the eyelids as well for the extra sparkle, and often use Sexpresso as a liner. If you like a natural look, I recommend this. I think my next collection will be the Naked Eye or the Matte Eye collection.</li>
            <li> bought for my daughters for gifts and the colors are beautiful. I know they will love them.  The colors are so pretty with great little tutorial cards with diagram for how to looks.  There is also a brush for application hidden in a drawer.  Can&#x27;t wait for them to open.</li>
            <li> Although small, this palette really has a lot of pigment for its size.  The colors are beautiful and perfect for daytime or nighttime wear.  The palette comes with three different looks - each row is a different set meant to go together.  The box also comes with three cards detailing the three looks and how to apply it to your eye.  However, it&#x27;s so easy to mix and match the colors, as everything compliments each other.  The bottom two rows of eyeshadow are shimmer, and the top row (the \\&quot;daytime\\&quot; look) is all matte.  So if you don&#x27;t like shimmer, you might be disappointed with this.  However, it&#x27;s not glittery, just shimmery.  Personally, I love the shimmer as I feel it brightens my eye and makes me look more awake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product until I tested it at Sephora, but now I can&#x27;t wait to wake up tomorrow and put this on!</li>
            <li> I love too faced products, especially their shadow palettes. I have used just about every brand out there from drugstore to high end and I think this is by far the best. These colors are so beautiful and can be worn at any time of the day or for any occasion. It goes on smooth and the color pigments are very vibrant, and will last all day. It seems like you don&#x27;t get much of each color but trust me these last and are well worth the money :)</li>
            <li> this has been a wonderful collection!  I love that it is easy for travel.  The colors are perfect and the cards help make it easy to put on.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this palette. It&#x27;s very pigmented, and I ended up buying the Naked palette too. Mostly I&#x27;m just writing this to address a few things other reviewers said. For one, I&#x27;m VERY pale and I still wore pretty much every color in the box. Yes, it&#x27;s very shimmery so you have to be aware of that. However, I still wore Push-Up (2nd row) and Honeypot (3rd row) every day, and I didn&#x27;t think it was overly dramatic, but more than the average person might like (VERY shimmery, I used a matte crease color to balance it out a bit). Overall this is not a very natural palette, (definitely could&#x27;ve had a better name) however, it&#x27;s not hard to get one or two good natural looks by mixing different colors, not just using them as the cards say. Plus a bunch of more dramatic ones.</li>
            <li> Love these earthy browns for a natural look. It&#x27;s my second favorite palette out of about 20 that I own! You can create many great looks and if you aren&#x27;t an eyeshadow pro, the three cards give you guidance to make your eyeshadow look flawless! I use a eyeshadow primer, I believe urban decay in the purple tube, under these and it literally stays on ALL DAY!</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS TOO FACED EYESHADOW KIT FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS WHEN SHE OPENED THE GIFT AT CHRISTMAS ALOT OF THE THE BLUSHES WERE BROKE OPEN !! PROBABLY FROM SHIPPING AND HANDLEING BUT MY  DAUGHTER KEPT THE KIT ANYWAY!! BECAUSE THE COLORS WERE BEAUTIFUL . U HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ORDERING TOO FACED ON LINE!! IT REALLY SHOULD BE PURCHASED IN THE STORES DUE TO THE PIGMENT IN THE EYESHADOWS!! NICE KIT!! KC</li>
            <li> Was apprehensive to pay this much but so glad I did. Makes my eyes pop and makes them stand out.</li>
            <li> The colors in this set are very pretty and look natural.  They also apply easily.  The problems I have are with fallout.  By the middle of the day, I have eyeshadow on my face and I find myself now substituting some of my similar MAC colors for the colors in this kit.  Also, the instruction cards could be a little bit better.  It was easier for me to go to youtube and see how to apply the shadows.  The brush the kit comes with is not very good, but the packaging of it, the shadows and the instruction cards is convenient.</li>
            <li> Looking for something that is great to wear to work?  This is the palette that will make getting ready for work easy.  All three of the sets of colors are easy to wear.  These glide on, and blend together effortlessly.  You will never have to worry about not having the right color.  This palette goes with much everything.  What I love more than anything the color you will use the most comes in the largest pan.  Finally someone who really understands how you use eye shadow.  I highly recommend this palette if you are looking for something that will help you look pulled together without looking like you over did your make up for the office.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I received my order from amazon.  The picture showed it having a pullout drawer with applicator and mine was just in a mini box.  All the pictures I had viewed showed it including a 2 sided applicator and even stated so. This was my first purchase for a Too Faced product and unfortunately I won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Bought this palette for a great price!! My niece will love this set of neutral eye shadows. Great for a girl that&#x27;s just starting to use makeup. Thanks for the excellent service and product.</li>
            <li> I love this palette, my only complaint is that all these colors have shimmer, which is a little strange for a natural palette. Otherwise they are very pigmented and gorgeous</li>
            <li> I love this palette &amp; use it weekly! It has decent pigmentation &amp; my only complaint is that it has a bit more fallout than other shadows I have that are high end. Still, it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love it! I also bought this at Sephora, this is second time I ordered it, my daughter took the first one and I just had to have another!!! LOVE IT, a must have.</li>
            <li> I personally love this palette for a bronzed eye look.  I love Too Faced makeup in general, the products are quality and no one markets makeup quite like Too-Faced!  The packaging of this set is adorable.  The colors are beautiful, and I think its great for medium/dark skin tones but this set has a few drawbacks.    -If you are very fair I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this set.  I think the colors would be too dark, too bronze, and come off too brassy/gold.  The first two lines of colors might be ok, especially the first set.  But the last line of colors I doubt you could wear.  For those fair, I would instead recommend Too Faced Naked Eye collection, they aren&#x27;t as brown.    -Last line of colors is pretty sparkly.  If you are like me and like sparkle you&#x27;ll like it, but if you want something subtle you might not like it.  -The how-to look cards are hard to get out of the box, I leave mine partially out to make it easier.  -The makeup brush that comes with the set is cheap and useless.  You&#x27;ll need a proper crease brush and a smudge brush to get the look just right    But in general I still gave this 4/5 stars because I really do love Too Faced products.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, beautiful neutral colors. Great pigmentation you pull off so many looks with this. I was impressed how fast I receive this product way before the estimated date. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Whenever I use this palette, I always get compliments - particularly with the first and second color sets.  The last (bottom) seems to have a bit too much sparkle so I don&#x27;t use it often, but the middle is just perfect!  I am addicted to this and have gone through two palettes already (well, in all fairness, my dog loved the first one when I was *almost* finished with it).    It is a little pricey but it lasts about 9 months with excessive use (3 - 4 times per week).    My favorite palette without a doubt!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this eye shadow for about 5 years and I love it.  I&#x27;m glad to see that the box it comes in is slimmer, which makes it easier for me to pack in my makeup bag for trips.</li>
            <li> I really, really love these colors. The top row is a bit too bland for me personally, but I do use the top dark color to put on top of my eyeliner sometimes to set it. Silk teddy is the best color in the pallet. It has a pearl finish, but nothing with actual sparkle, so it is great for everyday wear (literally. I wear this shadow almost every day and have done so for about 2 years). :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this makeup palette!  The colors are beautiful and long-lasting.  I have had no trouble with creasing and they are super easy to blend.  I love the tutorial cards included with the kit because it shows you how to effectively use the color combinations.  The eyeshadows give a beautiful subtle natural eye look just as promised.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to palette for a few years--great colors and with the instructions, it&#x27;s really easy to do a nice, natural eye for day or night. The bottom line is a bit too glittery for my eyes (I wear contacts), but overall, I really like the formulations and the textures and consistency.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a buy for anyone looking for a quick, streamlined natural look.</li>
            <li> this is a little compact that is perfect to put in your purse, the colors are great especially for someone older, not all that glitter stuff they sell these days, I am very happy with my choice...</li>
            <li> I liked it. I was expecting a little more creamier consistency but it&#x27;s pretty good. I&lt;br /&gt;m Africa American and the neutral palette looked good on me also.</li>
            <li> Too Faced cosmetics, Naked eye palette is the best palette you could ever have. I got this product in the beginning of the school year. To this day I still use it. The eyeshadow pallet cost $48.00 and came with free shipping. I got this product  from amazon. To be honest, its my favorite palette because the colors are really pretty, and it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the colors are really pretty. Also, the colors are not too shimmery or bright. Its color is subtle, and an everyday look. I can wear it with anything, any event or any where. For example, you can customize your look by mixing the shades for  school , work, or a night out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Second, its lasts for a long time. You could go through a whole day without the colors fading, or having to redo them. Since it is secure and doesn&#x27;t ruin your skin , it is for all ages. It doesn&#x27;t  dry out your eyes, or crease your eyes. The brush that comes with it is fantastic. You can make a perfect eyeliner shape easily.&lt;br /&gt;  Too faced cosmetics, Naked eye pallet is a good way  to spend your money. The colors are neutral. Also, you can wear them with anything. I would recommend it to any age looking for subtle colors. I rate it 4 out of five.</li>
            <li> These shades go on beautifully! I don&#x27;t have any problem with them caking in summer if I wear a primer. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 16 year daughter and she loved it. Now I regret not buying one for me !!!!!! Ladies , give it a try !!!!</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this after reading great reviews. Inside are nine eye shadows that compliment one another. Tucked into the packaging is a guide that easily details how to use the different colors to create different looks (&amp;#34;classic&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;day&amp;#34;...) I found that by following the instructions, my eyes really looked more defined and pretty. This is now all I use for eyeshadow. I am thrilled with it. Great compact packaging is perfect for travel, too!</li>
            <li> Wonderful colors.  Came quickly in the mail. Thank you.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! GORGEOUS COLORS 😍. Worth the price &amp; fast shipping.</li>
            <li> These colors are just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; to me. I have an olive complexion and the dark ones are extremely dark, even for me. I have to take a dark color and blend it with one of the lighter/sparkly colors to get a good shade for my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And FYI- I paid $28 for this, which I thought was reasonable. Today I see sellers trying to get $50 for it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this palette because the photos showed it was the older natural eye palette which was the actual palette I wanted but they send you the newer version if I wanted it that one I would have ordered that one off the website &amp; not make things worse there was a imprint of a finger in one of the eyeshadows! Update your photos!</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time.  I have also had this forever, and still do not need to purchase a new one.  Great for day wear to nighttime and glamorous occasions when you want a little sparkle.</li>
            <li> I love this eye shadow palette! It had all the neutral colors I was looking for and was also reasonably priced. I use it every single day!</li>
            <li> I love that you can create many looks from a single compact.  If there is any drawback, it would be the size of the compact which is not portable.  The good news is that the most often used colors are large so for the price the set should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Too Faced Eye Shadow collection is wonderful.  The warm earthy tones are rich and compliment any eye color and outfit. You can add an extra little glamor by putting the sparkle of the light shadow on the cheek bones. The packaging is superior, well made to protect the product.</li>
            <li> It needs an applicator</li>
            <li> Bought as a present and my daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> I wanted just an every day kind of smokey eye pallet but much of this group is just too glittery for me.</li>
            <li> I literally use this collection everyday! I love them and don&#x27;t know how I managed before I got it... Such great neutrals and blend well with any color.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing eyeshadow palette! All of the colors are incredibly pigmented, and the shades are perfect for me since I only ever use neutral and natural colors. When I received the product in the mail, however, the tin case had dents, but the palette was fine. Overall I was/am very happy with this purchase, and especially happy that the price on Amazon was so much lower than the price listed online and in-store Sephora.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors. Give a smooth look. Will to buy more shadow colors. I use most of the Colors as everyday look all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just starting to dabble on eye make-up and I bought this kit because it seems to be the \\&quot;safest\\&quot; bet since it comes with instructions.  I am glad to have bought this because it is so easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have morena skin and all the colors featured in this kit works perfectly with my skin tone.  The first 3-row of colors are perfect for everyday use.  Like what the other reviewers mentioned, the last row does have a lot of sparkle in it.</li>
            <li> Great colors that stay on all day.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  I will never go back to pharmacy makeup again!</li>
            <li> I  love this pallet. The colors go on beautifully and they have a high pigment. I actually like the way they blend more than my Urban Decay 3 pallet. I will definitely purchase again. I haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet with any Too Faced purchase. You can&#x27;t go wrong , Its a must have.</li>
            <li> She asked for it by name.  She swears by the maker and says she trust their products with her face.  She is picky too as I suspect most young women are.  She likes it , so I love it.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo370E73AS19TCT]]Hi guys. Here is my review for the Too Faced Natural Eye Palette. It&#x27;s an excellent product and also very affordable if you buy it from Amazon. I hope you like my Too Faced Natural Eye Palette review.</li>
            <li> Be very careful, this item I purchased was a total fake. People are making very poor/low quality copies of what should be a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a few other reviews that say this set isn&#x27;t for the fair-skinned, but I am very fair skinned with dark hair, and I&#x27;ve never received more compliments than when I wear these colors.  I think you have to know what works for your individual look, but I use a light hand with the darker colors and they wear just beautifully.  My favorite is the second line, as they go with just about anything.  This is my favorite \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; set when I travel, and I don&#x27;t have to lug along my whole makeup box to look good.  The colors are true, rich in pigments, and stay put for a whole day.  I love these colors and feel they work well on just about anyone.  I&#x27;m a huge Too Faced fan!</li>
            <li> These provide longlasting color that goes on very smooth. It&#x27;s even better if you use it with their primer. The color combinations are beautiful and so perfect together. I don&#x27;t wear makeup often but the top row is what I use more often in the daytime. I purchased this at sephora for about $36.</li>
            <li> This is gorgeous! The colors are so nice and go on so well! The darker colors you will want to slowly build up because they are very heavy. Very beautiful and receive a lot of compliments!</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a bit the colours are absolutely beautiful. Best pallette I&#x27;ve ever used, the colours complements nd blend so well together and create. Beautiful natural shimmer</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter and she loves it. I have tried it and it is a great product. Stays all day and doesn&#x27;t crease.</li>
            <li> great product and price, however i never received the product, but amazon refunded me my money... i did end up purchasing the product from a local ulta and love it</li>
            <li> I have bought singular Too Faced eye shadows and enjoyed them.  So I was excited to try this.  I was not let down by it! I love the cards detailing how to do the make up.  My favorite colors are Honey Pot and Cocoa Puff.  I&#x27;ve tried the different cards with different colors and I am thankful for the help!  I am all about shimmer and glitter, but I was disapointed to learn that Nude Beach shed a lot!  My husband wouldn&#x27;t touch  me because of it.  However that was quickly remedied by using Too Faced Shadow Insurance.  My happiness was short lived however, my cat knocked the palette to the floor and Nude Beach shattered everywhere.  A visit to the store revealed this happened tothe display model as well, so beware, Nude Beach may not travel well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, this was a huge success to Too Faced and I still use this palette nearly everyday, it is great for work!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this pallet it has neutral colors perfect for an everyday wear but also shimmery colors for a night out. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeshadow because it is easy to follow the eye cards that come with it and  yet mix and match the colors. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> it&#x60;s exactly like the picture, and the colors are awesome, it stays all day and never slide, and the instructions are great, i can makeup easy</li>
            <li> I found I really only use 3 of these colors.. The ones for after hours, I could not get to go on smooth even with a brush or with my finger tips.. Globbed together where I started on my eye lids.. I&#x27;m not impressed. I will stay with my Bobbi Brown shadows, they are great and glid on smooth.</li>
            <li> These shadows are even more pretty in person! The colors are all really pigmented and with Two Faced Shadow Insurance, the shadow stays gorgeous all day long! I&#x27;m  in love!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this pallette! I didn&#x27;t buy it on amazon or online even, I purchased this at ulta for about the same price and totally fell in love with it. very pretty nueteral colors that you can dress up or down. I think I use it just about everyday mixing and matching with my UD book of shadows IIV. The look cards that it comes with are very helpful and easy to follow. This pallette also came with a little sample of their eye shadow primer which was also really nice, but sadly ran out in just a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this pallette is awesome and I highly recommend it to anyone that likes sexy, natural eyes. :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely cannot say enough about this product, I love it!!!! In fact it&#x27;s so awesome, I purchased another set for my Mom. It comes with pictures that instruct you how to apply it. Just perfect, a must have!</li>
            <li> This cute package has three different sets of eyeshadow combinations and comes with cute little instruction cards to explain how to apply them. The first eyeshadow combo is a daily look that is subtle but enhances and brightens my eyes, just lovely! The second combo is what I use the most often - it&#x27;s a classy look that has a more bronze, golden, but pinkish look to it and it looks so nice that I end up using that one the most. The third one is very pretty and is a little more glamorous and I use it for special occasions. I have lots of eyeshadow palettes but this is the one that I keep bringing out every day! It&#x27;s just so natural looking yet brightens and enhances your eyes, it&#x27;s subtle makeup that looks classy and expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking for a palette that&#x27;s got more natural colors that still give you a classy, expensive look definitely buy this palette! I got it three months ago and I barely made a dent in the palette, even after using it every day. A little went a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to buy this again and again, hopefully they don&#x27;t discontinue it, because this is going to be a staple for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> This has been my stand by and favorite for years. I buy other eye shadows and use them for awhile, but I either come back to this one or use some of the colors with my newer palettes. I have purchased this one twice. The colors are really pigmented and have lasting power. It is also a palette that anyone with any eye color or complexion can wear. I have brown/hazel eyes and my sister has green. We both love this palette. The cards with tutorials are also really fun. It is a fool proof collection. I highly recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> Love the color pallettes and the sturdy case.  I do wish it had come with an applicator/brush as older versions did.  These are high quality eye shadows.</li>
            <li> This is the first palette I&#x27;ve ever bought and I love it. By far my favorites are the top row (matte shades) but the second row is beautiful too. I think the third row is a bit sparkly for me and my age (and conservative workplace) but the shades are still gorgeous. All the colors are beautifully pigmented - especially velvet revolver, and the top right chocolate shade. My love for VR in particular is just how SMOOTH it goes on and how great of a cappuccino color it is. Too Faced seems to be a great brand, and thus far I am pretty happy with everything I&#x27;ve gotten from them. Someone else mentioned this palette may not be the best for fair skin but I think it can work pretty well with any warm-toned look. I&#x27;d totally recommend this.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this product. it goes on so nicely and feels so smooth. it stays on all night and looks awesome.</li>
            <li> Pretty natural colors with a bit of shimmer for fun.  Lasted all day with very little wear.  Colors are true to what is shown.  Case is metal and a little on the large size.  Not something you would want to keep in your purse because it opens so easily, but great for home.  I like it and am wanting to try other colors.</li>
            <li> very satisfactory, person gifted liked it very much</li>
            <li> Being cheap in nature...i&#x27;m still surprised that i purchased this shadow. But i was prepping for a wedding and wanted to look good. I&#x27;m sooo glad i bought it! I wear it every day. it&#x27;s great for a million looks! Plus it&#x27;s lasted forever...i bought this back in 2011 and i still have plenty of all the colors!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  It is exactly how it was described and the &#x27;how to&#x27; cards are very helpful for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t wear much make up. I personally like the balance between the shimmery and base tone colors.</li>
            <li> its saying it was delivered but it hasnt been. &amp; it wasnt stolen out of my mailbox because it locks &amp; i usually meet the mailman at my door when he comes. im real worried, ill give it a week but if it isnt here i want my money back for sure! .. never had a problem with amazon until now.,</li>
            <li> This shadow collection has the best colors and comes in a really nice compact.  I received it as a gift, and I loved it so much, I purchased it for my daughter.</li>
            <li> The Too Faced Natural Eye Palette is 9 colors divided into 3 looks - Daytime, Classic, and Fashion. Each look comes with a card showing you the best way to apply the look. The cards can be slightly difficult to remove from the packaging so I&#x27;d recommend leaving them partially out for easier access. The darkest shades are intended to be eyeliners so if you aren&#x27;t practiced in applying powder eyeliners then you may not like this palette. The daytime look consists of matte colors which aren&#x27;t shimmery and look very natural. The classic look has a base that is shimmery and the colors are slightly darker so the look is more dramatic. The fashion look has flakes of glitter making the overall look very sparkly. The shadows stay on well and the colors are nicely coordinated. A good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I really like color combinations in this eye shadow collection.  It&#x27;s very easy to go from day to night with a few quick changes and it comes with instruction cards on how to apply, which makes it virtually mistake proof.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected it to be! This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for, eye makeup that makes you look and feel FLAWLESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> So I was kind of worried after I ordered this that with it being eye shadow that it would show up all broken.  Luckily it wasn&#x27;t.  It also had this cool diagram on how to put the eye shadow on for your best results.  This product is very light and I really think I might purchase other items from the company Too Faced Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I use this eye shadow every day now! It&#x27;s so pretty and it even comes with instructions on where to apply each color on your lid. Fool proof!</li>
            <li> The Too Faced Cosmetics brand is phenomenal and I love their packaging, makeup tips, and color options. Love the matte eyeshadow</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected it to be, goes on great and I just love this product.  I find it to look good on just about everyone!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite. I use it more often than other eye shadow. For daily use or for parties. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a year and a half and I still haven&#x27;t ran out! Great pigment shadow!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using Too Faced Cosmetics Natural Eye Shadow Collection.  It is an excellent product for every woman of any color or nationality.  It is long lasting.  The cost is a bit expensive, they should offer coupons or discounts for frequent buyers.  I could use a coupon on future products.</li>
            <li> Love these colors they are so beautiful! Too Faced has great quality eye shadows and they have a lot of pigment to them! Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> There are so many ways to wear this! It comes with graphic/instruction cards. But, you can also experiment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are matt, frosty, shimmery, glittery, and shiny. Highly pigmented, generally. A number of colors work well as highlights that you wouldn&#x27;t expect until you try it. Works on ANY skin tone, type, colors! (I&#x27;m VERY pale, and my friend is WAY dark, but it&#x27;s ALL GOOD!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin/eyes, and this product does NOT agitate or bother my face, skin, eyes, etc... It ALSO doesn&#x27;t cause wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was recommended THIS specifically for job interviewing, or working in an office! (Yes, I DID get the job!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-and it also mixes well with Urban Decay&#x27;s NAKED PALLET I &amp; II, as well as a number of drugstore brands, like Maybeline. If you use Urban Decay&#x27;s \\&quot;Primer Potion\\&quot; before you apply, THIS product will stay on up to 3 days strait, even in HIGH humidity!&lt;br /&gt;You can ALSO use this make-up to go out at night!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2GVVQPSF80LMR]]You can see the makeup in my review, check it out!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of weird that this is suppose to be &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look yet most of the shades is glittery. I expected more matte but it&#x27;s still a very nice palette.</li>
            <li> I have been searching forever for a natural eyeshadow that doesn&#x27;t make you look tired and lasts all day. Too faced natural eye is amazing. I&#x27;m going to buy more from too faced because of its look and quality.</li>
            <li> This pallete is slightly deceiving, I thought the shadows were going to be slightly bigger and was hoping a little less chalky! I&#x27;m thinking I should have bought the NakedPallete instead! However, it came early and in great condition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;xx</li>
            <li> Great palette for everyday looks, it has three cards for three different looks but I nix colors around and change up looks to create different everyday looks, my personal or signature look with this palette is silk teddy on the lids, a little honey pot in the inner corner Erotica in the crease and coco puff for the outer corner, love it!!! its my go to look where I don&#x27;t know Wat look I want that day.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas along with the Brow Envy.  We all love these products.  I may have borrowed it from one of my daughters and forgot to return it...&lt;br /&gt;the colors are perfect for those who enjoy neutral shades.</li>
            <li> Amazing eye shadows, prettiest colours, so much cheaper than going to kit to get it , absolutely in love with too faced !!</li>
            <li> I use these shadows everyday the top colors are perfect for day wear, you can go heavy on the liner if you want for night as well... The bottom colors are my favorite!!! All of Too Faced Cosmetics are awesome to me! It came on time and nicely packaged so I would really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love too faced makeuP. Colors are so vibrant and stay on all day.</li>
            <li> Too Faced has done it again! They continuously come out with these perfectly matched eye shadow sets to keep scatter-brained people (like myself) from digging through shadow after shadow trying to find a trio that works together. The Neutral Eye set is my go-to for pretty much any occasion. I like that there are three different options to suit whatever need you may have-whether it is work, a night out, or a special occasion, these shadows work well in the trios that Too Faced has already picked AND mix-matched. The shadows are pigmented and last all day (I use Mac&#x27;s neutral eye paint as a base) without any creasing or fading. I will be replenishing mine as soon as it runs out. It may seem like a lot of money to spend on a small eye shadow set, but it will last long and you will be pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed the natural colors for the base of the eye.  However, I wish the base would have more coverage so it doesn&#x27;t take so long to put it on (me being lazy).  The colors are great and I love the packaging.  I guess they could have added an mirror to the inside when you open it but..........</li>
            <li> I have never spent this much money on eye shadow before. I am usually a drug store makeup buyer. I saw the beautiful colors and the promise of the makeup lasting all day and it was for real. I did buy the shadow insurance to go with it and a nice starters brush set too. I am having all kinds of people complimenting me on my new eye look. I am going to buy the other Two Faced Eye Shadow Collections pallets with other beautiful colors in them. Worth every cent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m interested in buying this, but I am a bit confused. The title says &amp;#34;natural eyes pallete&amp;#34; but the picture shows colors from the &amp;#34;natural matte palette&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m curious about which product it actually is.</li>
            <li> I am using my husbands account but I want to say This palette is the bomb!!! The colors are so gorgous!!! The eyeshadow glides on so smoothe and easy and lasts all day (with my sahdow primer). There is so many looks that can come right from this one little palette. I would reccommend this to a friend or I would buy it for a gift. I don&#x27;t regret a penny I have in this palette. I plan to purchase more Too Faced palettes in the future.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for over a year, I wear some of the colors nearly every day. This shadow is great, the colors go together perfectly, there are style suggestion cards that come with the set,and the set is really worth your $$ ! all day wear without a doubt and high quality shadows. My favorite is \\&quot;honey pot\\&quot; im almost out !</li>
