            <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, very light weight conditioner that helps to detangle my thick curly hair!!!</li>

            <li>I have naturally curly hair and live in FL....</li>

            <li>It feels soft.</li>
            <li>But using the product alone, does nothing for my natural 4a/b/c hair.</li>
            <li>I really feel that I have wasted my money but not so much that I&#x27;d throw the product away.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t personally use this, but it works wonders for my 14month old son.</li>

            <li> It really does what it says. I have wavy unruly hair. I keep scrunching my towel dried hair after uniformly distributing it through out my hair lengths. The end result is soft hair and beautiful beachy waves with zero stiffness.</li>
            <li> I like this product  smell good and my hair feel fine.</li>
            <li> I wanted this product to work but it failed. The ingredients are not natural. My curls were dry after I put this stuff in. I would not recommend this product to anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> Got a sample of this product and now I&#x27;m here shopping Amazon for a regular supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this after a sample of the curls unleashed sulfate free shampoo. This conditioner smells mild and fresh to my nose, though I get the reference to the antibiotic someone mentioned in these reviews. The consistency is like soft soap or a tad thinner.  It was easy to apply. I think these products work by doing an excellent job of smoothing the hair cuticle, sealing the hair making for much more smoothness and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a lot of spring in my hair from this product. I&#x27;m buying this stuff for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> Curly haired girls should give this a try. Conditioner is your friend and this one tops the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product...I have naturally curly hair and live in FL....IT WORKS! Not heavy or greasy...&lt;br /&gt;FYI....much cheaper in Walmart!</li>
            <li> Rich, luxurious, deep-conditioning &amp; smells amazing.  I love all hair products from this brand &amp; have been using them for a while</li>
            <li> This makes my hair look healthy and shiny and makes my curls look great!</li>
            <li> This conditioner absorbs well into my hair, but have to use other leave in conditioner to soften my hair. It also smells like amoxicillin.:(</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a leave-in conditioner that is going to make your hair actually feel conditioned, this is not it. The consistency is like a cheap lotion: very thin and watery. I have 3c hair and when I put it on my damp hair, I don&#x27;t feel any moisture. I really feel that I have wasted my money but not so much that I&#x27;d throw the product away. The only positive that I can say about this is that it does help a bit with detangling. It also pairs well with a cream. Even if you are on a tight budget, there are better leave-ins within this price range. I would not repurchase. I&#x27;d recommend it only as a detangler but NOT as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> As a BIG fan of the Curls Unleashed Curl Defining Cream, I decided to try the No Boundaries Leave in Conditioner. After reading some reviews about the smell, I decided to smell it prior to purchasing it in the store, and the smell didn&#x27;t bother me. I absolutely love the curl defining cream and use it several times a week so I purchased the product, and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. After washing my hair and conditioning it as I normally do, I put the leave in conditioner in and used the curl defining cream for my two strand twists, like I usually do. I let my hear air dry over night, and in the morning proceeded to untwist my hair as usual. I have to admit... My curls were gorgeous! But as I was untwisting my hair, I noticed a crumb-like substance in my hair and falling on my shirt which happened to be black so it was very obvious. My mood instantly changed - I knew the crumb-like residue had to be from the leave in conditioner because that was the only thing I did differently in my hair routine. Since being natural, I&#x27;ve never had an issue with dandruff and my hair is well moisturized.  I was getting ready for work, so needless to say, I didn&#x27;t have time to wash my hair and start this process again -minus the leave in conditioner, but after work today, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll be doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that no one mentioned this happening to them in the other reviews, so I&#x27;m apt to believe that I may have gotten a bad batch, but I&#x27;m not sure if I want to try it again with a new bottle. I was used to spending $20 a bottle for the Mixed Chics leave in conditioner, and I was excited to try something a little cheaper, but I guess it&#x27;s true: You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, very light weight conditioner that helps to detangle my thick curly hair!!! I use the curls unleashed shampoo and gel also.</li>
            <li> This was the worst mistak my hair, didn&#x27;t like it at all I had more shedding then usually, and my hair started breaking off I was scared that my hair was falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not recommend this too anyone.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t personally use this, but it works wonders for my 14month old son. He has very soft/long/curly hair. Can&#x27;t go a day without this and olive oil for him.</li>
            <li> Does it job. I buy it on a monthly base for my son&#x27;s curly hair.</li>
            <li> It smells really good and makes my curls super defined. Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> My hair does feel different. It feels soft. It has a nice fragrance.  A bit pricy though. Suave has come out with their own line of shampoo and conditioner with low sulfate.  I compared the Suave to this product.  The suave seemed to have left my hair feeling oily.  The organic conditioner did not.  Up in the air as to wheather I will spend the money again for this conditioner, though.</li>
            <li> Awful. Made my hair tangled and stiff. Not a good moisturizer and definitely didn&#x27;t do much for my curls. Never again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like smell and doesn&#x27;t moisturize. The smell for me is nauseating. I have to mix it with other products to hide the smell. But using the product alone, does nothing for my natural 4a/b/c hair.</li>
