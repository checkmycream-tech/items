            <li>and you can see how great that must have been...</li>
            <li>Carrots night cream and liked it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to make my skin any more irritated than it already is.  </li>
            <li>On top of that?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitivity to many things</li>
            <li>Then I decided to buy more since I &amp;#34;thought&amp;#34; they worked so well.</li>
            <li>It does remove MOST of the cosmetics and dirt from my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these wipes.</li>
            <li>I will purchase again, but for a better price elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I thought I would love these.</li>
            <li>I used one to wipe very quickly at some foundation on my neck - no problem, easy peasy.</li>
            <li>I immediately washed it off with face wash and felt fine after.  </li>
            <li>Smelled great and felt fine for a second.  </li>
            <li>Then I come on here and see that others experienced the same thing?</li>
            <li>Originally, the claims on the packaging of being &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; sold me, as I was expecting a face wipe</li>
            <li>Turned bright red, stings, like a sunburn or allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>Like others have said, these burned my face causing bright red circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>My face is bright red now!</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t because it doesn&#x27;t feel true.</li>
            <li>I bought a sampler pack that I used a few weeks ago, they worked great, smelled okay and were decently priced.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the clean, simple smell that comes from these as soon as I opened the package.</li>
            <li>The burning sensation and the redness were both pretty disconcerting.</li>
            <li>I should have read reviews first.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I love the smell and feel of these wipes.</li>
            <li>My skin was red and burnig for a good couple of hours and my eyes were burning and red as well.</li>
            <li>Most products dry my skin out terribly.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I am very dissapointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This product is very suspicious.</li>
            <li>, my face is bright red, and I&#x27;m NEVER sensitive to things like this!!!!</li>
            <li>I used one wipe on my face after working all day to clean off the grime, sweat and old makeup and instantly noticed the softness it gave my skin.</li>
            <li>I bought these on my way out of the beauty section in Target because I was out of my normal E.L.F. wipes and they were at the end of the row and on sale.</li>
            <li>Amazon price is highly inflated) and I too suffer from very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>IF they come out with a new formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well the first wipe I used from this new pack turned my face beet RED</li>
            <li>I do not usually have sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>;, actually made my face red and swollen and burning, which is the first time that has ever happened to me with a beauty product!</li>
            <li>Then it got worse and my wife asked why my face was bright red...  </li>
            <li>I would steer clear of this product however.  </li>
            <li>These burn my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I would think that if this product is meant for sensitive skin, that it shouldn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li>I prefer natural products because I have sensitive skin that is also oily &amp; acne prone.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin, and I have never reacted to any face product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>they ain&#x27;t goin&#x27; anywhere near my face.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and these wipes made my face look sunburned and it burned like hell.</li>
            <li>I normally buy Ology hypoallergenic facial wipes but ran out and on an impulse buy decided to buy these.</li>
            <li>Barely removed my makeup and now my skin is hurting and itchy.</li>
            <li>Anyone have suggestions for a wipe that&#x27;s actually made with natural ingredients that works well to remove makeup?</li>
            <li>Used half a wipe - now my whole face is on fire with red rashes all over it.</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll just take the time to wet a washcloth and use a drop of my Shea Moisture Shampoo or John Masters Organics Zinc &amp; Sage Shampoo with Conditioner or Mineral Fusions shampoo or Boscia Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li> They do about an equal job cleansing but the scent is a tad on the strong (and sort of artificial) side.</li>
            <li> they burned and I broke out in a rash followed by itchy dry skin -im</li>
            <li> My face is a combination of dry around my nose and cheeks but oily by my eyes and hairline.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin and wrongly assumed &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; meant gentle, soothing, not irritant.  </li>
            <li> They are a bit rough on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> going to use these as wet wipes from now on...</li>
            <li> I had unfortunately used them right before work</li>
            <li> I only used one cloth, but I&#x27;m not willing to suffer for a few cents.</li>
            <li> I usually use the wipes from &amp;#34;simple&amp;#34; so I thought these would be similar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a slightly stickiness, possibly due to excess cleansing product in the wipe - some of my wipes were foamy/sudsy.</li>
            <li> Just used one towelette for the first time and had to wash off immediately with my regular face wash because my skin was burning so badly.</li>
            <li> Ingrid&#x27;s new packaging brought me to this product, but ill never use it again.</li>
            <li> I tried using them off and on for a few months and my skin never got used to them.</li>
            <li> that not only cleansed my face, but also did so without irritating my semi-sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easily the worst make-up remover I&#x27;ve ever used..</li>
            <li> I am shocked because I am not sensitive to other products.  </li>
            <li> It was not a good makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> They are soft and I like that, but these the softness doesn&#x27;t make up for how badly these irritate my skin!</li>
            <li> Terrible product as about half of the other reviewers also say.  </li>
            <li> Not good for sensitive/ hypoallergenic skin!</li>
            <li> Tonight I used one of these wipes for the second time, and my face felt and looked like I had a horrible sunburn.</li>
            <li> / when they change the formula, I hope they don&#x27;t add parabens or propylene glycol or any other horrible</li>
            <li> Instead, they burn my face like crazy.</li>
            <li> WRONG!  </li>
            <li> Then I had a terrible experience where they burned so badly</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> but this reaction is so awful</li>
            <li> It also did a terrible job of removing makeup.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with NOT sensitive skin. Until I wiped one of these on my face.  Turned bright red, stings, like a sunburn or allergic reaction. Terrible product as about half of the other reviewers also say.  AVOID!</li>
            <li> I bought these on my way out of the beauty section in Target because I was out of my normal E.L.F. wipes and they were at the end of the row and on sale. I used one to wipe very quickly at some foundation on my neck - no problem, easy peasy. That night, though, when I got out of the bath and decided to wash my face and used them to remove my makeup? Horrible. Awful. Burning sensations all over my cheeks and jawline, my eyes are watery, my face is bright red, and I&#x27;m NEVER sensitive to things like this!!!! I was going to give them to a coworker to get them out of the house but this reaction is so awful I&#x27;m not even going to risk that. I&#x27;ll be throwing this package of 38 unused wipes away immediately - I suggest you do the same if you bought them!!!</li>
            <li> Bought these at target yesterday. Used half a wipe - now my whole face is on fire with red rashes all over it. Barely removed my makeup and now my skin is hurting and itchy. Instantly went in the trash. NEVER AGAIN! Not hypoallergenic. I&#x27;ve never reacted to anything else. Anyone have suggestions for a wipe that&#x27;s actually made with natural ingredients that works well to remove makeup? Never trusting &#x27;Yes To&#x27; again.</li>
            <li> These burn my sensitive skin. I tried using them off and on for a few months and my skin never got used to them. Then I had a terrible experience where they burned so badly my face looked sunburned for three days. I will never use these again.</li>
            <li> Easily the worst make-up remover I&#x27;ve ever used.. They are soft and I like that, but these the softness doesn&#x27;t make up for how badly these irritate my skin! My skin was red and burnig for a good couple of hours and my eyes were burning and red as well. These made me feel like a blotchy red lobster. Ingrid&#x27;s new packaging brought me to this product, but ill never use it again.</li>
            <li> I am very dissapointed with this purchase. My daughter used these towelettes and after five minutes, her face was tomato red and stinging. She kept complaining her face was burning. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Do not buy this product!</li>
            <li> Turned my face completely red. I do not usually have sensitive skin at all. I do not recommend at all. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Bought the blueberry one.  Used it the 1st day I got it.  Smelled great and felt fine for a second.  Then it started burning.  I figured it just meant that it was working.  Then it got worse and my wife asked why my face was bright red...  I immediately washed it off with face wash and felt fine after.  My wife tried one and didn&#x27;t have an adverse reaction to it.  I would steer clear of this product however.  The burning sensation and the redness were both pretty disconcerting.</li>
            <li> Add me to the list of burn victims.  I should have read reviews first.  I do have sensitive skin and wrongly assumed &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; meant gentle, soothing, not irritant.  WRONG!  I don&#x27;t need to make my skin any more irritated than it already is.  On top of that? It was not a good makeup remover.  I don&#x27;t wear waterproof mascara, but I had to use a wash cloth to get the rest off.  I only used one cloth, but I&#x27;m not willing to suffer for a few cents.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitivity to many things but these messed up my face they burned and I broke out in a rash followed by itchy dry skin -im still tryin to recover - my face and forehead</li>
            <li> I bought a sampler pack that I used a few weeks ago, they worked great, smelled okay and were decently priced. I usually use the wipes from &amp;#34;simple&amp;#34; so I thought these would be similar. Then I decided to buy more since I &amp;#34;thought&amp;#34; they worked so well. Well the first wipe I used from this new pack turned my face beet RED like I was severely sun burned and stung! What the hell? Then I come on here and see that others experienced the same thing? What&#x27;s in these things that is doing that!?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the &amp;#34;yes to cucumbers&amp;#34; SOOTHING hypoallergenic facial towels.&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;- 98% Natural&lt;br /&gt;- Cruelty Free&lt;br /&gt;- Paraben Free&lt;br /&gt;- It does remove MOST of the cosmetics and dirt from my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;- Tingles&lt;br /&gt;- Burns&lt;br /&gt;- Makes my eyes water even when I don&#x27;t apply the wipe to my eyes. (sometimes I like to just wipe the oil from my t-zone or brow pencil from my eyebrows.)&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves a film over my skin. I almost feel as though I have a mask on once I&#x27;m done wiping my face with these.&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t make me feel any cleaner. I always feel like I need to go wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;- They are a bit rough on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I would list HYPOALLERGENIC FORMULA in the Pro&#x27;s section but I can&#x27;t because it doesn&#x27;t feel true. I would think that if this product is meant for sensitive skin, that it shouldn&#x27;t burn. Or make my eyes water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If / when they change the formula, I hope they don&#x27;t add parabens or propylene glycol or any other horrible ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this formula to anyone and I will NOT be buying them again until MAYBE IF they come out with a new formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just take the time to wet a washcloth and use a drop of my Shea Moisture Shampoo or John Masters Organics Zinc &amp; Sage Shampoo with Conditioner or Mineral Fusions shampoo or Boscia Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes. I enjoyed the clean, simple smell that comes from these as soon as I opened the package. I used one wipe on my face after working all day to clean off the grime, sweat and old makeup and instantly noticed the softness it gave my skin. Any redness I had also subsided.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know where all the &amp;#34;burned my face off&#x27; reviews are coming from!&lt;br /&gt;I bought these at Publix (for $4.99 btw...Amazon price is highly inflated) and I too suffer from very sensitive skin. My face is a combination of dry around my nose and cheeks but oily by my eyes and hairline. Most products dry my skin out terribly.&lt;br /&gt;  Overall, I love the smell and feel of these wipes. I will purchase again, but for a better price elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with facial wipes to find my go to brand. I prefer natural products because I have sensitive skin that is also oily &amp; acne prone. Prior to this I was using Burt&#x27;s Bees wipes. They do about an equal job cleansing but the scent is a tad on the strong (and sort of artificial) side. Another con is the feeling on my skin after use. I&#x27;ve noticed a slightly stickiness, possibly due to excess cleansing product in the wipe - some of my wipes were foamy/sudsy. They&#x27;ll do in a pinch but not a product to rave about. Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Just used one towelette for the first time and had to wash off immediately with my regular face wash because my skin was burning so badly. It&#x27;s been 15 minutes and it still burns around my eye area. My face looks like it has been sunburned. Stay away.</li>
            <li> Tonight I used one of these wipes for the second time, and my face felt and looked like I had a horrible sunburn. Sucked all the moisture out along the way. It also did a terrible job of removing makeup. This product is very suspicious. I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin, and I have never reacted to any face product. What is in this garbage??</li>
            <li> I thought I would love these. Instead, they burn my face like crazy. I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin. I gave them away. I will not repurchase</li>
            <li> Like others have said, these burned my face causing bright red circles around my eyes. The fact that they are sold as soothing and hypoallergenic is a joke.</li>
            <li> I normally buy Ology hypoallergenic facial wipes but ran out and on an impulse buy decided to buy these. I&#x27;ve already used Yes To.. Carrots night cream and liked it but not to reiterate... These wipes left my face burning and EXTREMELY red for a couple hours. I had unfortunately used them right before work and you can see how great that must have been... Not good for sensitive/ hypoallergenic skin!</li>
            <li> Burned my skin!  I am shocked because I am not sensitive to other products.  I picked this up because it was on sale, wish I stuck to the neutrogena wipes.  My face is bright red now!</li>
            <li> Originally, the claims on the packaging of being &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; sold me, as I was expecting a face wipe that not only cleansed my face, but also did so without irritating my semi-sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, they caused an uncomfortable burning sensation after I used them, especially in the cheek area, that lingered more than 15 min. after use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to use these as wet wipes from now on...they ain&#x27;t goin&#x27; anywhere near my face.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Soothing&amp;#34; &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34;, actually made my face red and swollen and burning, which is the first time that has ever happened to me with a beauty product!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and these wipes made my face look sunburned and it burned like hell.</li>
