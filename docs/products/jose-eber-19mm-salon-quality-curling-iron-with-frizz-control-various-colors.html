            <li>I&#x27;m one of those people who thought some of the cheaper, drugstore curling irons would be just as good -</li>

            <li>My friend has one, used it with great results, so decided to get my own.</li>
            <li>Curls hair quickly and creates excellent curls, but beware that it can burn!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I purchased it from Amazon vs the mall.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good if you need a lot of heat to keep your curls, but it would be nice if it could be adjusted.</li>

            <li>Totally love this curling wand.  </li>
            <li>I tried the Jose Eber curling iron and thought it was much better and easier to use.</li>
            <li>It creates those perfect curls that other irons can&#x27;t compete with, or you can make sexy beach waves!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>What more would you want?</li>
            <li>Even still wavy the next day, Best hair tool i&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, I am in LOVE with this curling iron.</li>
            <li>:) A year ago I bought this curling iron as a curling iron newbie, and now I am a master at curling away people&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>When she uses the iron, her hair falls in lovely finger waves.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I used it, I got so many compliments and I curled a friends hair</li>
            <li>Just make sure to wear the heat protective glove that is included(I wasn&#x27;t wearing it when I burned my finger).</li>
            <li>This product works as advertised and I am glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>but once you got the hang of it your able to do any type of hair styles.</li>
            <li>But I think that after using more often I won&#x27;t burn myself anymore.</li>
            <li>i hope i take 25 to wavy look :)</li>
            <li>Love the wand and this brand is one that I can always trust.</li>
            <li>That excluded most everything else.    </li>
            <li>This curler works better than any curler I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Need better glove.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>a must buy :)</li>
            <li>I researched this product and for the most part found nothing but praise.</li>
            <li>I never write reviews but this curling wand saves me a lot of time and keeps my husband happy because my hair normally takes forever to curl. :)</li>
            <li>This gives quick, beautiful, consistent results.</li>

            <li>Overall, this curling iron is amazing!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to manage getting my hair to do anything let alone hold a curl, so I have been really happy with this curling iron so far.</li>
            <li>Maybe there is a better technique that will leave your hair smooth all over, but I didn&#x27;t intuitively find it.)    </li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend getting this curling iron if you&#x27;re looking for a good clampless curling iron.</li>
            <li>I definately recommend this to anyone who wants a good culing iron.</li>
            <li>It curls so quickly, but most importantly, it HOLDS my curl!</li>
            <li>It really is easy and quick, and you&#x27;ll thank yourself later for getting this great tool!</li>
            <li>I always get tons of compliments on my hair, when I curl it with the wand :) Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to hold</li>
            <li>Once you switch hands, it&#x27;s easy to adjust to the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and just what I needed.</li>
            <li>Very easy and fun to do.</li>
            <li>I first saw it in a mall kiosk and tried it on my hair and it worked amazingly.</li>
            <li>I actually tested this curling iron yesterday afternoon and it curled my hair beautifully.</li>
            <li>I love this iron , it give  me a real  hair fashion  by my own hand , it is fantastic .</li>
            <li>I use it Europe at the moment and works fine on the 220 volt here</li>
            <li>Would have been nice to have a temperature control, but for the price, I certainly will not complain.     </li>
            <li>It does get very hot, too!</li>
            <li>I do both my girls hair and the curls look great and maintain the entire day.</li>
            <li>I have stick-straight hair that will not hold a curl, even with all the product available.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>Ladies, there comes a point in our lives where we have to stop buying cheap products and invest in quality goods.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with the way it left my hair</li>
            <li>and then before I leave brush fingers or a lightly brush it.</li>
            <li>Great product since I could never curl my hair w/ a regular iron with the clamp..</li>
            <li>One thing I learnt fast: DO NOT use the iron without the glove on!!!</li>
            <li>Very satisfated !!!</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product and I can only highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I simply love this product, it is VERY high quality!</li>
            <li>First off, I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s all worth it!</li>
            <li>I have never been able to find a curling iron that works on my naturally straight hair - until now!</li>
            <li>Product arrived way before its scheduled delivery date, well packaged in its original box, with a glove and life time warranty (that has to be initiated by registration, however).</li>
            <li>Plugged it in with a voltage adaptor and it works great, no sparking or anything; Just make sure your adaptor can accommodate the uneven two prong plug.      </li>
            <li>the process is super easy and quick.  </li>
            <li>Curls or waves, depending on how you handle them as they cool.</li>
            <li>The glove is a knitted cotton glove, which is nice to protect you from the insta-burn you could get if the iron went directly on your skin.</li>
            <li>Love the way it curls your hair in nice loose curls.</li>
            <li>I am so glad her daughters introduced this new type of hair tool to me, too!</li>
            <li>Get the real and original clipless iron on here!    </li>
            <li>If you want super bouncy curls, continue to hold the curl as it cools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly -- glove is included.</li>
            <li>dont have your hair wrapped around it for ages, curls super</li>
            <li>Overall very satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li>It does get very hot and I have the burn marks to proove it.  </li>
            <li>fast.&lt;br /&gt;It does get very hot</li>
            <li>(I was not exactly familiar with Jose Eber, but the brand in general seems to have really good reviews and seen as a good one with quality items.)    </li>
            <li>and so it is just HOT!</li>
            <li>I kind of wish I would have gotten the 25mm barrel because these curls aren&#x27;t as big as I normally like them to be, but they&#x27;re still really cute.  </li>
            <li>I have had problems in keeping my hair curled being that I have fine, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finally able to get some really nice body in my hair - and finally get curl near the roots!  </li>
            <li>This curling iron is absolutely amazing, and i know I most curling irons end up being a waste of money</li>
            <li>And having a video is useful to know what all you can accomplish.</li>
            <li>The heat doesn&#x27;t bother me, but it did however leave me with two scars on my chest (to which my friends make fun of me and call them hickeys).</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re still there, but the result was so worth it</li>
            <li>and she loved it so much she bought one the next day.</li>
            <li>The curler is a nice one, it only had 1 heat setting.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definately worth it, its my holy grail.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is one of those goods because it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>The iron gets SUPER hot.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it was a GREAT first impression.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit to get used to, but does a wonderful job creating those soft, messy curls that I was looking for!</li>
            <li>This is my first and only wand that I own</li>
            <li>The super hot temperate really sets the curls quickly</li>
            <li>the product had arrived before expected in new I happy with it</li>
            <li>I have very straight, fine hair that normally doesn&#x27;t hold a curl AT ALL,</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous that it wouldn&#x27;t work the same or that it would be defective, but it is INCREDIBLE!</li>
            <li>- This thing is hot, hot, HOT!</li>
            <li>More and more companies are going green and not printing out lengthy instructions.</li>
            <li>It comes with a glove, which was a nice surprise and a necessary accessory because this thing gets really</li>
            <li>I have super straight hair, and it takes a lot to curl it, but this did the job.  </li>
            <li>It heats up super fast so you don&#x27;t have to wait longer than a minute to use it.</li>
            <li>There is no little kick stand or notch that allows it to rest easily on a counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>PRO&#x27;S:  - VERY fast heating up time (</li>
            <li>After seeing their different hairstyles for my cousins wedding, the natural beach wave was my favorite, I knew I had to get in on the new iron!     :)</li>
            <li>Using some curl mousse and about 20 minutes of my time my hair goes from stick straight to curly and stays that way even sleeping on it!</li>
            <li>the iron is supposed to be hot to make your hair do things.</li>
            <li>The Jose Eber iron barrel does not change it is the same size from top to bottom.</li>
            <li>*cough*)</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if the curls will hold up in a more humid climate, will have to test that out later.  </li>
            <li>There are much better ones in the market, do your homework and pick one with multiple settings and the ability to change the size of wand.  </li>
            <li>It really is!)     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easily worth thrice as much.</li>
            <li>Hot iron&#x3D;DO NOT TOUCH.     </li>
            <li>(maybe mine doesn&#x27;t get as hot?), but</li>
            <li>the curls I get with my iron last most of the day.</li>
            <li>I love that it heats up to 350  degrees and do not mind that there is only an on/off switch</li>
            <li>I have used this consistently since my purchase and appreciate how natural(loose curls) and bouncy my hair is with this.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using a non clip curling iron.</li>
            <li>but at first its a must have.&lt;br /&gt;Def</li>
            <li>19mm is perfect for tight curler or beachy waves, depending on how much hair/how long you hold it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t curl my own hair &amp; when other people do, it just falls out within a couple hours.</li>
            <li>So as long as you take care not to shove it on your unprotected skin you should be fine!</li>
            <li>and I live in a super humid climate.</li>
            <li>The staying power is excellent so touch ups are less frequent if you go for multiple days without washing.</li>
            <li>Even being careful, I got burnt very easily -</li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t think its worth it for the high price or the burns</li>
            <li>It gets hot really fast</li>
            <li>(Not long ago I bought my first clip iron, the cheap</li>
            <li>It took me a while to get the technique down, but once I did my hair looked amazing.</li>
            <li>The instruction manual says it has a temperature control setting, but the picture on Amazon is pretty accurate, it is only an on/off switch.</li>
            <li>Curling is easy, and the curls do last a while.</li>
            <li>I bought this curling iron a few weeks ago and I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I was amazed how wonderful it curled my teenage daughters hair because it will normally curl because of how thick and straight it is.</li>
            <li>It holds curls great and it takes me about 20 minutes to do all my hair (I have reasonably long hair), before with my other one it took about an hour.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is exactly what I have been looking for and the curls hold in my hair for alot longer than any other product I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works with the European 240 voltage just fine.</li>
            <li>Grab a chunk of hair, wrap it around the barrel, hold it a few seconds... and voila, tight beautiful curl!</li>
            <li>For me this iron was much easier to use.</li>
            <li>(This isn&#x27;t as much of a con as it is a warning)</li>
            <li>The curling iron heats up fast and curls hair fast.</li>
            <li>and I have stick straight hair.</li>
            <li>I suggest getting this iron if you really want something that lasts.</li>
            <li>I have really straight hair that just never holds curl.  </li>
            <li>and I really couldn&#x27;t change a thing about it.</li>
            <li>and it really works</li>
            <li>I can do my whole head of hair in 10 mins, but if you&#x27;ve never used a curling iron before, the technique may take you some time in the beginning.</li>
            <li>As for the vendor, beware that they are very uncooperative and will charge a \\&quot;restocking fee\\&quot; if you try to return.  </li>
            <li>I do highly suggest the iron still!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>second one I&#x27;ve purchased and it makes my hair look fantastic.</li>
            <li>but with short hair I get fantastic waves.</li>
            <li>Recently I tried curling my hair with a regular barrel and decided it wasn&#x27;t worth my time, my Jose Eber wand is much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SO much cheaper to buy it off here.</li>
            <li>I, a grown adult, can finally make my hair look cute like all the TV stars.  </li>
            <li>Been using it for a few years now and everyone asks how I get my hair to look so nice and curly.</li>
            <li>, i don&#x27;t want to add any more heat damage to my hair, but for those bad hair days and when my perm is fading, or for those special nights out - i&#x27;m so glad i now have a curling iron to rely on!</li>
            <li>Just be careful, this baby gets HOT and its easy to burn yourself.</li>
            <li>My mall tries to sell this same type of iron (different brand however) for 4x the price, and let me tell you, it isn&#x27;t anywhere as good!</li>
            <li>It is a bit of a learning curve to properly curl your hair, especially the back, but once you get the hang of it, it is amazing!    </li>
            <li>This is my second José Eber Curling Iron (My first one was stolen at a friends house, sadly) and let me just say, it is FANTASTIC!!!!!</li>
            <li>A lot of youtube videos were showing me completely different ways to do it, that&#x27;s how i originally started off.</li>
            <li>Very simple, straightforward, no fuss.</li>
            <li>Nice curls that will last a long time in my very fine/thin hair.</li>
            <li>My intention was to \\&quot;test-drive it\\&quot; and find out what I liked and disliked about it, as to be better informed on what to look for in a more expensive one.</li>
            <li>It heats up fairly quickly, although there is no indicator to tell you when its ready, only an on/off switch.</li>
            <li>i think gives you good versatility - if you want larger curls/waves just use larger sections of hair and for tighter curls, use smaller sections of hair.</li>
            <li>, I was kind of skeptical because I have never had a curling iron that does what I want- make pretty curls that hold and that curl quickly.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT, everyone loves it too and cant believe how much less I paid than the mall kiosks.</li>
            <li>I chose this particular curling iron for these reasons:    </li>
            <li>All in all a decent wand.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, makes great curls in less than 5 seconds per strand, that last and last and last.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but this is exactly what I wanted and more!</li>
            <li>The glove is nice but hard to grab hair with it.  </li>
            <li>I love this curling iron and you should get it if you have trouble curling you hair.</li>
            <li>I have normal hair and it takes me 45-60 minutes to do my hair</li>
            <li>My Herstyler took forever to get a curl, normally fell out 1/2 way throughout night</li>
            <li>- Anyone can master this tool  - Leaves hair looking soft and shiny, not crunchy  - Professional salon quality  - No CLIP!!!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t remember.)but any other glove worked fine for me.     </li>
            <li>The only negative is that it is super hot and you can easily burn yourself.  </li>
            <li>your right side (or non-dominant side) switch hands and hold the iron in your left hand-</li>
            <li>and my hair gets put through the ringer -- it&#x27;s naturally straight, dark, flat, hard-to-curl and very fine, so i get a perm once a year for volume and also get color/highlights.  </li>
            <li>Both my girls have super long hair and we are always looking for new styles and curls.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, but even after sleeping on my curls with absolutely no product, they were still wavy and beautiful!</li>
            <li>I found the EXACT same curling iron on here for a sixth of the price!</li>
            <li>It gets so hot that you only have to hold it on each piece for 3-5 seconds: saves a lot of time!!</li>
            <li>The only con I can talk about is that it&#x27;s REALLY hot.</li>
            <li>it was also more affordable online than other, similar curling irons (enzo milano, etc).</li>
            <li>This item gets so scalding hot that it will burn you instantly if it comes in contact with your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is dual voltage, especially since we do have 220 volts at home, but travel often enough that we take always buy multi-voltage, especially for products like these.</li>
            <li>it wouldn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl.</li>
            <li>Funny, my cheap test iron wound up costing only a bit less than my definitive one.)     </li>
            <li>And of course, whenever a curl comes too tight for your taste, smooth it a couple of times with your hand</li>
            <li>It worked really well, but before I spent that much on it, I wanted to do some research.</li>
            <li>It takes 10 minutes to curl the whole head and it lasts until the next wash.</li>
            <li>I was deciding after my old Herstyler broke,  between the Herstyler curling wand I have had or the Jose Eber.</li>
            <li>My old cheap drug store curling iron would curl my hair but they would go limp almost immediately and that would happen with hair spray too.</li>
            <li>i also wished it came with a carry/travel bag to store it when you don&#x27;t have time to wait for it to cool down.   </li>
            <li>I got plenty of complements, and you&#x27;re pretty much in control whether you want springy curls or just a slight wave.</li>
            <li>It was in excellent condition and the only complaint that I have is that I have a hard time being coordinated enough to use it on myself.</li>
            <li>It seems intimidating, but as long as you switch hands and hold it in your left when doing your right side, you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that the curls lasted almost all day on my very long, straight hair.</li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly and packed tightly.</li>
            <li>Curling iron is an absolute hit with my daughter, much more expensive in Australia than what was purchased for on Amazon.</li>
            <li>That is how I got a burn, from trying to hold it in my right hand and still point it down and twist.  </li>
            <li>The glove does resist the heat, however, it won&#x27;t completely protect your fingers if you hold directly on the iron or near the iron for long periods of time.</li>
            <li>and I have no other problems with this curling iron.</li>
            <li>My hair seriously NEVER holds curl for a long period of time.  </li>
            <li>For your left side hold it in your right hand, glove-up your left hand and wind a bit of hair starting at the middle of the iron.  </li>
            <li>With this Jose Eber iron and short You Yube tutorial by a 12 year old...</li>
            <li>I received this product much sooner than i expected.  </li>
            <li>Curling my hair taking six minutes because I do larger sections and my hair naturally holds a curl</li>
            <li>(Yes, I got the pink version, but it&#x27;s the exact same iron as this one.)    </li>
            <li>hair is pretty thick and takes time to style but with this it&#x27;s really fast.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I can curl my hair one day, have soft waves the next and use the texture to create a bun on the third day.</li>
            <li>If you have been one of those people deciding if it&#x27;s really worth getting, splurge a little and get it!</li>
            <li>She has long, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It takes maybe 5-8 seconds to create a tight bouncy curl, but only like 3 to get a pretty wave.</li>
            <li>My hair is really fine &amp; honestly never holds curl, but this iron has been wonders!</li>
            <li>i do find that using the glove will slow me down -- but it does help you stay safe.</li>
            <li>- it does have a small, kind of built-in one, but it&#x27;s not enough and sometimes i have a hard time keeping it from sliding off the counter.</li>

            <li> Or go to Youtube and search the curling iron and people post their own instructional videos.    </li>
            <li> I burned the side of my face with it (my own fault, not the irons, I&#x27;m a klutz) but</li>

            <li> Absolute wonderful product.</li>
            <li> It does make a nice curl, but..</li>
            <li> I bought so many irons which supposed to be really good, but didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> The best curler I&#x27;ve ever used ,Because it&#x27;s really curled my hair amazingly &amp;#34;thank</li>
            <li> Would be nice to adjust the  Temperature.</li>

            <li> liked this item</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m experienced with clipless curling wands but still managed to burn myself twice the first time I used this!</li>

            <li> Totally love this curling wand.  </li>
            <li> I tried the Jose Eber curling iron and thought it was much better and easier to use.</li>
            <li> It creates those perfect curls that other irons can&#x27;t compete with, or you can make sexy beach waves!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> What more would you want?</li>
            <li> Even still wavy the next day, Best hair tool i&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, I am in LOVE with this curling iron.</li>
            <li> :) A year ago I bought this curling iron as a curling iron newbie, and now I am a master at curling away people&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> When she uses the iron, her hair falls in lovely finger waves.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I used it, I got so many compliments and I curled a friends hair</li>
            <li> Just make sure to wear the heat protective glove that is included(I wasn&#x27;t wearing it when I burned my finger).</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised and I am glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> but once you got the hang of it your able to do any type of hair styles.</li>
            <li> But I think that after using more often I won&#x27;t burn myself anymore.</li>
            <li> i hope i take 25 to wavy look :)</li>
            <li> Love the wand and this brand is one that I can always trust.</li>
            <li> That excluded most everything else.    </li>
            <li> This curler works better than any curler I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Need better glove.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>

            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> a must buy :)</li>
            <li> I researched this product and for the most part found nothing but praise.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this curling wand saves me a lot of time and keeps my husband happy because my hair normally takes forever to curl. :)</li>
            <li> This gives quick, beautiful, consistent results.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m pretty good at doing hair</li>
            <li> Overall, this curling iron is amazing!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to manage getting my hair to do anything let alone hold a curl, so I have been really happy with this curling iron so far.</li>
            <li> Maybe there is a better technique that will leave your hair smooth all over, but I didn&#x27;t intuitively find it.)    </li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend getting this curling iron if you&#x27;re looking for a good clampless curling iron.</li>
            <li> I definately recommend this to anyone who wants a good culing iron.</li>
            <li> It curls so quickly, but most importantly, it HOLDS my curl!</li>
            <li> It really is easy and quick, and you&#x27;ll thank yourself later for getting this great tool!</li>
            <li> I always get tons of compliments on my hair, when I curl it with the wand :) Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to hold</li>
            <li> Once you switch hands, it&#x27;s easy to adjust to the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Very easy and fun to do.</li>
            <li> I first saw it in a mall kiosk and tried it on my hair and it worked amazingly.</li>
            <li> I actually tested this curling iron yesterday afternoon and it curled my hair beautifully.</li>
            <li> I love this iron , it give  me a real  hair fashion  by my own hand , it is fantastic .</li>
            <li> I use it Europe at the moment and works fine on the 220 volt here</li>
            <li> Would have been nice to have a temperature control, but for the price, I certainly will not complain.     </li>
            <li> It does get very hot, too!</li>
            <li> I do both my girls hair and the curls look great and maintain the entire day.</li>
            <li> I have stick-straight hair that will not hold a curl, even with all the product available.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> Ladies, there comes a point in our lives where we have to stop buying cheap products and invest in quality goods.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with the way it left my hair</li>
            <li> and then before I leave brush fingers or a lightly brush it.</li>
            <li> Great product since I could never curl my hair w/ a regular iron with the clamp..</li>
            <li> One thing I learnt fast: DO NOT use the iron without the glove on!!!</li>
            <li> Very satisfated !!!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product and I can only highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I simply love this product, it is VERY high quality!</li>
            <li> First off, I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s all worth it!</li>
            <li> I have never been able to find a curling iron that works on my naturally straight hair - until now!</li>
            <li> Product arrived way before its scheduled delivery date, well packaged in its original box, with a glove and life time warranty (that has to be initiated by registration, however).</li>
            <li> Plugged it in with a voltage adaptor and it works great, no sparking or anything; Just make sure your adaptor can accommodate the uneven two prong plug.      </li>
            <li> the process is super easy and quick.  </li>
            <li> Curls or waves, depending on how you handle them as they cool.</li>
            <li> The glove is a knitted cotton glove, which is nice to protect you from the insta-burn you could get if the iron went directly on your skin.</li>
            <li> Love the way it curls your hair in nice loose curls.</li>
            <li> I am so glad her daughters introduced this new type of hair tool to me, too!</li>
            <li> Get the real and original clipless iron on here!    </li>
            <li> If you want super bouncy curls, continue to hold the curl as it cools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly -- glove is included.</li>
            <li> dont have your hair wrapped around it for ages, curls super</li>
            <li> Overall very satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> It does get very hot and I have the burn marks to proove it.  </li>
            <li> fast.&lt;br /&gt;It does get very hot</li>
            <li> (I was not exactly familiar with Jose Eber, but the brand in general seems to have really good reviews and seen as a good one with quality items.)    </li>
            <li> and so it is just HOT!</li>
            <li> I kind of wish I would have gotten the 25mm barrel because these curls aren&#x27;t as big as I normally like them to be, but they&#x27;re still really cute.  </li>
            <li> I have had problems in keeping my hair curled being that I have fine, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finally able to get some really nice body in my hair - and finally get curl near the roots!  </li>
            <li> This curling iron is absolutely amazing, and i know I most curling irons end up being a waste of money</li>
            <li> And having a video is useful to know what all you can accomplish.</li>
            <li> The heat doesn&#x27;t bother me, but it did however leave me with two scars on my chest (to which my friends make fun of me and call them hickeys).</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re still there, but the result was so worth it</li>
            <li> and she loved it so much she bought one the next day.</li>
            <li> The curler is a nice one, it only had 1 heat setting.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definately worth it, its my holy grail.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is one of those goods because it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> The iron gets SUPER hot.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it was a GREAT first impression.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit to get used to, but does a wonderful job creating those soft, messy curls that I was looking for!</li>
            <li> This is my first and only wand that I own</li>
            <li> The super hot temperate really sets the curls quickly</li>
            <li> the product had arrived before expected in new I happy with it</li>
            <li> I have very straight, fine hair that normally doesn&#x27;t hold a curl AT ALL,</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous that it wouldn&#x27;t work the same or that it would be defective, but it is INCREDIBLE!</li>
            <li> - This thing is hot, hot, HOT!</li>
            <li> More and more companies are going green and not printing out lengthy instructions.</li>
            <li> It comes with a glove, which was a nice surprise and a necessary accessory because this thing gets really</li>
            <li> I have super straight hair, and it takes a lot to curl it, but this did the job.  </li>
            <li> It heats up super fast so you don&#x27;t have to wait longer than a minute to use it.</li>
            <li> There is no little kick stand or notch that allows it to rest easily on a counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> PRO&#x27;S:  - VERY fast heating up time (</li>
            <li> After seeing their different hairstyles for my cousins wedding, the natural beach wave was my favorite, I knew I had to get in on the new iron!     :)</li>
            <li> Using some curl mousse and about 20 minutes of my time my hair goes from stick straight to curly and stays that way even sleeping on it!</li>
            <li> the iron is supposed to be hot to make your hair do things.</li>
            <li> The Jose Eber iron barrel does not change it is the same size from top to bottom.</li>
            <li> *cough*)</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if the curls will hold up in a more humid climate, will have to test that out later.  </li>
            <li> There are much better ones in the market, do your homework and pick one with multiple settings and the ability to change the size of wand.  </li>
            <li> It really is!)     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easily worth thrice as much.</li>
            <li> Hot iron&#x3D;DO NOT TOUCH.     </li>
            <li> (maybe mine doesn&#x27;t get as hot?), but</li>
            <li> the curls I get with my iron last most of the day.</li>
            <li> I love that it heats up to 350  degrees and do not mind that there is only an on/off switch</li>
            <li> I have used this consistently since my purchase and appreciate how natural(loose curls) and bouncy my hair is with this.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a non clip curling iron.</li>
            <li> but at first its a must have.&lt;br /&gt;Def</li>
            <li> 19mm is perfect for tight curler or beachy waves, depending on how much hair/how long you hold it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t curl my own hair &amp; when other people do, it just falls out within a couple hours.</li>
            <li> So as long as you take care not to shove it on your unprotected skin you should be fine!</li>
            <li> and I live in a super humid climate.</li>
            <li> The staying power is excellent so touch ups are less frequent if you go for multiple days without washing.</li>
            <li> Even being careful, I got burnt very easily -</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t think its worth it for the high price or the burns</li>
            <li> It gets hot really fast</li>
            <li> (Not long ago I bought my first clip iron, the cheap</li>
            <li> It took me a while to get the technique down, but once I did my hair looked amazing.</li>
            <li> The instruction manual says it has a temperature control setting, but the picture on Amazon is pretty accurate, it is only an on/off switch.</li>
            <li> Curling is easy, and the curls do last a while.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron a few weeks ago and I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I was amazed how wonderful it curled my teenage daughters hair because it will normally curl because of how thick and straight it is.</li>
            <li> It holds curls great and it takes me about 20 minutes to do all my hair (I have reasonably long hair), before with my other one it took about an hour.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is exactly what I have been looking for and the curls hold in my hair for alot longer than any other product I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works with the European 240 voltage just fine.</li>
            <li> Grab a chunk of hair, wrap it around the barrel, hold it a few seconds... and voila, tight beautiful curl!</li>
            <li> For me this iron was much easier to use.</li>
            <li> (This isn&#x27;t as much of a con as it is a warning)</li>
            <li> The curling iron heats up fast and curls hair fast.</li>
            <li> and I have stick straight hair.</li>
            <li> I suggest getting this iron if you really want something that lasts.</li>
            <li> I have really straight hair that just never holds curl.  </li>
            <li> and I really couldn&#x27;t change a thing about it.</li>
            <li> and it really works</li>
            <li> I can do my whole head of hair in 10 mins, but if you&#x27;ve never used a curling iron before, the technique may take you some time in the beginning.</li>
            <li> As for the vendor, beware that they are very uncooperative and will charge a \\&quot;restocking fee\\&quot; if you try to return.  </li>
            <li> I do highly suggest the iron still!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> second one I&#x27;ve purchased and it makes my hair look fantastic.</li>
            <li> but with short hair I get fantastic waves.</li>
            <li> Recently I tried curling my hair with a regular barrel and decided it wasn&#x27;t worth my time, my Jose Eber wand is much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SO much cheaper to buy it off here.</li>
            <li> I, a grown adult, can finally make my hair look cute like all the TV stars.  </li>
            <li> Been using it for a few years now and everyone asks how I get my hair to look so nice and curly.</li>
            <li> , i don&#x27;t want to add any more heat damage to my hair, but for those bad hair days and when my perm is fading, or for those special nights out - i&#x27;m so glad i now have a curling iron to rely on!</li>
            <li> Just be careful, this baby gets HOT and its easy to burn yourself.</li>
            <li> My mall tries to sell this same type of iron (different brand however) for 4x the price, and let me tell you, it isn&#x27;t anywhere as good!</li>
            <li> It is a bit of a learning curve to properly curl your hair, especially the back, but once you get the hang of it, it is amazing!    </li>
            <li> This is my second José Eber Curling Iron (My first one was stolen at a friends house, sadly) and let me just say, it is FANTASTIC!!!!!</li>
            <li> A lot of youtube videos were showing me completely different ways to do it, that&#x27;s how i originally started off.</li>
            <li> Very simple, straightforward, no fuss.</li>
            <li> Nice curls that will last a long time in my very fine/thin hair.</li>
            <li> My intention was to \\&quot;test-drive it\\&quot; and find out what I liked and disliked about it, as to be better informed on what to look for in a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> It heats up fairly quickly, although there is no indicator to tell you when its ready, only an on/off switch.</li>
            <li> i think gives you good versatility - if you want larger curls/waves just use larger sections of hair and for tighter curls, use smaller sections of hair.</li>
            <li> , I was kind of skeptical because I have never had a curling iron that does what I want- make pretty curls that hold and that curl quickly.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT, everyone loves it too and cant believe how much less I paid than the mall kiosks.</li>
            <li> I chose this particular curling iron for these reasons:    </li>
            <li> All in all a decent wand.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, makes great curls in less than 5 seconds per strand, that last and last and last.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but this is exactly what I wanted and more!</li>
            <li> The glove is nice but hard to grab hair with it.  </li>
            <li> I love this curling iron and you should get it if you have trouble curling you hair.</li>
            <li> I have normal hair and it takes me 45-60 minutes to do my hair</li>
            <li> My Herstyler took forever to get a curl, normally fell out 1/2 way throughout night</li>
            <li> - Anyone can master this tool  - Leaves hair looking soft and shiny, not crunchy  - Professional salon quality  - No CLIP!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t remember.)but any other glove worked fine for me.     </li>
            <li> The only negative is that it is super hot and you can easily burn yourself.  </li>
            <li> your right side (or non-dominant side) switch hands and hold the iron in your left hand-</li>
            <li> and my hair gets put through the ringer -- it&#x27;s naturally straight, dark, flat, hard-to-curl and very fine, so i get a perm once a year for volume and also get color/highlights.  </li>
            <li> Both my girls have super long hair and we are always looking for new styles and curls.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but even after sleeping on my curls with absolutely no product, they were still wavy and beautiful!</li>
            <li> I found the EXACT same curling iron on here for a sixth of the price!</li>
            <li> It gets so hot that you only have to hold it on each piece for 3-5 seconds: saves a lot of time!!</li>
            <li> The only con I can talk about is that it&#x27;s REALLY hot.</li>
            <li> it was also more affordable online than other, similar curling irons (enzo milano, etc).</li>
            <li> This item gets so scalding hot that it will burn you instantly if it comes in contact with your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is dual voltage, especially since we do have 220 volts at home, but travel often enough that we take always buy multi-voltage, especially for products like these.</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl.</li>
            <li> Funny, my cheap test iron wound up costing only a bit less than my definitive one.)     </li>
            <li> And of course, whenever a curl comes too tight for your taste, smooth it a couple of times with your hand</li>
            <li> It worked really well, but before I spent that much on it, I wanted to do some research.</li>
            <li> It takes 10 minutes to curl the whole head and it lasts until the next wash.</li>
            <li> I was deciding after my old Herstyler broke,  between the Herstyler curling wand I have had or the Jose Eber.</li>
            <li> My old cheap drug store curling iron would curl my hair but they would go limp almost immediately and that would happen with hair spray too.</li>
            <li> i also wished it came with a carry/travel bag to store it when you don&#x27;t have time to wait for it to cool down.   </li>
            <li> I got plenty of complements, and you&#x27;re pretty much in control whether you want springy curls or just a slight wave.</li>
            <li> It was in excellent condition and the only complaint that I have is that I have a hard time being coordinated enough to use it on myself.</li>
            <li> It seems intimidating, but as long as you switch hands and hold it in your left when doing your right side, you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that the curls lasted almost all day on my very long, straight hair.</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly and packed tightly.</li>
            <li> Curling iron is an absolute hit with my daughter, much more expensive in Australia than what was purchased for on Amazon.</li>
            <li> That is how I got a burn, from trying to hold it in my right hand and still point it down and twist.  </li>
            <li> The glove does resist the heat, however, it won&#x27;t completely protect your fingers if you hold directly on the iron or near the iron for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> and I have no other problems with this curling iron.</li>
            <li> My hair seriously NEVER holds curl for a long period of time.  </li>
            <li> For your left side hold it in your right hand, glove-up your left hand and wind a bit of hair starting at the middle of the iron.  </li>
            <li> With this Jose Eber iron and short You Yube tutorial by a 12 year old...</li>
            <li> I received this product much sooner than i expected.  </li>
            <li> Curling my hair taking six minutes because I do larger sections and my hair naturally holds a curl</li>
            <li> (Yes, I got the pink version, but it&#x27;s the exact same iron as this one.)    </li>
            <li> hair is pretty thick and takes time to style but with this it&#x27;s really fast.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I can curl my hair one day, have soft waves the next and use the texture to create a bun on the third day.</li>
            <li> If you have been one of those people deciding if it&#x27;s really worth getting, splurge a little and get it!</li>
            <li> She has long, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It takes maybe 5-8 seconds to create a tight bouncy curl, but only like 3 to get a pretty wave.</li>
            <li> My hair is really fine &amp; honestly never holds curl, but this iron has been wonders!</li>
            <li> i do find that using the glove will slow me down -- but it does help you stay safe.</li>
            <li> - it does have a small, kind of built-in one, but it&#x27;s not enough and sometimes i have a hard time keeping it from sliding off the counter.</li>
            <li> I have never been good at using a curling iron but hated my straight hair.</li>
            <li> Hold it for for a few seconds and slide the iron out (which is really easy because the iron is slick and the only thing holding your hair in place is tension that you supply).  </li>
            <li> My only complaint with the iron is that it gets ridiculously hot.</li>
            <li> when i try for larger waves, it usually lasts until the end of the day before it really loosens up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really amazing!!!!My hair usually don&#x27;t get curly, even at beauty salons people who try to curl my hair</li>
            <li> Leaves hair shiny and the curls are long lasting.</li>
            <li> My iron doesn&#x27;t seem to make curls that last quite as long as her jose eber did</li>
            <li> the price was \\&quot;$100 marked down from $150\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> so it takes far less time to style.</li>
            <li> (i have experienced a bad burn with a curling iron in the past</li>
            <li> Also the curling iron has a long cord, and the iron comes with a glove for you finger protection.    </li>
            <li> i have long hair and the 19mm</li>
            <li> This iron allows me to curl my hair, sleep on it and wear it again the next day with minimal maintenance.</li>
            <li> I did not put hair spray on it and the curls stayed curled all day long.</li>
            <li> but hey, one look at the naked barrel and that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> There is no temperature adjustment, the only option is \\&quot;very hot\\&quot;, so if you have fragile thin hair, keep that in mind...</li>
            <li> The glove does have long fingers, but protects my hand when I&#x27;m using this iron.</li>
            <li> So I wear a long sleeve shirt when I curl my hair.</li>
            <li> (I have really long hair) &amp; it stays for two-three days if I don&#x27;t brush it or wash it.</li>
            <li> It is harder to use with my short hair and the curls</li>
            <li> do not stay in long</li>
            <li> if you have fragile or thin hair, it might be too hot for you      </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t burned anything except for my finger, which left a little mark for about a day, but my friend and sister grazed their face and neck and it left a burn mark that turned into a scab and eventually fell off, so</li>
            <li> I recieved the iron 2 days earlier than I expected!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experimented yet, but I&#x27;m sure you can use anywhere from thin strands of hair for a spiral look, to thick chunks for looser waves.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for medium to long length hair though, you will get different curls than a typical curling iron.</li>
            <li> From first impression opening the box, it looks like it&#x27;s poor quality and not a legit product.  </li>
            <li> I can now have curly hair in less than 10 mins, the curls last,and last.</li>
            <li> This product is not very good and it does not have different setting which means that you will always use the same temperature and therefore your hair will be damaged faster.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed and so happy because I am tired of being disappointed with cheap curling irons and curlers that require an obscene amount of time and spray for mediocre results.   </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair that typically doesn&#x27;t curl with a normal curling iron.</li>
            <li> I am a low maintenance person, so I hate spending time doing my hair, but this curling iron actually gets the job done quickly and the curls actually stay curled.   </li>
            <li> Just be careful not to burn your hand.</li>
            <li> Just be careful if you don&#x27;t use the glove, you may get burnt.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this curling iron, especially if you have thick straight Hispanic hair like me or if you don&#x27;t want to spend all morning desperately trying to get your hair to behave.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this rather than waste $200 on practically the same product.</li>
            <li> - pink handle,</li>
            <li> and they stay with the use of minimal product.  </li>
            <li> Jose Eber Curling Iron, Pink, 25mm]]</li>
            <li> ..just be careful when you use it.  </li>
            <li> I was initially saving up for an Enzo Milano when I came across this curling iron for less than $30!</li>
            <li> The first couple of times its awkward especially getting use to the glove, but now I can do it in 20 min.</li>
            <li> so be careful!  </li>
            <li> So be careful when handling!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to use for the first time.</li>
            <li> other con is that it is roly.  </li>
            <li> the amount of friction and resistance didn&#x27;t seem right), it left ugly creases on my hair.</li>
            <li> It was a little difficult to use the first time, but with continued used, It should get easier.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I burned my hands a couple times so I would recommend you buy the glove too.</li>
            <li> I have thin, soft, silky hair...</li>
            <li> i can now throw out all other curling irons after getting this!</li>
            <li> To my surprise I found that the very same product an Amazon retailer sells for less than $70, retails for $200 on the Jose Eber website!!!</li>
            <li> It just looks like a mess then.</li>
            <li> hair type is thin (but plentiful), wavy (almost curly hair) and generally quite frizzy..  </li>
            <li> it leaves really tight curls, without even using any product.  </li>
            <li> It curls my hair and with a little hair spray, being that I do not use any products in my hair, my curls kept all night.  </li>
            <li> So a little bit of a pain.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble curling my hair with clamps.</li>
            <li> I have misplaced the glove that came with it, (</li>
            <li> cons are that the glove will still allow you to get burned if you touch the iron longer than a few seconds.</li>
            <li> The glove is also a little too big for me and my hands are not dainty.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was getting so annoyed about this because it is extremely difficult for me to curl (my hair does NOT curl), that i almost returned it.</li>
            <li> My hair is already straight and it has always been very difficult to get/keep any curls in it.</li>
            <li> Then, my mom showed me how to do it; you have to take extremely small pieces of your hair, separate them on the iron, twist and go all the way up to your head.</li>
            <li> Will update once used to test function, but I&#x27;m not confident I&#x27;ll be keeping it.</li>
            <li> I hate regular curling irons - forever leaving weird lines in my hair, not curling exactly how I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I knew right off the bat that I hated the clip; not only I found difficult to slide my hair through it (</li>
            <li> if I did get one at least, it was a while ago.</li>
            <li> It is inevitable with this item.&lt;br /&gt;Wrapping the hair around the wand is awkward using the protective glove.  </li>
            <li> However, it will not fully protect you from a burn so just exercise a bit of common sense.</li>
            <li> It does take her about 40-50 minutes to do as she has quite thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I feel motivated now to do my hair in the morning because I know it won&#x27;t be a frustrating waste of time.</li>
            <li> (I knew that my 1.5\\&quot; by Revlon was way too thick.</li>
            <li> I have thick, course, color treated hair and NOTHING would keep my curls.</li>
            <li> But if you dont, it&#x27;s probably going to end up looking ridiculous.</li>
            <li> ends of my hair would look ridiculous.</li>
            <li> While using the Revlon iron was very difficult, and the resulting curls were quite flat, this one was a dream!</li>
            <li> in fact I&#x27;m pretty terrible.  </li>
            <li> I mean it!</li>
            <li> Be careful when using this and try and wear the glove at all times, I have a permanent scar on my wrist from this thing, and it will burn you really bad</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve bought quite a few and the results always always disappointed me.</li>
            <li> but this curling iron was difficult for me to use.</li>
            <li> It is difficult because there is no clip on the iron making it difficult to wrap the ends of your hair without getting burned.</li>
            <li> Everyone knows about that evil kink you get at the end when you use a regular clamping curling iron, and for some reason I always ended up getting that whenever I curled my hair.</li>
            <li> iron heats up in mere seconds.</li>
            <li> needless to say</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical about this product.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a glove, but it&#x27;s like twice the size of my hand, so it&#x27;s useless.  </li>
            <li> (I feel sorry for anyone not doing research and paying that price).</li>
            <li> you should keep reminding yourself that these curling irons are dangerous machines, remember to treat it that way and don&#x27;t be too careless when you use</li>
            <li> complain that my hair are too silky and it&#x27;s almost impossible to curl them.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Totally love this curling wand.  They sell this wand here locally for $150, but I totally got a steal deal buying it via Amazon!!!  Curling wand gets really hot, but totally love the curls!!!!</li>
            <li> First off, I love this curling iron. It is amazing! Using some curl mousse and about 20 minutes of my time my hair goes from stick straight to curly and stays that way even sleeping on it! I&#x27;ve never been able to manage getting my hair to do anything let alone hold a curl, so I have been really happy with this curling iron so far. It gets hot really fast, it&#x27;s easy to hold and it comes with a heat glove so you don&#x27;t burn your hands.    For those who say it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions - it comes with a card that says to go online to watch a video on how to use it. More and more companies are going green and not printing out lengthy instructions. And having a video is useful to know what all you can accomplish. Or go to Youtube and search the curling iron and people post their own instructional videos.    My only complaint with the iron is that it gets ridiculously hot. There is no heat control and so it is just HOT! I burned the side of my face with it (my own fault, not the irons, I&#x27;m a klutz) but the iron is supposed to be hot to make your hair do things. So as long as you take care not to shove it on your unprotected skin you should be fine!</li>
            <li> I bough a different version of this curling iron a couple of years ago. I bought the Herstyle from the mall and paid aboutt $150. I think I&#x27;m pretty good at doing hair but this curling iron was difficult for me to use. I returned it after trying over and over again. I had a problem with the ends of the hair looking fried. It is difficult because there is no clip on the iron making it difficult to wrap the ends of your hair without getting burned. I really liked how the curled looked with the exception of the ends. Both my girls have super long hair and we are always looking for new styles and curls. I tried the Jose Eber curling iron and thought it was much better and easier to use. I realized the iron itself is shaped different. The Herstyle  iron barrel narrows as you get to the end of the barrel and the hair slipped off the iron for me. The Jose Eber iron barrel does not change it is the same size from top to bottom. For me this iron was much easier to use. They give you a glove that helps with the ends of the hair so you don&#x27;t burn yourself (so did the Herstyle) but the ends of the hair did not looked fried. I do both my girls hair and the curls look great and maintain the entire day. I&#x27;m Happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I saw this curling iron at the mall and it was selling for $250. It worked really well, but before I spent that much on it, I wanted to do some research. I AM SO HAPPY THAT I DID! I found the EXACT same curling iron on here for a sixth of the price! I was a little nervous that it wouldn&#x27;t work the same or that it would be defective, but it is INCREDIBLE! The curls are flawless and they will stay for 3 days. I recommend this to everyone. Just be careful not to burn your hand. USE the GLOVE!</li>
            <li> I love it! it takes some getting used to if you are coming from an iron with a clamp, but it works great. It gets so hot that you only have to hold it on each piece for 3-5 seconds: saves a lot of time!!</li>
            <li> I bought this iron for my daughter and we love it! Leaves hair shiny and the curls are long lasting. Simply amazing!</li>
            <li> This is my second José Eber Curling Iron (My first one was stolen at a friends house, sadly) and let me just say, it is FANTASTIC!!!!! For ANYONE who is curling challenged (*cough* ME *cough*) this thing is easy as 1-2-3! It creates those perfect curls that other irons can&#x27;t compete with, or you can make sexy beach waves! I simply love this product, it is VERY high quality! My hair does not hold curls, and with this iron I don&#x27;t use any product (besides a heat protectant) and the curls stay for days. My mall tries to sell this same type of iron (different brand however) for 4x the price, and let me tell you, it isn&#x27;t anywhere as good! Get the real and original clipless iron on here!    PRO&#x27;S:  - VERY fast heating up time (BEWARE, IT GETS HOTT!!! I have scars from it burning me)  - Anyone can master this tool  - Leaves hair looking soft and shiny, not crunchy  - Professional salon quality  - No CLIP!!! so not dents on the hair  - Swivel cord    CON&#x27;S:  - This thing is hot, hot, HOT! (This isn&#x27;t as much of a con as it is a warning) Be careful when using this and try and wear the glove at all times, I have a permanent scar on my wrist from this thing, and it will burn you really bad so be careful!  - No temperature setting, so if you have fragile or thin hair, it might be too hot for you      So as you can see, the pros outweigh the cons. If you have been one of those people deciding if it&#x27;s really worth getting, splurge a little and get it! It really is easy and quick, and you&#x27;ll thank yourself later for getting this great tool!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a curling iron that can handle my amazingly heavy, frizzy,and straight hair, and I found it. Thank you LORD! I can now have curly hair in less than 10 mins, the curls last,and last. I love it. The curling iron heats up fast and curls hair fast. What more would you want? Also the curling iron has a long cord, and the iron comes with a glove for you finger protection.    Love this amazing curling iron!</li>
            <li> My hair NEVER curls, this curls it and holds the curl all day/night. Even still wavy the next day, Best hair tool i&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I have never been good at using a curling iron but hated my straight hair. I have used this about 10 times and its amazing! The first couple of times its awkward especially getting use to the glove, but now I can do it in 20 min. I curled my hair one morning before school and when i got home at 5:30 after track it was still curly!  Tip: if you want wavy hair brush it out, it doesn&#x27;t fall out once you brush it.</li>
            <li> I have stick-straight hair that will not hold a curl, even with all the product available. I got sucked into allowing one of the mall kiosk guys to demonstrate this iron on my hair. I was skeptical, but even after sleeping on my curls with absolutely no product, they were still wavy and beautiful! I found it for a much better price on Amazon and just had to have it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble curling my hair with clamps. Everyone knows about that evil kink you get at the end when you use a regular clamping curling iron, and for some reason I always ended up getting that whenever I curled my hair. To this day, I still don&#x27;t use any of my clamping curling irons even with the Jose Eber Curling iron.     Let me tell you, I am in LOVE with this curling iron. It is the best hair styling tool I have ever gotten. No matter whose curling irons I use, I always end up coming back to mine because it works so well with my hair. The curls last all day and I have stick straight hair. (Asian genes) I haven&#x27;t tried sleeping with them because I have oily hair but I do know that when I take a nap for hours, they turn into softer waves.    I absolutely recommend getting this curling iron if you&#x27;re looking for a good clampless curling iron. I have misplaced the glove that came with it, (if I did get one at least, it was a while ago. Can&#x27;t remember.)but any other glove worked fine for me.     The only con I can talk about is that it&#x27;s REALLY hot. That&#x27;s good if you need a lot of heat to keep your curls, but it would be nice if it could be adjusted. The heat doesn&#x27;t bother me, but it did however leave me with two scars on my chest (to which my friends make fun of me and call them hickeys). It&#x27;s been a year and they&#x27;re still there, but the result was so worth it and I have no other problems with this curling iron. Absolute wonderful product. Plus, you save a lot of money. :) A year ago I bought this curling iron as a curling iron newbie, and now I am a master at curling away people&#x27;s hair. I suggest getting this iron if you really want something that lasts.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item through Amazon.com. The item arrived quickly and packed tightly. Excellent service/no problems with the order. This curling iron comes with a heat resistant glove. It heats up fairly quickly, although there is no indicator to tell you when its ready, only an on/off switch. It was a little difficult to use the first time, but with continued used, It should get easier. I was pleasantly surprised that the curls lasted almost all day on my very long, straight hair. I used chi oil in my hair prior to curling. Overall very satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my oldest daughter (24) for her birthday.  Every time she uses it she gets loads of compliments!  She has long, naturally curly hair.  When she uses the iron, her hair falls in lovely finger waves.  The curls last two days. It does take her about 40-50 minutes to do as she has quite thick hair.  Her sister (21) loves it too and I&#x27;m planning on getting her an iron for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I didnt like that it didnt have the clip to curl and also it was only one temperature. At first, I was getting so annoyed about this because it is extremely difficult for me to curl (my hair does NOT curl), that i almost returned it. Then, my mom showed me how to do it; you have to take extremely small pieces of your hair, separate them on the iron, twist and go all the way up to your head. A lot of youtube videos were showing me completely different ways to do it, that&#x27;s how i originally started off. AND IT DID NOT WORK. DONT start from your ends and go halfway up. It just looks like a mess then. If you have the time and you know what to do, go for it. But if you dont, it&#x27;s probably going to end up looking ridiculous.</li>
            <li> This is the best curling iron I have ever used! It took me a while to get the technique down, but once I did my hair looked amazing. The curls stayed in until I washed my hair again 2 days later. I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> I have really straight hair that just never holds curl.  But this iron is amazing...it leaves really tight curls, without even using any product.  It comes with a glove, which was a nice surprise and a necessary accessory because this thing gets really hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take away one star for difficulty of use, since there is no clip, you have to hand wind your hair, and it can be a challenge not to burn yourself.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron a few weeks ago and I absolutely LOVE it! My friend recommended it to me and said it worked great, I was kind of skeptical because I have never had a curling iron that does what I want- make pretty curls that hold and that curl quickly. Her curled hair always looked great so I decided to get this. It has been amazing and I really couldn&#x27;t change a thing about it. It holds curls great and it takes me about 20 minutes to do all my hair (I have reasonably long hair), before with my other one it took about an hour. As soon as I used it, I got so many compliments and I curled a friends hair and she loved it so much she bought one the next day. I&#x27;ve also curled it and then slept on it and it just makes looser waves that you can wear or re-curl, both look great. I haven&#x27;t burned anything except for my finger, which left a little mark for about a day, but my friend and sister grazed their face and neck and it left a burn mark that turned into a scab and eventually fell off, so when you use it pay attention because if you accidentally touch your face or neck it can burn you. Just make sure to wear the heat protective glove that is included(I wasn&#x27;t wearing it when I burned my finger). Overall, this curling iron is amazing!! I am convinced that it is the best curling iron in the world, definitely a good investment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who thought some of the cheaper, drugstore curling irons would be just as good - but I&#x27;ve bought quite a few and the results always always disappointed me. so I decided to shell out the $$ for a jose eber curling iron on ebay- but am sharing my review here.   i can now throw out all other curling irons after getting this! iron heats up in mere seconds. it was also more affordable online than other, similar curling irons (enzo milano, etc). and it really works like they say - creates a great-looking, shiny curl that doesn&#x27;t look \\&quot;fried\\&quot; or crimped!!  now everyone&#x27;s hair is different. and my hair gets put through the ringer -- it&#x27;s naturally straight, dark, flat, hard-to-curl and very fine, so i get a perm once a year for volume and also get color/highlights.  needless to say, i don&#x27;t want to add any more heat damage to my hair, but for those bad hair days and when my perm is fading, or for those special nights out - i&#x27;m so glad i now have a curling iron to rely on! my processed hair sometimes looks healthier after i use the curling iron! just buy a good thermal protecting spray and setting lotion. i have long hair and the 19mm i think gives you good versatility - if you want larger curls/waves just use larger sections of hair and for tighter curls, use smaller sections of hair. when i try for larger waves, it usually lasts until the end of the day before it really loosens up. tighter curls/waves can sometimes last up to 1 1/2 to 2 days for me. don&#x27;t know if the curls will hold up in a more humid climate, will have to test that out later.  I can do my whole head of hair in 10 mins, but if you&#x27;ve never used a curling iron before, the technique may take you some time in the beginning. i do find that using the glove will slow me down -- but it does help you stay safe. (i have experienced a bad burn with a curling iron in the past so i am ultra paranoid with this one). you should keep reminding yourself that these curling irons are dangerous machines, remember to treat it that way and don&#x27;t be too careless when you use or you WILL accidentally burn yourself.   one downside is that I wished this had a \\&quot;kickstand\\&quot; - it does have a small, kind of built-in one, but it&#x27;s not enough and sometimes i have a hard time keeping it from sliding off the counter. i also wished it came with a carry/travel bag to store it when you don&#x27;t have time to wait for it to cool down.   but all in all GREAT product!!!</li>
            <li> This product is not very good and it does not have different setting which means that you will always use the same temperature and therefore your hair will be damaged faster.  There are much better ones in the market, do your homework and pick one with multiple settings and the ability to change the size of wand.  As for the vendor, beware that they are very uncooperative and will charge a \\&quot;restocking fee\\&quot; if you try to return.  I would never use them again.</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised and I am glad I purchased it.  It does get very hot and I have the burn marks to proove it.  I&#x27;m very glad I purchased it from Amazon vs the mall.  At the mall the price was \\&quot;$100 marked down from $150\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is amazing. It leaves bouncy curls that last days. I have long, thick, wavy hair that typically doesn&#x27;t curl with a normal curling iron. This iron allows me to curl my hair, sleep on it and wear it again the next day with minimal maintenance. It&#x27;s fantastic. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it, especially for the price it can be found for on Amazon. Just be careful if you don&#x27;t use the glove, you may get burnt.</li>
            <li> This curling iron curls all types of hair. The curls can even last 2-3 days! I love this curling iron and you should get it if you have trouble curling you hair. It takes some time to get use to it but once you got the hang of it your able to do any type of hair styles. I have normal hair and it takes me 45-60 minutes to do my hair but it&#x27;s all worth it!</li>
            <li> This item gets so scalding hot that it will burn you instantly if it comes in contact with your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have been burned on my face, neck and fingers. It is inevitable with this item.&lt;br /&gt;Wrapping the hair around the wand is awkward using the protective glove.  I see no reason why it was not designed with a clamp to hold the tress of hair to the barrel.  It does make a nice curl, but.. I do HEAR my hair sizzle.&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t think its worth it for the high price or the burns</li>
            <li> The curler is a nice one, it only had 1 heat setting.  If you need a glove, purchase one separately.  This glove does nothing to help resist the heat on your hand.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but this is exactly what I wanted and more! :) I am VERY pleased with this curling \\&quot;wand\\&quot;. It does get very hot, too! So be careful when handling! The glove does resist the heat, however, it won&#x27;t completely protect your fingers if you hold directly on the iron or near the iron for long periods of time. I do highly suggest the iron still! I love the ringlet-style, the wavy-style, and the natural-style curls this iron can do! I am sure there are plenty more styles to try still! I can&#x27;t wait!!!    My aunt is a hairstylist and actually recommended this type of curling iron, too! I am so glad her daughters introduced this new type of hair tool to me, too! After seeing their different hairstyles for my cousins wedding, the natural beach wave was my favorite, I knew I had to get in on the new iron!     :)</li>
            <li> the product had arrived before expected in new I happy with it but i haven&#x27;t try it yet to see if it works well</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST curling iron I have ever used in my life. I first saw it in a mall kiosk and tried it on my hair and it worked amazingly. I have super straight hair, and it takes a lot to curl it, but this did the job.  It lasts through brushes, sleeping on it, almost anything. I curled my hair one day, and it lasted 3 days still looking amazing. It takes maybe 5-8 seconds to create a tight bouncy curl, but only like 3 to get a pretty wave. I definately recommend this to anyone who wants a good culing iron. It&#x27;s definately worth it, its my holy grail.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was recommended to me by another co-worker.  I have had problems in keeping my hair curled being that I have fine, straight hair.  But this product is amazing.  It curls my hair and with a little hair spray, being that I do not use any products in my hair, my curls kept all night.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife, she is very happy with it and also for my mother in law. Also very happy with that thing</li>
            <li> Ladies, there comes a point in our lives where we have to stop buying cheap products and invest in quality goods. This curling iron is one of those goods because it&#x27;s worth the money. I am a low maintenance person, so I hate spending time doing my hair, but this curling iron actually gets the job done quickly and the curls actually stay curled.   My old cheap drug store curling iron would curl my hair but they would go limp almost immediately and that would happen with hair spray too. I actually tested this curling iron yesterday afternoon and it curled my hair beautifully. I did not put hair spray on it and the curls stayed curled all day long. I was amazed and so happy because I am tired of being disappointed with cheap curling irons and curlers that require an obscene amount of time and spray for mediocre results.   I feel motivated now to do my hair in the morning because I know it won&#x27;t be a frustrating waste of time. I would absolutely recommend this curling iron, especially if you have thick straight Hispanic hair like me or if you don&#x27;t want to spend all morning desperately trying to get your hair to behave.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipless curling iron after trying my friends.  I love it!  It is very easy to use and creates awesome curls.</li>
            <li> Curling iron is an absolute hit with my daughter, much more expensive in Australia than what was purchased for on Amazon. Fantastic price, great item and all the women in the house love it.</li>
            <li> I love this iron , it give  me a real  hair fashion  by my own hand , it is fantastic . It was my best investment.</li>
            <li> This curling wand is amazing! It curls so quickly, but most importantly, it HOLDS my curl! My hair has never held a curl for more than a couple of hours, but with this curling wand, it will hold the curl for 2 days! I always get tons of compliments on my hair, when I curl it with the wand :) Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I was initially saving up for an Enzo Milano when I came across this curling iron for less than $30! I have to say I&#x27;m super happy I decided to buy this rather than waste $200 on practically the same product. I recieved the iron 2 days earlier than I expected! It heats up super fast so you don&#x27;t have to wait longer than a minute to use it. My only complaint is that I burned my hands a couple times so I would recommend you buy the glove too. But I think that after using more often I won&#x27;t burn myself anymore. I&#x27;m really happy with the way it left my hair so I would definitely recommend this product to everyone!! I really loved it and its the best hair styling tool I&#x27;ve bought since I got a Chi straightener. It&#x27;s a must buy (especially at this price)!!!</li>
            <li> SO AMAZING. I tried the enzo milano and this beats it! Definitely worth buying. Came with a heat protectant glove and lifetime warranty!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought for me the same curling iron, but 13mm. It&#x27;s really amazing!!!!My hair usually don&#x27;t get curly, even at beauty salons people who try to curl my hair complain that my hair are too silky and it&#x27;s almost impossible to curl them. I bought so many irons which supposed to be really good, but didn&#x27;t work out.I gave them away. But with my new curling iron i have no problems at all, my curles look so beautiful and keep holding!!!</li>
            <li> I hate regular curling irons - forever leaving weird lines in my hair, not curling exactly how I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is amazing.  Yes, the glove isn&#x27;t the best in terms of heat-resistance but I&#x27;m an adult, I can work around it! :D  I&#x27;m finally able to get some really nice body in my hair - and finally get curl near the roots!  And at $40?  It&#x27;s a steal!  I&#x27;m not just saying that either :D</li>
            <li> The best curler I&#x27;ve ever used ,Because it&#x27;s really curled my hair amazingly &amp;#34;thank god I found something can curl my hair hhhhh&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have never been able to find a curling iron that works on my naturally straight hair - until now! I do have to put product in it, and LOADS of hairspray, but this curling wand is the best of the best.  Just be careful, this baby gets HOT and its easy to burn yourself.</li>
            <li> i hope i take 25 to wavy look :)</li>
            <li> Love the way it curls your hair in nice loose curls. My daughter loved this and now she&#x27;s doing my hair too. Thank u again for a great christmas gift</li>
            <li> Delivered quick; quality of the curling iron was fantastic; the results of the hair styles from this curling iron have been awesome; and most importantly, it was a great price...Beats the heck out of paying the money for the same ones in the islands of the local malls.</li>
            <li> Curls hair quickly and creates excellent curls, but beware that it can burn!  i burnt my neck while using it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to use for the first time. the iron become very hot quickly and make wonderful curls. very cheap price.</li>
            <li> Good curling iron wand, glove was included...I didn&#x27;t see that in the amazon description when I ordered it so I ordered a separate glove as well..&lt;br /&gt;But the product is very good. I use it Europe at the moment and works fine on the 220 volt here</li>
            <li> Love the wand and this brand is one that I can always trust. Works well and is a must have.</li>
            <li> I chose this particular curling iron for these reasons:    - it was dual-voltage (110-220V). That excluded most everything else.    - it was clipless. (Not long ago I bought my first clip iron, the cheap [[ASIN:B000NNBLUM Revlon Ceramic Curling Iron - 1.5&#x27;&#x27;]]. My intention was to \\&quot;test-drive it\\&quot; and find out what I liked and disliked about it, as to be better informed on what to look for in a more expensive one. I knew right off the bat that I hated the clip; not only I found difficult to slide my hair through it (the amount of friction and resistance didn&#x27;t seem right), it left ugly creases on my hair. Maybe there is a better technique that will leave your hair smooth all over, but I didn&#x27;t intuitively find it.)    - the brand. (I was not exactly familiar with Jose Eber, but the brand in general seems to have really good reviews and seen as a good one with quality items.)    - the barrel size. (I knew that my 1.5\\&quot; by Revlon was way too thick. I trusted the review by \\&quot;MDLC\\&quot;, who wrote that 19\\&quot; was the perfect barrel size. (Thank you! It really is!)     - the price. (Nothing about this item suggests that it only cost $36, including shipping. The quality, the fancy box it came in, the gloves included... did I mention the quality? It&#x27;s easily worth thrice as much. Funny, my cheap test iron wound up costing only a bit less than my definitive one.)     - pink handle, anyone? (Yes, I got the pink version, but it&#x27;s the exact same iron as this one.)    So far I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it was a GREAT first impression. While using the Revlon iron was very difficult, and the resulting curls were quite flat, this one was a dream! Grab a chunk of hair, wrap it around the barrel, hold it a few seconds... and voila, tight beautiful curl! Very easy and fun to do. I haven&#x27;t experimented yet, but I&#x27;m sure you can use anywhere from thin strands of hair for a spiral look, to thick chunks for looser waves. And of course, whenever a curl comes too tight for your taste, smooth it a couple of times with your hand and it&#x27;s softer.    One thing I learnt fast: DO NOT use the iron without the glove on!!! Even being careful, I got burnt very easily - but hey, one look at the naked barrel and that&#x27;s to be expected. I&#x27;m just hoping never to burn my wrist (that looks very likely) but we shall see.     There is no temperature adjustment, the only option is \\&quot;very hot\\&quot;, so if you have fragile thin hair, keep that in mind... It&#x27;s no problem for me.     Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is the best thing I have ever used on my hair.  It gives me the curls I have always wanted and they stay with the use of minimal product.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This curler works better than any curler I have ever tried. It takes 10 minutes to curl the whole head and it lasts until the next wash. 19mm is perfect for tight curler or beachy waves, depending on how much hair/how long you hold it.</li>
            <li> Best curling iron by far - ever. Curls last 2-3 days (when you don&#x27;t wash your hair). Regular curling irons only last 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li> Excellent and a great price and Auto-voltage 110 and 220</li>
            <li> Super quick postage and great quality.&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy with this product. I recommend it. However it needs an adaptor for Australian power points.</li>
            <li> So... I have never been good at doing my hair... in fact I&#x27;m pretty terrible.  With this Jose Eber iron and short You Yube tutorial by a 12 year old... I, a grown adult, can finally make my hair look cute like all the TV stars.  Yay!  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.  It is very easy to use and the perfect size for Selena Gomez curls.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This gives quick, beautiful, consistent results. Curls or waves, depending on how you handle them as they cool. I&#x27;ve had a similar-sized curling iron with a clip but I never use them because results aren&#x27;t consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros of the design are that YOU control the tool.  Unlike traditional irons  the process is super easy and quick.  For your left side hold it in your right hand, glove-up your left hand and wind a bit of hair starting at the middle of the iron.  Hold it for for a few seconds and slide the iron out (which is really easy because the iron is slick and the only thing holding your hair in place is tension that you supply).  If you want super bouncy curls, continue to hold the curl as it cools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For your right side (or non-dominant side) switch hands and hold the iron in your left hand- just do it.  Otherwise you will fumble and burn yourself. That is how I got a burn, from trying to hold it in my right hand and still point it down and twist.  Once you switch hands, it&#x27;s easy to adjust to the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are that the glove will still allow you to get burned if you touch the iron longer than a few seconds. The glove is also a little too big for me and my hands are not dainty.  It makes picking out hair challenging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other con is that it is roly.  There is no little kick stand or notch that allows it to rest easily on a counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you have struggled with getting a wavy/curly look with curling irons, this is for you.  It seems intimidating, but as long as you switch hands and hold it in your left when doing your right side, you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair type is thin (but plentiful), wavy (almost curly hair) and generally quite frizzy..  The 19mm size is almost the size of my waves.  I&#x27;ve also just ordered the [[ASIN:B002LE8P82 Jose Eber Curling Iron, Pink, 25mm]] for looser, beachier waves.</li>
            <li> This iron was priced below others with similar features. I went with this one and am so glad I did! The glove does have long fingers, but protects my hand when I&#x27;m using this iron. It takes a bit to get used to, but does a wonderful job creating those soft, messy curls that I was looking for!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is great! It is a bit of a learning curve to properly curl your hair, especially the back, but once you get the hang of it, it is amazing!    The glove is a knitted cotton glove, which is nice to protect you from the insta-burn you could get if the iron went directly on your skin. However, it will not fully protect you from a burn so just exercise a bit of common sense. Hot iron&#x3D;DO NOT TOUCH.     The instruction manual says it has a temperature control setting, but the picture on Amazon is pretty accurate, it is only an on/off switch. Would have been nice to have a temperature control, but for the price, I certainly will not complain.     I love the fact that it is dual voltage, especially since we do have 220 volts at home, but travel often enough that we take always buy multi-voltage, especially for products like these. Plugged it in with a voltage adaptor and it works great, no sparking or anything; Just make sure your adaptor can accommodate the uneven two prong plug.      For the price, this cannot be beat. Very simple, straightforward, no fuss. Great for traveling for the dual voltage and once you learn how to use it, works great. I got plenty of complements, and you&#x27;re pretty much in control whether you want springy curls or just a slight wave. Not to mention, they will stay there for days (I waited three days before washing my hair out to test) and it still looked great.</li>
            <li> Good iron, could be hotter. Need better glove. Would be nice to adjust the  Temperature. All in all a decent wand.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is absolutely amazing, and i know I most curling irons end up being a waste of money but this is definitely not!! the curls lasted three days! i would this product recommend this for everyone!</li>
            <li> I received this product much sooner than i expected.  It was in excellent condition and the only complaint that I have is that I have a hard time being coordinated enough to use it on myself. :)  I would definitely recommend this product.  I am very satisfied.  thank you.</li>
            <li> The iron works great.  The curls last for hours.  The only negative is that it is super hot and you can easily burn yourself.  So I wear a long sleeve shirt when I curl my hair. The glove is nice but hard to grab hair with it.  So a little bit of a pain.  But overall very happy with it and love the results!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS BABY! I&#x27;VE HAD IT FOR YEARS, and I ordered it here on amazon. I LOVE IT, everyone loves it too and cant believe how much less I paid than the mall kiosks.</li>
            <li> I was deciding after my old Herstyler broke,  between the Herstyler curling wand I have had or the Jose Eber. My Herstyler took forever to get a curl, normally fell out 1/2 way throughout night and I live in a super humid climate. The Jose Eber, is amazing!!! Its the perfect temperature and i dont have to keep going over same pieces to get it to stay. I apply hairspray after I curl it and then before I leave brush fingers or a lightly brush it. My hair stays curled til the next day and don&#x27;t even need to curl it again. I never write reviews but this curling wand saves me a lot of time and keeps my husband happy because my hair normally takes forever to curl. :)</li>
            <li> Never used curlers before. This is a good one. Easy to use. Only wish it had diff heat settings. Great price too!!</li>
            <li> Amazing as always!!! I&#x27;ve had mine for years, my go to hair curler</li>
            <li> This is a really good curling iron! My friend has one, used it with great results, so decided to get my own. My iron doesn&#x27;t seem to make curls that last quite as long as her jose eber did (maybe mine doesn&#x27;t get as hot?), but the curls I get with my iron last most of the day. I have very straight, fine hair that normally doesn&#x27;t hold a curl AT ALL, so 10 to 12 hours of curls is fantastic and certainly the best I could ever hope for.</li>
            <li> I have thin, soft, silky hair... the kind that straightens perfectly but curling... that doesn&#x27;t happen. I can&#x27;t curl my own hair &amp; when other people do, it just falls out within a couple hours. with this iron, I curl my own hair in about 30 minutes (I have really long hair) &amp; it stays for two-three days if I don&#x27;t brush it or wash it. it is amazing! the only thing is, if I didn&#x27;t use the glove that comes with it, my hands would be burned almost every time! amazing product &amp; perfect size!</li>
            <li> Excellent! Works perfect, as was promised! Nice curls that will last a long time in my very fine/thin hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Does what it says.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical about this product.  From first impression opening the box, it looks like it&#x27;s poor quality and not a legit product.  Will update once used to test function, but I&#x27;m not confident I&#x27;ll be keeping it.</li>
            <li> Love this product -- second one I&#x27;ve purchased and it makes my hair look fantastic. Been using it for a few years now and everyone asks how I get my hair to look so nice and curly. Great product since I could never curl my hair w/ a regular iron with the clamp.. ends of my hair would look ridiculous. Heats up quickly -- glove is included. Two [non-burned] thumbs UP! :)</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  Works amazingly well, I love this.  It does not fry my hair.  I recommend this for medium to long length hair though, you will get different curls than a typical curling iron. It is harder to use with my short hair and the curls do not stay in long but with short hair I get fantastic waves.</li>
            <li> I have thick, course, color treated hair and NOTHING would keep my curls. I tried rollers (steam and ceramic) and multiple brands of wands. I couldn&#x27;t justify spending $200 on a high-end wand, so I tried this based on reviews and it is awesome. I can curl my hair one day, have soft waves the next and use the texture to create a bun on the third day. This wand is the best!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is exactly what I have been looking for and the curls hold in my hair for alot longer than any other product I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;J</li>
            <li> We got a wider variant than we ordered, but my wife was very happy nonetheless. It works with the European 240 voltage just fine. Curling is easy, and the curls do last a while.</li>
            <li> After using this wand for over three years I believe I can speak to how great it works! This is my first and only wand that I own and I would repurchase again in a heartbeat if I lost it. Curling my hair taking six minutes because I do larger sections and my hair naturally holds a curl well. I love that it heats up to 350  degrees and do not mind that there is only an on/off switch; it gets the job done well and doesn&#x27;t need the extra options in my opinion. Recently I tried curling my hair with a regular barrel and decided it wasn&#x27;t worth my time, my Jose Eber wand is much better. I have used this consistently since my purchase and appreciate how natural(loose curls) and bouncy my hair is with this.</li>
            <li> I liked this item , it&#x27;s good, very good item.&lt;br /&gt;I liked this item , it&#x27;s good, very good item.</li>
            <li> This curling wand gets hotter than the surface of the sun. I&#x27;m experienced with clipless curling wands but still managed to burn myself twice the first time I used this! The super hot temperate really sets the curls quickly so it takes far less time to style. The staying power is excellent so touch ups are less frequent if you go for multiple days without washing. Two (blistered) thumbs up!</li>
            <li> My hair seriously NEVER holds curl for a long period of time.  My friend bought this curling iron at the mall and paid $200. It&#x27;s SO much cheaper to buy it off here. The iron gets SUPER hot. It comes with a glove, but it&#x27;s like twice the size of my hand, so it&#x27;s useless.  I already have a scar from it, but it&#x27;s an amazing iron..just be careful when you use it.  I kind of wish I would have gotten the 25mm barrel because these curls aren&#x27;t as big as I normally like them to be, but they&#x27;re still really cute.  My hair is really fine &amp; honestly never holds curl, but this iron has been wonders! Def one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made off here.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and just what I needed.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a non clip curling iron. I watched a couple of videos online showing me what to do and how this curling iron works. I was amazed how wonderful it curled my teenage daughters hair because it will normally curl because of how thick and straight it is. I also did a couple of strands of my own hair. I can&#x27;t wait to do mine. I would recommend wearing the glove on your hand until you are use to the iron. I would recommend this to everyone. My only regret is not purchasing it sooner!</li>
            <li> I sent this back it wouldn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl. The return process was very simple</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, super awesome product!</li>
            <li> Works really good! Love it.</li>
            <li> Really good product ! Very satisfated !!!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing curling iron I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is pretty thick and takes time to style but with this it&#x27;s really fast.&lt;br /&gt;You dont have your hair wrapped around it for ages, curls super fast.&lt;br /&gt;It does get very hot so would recommend getting the protection glove with practice you will get so use to it&lt;br /&gt;and wont have any problems or a need for the glove but at first its a must have.&lt;br /&gt;Def a must buy :)</li>
            <li> We loved this curling wand until it stopped working 2 months after we bought it!!  Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> My hair is already straight and it has always been very difficult to get/keep any curls in it. I researched this product and for the most part found nothing but praise. To my surprise I found that the very same product an Amazon retailer sells for less than $70, retails for $200 on the Jose Eber website!!! (I feel sorry for anyone not doing research and paying that price). Product arrived way before its scheduled delivery date, well packaged in its original box, with a glove and life time warranty (that has to be initiated by registration, however). The curling iron is amazing! It heats up quickly, makes great curls in less than 5 seconds per strand, that last and last and last. I can even sleep on it and still have curls in my hair the next day! This is an awesome product and I can only highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love love love this curler! Hold the section of hair on for 5-10seconds for a brilliant curl that lasts for days... I mean it! Best decent curler on the market. I swear by it.</li>
