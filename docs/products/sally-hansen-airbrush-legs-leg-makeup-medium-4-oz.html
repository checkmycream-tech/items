            <li>Product works great by covering bruises, blemishes and veins; however, it&#x27;s orange...</li>

            <li>This is a great product for anyone wanting to show off great legs.</li>
            <li>The consistency is good and maybe for someone with the need for leg makeup could use, but not for covering up spider veins.</li>
            <li>This product is the best I have used to make my legs look &amp;#34;summer ready.&amp;#34;  It looks like a nice tan and is easy to apply.  </li>

            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for a nice sun-tanned glow,  but it didn&#x27;t cover the imperfections at all.  </li>
            <li>nice product, good delivery time nice quality</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s better than &amp;#34;Hey!</li>
            <li>This product is outstanding for me!</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen Airbrush Legs has amazing staying power.</li>
            <li>The sample I got was the kind that comes in a tube.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to try the lotion</li>
            <li>It went on even and immediately she had a nice tan</li>
            <li>Smells nice as well.</li>
            <li>Something I wouldn&#x27;t wear everday but a nice cover up.</li>
            <li>It really does perfect them and it covers up spider veins.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very easily remedied, unlike self-tanner</li>
            <li>It really is like putting foundation on your legs, a very good, lightweight foundation.</li>
            <li>The thing I love about this is that it is so easy to spread around evenly and is a nice shade.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I like the way this goes on much better than the spray version.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>it just makes me feel better about myself.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the medium shade.</li>
            <li>I have used many self-tanning products as well as color for the legs.</li>
            <li>My legs look sunkissed for sure.</li>
            <li>I should admit this method works way better, and my skin doesn&#x27;t look orange anymore.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not heavy like some leg makeup products, but works beautifully for us &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; women.</li>
            <li>The cream is much easier to apply and looks just as good.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and lasts</li>
            <li>Not as easy to apply as others have stated to get the results you want.</li>
            <li>I have an olive complexion and tan rather easily in the sun, however, my legs are always the hardest to tan.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve applied it and it&#x27;s stayed nicely for several days with good care and showering each day.</li>
            <li>This product will come off with a light scrub of soap and water, but not by patting the skin lightly.</li>
            <li>My legs feel smooth and look shades darker because of just one application.</li>
            <li>If you rub it really well, it will blend nicely.</li>
            <li>It gave me a gorgeous bronze glow &amp; looked as natural as if I&#x27;d just returned from a tropical vacation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several tanning products over the years and this is much the best.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t wear it everyday, but for special occasions in the summer time when I want my legs to look really great!</li>
            <li>I have had many compliments of generally looking nice (people might not know why</li>
            <li>It also is a good product if you use self-tanners and experience a major stain blunder.</li>
            <li>Even my feet look pretty in summer sandals when I mastered the top of them.</li>
            <li>This lotion however is wonderful and easier to put on and works just as well if not better.  </li>
            <li>Not the best to put over tattoos because it does look like your wearing something over the tattoo as it looks dull.</li>
            <li>However, if your spider veins are extreme it may not completely conceal them, but it certainly makes them look a lot better and it leaves a very nice kind of glow on the legs.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s now my preferred product as it seems I have more direct control with no overspray on surrounding things.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t seem to lose any SH colour, smell freshly showered and the  water seems to set the lotion - in my mind.</li>
            <li>I actually got a compliment from a co-worker about how nicely tanned my legs were</li>
            <li>If you put this product on just right</li>
            <li>It looks like a great tan, and covers small blemishes/veins.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not too dark, just like a good tan.</li>
            <li>I like the lotion better because it drys much quicker, doesn&#x27;t stain when Dry and easy to remove with a baby wipe or soap and water.</li>
            <li>You can purchase the sample travel size to begin and test it out, and I bet you will be back quickly to purchase the full size!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s too hot</li>
            <li>I first used the Sally Hansen Airbrush Legs in the spray can form when it first came out on the market.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another benefit is that my skin immediately feels velvety soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Those colored legs look great!)), the colour doesn&#x27;t scream &#x27;fake&#x27; on me and haven&#x27;t bought pantyhose forever.</li>
            <li>I first saw it in Wal-Mart for $11.99 and decided to try it.</li>
            <li>I wore it for the first time to a wedding</li>
            <li>would have never have thought to buy this if I hadn&#x27;t used the mini sample size first.</li>
            <li>It looked orange at first</li>
            <li>The product dries quickly with no major commitment required since the product easily washes off with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, similar to putting on lotion.  </li>
            <li>Easy enough to apply.  </li>
            <li>works well for a night out and a quick solution to having smooth tan legs and arms, be careful though will rub off in the clothes, car, bed, chairs, everything!</li>
            <li>It really evens out your skin tone and hides flaws and discoloration.  </li>
            <li>Then I shower with it on and gently pat (not rub)</li>
            <li>It rubs in very well and makes a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for looking summer ready without the sun damage.</li>
            <li>I have very splotchy skin on my legs and this evens</li>
            <li>but it dries like a real tan.</li>
            <li>I really like it can&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It really smooths out your legs.</li>
            <li>This works really well on my aging legs to hide sports and varicose veins when I wear my summer capris.  </li>
            <li>Just tried Sally Hansen&#x27;s Airbrush legs for the first time and am so pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this product helped/worked out for other people</li>
            <li>I have purchased Air Brush Legs in the past, but have always bought the spray on kind.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying it.  </li>
            <li>My expectations were too high</li>
            <li>I originally bought it to even the skin tone on my legs (due to mosquito and fire ants bites), which the product did to a certain degree...</li>
            <li>I was very pleased, due to having very sensitive skin and having an outbreak while overseas due to the high rays of the sun.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, compared to other similar products, where I had to moisturize my legs first.</li>
            <li>Best to apply one thin layer, wait for it to dry, and then keep adding layers and allowing to dry to your preferred tan shade.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not too light and not too dark, and it looks completely natural.</li>
            <li>but by morning it had completely faded.</li>
            <li>It goes on evenly and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had any sensitive reactions to the product at all.  </li>
            <li>and it starts to blend in with your skin tone creating a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>Does not look natural at all even when used with lotion.</li>
            <li>If I apply like normal, wait 20min to dry then gently use a damp towel to take some of it off</li>
            <li>It really gives your legs a natural looking tan and evens out any skin minor imperfections/flaws.  </li>
            <li>Because I wash my hands frequently, I use a common sponge type beauty blender on the top of my hands and feet if I am heading to a social event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty similar to my regular skin color.</li>
            <li>w/the aerosol getting on anything, I would spray it on a mitt and put a mitt on the other hand and go to town applying it quickly and using it a 2nd time to get it</li>
            <li>Threw it to my husband quickly to put in a clear bag at security as a last ditch effort, and the guy said to my husband with a slight smirk,  &amp;#34;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>My only wish is a product like this made with natural ingredients instead of chemicals I can&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li>my skin with mild shower gel on a small pouf.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, but the dried product gets on every article of clothing and does NOT come out!</li>
            <li>The spray served me well over the years, but despite laying down a big old sheet on the floor, the spray really did drift.</li>
            <li>do use this over my entire body sometimes usually during the summer or for special events.  </li>
            <li>so I love that it gives me just enough of a natural looking tan on my legs without looking fake or splotchy orange.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m pretty pale but not the palest person</li>
            <li>It really makes your legs look air brushed, I have freckles and they slightly show once I applied the lotion.</li>

            <li> w/the aerosol getting on anything, I would spray it on a mitt and put a mitt on the other hand and go to town applying it quickly and using it a 2nd time to get it</li>
            <li> Threw it to my husband quickly to put in a clear bag at security as a last ditch effort, and the guy said to my husband with a slight smirk,  &amp;#34;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> My only wish is a product like this made with natural ingredients instead of chemicals I can&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li> my skin with mild shower gel on a small pouf.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, but the dried product gets on every article of clothing and does NOT come out!</li>
            <li> The spray served me well over the years, but despite laying down a big old sheet on the floor, the spray really did drift.</li>
            <li> do use this over my entire body sometimes usually during the summer or for special events.  </li>
            <li> so I love that it gives me just enough of a natural looking tan on my legs without looking fake or splotchy orange.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m pretty pale but not the palest person</li>
            <li> It really makes your legs look air brushed, I have freckles and they slightly show once I applied the lotion.</li>
            <li> I have used many sunless tanners in the past that have smelled bad, been sticky, and left my hands and legs full of streaks.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the aerosol can for several years all year long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged woman with small spider veins, a few light freckles on my legs and arms and upper chest, and I have always felt like my skin was a bit blotchy all over</li>
            <li> But it was a little dark at first.</li>
            <li> Just remember to let it dry to see the final result!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does take a while to dry, and it will leave color on your clothes if you sweat, which I often do.</li>
            <li> then let dry for about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> apply it where needed, then then throw on some old jammies or dark clothes and let it set for a few minutes while I sit and relax.</li>
            <li> This is too lightweight to mask them, but they are much less obvious.  </li>
            <li> However, this product not only gives a slight tan, but COVERS</li>
            <li> but only by a little.</li>
            <li> I was tempted to do a second coat on my legs just to see how dark I could get them!</li>
            <li> If I have seen any minimal transfer, it&#x27;s because I was too hasty in not letting it set before bed or dressing.</li>
            <li> I also have a few white sun spots on my legs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I felt discouraged after using it a few tries (Wondering if Sally Hansen has the same product in lighter shade?).</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a little runny, so you have to be careful when applying.</li>
            <li> It disguised my scars &amp; other imperfections &amp; gave me the confidence to wear shorts when I previously wouldn&#x27;t have dared.</li>
            <li> Too dark and streaky.</li>
            <li> and it was too dark for my legs.  </li>
            <li> I am very white due to a serious illness and pantyhose make me itch.  </li>
            <li> but then I tried using less of the product, as well as mixing it with lotion so it absorbs easier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less streaky and a little thicker, like a foundation for your legs.  </li>
            <li> It looks a little orange when I put it on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale with sallow skin tone, I use about 3 thin layers on my legs for a natural even tan look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> which you&#x27;re stuck with for a few days.</li>
            <li> but it was always rather messy.  </li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding the aerosol</li>
            <li> I use it everyday when I wear dresses or shorts.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always pale</li>
            <li> In fact, I think that&#x27;s why I bought this product in the first place...to fix an ugly self tan</li>
            <li> and I am hard to tan even a little.</li>
            <li> at least a little foundation on my face to even out my skin &amp; cover imperfections...</li>
            <li> I have found very little transfer to sheets or clothing.</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all, not even on small spider veins.  </li>
            <li> I have very pale skin on my legs</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t do much for me. :(</li>
            <li> Nothing will cover-up all of the time worn age marks, but this at least softens the look.</li>
            <li> This formulation runs out of the tube and gets all over, it has ruined an expensive rug due to the pouring out the tube.</li>
            <li> Before trying it, I was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> I tried to use this to cover up a blemish on my legs and not only did it not cover it up, but it made me look like I had a bad spray tan.</li>
            <li> Like any lotion, it has an oh so very subtle scent which doesn&#x27;t bother me (not at all like the awful and much different DHA self-tanner smell), but I have a routine when I&#x27;m using this</li>
            <li> Helps to fix any messes from self-tanning gone wrong.</li>
            <li> Just a bunch of oily makeup for your legs, ladies. :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this lotion. The color is what it is described. It goes on smooth, compared to other similar products, where I had to moisturize my legs first.</li>
            <li> I just loved the sample I received of Sally Hansen&#x27;s Air Brush Legs!  I have purchased Air Brush Legs in the past, but have always bought the spray on kind.  The sample I got was the kind that comes in a tube.  I like the way this goes on much better than the spray version.  It&#x27;s less streaky and a little thicker, like a foundation for your legs.  It makes your skin look smoother and hides imperfections. It goes on matte and doesn&#x27;t have sparkles in it which is a plus for me.  This product is great when you want to wear a dress and it&#x27;s too hot or you don&#x27;t like wearing hose.  It makes your legs look air brushed you could say.  It really evens out your skin tone and hides flaws and discoloration.  I will continue to buy this in the future, but will be switching to the tube instead of buying the spray. #AirbrushPerfectLegs  I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Product works great by covering bruises, blemishes and veins; however, it&#x27;s orange... Like Oompa Loompa Orange. I&#x27;ve tried mixing with lotion to dilute but that only ends up rubbing off on clothing later. If I apply like normal, wait 20min to dry then gently use a damp towel to take some of it off it lessens the orange color but only by a little.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I first used the Sally Hansen Airbrush Legs in the spray can form when it first came out on the market. It literally changed my summer confidence. I&#x27;m a middle aged woman with small spider veins, a few light freckles on my legs and arms and upper chest, and I have always felt like my skin was a bit blotchy all over and I am hard to tan even a little. The spray served me well over the years, but despite laying down a big old sheet on the floor, the spray really did drift. I put up with it and eventually would use the enclosed shower to spray my skin. I was thrilled to try the lotion and it&#x27;s now my preferred product as it seems I have more direct control with no overspray on surrounding things. I also find the lotion lasts a lot longer. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use this over my entire body sometimes usually during the summer or for special events.  It&#x27;s not greasy or oily whatsoever, but stays on like satin when rubbed in well. Like any lotion, it has an oh so very subtle scent which doesn&#x27;t bother me (not at all like the awful and much different DHA self-tanner smell), but I have a routine when I&#x27;m using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it where needed, then then throw on some old jammies or dark clothes and let it set for a few minutes while I sit and relax. Then I shower with it on and gently pat (not rub) my skin with mild shower gel on a small pouf. I don&#x27;t seem to lose any SH colour, smell freshly showered and the  water seems to set the lotion - in my mind. This product will come off with a light scrub of soap and water, but not by patting the skin lightly. If you make a mistake it&#x27;s very easily remedied, unlike self-tanner which you&#x27;re stuck with for a few days. Sally Hansen Airbrush Legs has amazing staying power. I&#x27;ve applied it and it&#x27;s stayed nicely for several days with good care and showering each day. I have found very little transfer to sheets or clothing. If I have seen any minimal transfer, it&#x27;s because I was too hasty in not letting it set before bed or dressing. A regular wash cycle takes any residue out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another benefit is that my skin immediately feels velvety soft and smooth. It also is a good product if you use self-tanners and experience a major stain blunder. Helps to fix any messes from self-tanning gone wrong. In fact, I think that&#x27;s why I bought this product in the first place...to fix an ugly self tan mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yup. I like it. I have had many compliments of generally looking nice (people might not know why and that&#x27;s better than &amp;#34;Hey! Those colored legs look great!)), the colour doesn&#x27;t scream &#x27;fake&#x27; on me and haven&#x27;t bought pantyhose forever. Even my feet look pretty in summer sandals when I mastered the top of them. Because I wash my hands frequently, I use a common sponge type beauty blender on the top of my hands and feet if I am heading to a social event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was stranded on an island, I&#x27;d want mascara, blush, lip gloss and definitely my Sally Hansen Airbrush lotion. Just flew internationally and forgot to put the tube in my checked luggage and it was oversized for a carry-on security airport issued plastic bag. I was terrified security was going to seize it. Threw it to my husband quickly to put in a clear bag at security as a last ditch effort, and the guy said to my husband with a slight smirk,  &amp;#34;I&#x27;m sure your hairy legs will look beautiful with this stuff.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We got through security ok.  :)</li>
            <li> Finally!!! Makeup for your legs!!! I never leave the house without putting on makeup....at least a little foundation on my face to even out my skin &amp; cover imperfections...it just makes me feel better about myself. This is basically sunshine in a tube!!! It gave me a gorgeous bronze glow &amp; looked as natural as if I&#x27;d just returned from a tropical vacation. It disguised my scars &amp; other imperfections &amp; gave me the confidence to wear shorts when I previously wouldn&#x27;t have dared. I absolutely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> If you put this product on just right it hides all leg flaws.</li>
            <li> Just tried Sally Hansen&#x27;s Airbrush legs for the first time and am so pleasantly surprised! Before trying it, I was a little skeptical. I have used many sunless tanners in the past that have smelled bad, been sticky, and left my hands and legs full of streaks. This is not the case with Air Brush Legs. It really is like putting foundation on your legs, a very good, lightweight foundation. It rubs in very well and makes a noticeable difference. I was tempted to do a second coat on my legs just to see how dark I could get them! My legs feel smooth and look shades darker because of just one application. The color did not fade or rub off until I showered the next day and washed it off with soap. This is definitely something I would like to keep on hand for those times I want to wear shorts or a dress but have not had time to lay out.</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all, not even on small spider veins.  The consistency is good and maybe for someone with the need for leg makeup could use, but not for covering up spider veins.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and lasts</li>
            <li> I received this product as a freebie by Influenster.  It&#x27;s easy to apply, similar to putting on lotion.  The product dries quickly with no major commitment required since the product easily washes off with soap and water.  I recommend this product for looking summer ready without the sun damage. @influenster @sallyHansen #contest #airbrushperfectlegs</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter. It went on even and immediately she had a nice tan but by morning it had completely faded.</li>
            <li> Too dark and streaky. Only for oompa loompas.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this Sally Hansen product in the spray, but when I ran out I saw it came in a lotion form which I haven&#x27;t see int he store I decided to give it a try.  The spray did the job but it was always rather messy.  This lotion however is wonderful and easier to put on and works just as well if not better.  It really gives your legs a natural looking tan and evens out any skin minor imperfections/flaws.  I actually got a compliment from a co-worker about how nicely tanned my legs were and when I told her what I used she couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I&#x27;m always pale so I love that it gives me just enough of a natural looking tan on my legs without looking fake or splotchy orange.  And, the fact that it comes in lotion is just the highlight of my day.  Smells nice as well.</li>
            <li> works well for a night out and a quick solution to having smooth tan legs and arms, be careful though will rub off in the clothes, car, bed, chairs, everything! I try to stand in front of a fan to help set the color before stepping out</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have used to make my legs look &amp;#34;summer ready.&amp;#34;  It looks like a nice tan and is easy to apply.  Just remember to let it dry to see the final result!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  It goes on evenly and looks natural.  I have very splotchy skin on my legs and this evens&lt;br /&gt;it out enough that I can wear shorts or skirts without feeling self-conscious.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the aerosol can for several years all year long. I am very white due to a serious illness and pantyhose make me itch.  I was having trouble finding the aerosol so I bought 2 of these, big mistake! This formulation runs out of the tube and gets all over, it has ruined an expensive rug due to the pouring out the tube. I didn&#x27;t expect that at all and I have never had any problem w/the aerosol getting on anything, I would spray it on a mitt and put a mitt on the other hand and go to town applying it quickly and using it a 2nd time to get it the color I like. I wish I called about this and the damaged rug but have been in and out of the hospital.</li>
            <li> Unless it is just for one night to help cover a scar, don&#x27;t bother with this product. Not as easy to apply as others have stated to get the results you want.</li>
            <li> I tried this product. It dries quickly, but the dried product gets on every article of clothing and does NOT come out! I washed it off and tried the aerosol version, but that did the same thing. I used to use Studio 35, but they don&#x27;t sell it anymore. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is outstanding for me! I have an olive complexion and tan rather easily in the sun, however, my legs are always the hardest to tan.  I also have a few white sun spots on my legs.  This product covers my sun spots and evens out the tan look on my legs.  I use it everyday when I wear dresses or shorts.  It&#x27;s a must have for me!  I use the medium and it&#x27;s not too light and not too dark, and it looks completely natural. I can use this even when I&#x27;m wearing white.  I mix the airbrush legs with my lotion then apply to my legs...then let dry for about 15 minutes.  There&#x27;s no color transfer onto my clothes at all.  I&#x27;ve never had any sensitive reactions to the product at all.  It&#x27;s a must have for me!  I highly recommend trying it.  You can purchase the sample travel size to begin and test it out, and I bet you will be back quickly to purchase the full size!  5 stars all the way!</li>
            <li> Something I wouldn&#x27;t wear everday but a nice cover up. I like the lotion better because it drys much quicker, doesn&#x27;t stain when Dry and easy to remove with a baby wipe or soap and water. It really makes your legs look air brushed, I have freckles and they slightly show once I applied the lotion. Not the best to put over tattoos because it does look like your wearing something over the tattoo as it looks dull.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for covering flaws on your legs when wearing a dress.  Easy enough to apply.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the medium shade. It looks like a great tan, and covers small blemishes/veins. It&#x27;s quite waterproof, and doesn&#x27;t smear onto clothes or furniture. I probably won&#x27;t wear it everyday, but for special occasions in the summer time when I want my legs to look really great!</li>
            <li> I thought I wanted something to cover my old-lady blue veins on my legs. This is too lightweight to mask them, but they are much less obvious.  The thing I love about this is that it is so easy to spread around evenly and is a nice shade.  It looks a little orange when I put it on but it dries like a real tan. I have very pale skin on my legs but I got the medium shade and it&#x27;s not too dark, just like a good tan. I&#x27;ve tried several tanning products over the years and this is much the best.</li>
            <li> I have used many self-tanning products as well as color for the legs. However, this product not only gives a slight tan, but COVERS imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;It is not heavy like some leg makeup products, but works beautifully for us &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; women.</li>
            <li> My expectations were too high I guess, it did not cover well and it was too dark for my legs.  will have to return it</li>
            <li> I tried to use this to cover up a blemish on my legs and not only did it not cover it up, but it made me look like I had a bad spray tan. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone wanting to show off great legs. It really does perfect them and it covers up spider veins. However, if your spider veins are extreme it may not completely conceal them, but it certainly makes them look a lot better and it leaves a very nice kind of glow on the legs. I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
            <li> This seems to work as advertised if you follow the directions. Nothing will cover-up all of the time worn age marks, but this at least softens the look.</li>
            <li> Yuck. Just a bunch of oily makeup for your legs, ladies. :(</li>
            <li> This is a good product for a nice sun-tanned glow,  but it didn&#x27;t cover the imperfections at all.  I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really like it can&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I first saw it in Wal-Mart for $11.99 and decided to try it. I was very pleased, due to having very sensitive skin and having an outbreak while overseas due to the high rays of the sun. I wore it for the first time to a wedding and I was very happy with the results. I will definitely being buying this product again, and now that I see Amazon has it as an add-on for $3 I will definitely be purchasing it from here.</li>
            <li> Pretty similar to my regular skin color. I&#x27;m mixed asian and I&#x27;m tan to begin with.. But it was a little dark at first. If you rub it really well, it will blend nicely. My legs look sunkissed for sure.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes everyone at work think I have on pantyhose. It really smooths out your legs. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does take a while to dry, and it will leave color on your clothes if you sweat, which I often do.</li>
            <li> This works really well on my aging legs to hide sports and varicose veins when I wear my summer capris.  It is a little runny, so you have to be careful when applying.</li>
            <li> Starts out orangey, but give it a minute and it starts to blend in with your skin tone creating a natural looking tan. Best to apply one thin layer, wait for it to dry, and then keep adding layers and allowing to dry to your preferred tan shade. I&#x27;m very pale with sallow skin tone, I use about 3 thin layers on my legs for a natural even tan look.&lt;br /&gt;I would have never have thought to buy this if I hadn&#x27;t used the mini sample size first. My only wish is a product like this made with natural ingredients instead of chemicals I can&#x27;t pronounce. Otherwise works as intended.</li>
            <li> Does not look natural at all even when used with lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the can version of this for years but it&#x27;s messy. The cream is much easier to apply and looks just as good.</li>
            <li> nice product, good delivery time nice quality</li>
            <li> UPDATE (8/15/2015): I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while and I should admit - I regret giving it 3 stars. It looked orange at first but then I tried using less of the product, as well as mixing it with lotion so it absorbs easier. I should admit this method works way better, and my skin doesn&#x27;t look orange anymore. I upgraded the review to five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product somewhat worked. But it was too orange-looking on my skin (I&#x27;m pretty pale but not the palest person I know).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I felt discouraged after using it a few tries (Wondering if Sally Hansen has the same product in lighter shade?). I originally bought it to even the skin tone on my legs (due to mosquito and fire ants bites), which the product did to a certain degree... However, I thought the skin on my legs looked too unnatural comparing to the skin tone on the rest of my body. I&#x27;m glad this product helped/worked out for other people but it didn&#x27;t do much for me. :(</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever! I use all over my body. Stays on for 3-4 days</li>
