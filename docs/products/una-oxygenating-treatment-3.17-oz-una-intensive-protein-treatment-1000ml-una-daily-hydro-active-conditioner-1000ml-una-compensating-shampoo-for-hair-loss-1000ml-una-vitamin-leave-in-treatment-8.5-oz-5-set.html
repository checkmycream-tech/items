            <li>It works well and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use gel and the deep conditioner works great at keeping my hair in place when wearing a bun, and it also works great as a frizz fighter when wearing hair down.</li>

            <li>Absolutely worth it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these before at my salon, this is a bargain. They (salon &amp; beauty supplies) definitly try to sell it for way more than offered here. I love all the products, especially the drops. I would buy this everytime.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe the prce I paid for it! Amazing! Like Amazon ♡</li>
            <li> Love this! Makes your hair so healthy. Shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> I like this product. I have not been using it long enough to know how effectively it works but so far it is really great.</li>
            <li> I love this products they are worth it</li>
            <li> Excellent product... Love it</li>
            <li> This product is great. First delivery attempt was horrible. The bottles were broken and spilled inside the box. But after contacting the seller, they resent the package, and this time everything was intact. Would definitely recommend. The shampoo leaves your hair tingly and the protein deep conditioner is the best, and it smells awesome. I leave it on overnight and wash it out in the morning leaving my hair silky. The drops also leaves your hair tingly when you rub it in and the vitamin spray is great. I have relaxed hair and its works perfect for my hair type. And it&#x27;s much cheaper than the salon and also much bigger in size. I have semi dry hair. If I use a moisturizer deep conditioner it sometimes leaves my hair very greasy. And sometimes I need the moisture. This deep conditioner is a great balance for people who has difficulty finding products for their hair type.</li>
            <li> the product itself is GOOD . BUT the shipment was HORRIBLE !!! instead of getting a conditioner and shampoo i received no conditioner and 2 shampoo. the tops were broken and the jar of treatment was cracked all the product was spilled everywhere.</li>
            <li> This product is really work well with my hair. Because my hair was braking a lot since I  started using it I  see a lot difference.</li>
            <li> Is very Good for my hair</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair felt after using this product....will buy more...I will continue with this product 6 months and review again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 years.  Love the way my hair feels and behaves after using it.  A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love it. So much gentler and effective than any other hair care product on my hair. Absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> This hair product is great as far as leaving my hair feeling silky and shiny. I only been using it for three weeks so I still haven&#x27;t notice any difference as far as my hair falling out . Im going to give it three more weeks since that&#x27;s the recommended time.</li>
            <li> Simply the best!! I have been use them for months and I have any complaint!! I am ready to order them again!!</li>
            <li> The shampoo tingles similar to Nioxin but with lather and once you put the deep conditioner in your hair you can feel it working and de-tangling your hair making it feel super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I love it Dominicans use this on my hair which made me purchase this product they became to expensive so I stopped  going there. great for ethnic hair I&#x27;m white black it Italien Indian and German So my hair is naturally  curly /poofy. you will fall in love with these products the only bad part  about  buying these products it you have to buy their serum separate other than that it&#x27;s refreshing &amp; worth the money</li>
            <li> I love this product! It will continue to be a part of my hair care routine.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work at all, all the money I wasted. Don&#x27;t want to throw it away because it hurts to throw money down the drain.</li>
            <li> This brand was recommended to me by a friend who raved about it. I have relaxed hair and it has been breaking so I just decided to buy the entire supply in an effort to get my hair healthy again. The only items I plan on purchasing again are the shampoo, deep conditioner and the drops. The conditioner is not for my hair type. I need a moisturizing conditioner and the conditioner is very watered down and does nothing for my hair. The deep conditioner is great as a leave in. I don&#x27;t use gel and the deep conditioner works great at keeping my hair in place when wearing a bun, and it also works great as a frizz fighter when wearing hair down.</li>
            <li> These products are really good. My hair is soft and manageable. They smell is good too. I have curly hair, I do not relax or perm my hair but I wear it straight (Dominican Blow Out). These products have helped my hair grow. Overall my hair is healthier.</li>
            <li> This treatment was better than anticpated. My wife was looking for some quality hair products and someone recommended this brand. She is really happy with the quality and the results. Great quality, great results, she highly recommends it.</li>
            <li> My hair was falling like crazy. My hair stylist recommended this product. I have been using it for the past three months, the result is amazing. My hair grew and looks so shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommend these products, she also requestd that I go natural. My perm is growing out and my hair is not breaking. It is May and the last perm I had was in November. Ladies you know when a perm is growing out you lose hair. Well with these products I have not lost any hair. I recommend the entire 5 items.</li>
            <li> This product has been recommended by all of the ladies at my hair salon.  It works well and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Very happy with all the procedure and the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipment and packed to perfection.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Amazing products saw a difference after one use. I have long hair that gets tangled really easily when wet. The protein treatment comb right through with ease my hair was soft and shiny. The shampoo left my scalp feeling really clean. It&#x27;s worth the $$$</li>
