            <li>On the top of it I had an allergic reaction to this product.</li>
            <li>the night repair 50ml, there was no leak or defect with the container, however, it also had so many scratches on the container and</li>
            <li>for the better</li>

            <li>My wife use this product so many years, we bought from Europe or Airport.</li>
            <li>It is like magic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to get in department store, where you know what you going to get.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is incredible how different *</li>
            <li>fast shipping good price</li>
            <li>Good product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>But this one made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I honestly believe that this has helped my 71 year old face look better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent product, well worth the money spent!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable, and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I use the moisturizer and toner, as well as the Perfectly Clean foam cleanser (hightly recommended too).</li>
            <li>Ok, but very exoendive</li>
            <li>But most dramatically, the dullness is much improved and my skin is rosier and brighter.  </li>
            <li>A agree with others about texture, not greasy and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>Great value maintains estee lauder quality as expected!!</li>
            <li>It should be good, I bought this for other person.</li>
            <li>First of all, I bought this in-store.</li>
            <li>I am not going to talk to you about the long term effets of ANR, because everyone who used it regularly knows it&#x27;s great on your skin, no wonder it&#x27;s been on the market forever as a staple</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my first of buying it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been use ANR for years, this is the first one I brought smells totally wired and much thinner than the authentic one I brought from department store.</li>
            <li>Very reliable.</li>
            <li>My husband really noticed a difference too.  </li>
            <li>Service from this vendor was fast and came as ordered.</li>
            <li>The lid was crushed on two sides and the container had so many scratches as if it had been used for a couple of years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottle, the print on the bottle,  the texture and the smell of the liquid are all completely different as the genuine</li>
            <li>Overpriced, but needed the product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>My skin is tighter, but more soft, and definitely smoother.  </li>
            <li>it was a return from Macy;s store and the product was watered down, so i paid $100.00 for mostly tap water</li>
            <li>It was making me look older.  </li>
            <li>High cost performance</li>
            <li>I tried many different products, including harsh exfollients, none really seemed to help as much as I hoped.  </li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference in the clearing out of your pores, but very gently, no irritation.  </li>
            <li>I believe my fine lines look less pronounced.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time we buy this product from third party.</li>
            <li>I even got scared that maybe I had developped someting not good, because I really had this feeling of when your breast was groing as a teenager, slighty tender, more sensitive...</li>
            <li>I received the products I ordered, which are an advanced night repair 50ml and an advanced night repair eye.&lt;br /&gt;But very disappointingly the  eye product leaked and more than one third of the contents was gone and thus wetting the carton box.</li>
            <li>It fixed all my issues.  </li>
            <li>I switched now to a complete Estee Lauder skin care regimen.  </li>
            <li>just as those i used to have, applied it before sleeping, and the next morning, my skin just become much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really like someone else to try and tell me if they experience the same thing...</li>
            <li>It really feels different afterwards</li>
            <li>i will come back when i need a new one!</li>
            <li>Meanwhile I kept using ANR and the breast looked greater, I mean really full, round, bouncy...</li>
            <li>The liquid is dilute and smell different, the print on the bottle is just on the surface, the real one is engraved, you can see and feel the different.</li>
            <li>Will order from Estee Lauder directly in the future!!!!</li>
            <li>In the photo, the left one is genuine Estee Lauder, can you see the logo print on the lid of the fake one (the right bottle), you can see the different when you compare.</li>
            <li>The apparence of the product was different from my previous bottle, much thinner.</li>

            <li> The product I recieved was not only pungent and an odd consistency, it came in a plastic bottle versus the normal glass bottle.</li>

            <li> The bottle of the fake one is thinner than the genuine</li>
            <li> She uses this for a long time.</li>
            <li> A little drop is enough to cover your entire face.</li>
            <li> I went to Kenting, Taiwan last week, and got sunburned on my neck, and I just applied a little drop, then  my neck felt not that hurt the next day.</li>
            <li> And the print on the fake one is blurry, and the real one is clear.</li>
            <li> Also, since this is not a cheap serum you will want to use it moderately.&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the bottle, specially since it is very very hard to get it out once it&#x27;s almost finished.</li>
            <li> I have struggled over the last few years with dulling skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used for some time ，but I think it‘s not real and not effective。</li>
            <li> I already request a refund, I hope other people can read this before they make a payment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still use other creams but this is the foundation.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone, from mid 20&#x27;s to late 40&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> There are definitely less content in this bottle than what I bought from the Store.</li>
            <li> I should not have bought it here just for less money...</li>
            <li> Not worth the few dollars I saved.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this product is real, might be a fake.</li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have to say that don&#x27;t waste your money buying this product.</li>
            <li> few months ago, the skin on my chest started to repond to my body lotions by producing small pimples...</li>
            <li> When my wife open the box, she find that this is a fake Estee Lauder product.</li>
            <li> The packaging is not real, the item is fake.</li>
            <li> Received EL ANR Recovery Complex.  </li>
            <li> Described as EL ANR Recovery Complex II.</li>
            <li> Received a package from ebay, which made me confused for a while.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li> It smells weird, and it&#x27;s watery.</li>
            <li> This is fake product.</li>
            <li> I am so disappoint, the product we received is fake.</li>
            <li> This product is fake.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The products are very disappointing and not reliable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disgusted and furious.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use it everyday. Very reliable.</li>
            <li> Very good stuff, but still pricey.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li> Ok, but very exoendive</li>
            <li> The packaging is not real, the item is fake.</li>
            <li> Really good! I like buying it cheaper than Korea. Thank you! GOOOOOOD items</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product&lt;br /&gt;Before and I know how it is supposed to smell and look. The product I recieved was not only pungent and an odd consistency, it came in a plastic bottle versus the normal glass bottle. This is theft and fraud. Who knows what I put on my face. I&#x27;m disgusted and furious.</li>
            <li> It should be good, I bought this for other person. She uses this for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great product with good price.</li>
            <li> This serum is amazing.  I have struggled over the last few years with dulling skin.  It was making me look older.  I tried many different products, including harsh exfollients, none really seemed to help as much as I hoped.  But this one made a huge difference.  It fixed all my issues.  My skin is tighter, but more soft, and definitely smoother.  I believe my fine lines look less pronounced.  But most dramatically, the dullness is much improved and my skin is rosier and brighter.  I now look 5 to 10 years younger I believe.  My husband really noticed a difference too.  I switched now to a complete Estee Lauder skin care regimen.  I use the moisturizer and toner, as well as the Perfectly Clean foam cleanser (hightly recommended too).</li>
            <li> fast shipping good price</li>
            <li> I have to say that don&#x27;t waste your money buying this product. It smells weird, and it&#x27;s watery. It&#x27;s not supposed to be like this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any change of my skin condition after using it for 2 months. Not worth it!</li>
            <li> it was a return from Macy;s store and the product was watered down, so i paid $100.00 for mostly tap water</li>
            <li> Great value maintains estee lauder quality as expected!!</li>
            <li> Of all the creams, serums, etc. I have bought this one does everything it says.  It makes a huge difference in the clearing out of your pores, but very gently, no irritation.  It&#x27;s an excellent product, well worth the money spent!  Service from this vendor was fast and came as ordered.</li>
            <li> i bought it for my friend. she like it, and always use it.</li>
            <li> This is fake product. The apparence of the product was different from my previous bottle, much thinner. On the top of it I had an allergic reaction to this product. Don&#x27; t buy it.</li>
            <li> My husband even noticed my face was glowy without knowing I had used it.</li>
            <li> I received the products I ordered, which are an advanced night repair 50ml and an advanced night repair eye.&lt;br /&gt;But very disappointingly the  eye product leaked and more than one third of the contents was gone and thus wetting the carton box. The lid was crushed on two sides and the container had so many scratches as if it had been used for a couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;The lid itself is a defective.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t completely sealed unless I don&#x27;t adjust it carefully striving for almost a minute.&lt;br /&gt;Concerning the night repair 50ml, there was no leak or defect with the container, however, it also had so many scratches on the container and even some letters of which was deleted.&lt;br /&gt;The products are very disappointing and not reliable. I would like you to take a proper measure for this occasion.</li>
            <li> There are definitely less content in this bottle than what I bought from the Store. I should not have bought it here just for less money...</li>
            <li> First of all, I bought this in-store. But I felt I had to review this product anyways.&lt;br /&gt;It is incredible how different *for the better* my skin felt the morning after I applied this serum. I can feel the difference when I don&#x27;t apply it, it just &#x27;smoothed&#x27; out my skin. A little drop is enough to cover your entire face. Also, since this is not a cheap serum you will want to use it moderately.&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the bottle, specially since it is very very hard to get it out once it&#x27;s almost finished. But the product itself is INCREDIBLE! I recommend it to anyone, from mid 20&#x27;s to late 40&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;For the best results, use it in combination with the Advanced Night Repair Eye one.</li>
            <li> just as those i used to have, applied it before sleeping, and the next morning, my skin just become much softer and smoother. I went to Kenting, Taiwan last week, and got sunburned on my neck, and I just applied a little drop, then  my neck felt not that hurt the next day. i will come back when i need a new one!</li>
            <li> Received a package from ebay, which made me confused for a while. Good quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 months and I can see my skin looks and feels better.</li>
            <li> The product came in the mail quickly and in excellent condition.  When used regularly I can see a transition of my skin as promised the products manufacturer.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I honestly believe that this has helped my 71 year old face look better. I have tried other products with very little success. It can&#x27;t be said that I look like I found &amp;#34; The Fountain of Youth&amp;#34;, but I do look a bit younger.</li>
            <li> Softens skin under eyes, a big deal for me, so that makeup does not make the skin look like crape paper.  You need only a drop for both eyes. A agree with others about texture, not greasy and dries quickly.  I&#x27;ve been using it only a week or 2.  I do see wrinkle appearance reduction for &amp;#34;crow&#x27;s feet&amp;#34;, but mine were not deep to begin with.  It won&#x27;t help with under-eye bags; those are caused by the fat loosing it support system and only surgery will help that.  I&#x27;ve tried it on the hands with no results.  No smell is a plus.</li>
            <li> I am not going to talk to you about the long term effets of ANR, because everyone who used it regularly knows it&#x27;s great on your skin, no wonder it&#x27;s been on the market forever as a staple product.&lt;br /&gt;My discovery is a bit different.Let me explain:&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago, the skin on my chest started to repond to my body lotions by producing small pimples...blemishes on a decollete...ouch.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was the oil in the lotions so I decided to go oil-free and use ANR on my chest instead...the skin loved it, but that is not all: the BOOBS loved it too. Day after day they started getting fuller. I was not on any homones product so I started wondering...I even got scared that maybe I had developped someting not good, because I really had this feeling of when your breast was groing as a teenager, slighty tender, more sensitive...So I checked and nothing. Meanwhile I kept using ANR and the breast looked greater, I mean really full, round, bouncy...So after investigating, I came to the conclusion that the ANR must have something to do woth it because I haven&#x27;t done anything differently. I&#x27;d really like someone else to try and tell me if they experience the same thing...But so far , this is GREAT!!!:):)</li>
            <li> Excellent product I&#x27;ve used religiously for 30+ years....swear by it.</li>
            <li> I just received this product today. I am so disappoint, the product we received is fake. When my wife open the box, she find that this is a fake Estee Lauder product. My wife use this product so many years, we bought from Europe or Airport. This is the first time we buy this product from third party. The bottle, the print on the bottle,  the texture and the smell of the liquid are all completely different as the genuine one.&lt;br /&gt;  The liquid is dilute and smell different, the print on the bottle is just on the surface, the real one is engraved, you can see and feel the different. And the print on the fake one is blurry, and the real one is clear. The bottle of the fake one is thinner than the genuine one.&lt;br /&gt;  I already request a refund, I hope other people can read this before they make a payment.&lt;br /&gt;  In the photo, the left one is genuine Estee Lauder, can you see the logo print on the lid of the fake one (the right bottle), you can see the different when you compare. And the print on the bottle is also different.</li>

            <li> I have used for some time ，but I think it‘s not real and not effective。</li>
            <li> Overpriced, but needed the product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been use ANR for years, this is the first one I brought smells totally wired and much thinner than the authentic one I brought from department store. And I tried one night the next morning my face and eye area were red and feel irradiated. Not recommended</li>
            <li> It really feels different afterwards</li>
            <li> Received EL ANR Recovery Complex.  Described as EL ANR Recovery Complex II. Returned.</li>
            <li> High cost performance</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my first of buying it. It&#x27;s very comfortable, and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Have used night repair for years and years, nothing else compares for damage repair.  I still use other creams but this is the foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read Hollywood actresses are using this, and decided to try. It is like magic. Skin looks awesome, smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> This product is fake. Different scent,different consistency..Trying to return it but I threw out the packaging. Not worth the few dollars I saved. Will order from Estee Lauder directly in the future!!!!</li>
