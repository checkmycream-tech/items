            <li>and I have been happy with it overall, but</li>
            <li>This face wash is gentle yet effective.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt leave the feeling of &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; on the face, washes off clean.</li>
            <li>It creates a very light, weightless foam that cleans skin very well.</li>
            <li>I really think my skins looks much better than it looked before I started using it</li>

            <li>I am introducing him to organic, no animal testing products, so he finally agreed to give one of my favorite brands a shot!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is organic and it leaves your skin soft and moisturized and takes all your make up off.</li>
            <li>The foam is easy to use, helps keep skin clean, but does not dry it.</li>
            <li>and I must say it is very gentle to the skin, cleanses well and causes no break outs or drying out.</li>
            <li>My face gets smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Feels extra clean and fresh after all</li>
            <li>Normally I wash my face with a scrub first and then with this foam.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and never dry.</li>
            <li>Skin really feels soother.</li>

            <li>It keeps my skin clean and gets rid of the extra oil without over drying my skin.</li>
            <li>I am 35 and have sensitive, combination skin - most cleansing products cause my skin to break out and/or dry it out</li>
            <li>I got this cleanser for my husband who is used to some certain brands and it is a challenge to get him to try something new.</li>
            <li>I just finished the first bottle of this product and so far I like it a lot.</li>
            <li>It was much worse when I was a teenager, got better as an adult after taking some heavy pills but still experienced major breakouts.</li>
            <li>REALLY WELL LEAVING NO RESIDUE BEHIND AND LEAVES MY SKIN FEELING CLEAN AND FRESH</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very recommended item for everyday use.</li>
            <li> product smells really nice. Very refreshing and does&#x27;t dry the skin up as much as other cleansing foams i used in the past. It wouldn&#x27;t remove make-up though. I only use it when i already clean my face with make-up remover. Feels extra clean and fresh after all</li>
            <li> Came on time and works amazingly. It keeps my skin clean and gets rid of the extra oil without over drying my skin. It has also helped get rid of my acne which is what I hoped it would do. I also like that it&#x27;s natural. I use it in the morning but at night I use the cleansing tonic for oily skin by the same company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with skin issues for years... It was much worse when I was a teenager, got better as an adult after taking some heavy pills but still experienced major breakouts. This is my most favorite face wash that I&#x27;ve ever had, smells so good and my skin looks and feels amazing!! I don&#x27;t get the breakouts anymore, just the occasional blemish (which is almost always cause by me falling asleep before washing my face before bed.) I&#x27;m so glad I found a face wash to stick with! Will definitely order again and again and again &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> Pretty great cleanser. I used to use Caudalie one which is 4 times more expensive, switched to Natura Siberica and did not notice any difference.</li>
            <li> GREAT CLEANSER COMES OUT FOAM AND CLEANS REALLY WELL LEAVING NO RESIDUE BEHIND AND LEAVES MY SKIN FEELING CLEAN AND FRESH</li>
            <li> The foam is easy to use, helps keep skin clean, but does not dry it. I use it twice everyday, and can see the difference - pores gets less visible, red spots go away. Smells nice not too strong, leaves a fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> This was a great face wash--very mild with a nice scent to it</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. I was using Neutrogena before and since I started using this one my skin does look better! It doesnt leave the feeling of &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; on the face, washes off clean. Very mild, pleasant smell. I think it is the best choice among products under $20. Great value.</li>
            <li> This purifying foaming cleanser is on of the best cleansers I&#x27;ve tried so far. I love the fact that it is organic and it leaves your skin soft and moisturized and takes all your make up off.</li>

After about 2 weeks I can see the results, my skin got lighter, seems like my post acne redness diminished and my skin is more radiant. I have already ordered 2 more bottles.

            <li> Love, love, love this stuff! This cleanser smells very nice and does a good job cleaning my face. The bottle lasts a long time-I&#x27;ve had mine since May.</li>
            <li> very much I love this foam for washing face. I have a combined skin and foam suits me perfectly. I use it in the summer and in the winter. I buy already for the fourth time.</li>
            <li> Seems like water with a hint of perfumey-smelling soap going through a foam dispenser.  Not harmful, but a little flowery for me.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s doing anything.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cleanser! My skin has condition has NEVER  been better! I will never go back to using any other cleanser!</li>
            <li> This is a really good product. I am 35 and have sensitive, combination skin - most cleansing products cause my skin to break out and/or dry it out (I have been using Neutrogena transparent bar which causes no break outs and I have been happy with it overall, but the downside is it dries out my skin). I have been using this product for about 10 days now and I must say it is very gentle to the skin, cleanses well and causes no break outs or drying out. I really think my skins looks much better than it looked before I started using it and since I have changed nothing else but my cleanser, it would be fair to assume it is the cleanser that made the difference.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would advise anyone to give it a try and I myself plan on trying other facial products by Natura Siberica.</li>
            <li> Love this brand.  This face wash is gentle yet effective.  My face feels clean and never dry. I also have their shampoo, conditioner, eye cream, and face serum.</li>
            <li> It normal I didn&#x27;t see any different in my face.</li>
            <li> I got this cleanser for my husband who is used to some certain brands and it is a challenge to get him to try something new. I am introducing him to organic, no animal testing products, so he finally agreed to give one of my favorite brands a shot! I got him Natura Siberica face cleanser and... he loves it! I tried it myself and I like it too. It creates a very light, weightless foam that cleans skin very well. It has a nice tint of smell to it. I will order this product for myself in the future.</li>
            <li> Used this as clenser for oily skin. Works as well for combinated. It&#x27;s quite good, comes as a foam. Can be used before peel or exfoliator. Skin really feels soother.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find words to describe how incredible this cleanser is! I LOVE the smell!!! Using this product is a pleasure! It cleans my face perfectly! My face gets smooth and soft. What a nice experience.</li>
            <li> been using this product to clean my face upon waking up, it is refreshing and smells good, smells like seven up</li>
