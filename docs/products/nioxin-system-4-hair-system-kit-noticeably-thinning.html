            <li>This hair care system is great for thinning hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product over a year and think it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with the results of this product.  </li>
            <li>To each their own with what strength works best for you, but I wasn&#x27;t going bald and the 4 works wonders!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use this as it says to and it works just as good as described.  </li>
            <li>Good thing with no conditioner my hair is ripped out of my head.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>but this is still a good product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give a fair review of this product because it will take time to see the results.</li>
            <li>good price compared to hairdresser,</li>
            <li>I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>Caused my wife&#x27;s hair to come out more!</li>
            <li>so I bought a couple of kits for my aunts to try and they absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Ordered it for my mom and she loves it and has ordered more!</li>
            <li>These products are fantastic!!</li>
            <li>I agree it might smell nice, but so does a lot of shampoos.</li>
            <li>Great product seems to be working so far so good almost 30 days now notice a difference!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they are all very safe and effective to use.  </li>
            <li>So far, I am happy!</li>
            <li>My hair is fuller, softer and full of body!!  </li>
            <li>So far it is an excellent product for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a HUGE difference in the thickness and health of my hair and it was growing like a weed!  </li>
            <li>but it does seam to look better.</li>
            <li>Love this Hair care system</li>
            <li>yes I love this product</li>
            <li>The products keep their promises :)</li>
            <li>I have used the shampoo for over a year and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff I ordered more</li>
            <li>Well......I think they changed more than that.  </li>
            <li>The results was my hair falling out more than before I began using it.</li>
            <li>love it .</li>
            <li>I had to buy more conditioner to keep up with the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Been 2 weeks:)</li>
            <li>$15-20 more in Ulta and Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>these products are easy to use, &amp; the shampoo has a pleasant, fresh peppermint fragrance.</li>
            <li>Shampoo makes hair feel very clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to follow directions.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use sticky gels and mouses any longer, the scalp treatment acts as a root booster and the conditioner keeps hair smooth when styling with a dryer.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t say that I see much difference.</li>
            <li>And I love that it is delivered right to my door without me having to go to a salon to buy it.</li>
            <li>Quick easy delivery.</li>
            <li>Significant hair regrowth occurred within four months.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair clean and manageable.</li>
            <li>Will continue to use to see if continued use will show more positive results.  </li>
            <li>It does clean, condition and make my scalp feel cool, but I don&#x27;t know if it is helping the problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Noticeable improvement fairly soon after starting the regimen.</li>
            <li>System 3 works better in my opinion for hair growth but the foam in system 4 really does add volume and strength to my hair.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>as described, received quickly</li>
            <li>The shampoo works nicely, however, after using the entire product, I did not notice any difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know that it is worth the price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit expensive in the full sizes, and I had no idea if I&#x27;d like it or not, so the starter kit is the perfect way to see how it works for you.  </li>
            <li>and after 2 weeks I am seeing &#x27;new growth&#x27; along my edges where my hair is more apt to come out due to stress..</li>
            <li>and my hair grows very fast.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner doesn&#x27;t make my hair soft unless I use a huge handful of it at a time.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>Used together these products keep my hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>After the first wash i could feel a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really nice minty smell that slightly tingles when it&#x27;s on your head...</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s pure choice.  </li>
            <li>They certainly don&#x27;t care about customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see any results.</li>
            <li>is gentle on what hair I do have.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference</li>
            <li>Bio in system really works.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and it really does help my very noticeably thinning hair.</li>
            <li>Purchased Nioxin after seeing how much hair I lost during chemo treatment.  </li>
            <li>WOrked better than expected.</li>
            <li>haha.  </li>
            <li>So far she has used two kits and just recently ordered some more shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love the product - I also use other Nioxin products and have recommended them to others.</li>
            <li>But it is better than any other product out there.</li>
            <li>Purchased the bigger sizes when I ran out of these products and it is worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>Tons of new growth in my part area, as well as my bang area!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any more or less hair loss, so for the money, I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li>I followed the product instructions and highly recommend that you try it.</li>
            <li>Other reviews indicate that good results happen with consistent use over a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>So far, it hasn&#x27;t done much.</li>
            <li>It is really too early to tell.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks you start to see more volume added to hair.</li>
            <li>Can see thicker hair and new hair after one month.</li>
            <li>I hope for new growth and healthier hair.</li>
            <li>Will use a different conditioner as my hair was becoming dry.</li>
            <li>It also helped clear up styling product breakout on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>It takes time for results to be clear.</li>
            <li>However, hair does not good &amp;#34;great,&amp;#34; it just looks like normal which is better than frizzy and all over the couch.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed any marked improvement, been using it for over a month.</li>
            <li>I have only been using the product several weeks ,so really don&#x27;t see much difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s action.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair way to soft, no body at all.  </li>
            <li>So far, I like the idea that this product could work.</li>
            <li>This product is a most try before resorting to more extreme and expensive measures.</li>
            <li>I  rub it in carefully on all parts of my scalp, leave it in for 3 minutes as directed then use my regular rich smoothing conditioner on the hair ends up to the scalp.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t give it any higher because I have only been using a short while .</li>
            <li>This product really didn&#x27;t improve the thickness of my hair as I had expected based on the claims made by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t thin more either</li>
            <li>I live in a very arid climate and need a little moisture in my conditioner .</li>
            <li>It seems to provide a little more body to my hair, and that makes it seem a little thicker.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know if it makes the scalp healthier or the hair itself stronger, but i am not losing my hair at the alarming rate i was 3 months ago, &amp; i think i even have as much hair now as i did before i started losing too much of it daily.</li>
            <li>I typically do not leave reviews, but I would highly recommend this product, this is my second time using it after a few years..</li>

            <li> I typically do not leave reviews, but I would highly recommend this product, this is my second time using it after a few years..</li>
            <li> If I had realized how small the bottles were, I would have ordered elsewhere, as I have found prices MUCH cheaper for the same thing.</li>
            <li> I have not been using this product long enough to write a review on it&#x27;s effectiveness, I did however wish to inform any potential buyers about the size of this product.</li>
            <li> I give the products three stars because I have not seen any new growth since using, but I&#x27;ve only been using  the conditioner and scalp treatment for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> This left my hair dry and brittle .</li>
            <li> It states it helps remove the sebum so the hair follicles can breathe and grow new hair, not true!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty expensive for those on fixed income</li>
            <li> The shampoo DOES strip out my auburn red hair coloring faster than my other shampoo for treated hair, so I have stopped using the shampoo.</li>
            <li> My thinning hair was primarily due to a recent surgery.</li>
            <li> Not sure that my hair looks any thicker however; I believe Nioxin stimulates growth and it is too early to determine that benefit.</li>
            <li> IT HAS JUST BEEN SLOW BUT SEEMS TO BE SOME NEW HAIR COMING IN.</li>
            <li> But, I do not like the leave in foam, leaves my hair a sticky mess, only used that 1 time.</li>
            <li> Rinse, only a little needed, takes tangles out.</li>
            <li> so it at least, possibly stopped, further loss.</li>
            <li> so this kit actually lasts me a few months at 2-3 washings a week.</li>
            <li> Trusting that it is going to work,  have only used it a few times,</li>
            <li> I tried other products for a year and nothing else worked</li>
            <li> I bought this product assuming it was the full size, and I was disappointed to see how tiny the bottles of product were.</li>
            <li> It made my hair dry, stiff, and brittle.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint  is the conditioner in and waiting longer than the shampoo</li>
            <li> And even looks a little thicker than before.  </li>
            <li> I chose the number 4 kit even though I don&#x27;t color my hair because it&#x27;s a little gentler.  </li>
            <li> does not leave a heavy film.</li>
            <li> after using the system for a few months i have indeed noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> i was not so naive as to expect a thick mop of hair from using this product, but i did experience a very definite decrease in the amount of hair i was losing everyday.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend or purchase again, was a waste of $30.</li>
            <li> a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I am still not sure that it is helping thicken my hair</li>
            <li> Not sure why this happened.</li>
            <li> My hair came back very thin in patches after chemotherapy almost 2 yrs ago.</li>
            <li> Plus it smells heavily minty which is a weird fragrance for a hair care product.</li>
            <li> Matter of fact I think it made it worse</li>
            <li> so far very disappointed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically an expensive way to cleanse your hair.</li>
            <li> i was afraid at the price of this product that i would be wasting my money, but here i am -- sold on it &amp; purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but it works!</li>
            <li> Too bad they changed the formula.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst hair product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This kit works great !  I don&#x27;t even use this as it says to and it works just as good as described.  I use it maybe twice a week and my hair grows very fast.  And even looks a little thicker than before.  It might grow even faster if I use it daily.  I chose the number 4 kit even though I don&#x27;t color my hair because it&#x27;s a little gentler.  But it&#x27;s pure choice.  I&#x27;m sure they are all very safe and effective to use.  Definitely would recommend to anyone with thinning hair problems.</li>
            <li> Bought this along with the thickening thickening, did not notice any change in the amount of hair coming out nor any thickness in my hair.  Will continue to use to see if continued use will show more positive results.  Will use a different conditioner as my hair was becoming dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this will grow hair back but it will make your do look fuller.  It also helped clear up styling product breakout on my scalp.  I have reordered this product.</li>
            <li> I am still not sure that it is helping thicken my hair but it does seam to look better.</li>
            <li> My mother in law has been using this for about a month and it is showing improvement.</li>
            <li> came quickly, great product!</li>
            <li> Noticeable improvement fairly soon after starting the regimen. Easy to follow directions.</li>
            <li> Love this Hair care system Hope they Never stop making it!!</li>
            <li> Caused my wife&#x27;s hair to come out more!</li>
            <li> Cleaned my scalp in no time!</li>
            <li> so far very disappointed</li>
            <li> Did not see any results and found out that the formula was changed and this is not the Nioxin I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I am waiting to see if it is going to work.So far, it hasn&#x27;t done much.I  don&#x27;t know what else to say.</li>
            <li> yes I love this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the results of this product. Fine/thin hair runs in my family so I bought a couple of kits for my aunts to try and they absolutely love it! It really works!</li>
            <li> IT HAS JUST BEEN SLOW BUT SEEMS TO BE SOME NEW HAIR COMING IN.</li>
            <li> Love the product - I also use other Nioxin products and have recommended them to others. The products keep their promises :)</li>
            <li> This product did not work as I thought it would. The shampoo works nicely, however, after using the entire product, I did not notice any difference in my hair. I didn&#x27;t notice any more or less hair loss, so for the money, I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> It says that it makes hair stronger and prevents breakage. Good thing with no conditioner my hair is ripped out of my head. The fullness is from all the frizz.</li>
            <li> Used together these products keep my hair soft and smooth.  I don&#x27;t have to use sticky gels and mouses any longer, the scalp treatment acts as a root booster and the conditioner keeps hair smooth when styling with a dryer.  I give the products three stars because I have not seen any new growth since using, but I&#x27;ve only been using  the conditioner and scalp treatment for a few weeks.  I have used the shampoo for over a year and love it.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks you start to see more volume added to hair. Try using all three: cleanser, shampoo and hair treatment always.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see any results. My hair didn&#x27;t thin more either so it at least, possibly stopped, further loss.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Leaves hair clean and manageable. Helps to keep my remaining hair. Quick easy delivery. does not leave a heavy film.</li>
            <li> I do think it is stimulating my hair to grow. But, I do not like the leave in foam, leaves my hair a sticky mess, only used that 1 time. The shampoo DOES strip out my auburn red hair coloring faster than my other shampoo for treated hair, so I have stopped using the shampoo. What I will, as I compromise, continue to use and reorder is the conditioner. I feel a scalp tingle using the conditioner. I  rub it in carefully on all parts of my scalp, leave it in for 3 minutes as directed then use my regular rich smoothing conditioner on the hair ends up to the scalp. Seems like a lot of work but I notice my hair growing so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any marked improvement, been using it for over a month.</li>
            <li> Can see thicker hair and new hair after one month.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price was comparable to local salons. It arrived quickly and packaged well. I have only been using the product several weeks ,so really don&#x27;t see much difference in my hair. It takes several months to make a valued statement about it&#x27;s action. I hope for new growth and healthier hair. My hair came back very thin in patches after chemotherapy almost 2 yrs ago.</li>
            <li> this is my second purchase of this kit. after using the system for a few months i have indeed noticed a difference. i was not so naive as to expect a thick mop of hair from using this product, but i did experience a very definite decrease in the amount of hair i was losing everyday. i don&#x27;t know if it makes the scalp healthier or the hair itself stronger, but i am not losing my hair at the alarming rate i was 3 months ago, &amp; i think i even have as much hair now as i did before i started losing too much of it daily. these products are easy to use, &amp; the shampoo has a pleasant, fresh peppermint fragrance. i have short hair so this kit actually lasts me a few months at 2-3 washings a week. i was afraid at the price of this product that i would be wasting my money, but here i am -- sold on it &amp; purchasing it again. i may never change from it as it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
            <li> It dries out your hair . I live in a very arid climate and need a little moisture in my conditioner . This left my hair dry and brittle .</li>
            <li> Trusting that it is going to work,  have only used it a few times,</li>
            <li> System 3 works better in my opinion for hair growth but the foam in system 4 really does add volume and strength to my hair. I think I&#x27;ll go back to system 3 but this is still a good product.</li>
            <li> My scalp had a sever reaction. Still has not cleared up. I stopped using it immediately. Not sure why this happened.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I ordered more</li>
            <li> So far it is an excellent product for my fine hair.  It has pumped the volume /looks thicker and healthier !</li>
            <li> This product really didn&#x27;t improve the thickness of my hair as I had expected based on the claims made by the manufacturer. Plus it smells heavily minty which is a weird fragrance for a hair care product. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but it works!</li>
            <li> Husband uses it faithfully.  A lot cheaper than buying it at the beauty shop.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This hair care system is great for thinning hair. Plus I have a genetic disorder that effects my hair and the Nioxin is gentle on what hair I do have. Thanks. I have been using it for a year and it keeps my hair from breaking and does thicken it.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased. I noticed a difference In a month. The product did what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> I have thyroid problems which wreck havoc on my hair. Nioxin always seems to get my hair back into shape. I like having it delivered to my home.</li>
            <li> This really works. In just one month, my hair is thicker and fuller.  I tried other products for a year and nothing else worked</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference</li>
            <li> Great product seems to be working so far so good almost 30 days now notice a difference!</li>
            <li> I have not been using this product long enough to write a review on it&#x27;s effectiveness, I did however wish to inform any potential buyers about the size of this product. I bought this product assuming it was the full size, and I was disappointed to see how tiny the bottles of product were. It&#x27;s my fault for not double checking the amount of product before ordering. If I had realized how small the bottles were, I would have ordered elsewhere, as I have found prices MUCH cheaper for the same thing.</li>
            <li> I used these products for 6-7 weeks and didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in thickness or volume. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this system again....and I also didn&#x27;t like the scent of the shampoo....it smells medicinal.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing different than regular shampoo. It states it&#x27;s for noticeably thinning hair, I beg to differ. After using it myself, I see no difference to my hair. I agree it might smell nice, but so does a lot of shampoos. It states it helps remove the sebum so the hair follicles can breathe and grow new hair, not true! It&#x27;s basically an expensive way to cleanse your hair. Try using a biotin shampoo and conditioner, works just as well. I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend or purchase again, was a waste of $30.</li>
            <li> It seems to provide a little more body to my hair, and that makes it seem a little thicker.  Other reviews indicate that good results happen with consistent use over a few weeks.  So far, I am happy!</li>
            <li> Bio in system really works. Significant hair regrowth occurred within four months. I followed the product instructions and highly recommend that you try it.</li>
            <li> It is really too early to tell.  It takes time for results to be clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product over a year and think it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I have been using for 2 months and cannot believe the difference! Tons of new growth in my part area, as well as my bang area! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin hair products for over 3 years.  It definitely is not the same formula.  I called Nioxin customer service &amp; told them I didn&#x27;t get the tingly feeling as I did before.  She said they added things to counteract the tingling because people compained it felt like it was burning.  Well......I think they changed more than that.  It makes my hair way to soft, no body at all.  Too bad they changed the formula.  I will not be using anymore......a waste of money.  Also, they have a list of things required in order to get your money back.  They certainly don&#x27;t care about customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> If you are a female suffering from severe hair loss. This product is a most try before resorting to more extreme and expensive measures.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I have used it before. This purchase was excellent because of the price. I will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> Didnt&#x27;t do anything for me after 40 days. Matter of fact I think it made it worse</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give a fair review of this product because it will take time to see the results. My thinning hair was primarily due to a recent surgery. I understand that people tend to lose some hair up to six months following anesthesia. It does clean, condition and make my scalp feel cool, but I don&#x27;t know if it is helping the problem.&lt;br /&gt;​</li>
            <li> I typically do not leave reviews, but I would highly recommend this product, this is my second time using it after a few years..and after 2 weeks I am seeing &#x27;new growth&#x27; along my edges where my hair is more apt to come out due to stress.. (multi-racial with multi-textured hair/curly).</li>
            <li> Honestly, I can&#x27;t say that I see much difference. But it is better than any other product out there.</li>
            <li> It is for chemically treated hair ex hair colored</li>
            <li> Still in the process of using it but I am hopeful!</li>
            <li> Ordered it for my mom and she loves it and has ordered more! So far she has used two kits and just recently ordered some more shampoo.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t give it any higher because I have only been using a short while . I will give you another review if I decide to continue and order again.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty expensive for those on fixed income</li>
            <li> Wonderful products and it really does help my very noticeably thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased Nioxin after seeing how much hair I lost during chemo treatment.  I like the way my hair feels after washing it.  Not sure that my hair looks any thicker however; I believe Nioxin stimulates growth and it is too early to determine that benefit.</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair product I have ever used.  It made my hair dry, stiff, and brittle.  I could not get a comb nor a brush through through my hair.  The results was my hair falling out more than before I began using it.</li>
            <li> good price compared to hairdresser,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with the results of this product.  My hair is fuller, softer and full of body!!  And I love that it is delivered right to my door without me having to go to a salon to buy it.</li>
            <li> After the first wash i could feel a difference in my hair. love it . After two weeks my hair looks and feel s thicker and healthier. will definitely be purchasing the larger bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin for about 5 months to help my thinning, rapidly-shedding hair. It hasn&#x27;t made any difference at all. The conditioner doesn&#x27;t make my hair soft unless I use a huge handful of it at a time. I use another conditioner on the length of my hair. I also didn&#x27;t like how the shampoo in this package is so much bigger than the conditioner. I had to buy more conditioner to keep up with the shampoo. I don&#x27;t think it helps with thinning hair. I will keep using it until it all runs out but I doubt I will see any increase in thickness or fullness, especially because my hair won&#x27;t stop shedding by the handful.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li> Stopped my hair from breaking out almost immediately. However, hair does not good &amp;#34;great,&amp;#34; it just looks like normal which is better than frizzy and all over the couch. I look forward to seeing what continued use will do for me.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know that it is worth the price</li>
            <li> Terrible. Arrived open. All of the contents leaked out. No packing slip.</li>
            <li> Great product as always!</li>
            <li> as described, received quickly</li>
            <li> I like what it says it will do, but I haven&#x27;t used it yet . . . . .</li>
            <li> It has started to grow back. Been 2 weeks:) Yeah@</li>
            <li> So far, I like the idea that this product could work. However, it is too soon to tell. I&#x27;ll use it until it is gone then review.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well.  Have some hair loss from medication, and this seems to be slowing the loss.  WOrked better than expected.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a few week but haven&#x27;t not to much of a difference yet. Only complaint  is the conditioner in and waiting longer than the shampoo</li>
            <li> These products are fantastic!!</li>
            <li> Shampoo makes hair feel very clean. Rinse, only a little needed, takes tangles out. Hair treatment gives hair a fullness to it. Use every day. Can&#x27;t beat the price from Amazon either. $15-20 more in Ulta and Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I would like to see my hair stop falling into the sink while I am drying it</li>
            <li> The person I bought this product for lives it and had been a regular user for some time.</li>
            <li> This really is as good as people say! My hair was thinning a ton after having extensions for years and coloring it every 8-10 weeks.  It&#x27;s a bit expensive in the full sizes, and I had no idea if I&#x27;d like it or not, so the starter kit is the perfect way to see how it works for you.  I noticed a HUGE difference in the thickness and health of my hair and it was growing like a weed!  Purchased the bigger sizes when I ran out of these products and it is worth every penny!  And I can&#x27;t say enough about the smell and how it feels on your head in the shower! It&#x27;s a really nice minty smell that slightly tingles when it&#x27;s on your head...makes you feel like it&#x27;s working immediately! I buy the 4 which I think is the strongest, just because I wanted the strongest ingredients to work faster haha.  And they do! To each their own with what strength works best for you, but I wasn&#x27;t going bald and the 4 works wonders!</li>
