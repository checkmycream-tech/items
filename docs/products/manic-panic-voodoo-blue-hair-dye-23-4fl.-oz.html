            <li>Amazing just ended up looking greenish but still love it</li>
            <li>Worth it, great color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*It&#x27;s strong!  </li>
            <li>mostly blue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>Of all the manic panic I&#x27;ve used, this one has the most color bleeding out.</li>
            <li>On medium brown hair the color looks more like an aqua green-blue.</li>
            <li>Every length of my hair (which is kind of long) was brilliant blue/green (</li>
            <li>works great  a nice blue that fades into a lighter shade</li>
            <li>Color goes on easy.</li>
            <li>, it will look amazing; exactly as it does on the hair model on Manic Panic&#x27;s official site.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair a beautiful blue!</li>
            <li>Works great, jar comes with a pretty good amount and you can alter the shade by applying more or less.</li>
            <li>I would suggest this to anyone who wants their hair a wonderful sky blue!</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll worth buying this!</li>
            <li>I had to bleach mines, TOTALLY worth it!</li>
            <li>It DOES tend to get everywhere, so be sure to do it in the shower or protect your area first.</li>
            <li>Quick ship, one of my favourite dye brands.</li>
            <li>and it came very fast!</li>
            <li>Love this dye because It has no harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li>I had been using SE BHF (light primary blue)</li>
            <li>you bleach your hair first</li>
            <li>So be prepared to get looks and stares, which in my personal experience, have been mostly positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I REALLY love this color blue, it had a Teal undertone to it.</li>
            <li>in fact, it conditions your hair, because they assume you&#x27;ll be bleaching it first.</li>
            <li>Have some bleach cleaner ready when you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This dye fades ridiculously fast.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t bleach your hair, the color is still strong enough to stick to your hair and give some great highlights in the sun, however, on dark blonde/brown hair it will appear more green than the blue it was intended to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Which is particularly a bummer because the shade is also one of the best-looking blues they have.</li>
            <li>its should.. :) get 5/6 washes before any fading if you leave it in at least 3 hours and hit it with a hair dryer 10 mins on 20 off...</li>
            <li>As noted, without bleaching the color is not the vibrant blue as you would expect.</li>
            <li>My ends are completely bleached (ombre-style) but my roots and lengths are just slightly lightened with a less potent blonde metallic box dye I bought at the local drug store.  </li>
            <li>color seems to fade little fast but as manic panic is a semi perment</li>

            <li> Worth it, great color.</li>
            <li> color as shown and worked great!</li>
            <li> So bright!  I had been using SE BHF (light primary blue) and it just wasn&#x27;t sticking in my hair at all.  Fed up with it, I decided to try MP Voodoo Blue.  I had my eye on it for some time but was worried the green tones  would overshadow the blue.  My ends are completely bleached (ombre-style) but my roots and lengths are just slightly lightened with a less potent blonde metallic box dye I bought at the local drug store.  I didn&#x27;t want to mess up the integrity of the new growth but I needed to lighten a little so the dye would stick.  I put this stuff in the other night, following instructions verbatim so I didn&#x27;t mess anything up.  Got out of the shower, looked in the mirror and was blown away.  The dye stuck very very well to my hair and it was BRILLIANT bright and beautiful.  Every length of my hair (which is kind of long) was brilliant blue/green (mostly blue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who have considered this color but haven&#x27;t yet decided, here are a few things you need to know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*If you bleach your hair first, it will look amazing; exactly as it does on the hair model on Manic Panic&#x27;s official site.

Kind of wish I could post a picture or something.</li>
            <li> I love this it&#x27;s awesome!! It turned out awesome very nice color and it came very fast! We&#x27;ll worth buying this! I will being buying again!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It made my hair a beautiful blue! I would suggest this to anyone who wants their hair a wonderful sky blue! I mix this product with a conditioner to make it go further. If you have longer hair (past your shoulders/ to your breasts or pecks) or thicker hair I would suggest getting two of these. I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> This dye fades ridiculously fast. In my bleached hair it faded within two days and with my sons unbleached hair it took less than a day.</li>
            <li> It works great on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be getting all my hair dye by manic panic.&lt;br /&gt;All colors are my favorite!</li>
            <li> I REALLY love this color blue, it had a Teal undertone to it. Color works Best the lighter your hair color. I had to bleach mines, TOTALLY worth it!</li>
            <li> Love it.. color seems to fade little fast but as manic panic is a semi perment its should.. :) get 5/6 washes before any fading if you leave it in at least 3 hours and hit it with a hair dryer 10 mins on 20 off... works great  a nice blue that fades into a lighter shade</li>
            <li> Love this dye because It has no harsh chemicals! My hair was blue for a long while!</li>
            <li> Manic Panic is the only hair dye I ever use. It has no chemicals, no fumes - in fact, it conditions your hair, because they assume you&#x27;ll be bleaching it first. The color lasts forever but is very easy to bleach out. It DOES tend to get everywhere, so be sure to do it in the shower or protect your area first.</li>
            <li> Of all the manic panic I&#x27;ve used, this one has the most color bleeding out. Which is particularly a bummer because the shade is also one of the best-looking blues they have.</li>
            <li> Color goes on easy. As noted, without bleaching the color is not the vibrant blue as you would expect. On medium brown hair the color looks more like an aqua green-blue. Seems to be lasting at lease three weeks with washings 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> Works great, jar comes with a pretty good amount and you can alter the shade by applying more or less.</li>
            <li> Quick ship, one of my favourite dye brands. Vegan, doesn&#x27;t harm hair as much as other dyes.</li>
