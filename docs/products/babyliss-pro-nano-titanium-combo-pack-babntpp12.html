            <li> , I was a little afraid that the Hair Iron was going to be too small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about the small blow dryer, but I have a LOT of hair, and take my full-size blow dryer even when we travel.</li>

            <li> my hair got caught on the miniature hair blower and the flat iron was too thick for my liking</li>
            <li> just dont use it in Europe because of the voltage difference and it will ruin the product! It only takes 10 min to straighten your hair!</li>
            <li> The babyliss combo pack is AWESOME! I am very much happy with both, the product and the supplier!  The shipping was very fast!  I do recommend you to go ahead with your purchase.  I had no problem at all! Thank you!</li>
            <li> works great and is small enough that it&#x27;s good to travel with.  our hairdresser recommended the brand, and we like it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!!&lt;br /&gt;this is very easy to use and easy to carry. This is very useful for you and your hair.</li>
            <li> My wife says the product is excellent, rapid heating, the plate is passed only two or three times and voila, straight hair is left for at least two days. Add to this a great dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was in less time than expected. The product came well packed</li>
            <li> I LOVE this straightener!  It is nice to have adjustable heat settings, and it is so smooth and easy to use! I haven&#x27;t used the trimmers, but they seem like they&#x27;ll be a nice travel set for my husband.  I&#x27;m not too crazy about the small blow dryer, but I have a LOT of hair, and take my full-size blow dryer even when we travel. I tried it out just to see, and it does get the job done. Overall, a great set at an even greater price!</li>
            <li> Muy buena la plancha, tengo el cabello crespo y con mi anterior plancha demoraba el doble de tiempo que con esta y no solo eso, sino que me queda mas liso. Me gusta mucho. Y el secador de cabello aun no lo he probado. Espero obtener un buen resultado igual.</li>
