            <li>Best trimmer</li>
            <li>the best feature about this item is it doesn&#x27;t give you razor bumps.</li>
            <li>but it is a great addition to my set!</li>
            <li>But the clipper itself is perfect.</li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>

            <li>Wonderful clippers.</li>
            <li>Superb quality, delivered on time</li>
            <li>The best deal and best haircut yet.</li>
            <li>I knocked off a star for the heat and noise because in my mind a perfect rating has to be earned, not given just for doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE CLIPPERS!!!</li>
            <li>Oster makes excellent products all the time and this clipper is one nice machine!!  </li>
            <li>I rate them as a very good buy.</li>
            <li>Very good.  </li>
            <li>Also, the combs don&#x27;t do a very good job.  </li>
            <li>very good clipper.</li>
            <li>But one thing the plastic heads do not stay on very good.</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>this model is VERY good for the price .</li>
            <li>A very good clipper.</li>

            <li>Very good quality</li>
            <li>Very good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>She used the techniques we saw on YouTube that involved using the guide combs and the results were very good.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, works great.</li>
            <li>I spoke to a couple barbers and they agreed that it&#x27;s not the ideal tool for beard trimming and styling.  </li>
            <li>Great product...not the best for a close shaved head.</li>
            <li>Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li>Definitely good buy!</li>
            <li>We are delighted!</li>
            <li>He absolutely loved them!</li>
            <li>Excellent product and good value, used twice per week for over a year with no problems.</li>
            <li>Purrs like a kitten, cuts beautifully, looks and feels like quality merchandise.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the cuts were because the blades weren&#x27;t perfectly aligned, but either way still not as good as the Osters.  </li>
            <li>very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>The clippers did a great job when I cut my husband&#x27;s hair.  </li>

            <li>Another great product from Oster</li>
            <li>I was not that happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know a couple of friends who cut their own hair, so I started to research which would be the best clippers for a beginner to buy.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>

            <li>I came to this quite by accident, but I&#x27;m happy to have discovered this no maintenance summer haircut for my son.  </li>

            <li>Great price and a well made clipper.  </li>

            <li>-in-all after about 5 years of owning this clipper and over 1000 haircuts with it, I can honestly say this was probably the best investment I ever made.  </li>

            <li>I had another Oster model that I bought about 1976 for about $25 at Sears and it worked great for almost 40 years until I dropped it on the floor and smashed it into pieces a month ago.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s very nice.  </li>
            <li>(Reason for the 4 v 5 rating) I did buy the attachments that are sold separately and they are amazing!</li>

            <li>I love these clippers they are perfect for tapering and even fading i would recommend these clippers to anyone!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Suffice it to say, we are very happy with our clippers and are so glad we bought them.</li>
            <li>The clippers work GREAT for my husband and surprisingly, also on our dog.</li>
            <li>Co-workers, family, and friends were all customers of mine and they were most impressed with the job I did as well as the smootheness of the clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Very good price too:)</li>
            <li>We thought those were good clippers until we used the Oster clippers.</li>
            <li>They do a good job for the price.  </li>
            <li>This was a good buy.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a good clipper for professionals.    </li>
            <li>The attachments are good.  </li>

            <li>I think the price is fair.</li>
            <li>I knew Oster was a good make</li>
            <li>I recommend this to all, Beginners to expert.. keep up the good work</li>
            <li>It arrived in record time and at an exceedingly good price.  </li>

            <li>They are too good to be tried on the poodle.</li>
            <li>the clippers were good but didn&#x27;t work well with attachments.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really good clippers.  </li>

            <li>This is good stuff.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I was hesitant to use something with a cord, but I attached this cord to a good extension cord and there was no problem at all doing it where I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Not as good a job as the reviews lead me to believe but still</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a good pay-off.  </li>

            <li>Good investment,</li>
            <li>(a good thing)</li>
            <li>The original Oster operated flawlessly for 27 years.</li>
            <li>These clippers are very good and cut hair easily.  </li>
            <li>Strong motor and very good quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use this without any extenders, but it does not give a super close trim.... if you want to go truly bald... this is not the best clippers for doing that.</li>
            <li>It comes with a variety of guards for differing lengths and is exceptional for hair and beards.</li>
            <li>I can cut my husband&#x27;s hair vey quick and it looks great!</li>
            <li>Very light and quite clipper that cuts very precise!!</li>

            <li>By contrast, these things cut almost perfectly the FIRST TIME!</li>
            <li>We used a cheap Wahl clipper for years and didn&#x27;t take very good care of it.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with it with one exception, the cord.</li>

            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>These were a bit more but had great reviews.  </li>
            <li>Still have for many years, works great.</li>
            <li>i would say it is ok,, nothing great</li>
            <li>Works flawless and can tell it&#x27;s quality by the build just make sure you get a good sanitizing and cleaning spray for after use to keep the blades lubricated and running free of clogs.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I went with these.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the way it worked on his hair too.</li>
            <li>Great clippers the size and weight are outstanding.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sure the dog was happy to get out of it anyway.)</li>
            <li>Very pleased with clippers</li>
            <li>I have a golden and am having difficulty getting the knack of blending, but for trimming fur on the belly and between the pads of her paws, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Good weight, nice feel in your hands.</li>
            <li>Very strong motor and good blades.</li>
            <li>But I bought these, and love em!</li>
            <li>Outstanding customer service!</li>

            <li>I love this clipper!</li>
            <li>This clippers are awesome, well made,and  they don&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li>Love these clippers!</li>
            <li>Love these clippers!</li>
            <li>Hope to have these for many years to come!</li>
            <li>I love these clippers!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>I love this clipper!  </li>
            <li>Great pricing and easy to use.</li>
            <li>the guards that come with it are just fine and work great</li>
            <li>Does a GREAT job on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>And as a result, it&#x27;s effectiveness may largely depend on which personality best meshes with your process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The weight is fine for managing one handed with a cord, and they have a good heft, giving me a good sense of a substantial motor.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not fond of the guards, but then I don&#x27;t use them for the length I want.&lt;br</li>
            <li>What was I thinking these are what the pros use and they are amazing.</li>
            <li>The motor is great, runs smooth</li>
            <li>this clipper was amazing and worked like the day I got it.  </li>
            <li>Amazing clipper</li>
            <li>Works amazing.</li>
            <li>the gradient is amazing and it never cuts my skin.</li>
            <li>All of the techniques that I used before to make him look better seem to me now like an effort to disguise the lack of a good clipper.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so would have liked a comb for 1 inch.</li>
            <li>I was getting people saying the haircut looks nice even though I could tell (because I scrutinized) that I screwed up.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just have nice friends(or</li>
            <li>He uses it without the attachments, and it gives him a nice, close cut.  </li>
            <li>These Oster clippers are in a class of their own.</li>
            <li>but I rigged that on my own.</li>
            <li>They cut nicely.</li>
            <li>Mine is the kind that if there&#x27;s no hair gel in it, it flops around in the slightest breeze.</li>
            <li>but they are the absolute best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Did a nice job.</li>
            <li>gets the job done and feels nice and sturdy, no frills, no frustration.</li>
            <li>Their vinyl bag is nice, too.</li>
            <li>They never snagged and they cut really nice and evenly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I invested in a good hair clipper.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair</li>
            <li>I honestly wish I could return it</li>
            <li>You could tell it used to be nice at one point.</li>
            <li>The even level of the cut seems way superior to Wahl and leagues better than the crappy Conair clippers.  </li>
            <li>glad oster still makes a good product.</li>
            <li>I ordered the razor to do my own burr haircuts.  </li>
            <li>Cut my own hair with additional combs I ordered.</li>
            <li>i also own an andis fade master</li>
            <li>So, I decided to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>Now my boys are doing their own hair and it is standing up to the abuse of teens.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving my own hair since the 7th grade</li>
            <li>Nicely made.</li>
            <li>Cut your own hair and save the hassle and money.</li>
            <li>I can set this clipper at the length I like without attachments and buzz my own head with the help of a hand held mirror.</li>
            <li>Like anything if you treat it nice, it will treat you nice.</li>
            <li>have found that for my uses the Oster Fast feed is not an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>I cut my own hair</li>
            <li>and it does the job nicely.</li>
            <li>These clippers are really nice.</li>
            <li>Best used after cleaning hair and combing it straight.</li>
            <li>I have cut my own hair two times with them and a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>to add my own take after reading the reviews -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>clippers did get quite warm...</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my Oster Fast Feed Clippers.  </li>
            <li>But now with this oster I have build my confidence and started doing my own fade haircut.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The Oster Fast feed is probably one of the best adjustable clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I am adding my enthusiastic approval to the pile.  </li>
            <li>and I cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>I currently own whal and andis clippers ,but have never owned oster clipper</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buzzing my own hair for about 12 years now.</li>
            <li>I do my own hair once a week</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband to do his own buzzcuts.  </li>
            <li>We learned how to cut our own hair and used them for about a year.  </li>
            <li>He and his roommates are very happy with this Oster Prof Fast Feed Clipper.  </li>
            <li>These are quieter and cut nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice price</li>
            <li>gives me a nice even cut.  </li>
            <li>On one believes i cut my own hair</li>
            <li>At a reasonable price, it provides excellent value</li>
            <li>Nice weight to it.</li>
            <li>so I purchased my own set of clippers.</li>
            <li>We hope to get a lot of use out of this nice trimmer.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it came with some kind of case</li>
            <li>I thought I might as well invest in my own clipper and save money by doing it myself.</li>
            <li>Price was within my budget, others have liked also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Wahl clipper for years now, as I cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>so I may not ever need the combs.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a really nice precision cut too,</li>
            <li>The Oster fast feed is one of the best clippers you can get period.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it came with a bag or container too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been clippering my own head for 20 years and never had clippers act like this.</li>
            <li>they get the job done nicely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give them a 4 as some type of case would have been nice.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to everyone who needs a nice set of clippers.</li>
            <li>It runs perfectly and cuts really well.</li>
            <li>and then they start to warm up.  </li>
            <li>wish the cord was just a bit longer, and it would&#x27;ve been nice if it came with a case of some kind, as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li>Very nice quality and the accessories are fine, too.  </li>
            <li>keep these clean and oiled and you will have a great clipper for years.</li>
            <li>Excellent clippers, highly recommend</li>
            <li>My really cheap but GREAT old trimmer from Best Buy died after about 25 years of service.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find that to be true, but they&#x27;re great nonetheless.</li>

            <li>Very easy to use.</li>

            <li>By far the best clippers I have ever purchased</li>
            <li>good product, that has a couple of cheap features on it.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it came with more attachments, but no deduction since that&#x27;s how it was described in the listing.</li>

            <li>So far so good!!</li>
            <li>My son cuts his own hair and this clipper iss a durable appliance that will be used for many years.</li>
            <li>I was honestly expecting something a lot better and regret the purchase.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to have more guards instead of just the four it comes with.</li>
            <li>I trim a beard with it......same great product, just thew right amount of power.</li>
            <li>will cut right through your hair for a even cut also use them for my beard which work great.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Update on May 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair clipper is still going strong!</li>
            <li>I got excellent service out of it and it last many years!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice, smoothly operating clipper that does not pull or snag hair, and is easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>I have many cheaper Wahl clippers over the years, and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>There are a lot of professional clippers that I&#x27;m sure are wonderful</li>
            <li>Excellent for a skilled professional.</li>
            <li>The clippers work flawlessly and far better than the cheapo ones I purchased 10 years</li>
            <li>best clippers for do it at home haircuts and i am sure professionally as well.  </li>
            <li>cuts great, very fast blade.</li>
            <li>You can cut your hair very fast and still have a great looking haircut.</li>
            <li>I cut my 2 sons hair with clipper never had a issue, specially For the price I thought it was a good choice.</li>
            <li>skills weren&#x27;t great with it the first time.</li>
            <li>Great clippers, they work very well!     </li>
            <li>I cut hair all day and never gets to hot to hold ,great with the andis magnetic gaurds</li>
            <li>I am happy with them and the first time I used them it paid for itself.</li>
            <li>It works well even with my fine arm hair!</li>
            <li>I used it and it was VERY VERY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>They cut very smoothly; there is no pulling</li>
            <li>This is a very IMPORTANT step because it prevents rust , which will reduce your edge which in turn starts nagging hair.</li>
            <li>The closest it will go is leaving a very very light shadow.  </li>
            <li>Gives a very smooth haircut</li>
            <li>I use the 000 setting, and it was very smooth going over the skin.</li>
            <li>Very light in weight and a prefect compliment to my Andis Fade Masters.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product because it cuts very smoothly.</li>
            <li>I have cut my own hair for 20 years and this is the first good pair of clipper I have owned.</li>
            <li>I think these are nice and strong clippers.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes we get overzealous when we find a good product, but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re exagerating when we make the claim that these are super clippers.  </li>
            <li>These clippers made it easy for me to cut my own</li>
            <li>Love the Clippers very precise</li>
            <li>It has almost been two years since i purchased this clipper, and so far its been very good to me.</li>
            <li>So far the durability has been very good</li>
            <li>and it was a huge mistake!</li>
            <li>Love this Clipper, have no issues with this been a year now since i have it</li>
            <li>That worked better.</li>
            <li>A lot better than Wahl.</li>
            <li>I am 100% pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to any person looking for a top quality consumer grade clipper.</li>
            <li>I used various techniques to make his hair look at its best</li>
            <li>and I now love to give my husband a haircut.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make my husbands hair grow faster to make me use it more often....</li>
            <li>I just wish it had more attachments with it.  </li>
            <li>I have already recomended it to many family members and friends.</li>
            <li>I found myself much more dexterous with the took and more confident in my and the clipper&#x27;s abilities.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even recall how I snagged such a great price on this!</li>
            <li>It worked okay, but not as well as our Wahl.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve since purchased another inexpensive Wahl clipper, and it works much better.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be best suited for basic use, like giving someone a buzz cut.  </li>
            <li>I can say i got every penny out of them and more, but its time to move on.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>This also gives a better, neater, more even cut.  </li>
            <li>Now i&#x27;ve been going to a barber for many years, and I get a Taper hair cut which runs about 17 bucks.</li>
            <li>and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love this clipper.</li>
            <li>I guess because the blade is adjustable, but I&#x27;d recommend buying additional attachments for more variety.</li>
            <li>No complaints, faster, better haircuts and it&#x27;s made in the USA.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i wish clippers would come with a more flexible cord, which none seem to do.</li>
            <li>I love it since the day I got it.</li>
            <li>I looked around at clippers and figured I would only be buying this once and would buy the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this unit.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had the clippers for a couple months, but they work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>and I expect many years of service.</li>
            <li>We are definitely satisfied.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it will cost alot more.</li>
            <li>These clippers are really outstanding.  </li>
            <li>It costs more</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews, I decided to get this one.  </li>
            <li>One more cut and it will have paid for itself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them many times over a couple of years, on me and on dogs.</li>
            <li>It pays for itself tenfold or more.</li>
            <li>I give myself a standard buzzcut sometimes and the included 3/8 and 1/4 guides work perfectly for that</li>
            <li>&gt;* more durable attachments - the set they sell ($25) is more than most clippers</li>
            <li>and we are enjoying them.  </li>
            <li>I do think these are good quality clippers that probably are great for a specific purpose in a barber&#x27;s arsenal of tools.  </li>
            <li>These clippers are outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Feels much more substantial than cheaper models bought at Walmart, Target, etc.  </li>
            <li>I moved the top blade a bit</li>
            <li>I was thinking this would be so much better and quieter</li>
            <li>The problem is that when cleaning it, if you remove all of the screws to remove the cut hairs more than 4-5 times, the screws no longer hold their grip because the grooves are in plastic and break off.</li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>and I am so glad I listened.</li>
            <li>i was especting it to cut more shorter or cleaner</li>
            <li>and I would probably give it 5 if it was made better.</li>
            <li>I know these may not be better than the Andis Masters</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s practical and looks cute.  </li>
            <li>This works so much better.</li>
            <li>and I get better and faster results with a 15 dollar pair of WAHL.</li>
            <li>Even with out the attachments it had to be shaved many times over for it to cut most of the hair.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Wahl was better quality, but, still didn&#x27;t seem to give an even cut.  </li>
            <li>Great clipper with fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I love these clippers.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to write a review of this product as I have been the proud owner of one for over 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was easily able to give about 5 haircuts an hour.  </li>
            <li>Just wish I was a better cat groomer.  </li>
            <li>but I am glad I chose this clipper.</li>
            <li>I cut my hair and that of my son every two - three weeks ,My son love it because it never pull and it glides through effortlessly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought Wahl clippers that were 10x better than these</li>
            <li>(Looks and feels a lot better</li>
            <li>with okay guards</li>
            <li>I will purchase more for grooming my dog.</li>
            <li>It has paid for itself many times over.</li>
            <li>Much better than any Wahls I ever owned.</li>
            <li>Greatest clipper ever used really quiet</li>
            <li>The Oster feels way more durable.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I use it to trim my cats and its just ok.</li>
            <li>though I use it without guides as I want buzz cut...should come with more attachments for the price</li>
            <li>This was used for sure</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>But a friend bought these and recommended, and my wife and I are glad he did.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and the cheap stuff from drugs stores wasn&#x27;t getting it done anymore.</li>
            <li>Love love love these clippers.</li>
            <li>I look forward to many years of service and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>These clippers are orders of magnitude better that any of the $15 to $20 clippers we&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Buying a hair clipper is the most rewarding home economy tip.</li>
            <li>so I thought Oster will be faster and better to do fading</li>
            <li>more could you want?</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not a problem, more of an irritant.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>So far these have fit the bill perfectly for my needs.</li>
            <li>I love love love my clippers.</li>
            <li>More than I care to admit.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think many people will get to it.</li>
            <li>I think it does a good job, but think she was looking for one that was a bit more powerful.</li>
            <li>Most around $20.  </li>
            <li>I was able with lots of nursing to cut my hair</li>
            <li>Either way i&#x27;m glad i have both.</li>
            <li>and i like them, but after using the Andis, i&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>Could come with a more comprehensive comb set.</li>
            <li>I have been barbering for many years and these clippers just make my job easier.</li>
            <li>so even better.</li>
            <li>Although I was the cutter not the cutter, even cleanup was so much better.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend buying the add on attachments if you want more variety in lengths.</li>
            <li>Oster clipper quality is top notch.</li>
            <li>I had a Oster clipper before and used it for more than 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve had many clippers before this one and this one is definitely the best.</li>
            <li>I wanted more.  </li>
            <li>i wish i had bought this years ago.&lt;br /&gt;far better than the wahl trimmer i have just thrown in the trash.</li>
            <li>I am glad I got it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s astonishing.    </li>
            <li>The durability alone would make the price point worthwhile.</li>
            <li>But this Oster has held up for me very well, and I&#x27;m extremely happy with</li>
            <li>These are way better.</li>
            <li>I love the blending comb attachment.</li>
            <li>I think if you buy these clippers you will be glad you did.  </li>
            <li>Oster clippers work better, cooler.</li>
            <li>are a way better design than the Oster guards with clip on.</li>
            <li>I had a cheaper brand and it worked ok.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and I have been using the cheap clippers which pull your hair out.</li>
            <li>This is the best haircutting regiman I have ever had and see no reason that I will change in the future.</li>
            <li>The motor is ok.. ..</li>
            <li>For the quality and price you can&#x27;t do much better.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews, I decided to try the Oster (paid $55 for it).  </li>
            <li>I decided to invest in a better pair of clippers.  </li>
            <li>DOES IN MY OPINION BETTER JOB THAN THE WAHL SENIOR&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to many more years of faithful Oster service from my well-maintained clippers.  </li>
            <li>I love these things.</li>
            <li>It is so much better than store bought clippers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just nice to have quality rather than the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>It cuts better than any wahl i&#x27;ve ever had but the whisper-quiet motor is a bunch of B***S</li>
            <li>These guards are better than the guards that come with the clippers.</li>
            <li>It could come with more clipping guards though.</li>
            <li>I think it is better than the Wahl but time will tell.</li>
            <li>, I can definitely say I made a great choice!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have this clipper for years to come.</li>
            <li>I love these clippers</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re hesitating, on the fence about investing in a better quality clipper, I suggest you go for it.  </li>
            <li>Compared to a Conair, this thing is not only a joy to use, but gives superior buzzes, too.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this clipper.</li>
            <li>This clipper did the job, made nice smooth cuts.  </li>
            <li>So clippers are an important tool in our house!  </li>
            <li>We looked at many.</li>
            <li>Be sure and pick up some oil for it as well from Oster.</li>
            <li>So I use scissors on top, electric shears everywhere else.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cuts rather than pulls my hair and has a better build quality.</li>
            <li>We are totally pleased.  </li>
            <li>Overall, great clippers for the price!</li>
            <li>good price,weight but not so powerful...</li>
            <li>One more haircut</li>
            <li>and it looks a lot better.</li>
            <li>and i love the fact that it is electric and don&#x27;t have to charge it beforehand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than satisfied.</li>
            <li>This model appears to have a better switch and an added plus is the support of the cord at the clipper.</li>
            <li>better than advertised.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I chose these</li>
            <li>work good, not as good as using metal blade attachments like professional clippers</li>
            <li>just okay.  </li>
            <li>We were even able to take the comb off and trim his mustache.</li>
            <li>We have used these clippers a handful of times since receiving them and I am mostly satisfied.  </li>
            <li>This was one of the best products I&#x27;ve bought online recently.</li>
            <li>An excellent deal for the low price.</li>
            <li>This device pays for itself in a short time - an excellent investment.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it works</li>
            <li>But for the price of 20-30 some bucks to replace every year or so, it was ok.  </li>
            <li>Definitely better than a cheapo set.  </li>
            <li>Its ok,not like the way it was written in the review i read about it being the 3rd best hair clipper</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great product, as described, now i just hope it holds up to its reviews.</li>
            <li>This one works much better.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>On top of that, just using them to shave my face</li>
            <li>I wish they came with more guide combs</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s soo much better and easier</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>sure to purchase some sort of blade wash with this - blade wash</li>
            <li>They are so quiet, and yet do the job perfect.</li>
            <li>Much much better quality than the andis and whal trimmer</li>
            <li>My son and I love the quietness of it too.</li>
            <li>It has paid for itself many times over.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m looking forward to never paying for a haircut again :-)</li>
            <li>Use it every week and everytime I&#x27;m getting better and faster at just getting a buzz cut.  </li>
            <li>Had to order a better assortment of combs, though.  </li>
            <li>The one I bought from Costco for $25 - $30 dollars is so much better.</li>
            <li>The baby liked the smooth vibration and there were no tears this time.</li>
            <li>Ok product when compared to price and quality .</li>
            <li>For a guy that shaves his head about twice a week, I couldn&#x27;t ask for better trimmers.</li>
            <li>Better than the ones they replace.</li>
            <li>Many of the alternatives charged $25.00 to $40.00.  </li>
            <li>My problems with it involve it&#x27;s tendency to accumulate hair on the top of the clipper comb and that reduces it&#x27;s ability to feed and cut hair.  </li>
            <li>I guess most of my problems are &amp;#34;user caused&amp;#34; and I just need to practice more.  </li>
            <li>For the money, it&#x27;s a good deal and worth the cost...</li>
            <li>When I cut my cousin&#x27;s hair I noticed a lil more about the heat.</li>
            <li>I love these clippers.</li>
            <li>This top of the line clipper is everything the description implied it to be.  </li>
            <li>They have yet to give more than two haircuts in a day, but odds are slim that they&#x27;ll see more than that.</li>
            <li>and I love these clippers.</li>
            <li>Stay on top of the maintenance for these clippers and you will&lt;br /&gt;save</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s satisfied and we will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>they work as advertised and cut hair better than the one it replaced</li>
            <li>All Roy had to do was give me a number three on top and a two on the sides.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will figure it out</li>
            <li>And so far, so good!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean, good smooth clipping!  </li>
            <li>does get kind of warm, but not scolding hot.</li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job, cuts through my hair very easily, does an even job, never chokes up.</li>
            <li>great product highly recommeded</li>
            <li>A good quality clipper, much better than those available in most drugstores and well worth its price.  </li>
            <li>The product works very well,  is easy to use and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to handle and cut very precisely.</li>
            <li>The cool thing is that every  time I cut my own hair, I realize that I am saving $15.</li>
            <li>At first this was a good shaver but over times it&#x27;s not shaving as well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the 76 is worth every penny to those with the need, but the Fast Feed seems ideal for home use.</li>
            <li>The first was good, cut well, and lasted 5 or 6 years, till I lost them.  </li>
            <li>good exactly what we wanted....</li>
            <li>Best clippers I&#x27;ve bought in a long time.</li>
            <li>Best investment I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li>Very nice complement to your oster classic 76 if you don&#x27;t already have them.</li>
            <li>First of all, let me say that the experience of making a purchase on Amazon.com was both pleasant and easy.</li>
            <li>Really happy with my new Wahl&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Maybe because it&#x27;s new, but works great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use &amp; love how the blade is adjustable.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding reviews made the choice easy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super picky with the things i own</li>
            <li>Was able to give myself and my son a pro haircut very quickly.</li>
            <li>use this clipper without issues, I am faster, the cut is more precise and it looks better than ever.  </li>
            <li>but these are more precise and offer a better cut all around.  </li>
            <li>I really hope it would that good for more than two yrears</li>
            <li>also looks great; the red in the photo is actually a nice retro burgundy.)</li>
            <li>(Own two sets that both work perfect) highly recommend these clippers for professional use.</li>
            <li>Cuts great so far!</li>
            <li>Leaves a clean cut!</li>
            <li>From the glowing reviews on this product, I can assume they work just fine for most people.  </li>
            <li>Had some $20 Wahl clippers for many years and did the job just fine</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure if I called the company they would have replaced the guard, however it works fine</li>
            <li>A very good buy overall, and aside from have to replace a blade because I dropped it</li>
            <li>This clipper works good, I would have liked it to cut a little shorter, but all in all a good clipper.  </li>
            <li>In compared to the andis&#x27;s polished metal feel, and silky smooth adjuster lever, the oster feel more like a toy than a tool.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I use to have a cheap Conair clipper and they worked better than these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m beyond pleased to see that these clippers are still available.</li>
            <li>purchased the Oster Professional for a friend for a birthday, great product.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, replacement parts are widely available and the design has mostly been unchanged for decades.  </li>
            <li>MY OLD CONAIR RAZOR CASE WORKED OUT GREAT.</li>
            <li>This is as close to professional clippers at a great price that you will ever get.</li>
            <li>Great set of clippers with the classy color.</li>
            <li>So, for what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m sure most people will love the Oster,</li>
            <li>They have a spring mechanism to keep the guard more securely fastened to the clippers.</li>
            <li>This is quiet, fit my hand nice and does a great job.</li>
            <li>They are smooth and give a fantastic cut!</li>
            <li>Great handling with lightweigt professional clippers.  </li>
            <li>I chose this Oster clipper because it had consistently good reviews and a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>In any case to be fair, the clipper has worked very well</li>
            <li>and I really wanted to get a good, long-lasting clipper.  </li>
            <li>If I can offload my fast feeds for a fair price I might have to try to go with a pair of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought the Oster Pro 510 Fast Feed Clipper on a whim (I like good tools).  </li>
            <li>To do a perfect job took me about 30 minutes to cut my hair because you have to make many passes from where the attachments push the hair down and</li>
            <li>My husband has extremely fine hair, so I was a bit concerned that the clippers wouldn&#x27;t be effective and in fact, on the first pass we both thought they didn&#x27;t work because we couldn&#x27;t hear any hair making contact, but sure enough the clippers made a perfect track right up the backside of his head!</li>
            <li>It cuts easily and cleanly and I should have bought it years ago!  </li>
            <li>good weight, cuts great and very sharp.  </li>
            <li>I was really impressed with how quickly they cut and how quiet the motor was.</li>
            <li>It is strong, the grip is good, it clips fast</li>
            <li>(I tried other brands before, and this is clearly the best I experienced)</li>
            <li>Right out of the box, with its own (included) guards, the blades cut through my hair effortlessly.</li>
            <li>easy to use, easy to clean!</li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT, QUIET AND VERY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>Very good, quiet my first haircut was so easy, I did it myself nice and even</li>
            <li>And just a VERY CLEAN SMOOTH CUT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>This is the best $38 I have ever spent!</li>
            <li>Overall good value!</li>
            <li>Talk about quick and easy fades!  </li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t know how crappy my original clippers were until i splurged to buy a better brand and heavier duty clippers.</li>
            <li>Other than that, these are the best clippers I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li>For about twice the price of the cheap one, this is easily ten times the clipper, and a very good value.</li>
            <li>This clipper is affordable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is a very powerful Clipper and cuts very cleanly.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t expect anything better, quiet and strong sounding , great choice on my part</li>
            <li>It was easy: just a couple of minutes with a screwdriver.  </li>
            <li>but it cuts much more cleanly.  </li>
            <li>It cuts well and is easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li>.i know i could not return it or exchange it to better one thtat can clean closer to the blade.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li>I used it to cut my hair and it cuts well and is easy to keep it maintain, Comes with oil.</li>
            <li>lever strips out too easy</li>
            <li>Its easy to hold which makes for easy fading and styling.</li>
            <li>most of the time and one of the smaller attachments does a great job of keeping it in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The adjustable lever that moves the clipper blade along is easy to overextend, and the blades are not interchangeable.</li>
            <li>cut closely and effortlessly and are easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re also a lot quieter than cheaper magnetic motor clippers I have used previously.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The motor is much more powerful than my Andis Master and can cut more evenly than my Andis Master.</li>
            <li>construction and materials.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and easy operation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>go for a cheaper one that will work just as well (or better), or go for a better product that would be worth it.</li>
            <li>But with shears it&#x27;s as easy as mowing the lawn.</li>
            <li>It does however, cut more effectively, I don&#x27;t need to go over it as much.</li>
            <li>so picking up a better, and more quality set of attachments would be useful</li>
            <li>Easy to use, makes an even cut.</li>
            <li>Use them once every couple months to cut my hair, and they make the job so easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and seemed to cut the hair well.</li>
            <li>I bought this 2 years ago and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>I strongly advise getting this instead of the rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend it, strongly.  </li>
            <li>and they are still running strong.  </li>
            <li>This clipper is high quality for a good price.</li>
            <li>Smooth and cuts clean!</li>
            <li>Fantastic tranaction fast shipingtrims up nice love</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this clipper it performs very well.</li>
            <li>quiet, well-made, and works beautifully.</li>
            <li>I would think the Oster fast feed costing more than the Oster Salon pro would be a better hair clipper since it cost more but its not.</li>
            <li>This Oster cuts clean and smooth and that&#x27;s what I like most about it.</li>
            <li>these clippers are awesome very powerful and extremely quiet.i also</li>
            <li>Best of all, the Oster Fast Feed is enormously quieter than anything with a cheap magnetic motor--which makes haircutting much more relaxing.</li>
            <li>great clippers tho real, quiet for the most part, dont pull on your hair, great overall</li>
            <li>I would suggest if you will be trimming any kind of thicker hair than a human&#x27;s, or want a good experience with an animal clipper to purchase a more powerful unit.</li>
            <li>Not sure yet, I need more time,but I think that this product is excellent.</li>
            <li>but it still isn&#x27;t as fine as the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The problem is it misses fine hairs even when going over and over.  </li>
            <li>It was actually easy to get comfortable with &amp; get a feel for how to use it.  </li>
            <li>and it works fine.</li>
            <li>but it seems fine.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t layer or add the fine touches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work with this clipper just fine.</li>
            <li>Hair is not pulled and noise level is fine.  </li>
            <li>For me, that&#x27;s perfectly fine because I felt the Wahl cut too close for what I wanted.</li>
            <li>When I first turned them on, I was also impressed by how quiet they are!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The included attachments are fine, by the way.</li>
            <li>I could have skipped them and been fine with just the clippers.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for home use about 15 months ago and its still working perfectly fine today.</li>
            <li>It has always worked fine on the humans, but we did try them on the dog once and the clippers got overwhelmed.  </li>
            <li>But I like the clipper just fine.</li>
            <li>Worked fine for me.</li>
            <li>It adjusts from 0 to 1/2 which suits my purpose fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a breeze to maintain, and the included combs do the job just fine for my hair-type.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>of my favorite things about the andis was the purple clip-on comb set which made for a quick change in sizes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It cuts most hair in one passing, and quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love that they are super durable.</li>
            <li>Luckily, we were still able to return through Amazon.</li>
            <li>clippers aren&#x27;t very loud, and the cord is a good length.  </li>
            <li>My old Wahl clipper was falling apart and it had never been the best of qualities, so I decided to get a new set.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very powerful and strong motor.</li>
            <li>Nice, quiet, quick cut, good comb attachments, seems like a quality trimmer.</li>
            <li>Very easy to handle and do not get hot.</li>
            <li>Worked fine for about 11 months then the motor experienced a sudden loss of power and it wont even clip hair without ripping it out.</li>
            <li>oster fast feed clippers feel amazing compared to those cheap wahls, and they really aren&#x27;t that much more!  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good if you&#x27;re worried about nicking a little ones skin, but not so good when cleaning up the neck and around the ears.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not into the Cleanhead look, so I cut my own, more streamlined version of my Natural.  </li>
            <li>: Being corded gives this machine a huge power advantage over the battery operated ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>machine cuts hair accurately.</li>
            <li>Huge improvement over the Wahl lithium and groomsman models I keep buying, everything about it seems well built.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the adjustable blade and also the attachments that came with it.  </li>
            <li>Solid, high-quality, great product.</li>
            <li>Its quite and smooth.</li>
            <li>Cheap hair clippers</li>
            <li>Never again will I buy that cheap garbage sold at grocery and pharmacy stores.</li>
            <li>They just do not perform as well as the garden variety Wahl Clippers available at WalMart.  </li>
            <li>for FREE.</li>
            <li>Not something that I enjoy taking the time to do.    </li>
            <li>Only drawback is no case for stoarage and the attachments are not that great.</li>
            <li>but they are cheap and</li>
            <li>We almost always used it with an attachment, and the attachments don&#x27;t line up precisely with the guard teeth of the clipper, so that they block some of the slots in which hair can enter to be cut.  </li>
            <li>They fit well in his hand and are comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>This Oster Fast feed is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have the Andis Master and the magnetic guards fit both machines.</li>
            <li>I have owned all kinds of cheap department store clippers.</li>
            <li>I had a cheap wall that died on me years ago.</li>
            <li>This clipper cuts great, it will last my lifetime no doubt.</li>
            <li>These are great for someone just starting out.</li>
            <li>So smooth on the hair during cut.  </li>
            <li>So if you need a great clipper, look no further.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic set of clippers, purchased with attachments separately</li>
            <li>Has a nice hum and seems very sturdy.</li>
            <li>This was primarily for my husband.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I get a really smooth cut with them.</li>
            <li>Quieter and faster than cheap ones.</li>
            <li>These worked just as advertised and cut through my hair smoothly.</li>
            <li>but the combs that come with it are cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>I enjoy cooking, the outdoors and reading</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also great for giving myself taper fades and fading out the back of my hair.</li>
            <li>IT IS A TRULY GREAT AMERICAN PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Which is precisely what I did.  </li>
            <li>These clippers have a smooth running motor with a &amp;#34;cool to the touch&amp;#34; comfortable feel.</li>
            <li>I would recomend getting the Andis magnetic gaurds with these clippers since the guards that come with it are cheap and have a tendancy to fall off</li>
            <li>This Oster Clipper is fantastic product and it has been working 2 years now.</li>
            <li>I also know that these are not $200 dollar clippers, however they don&#x27;t give as smooth of a cut that I was hoping they would.</li>
            <li>The clippers felt cheap as compared to my andis masters.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most powerful clipper on the market.</li>
            <li>These are of excellent quality and heavy duty.</li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job everytime.  </li>
            <li>Really easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>As i said in the headline this is a great clipper, it is a solid piece of equipment that gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It cuts vs. pulls, unlike the cheap drugstore</li>
            <li>These work great on my breed and human hair</li>
            <li>This trimmer works great for keeping facial hair neat and trimmed.  </li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t had any issues with overheating and they are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>LIGHT AND CUTS WELL</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t feel like cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light as ever unlike the Andis Master.</li>
            <li>I use my Andis Nano Magnet guards and they do fit this clipper.</li>
            <li>I upgraded from cheap 15 dollar machine to this</li>
            <li>They get the job done and run smoothly.</li>
            <li>Arrived 4 days earlier then suppose to, that was great.</li>
            <li>USE THIS MACHINE ON THE DAILY, IT CUTS GREAT</li>
            <li>/&gt;Powerful&lt;br /&gt;Attachments fit well&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cheap $25-30 models will not cut it.  </li>
            <li>Beat wishes and enjoy.</li>
            <li>cuts so smooth ul feel like \\&quot;</li>
            <li>I very much enjoy the way it looks and feels.</li>
            <li>guard to fit these clippers.  </li>
            <li>Also the guards fit them well.  </li>
            <li>I use a $1 shower curtain from a dollar store to drape over the sink for easy clean up.</li>
            <li>beats the cheap ones by 1000 and doesn&#x27;t pull your hair when it cuts</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get all backed up with hair in the guards like cheap clippers do.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, fantastic product.</li>
            <li>** and are as smooth as momma&#x27;s a</li>
            <li>I bought this razor to replace a cheap Whal hat I bought from Costco about 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t catch hair like my cheap one from conair..</li>
            <li>and smooth.</li>
            <li>but like the light weight</li>
            <li>Turned an hour job with a cheap cutter into a 5 minute one.  </li>
            <li>This is a great clipper for someone like me who only uses it about once a month.  </li>
            <li>So overall I am happy.</li>
            <li>Clipper worked well, smooth cut.  </li>
            <li>Amazon reshipped the hair clippers overnight free of charge</li>
            <li>Durable , light , and</li>
            <li>It pays for itself in five or six haircuts, the results look fantastic, and it takes 1/3 the time to cut their hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought them primarily for shaving my head.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a few months now and it is nice !!!</li>
            <li>These really mow through the hair and give a nice finished product.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic purchase,</li>
            <li>This is a great clipper, very similar to the andis master in performance.</li>
            <li>Purchased these after using cheap conair brand for years to shave my head.</li>
            <li>Hello if ya&#x27;ll don&#x27;t know these Fast Feeds are amazing.</li>
            <li>Some 400-500 hair cuts later, they still work great.</li>
            <li>I bought these fast feed clippers because I thought they would do a better job on my hair where I basically cut all the top with a #6 and the side with a #4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Well, so far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I use it for my own personal use to fade my own hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for nearly 2 years and it is as good as they day</li>
            <li>These are far superior to any of the cheaper brands.</li>
            <li>The motor is FAR superior.</li>
            <li>Many reviews said the clipper stays cool, but I am not finding that true with mine.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is far superior than all those consumer cordless trimmers that I&#x27;ve been through.  </li>
            <li>A super clean cut!  </li>
            <li>I have this thing about quality and doing things right, reliability is my top buying criteria, This one</li>
            <li>It runs cool and it&#x27;s easy to hold.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sharp, accurate, and the range on the adjustable blade is ideal.</li>
            <li>This is a very powerful and durable clipper.</li>
            <li>The motor frequency is very low pitched, so its very nice to use.</li>
            <li>Very powerful.</li>
            <li>It is fast, clean, and does an amazing job.</li>
            <li>Not the greatest one he&#x27;s ever used, but of decent quality and fairly quiet.</li>
            <li>The Oster Classic 76 is better, but more than I need.  </li>
            <li>The problem is that the Walh clippers dulled relatively quickly, got clogged with hair easily and took many passes to get it right because of the inferior attachments and the attachments popping off.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;And how eco friendly not to have to drive to the barber or salon, this way you have an appointment whenever you like and for free.  </li>
            <li>Exactly why I was looking for after years of using the best walmart brand I could buy, these are absolutely ideal for the home enthusiast cutting his families hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried many kinds and brands and this is my favorite so far!!</li>
            <li>The clippers are great, but I was expecting a higher professional feel yo them.</li>
            <li>They cut good and don&#x27;t get hot as fast.</li>
            <li>Super easy to zero gap.</li>
            <li>I owned an old pair of Remington clippers and was pretty happy with them..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quick and easy maintenance.</li>
            <li>Because of this it really does make giving myself a haircut very easy and enjoyable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These clippers are much more powerful and they cut quickly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>These clippers were so smooth and easy to use that I took over just because it looked like fun.</li>
            <li>The original clippers were Sears branded</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking of just going for the original 76</li>
            <li>well worth the money!  </li>
            <li>So far I em very satisfied with the seller and product.</li>
            <li>For under a hundred clams it is worth the investment!</li>
            <li>Not sure I can recommend buying it until I&#x27;ve had it for a while so best of luck if you choose to get it too.</li>
            <li>This is one powerful clipper!</li>
            <li>Cuts it the first time, and I&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
            <li>and this was a buy well worth it!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this in hopes that it would have the power to trim my dogs hair well.</li>
            <li>It does get hot like people say, so I would not recommend using it without attachments for more than 15 minutes without a break.  </li>
            <li>Worth the buy!</li>
            <li>Feel heavier than last pair I&#x27;m hoping they continue to be effective and give a precise cute.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and feels like barber shop quality clippers!  </li>
            <li>Got it for self-buzz cuts, was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I store it in the original box, but it&#x27;s not convenient.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have previously owned Oster clippers and received very good service.  </li>
            <li>It has a certain heft to it unlike many trimmers which feel like cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>The Oster is very light and cuts quickly and doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li>Owned an andis masters clipper before these for roughly 2.5 years, and i thought i loved those, and i&#x27;d never find something better.</li>
            <li>, it would grab instead of cut cleanly at times</li>
            <li>Fun and easy to use</li>
            <li>Clippers cut through hair quickly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>I love them, but i&#x27;m glad i kept my old ones for fading and taping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly the clipper grant a clean</li>
            <li>Luckily I had backup cheap clippers.</li>
            <li>It pulled my sons hair out, it didn&#x27;t cut cleanly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Functionally the clippers are great, but the skimping on $1 worth of plastic combs is so intention, such a cash grab that oster should be ashamed of themselves.</li>
            <li>The product was packed securely to protect the clippers and the shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>These cut as cleanly as any others I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>I lubricate the blades after every couple of hair cuts and take the blade off and clean it every couple of months.</li>
            <li>Let them drip for another 5 min, clean the excess</li>
            <li>I cut my boys as well as my own hair, and actually enjoy it now that I have a professional pair of clippers.</li>
            <li>Cuts clean.</li>
            <li>you cannot get a bald closeness cut, like if you are trying to clean up and outline a beard.  </li>
            <li>Clean non stoppable clipping and hair grooming.</li>
            <li>to clean and I wish it was wireless though...</li>
            <li>quite... ez clean up...</li>
            <li>this is a very high-quality clipper that has a lot of professional users that give it great reviews.</li>
            <li>Now, following considerable use, I can  emphatically state that this is a excellent hair clipper.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I pamper this clipper--- use a toothbrush to thoroughly clean it and apply drops of oil, before and after use.  </li>
            <li>Good clipper, definitely a step-up in quality from the cheap $20 clippers at Walmart.</li>
            <li>The Oster Professional fast feed works great.  </li>
            <li>recommend buying a cleaner spray that can clean, lube, and disinfect your clippers.</li>
            <li>but I think I will try vinegar &amp; hydrogen peroxide to clean &amp; disinfect.</li>
            <li>keeps it clean and sanitized.</li>
            <li>plus, I haven&#x27;t had to do anything but clean and oil them between cuttings</li>
            <li>Really easy to use and smooth; doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li>They are powerful enough that they cut very nicely and evenly.  </li>
            <li>reason I&#x27;ve not given it a full 5 is that, even when set to its lowest distance, I can&#x27;t get quite as close of a shave as I&#x27;d like for the areas I want to keep clean shaven.  </li>
            <li>It is a good idea to buy additional comb attachments to have more choices, as other reviewers have suggested.</li>
            <li>They clean up very easily, and come with 4 different comb lengths that provide me with many options for hair length.  </li>
            <li>Cuts right thru the hair!</li>
            <li>the reviews were right!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the Classic 76 can do a better job, but if you have fine hair, you might be better off paying for a real haircut.</li>
            <li>One must oil and clean the blades regularly for optimum performance.</li>
            <li>Very good quality, but not too heavy to hold.</li>
            <li>They could improve on a few things, but, it&#x27;s probably the best you can do without having to pay ungodly amounts for higher costing clippers.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t say enough great things about the OSTER Fast Feed!  </li>
            <li>Great just what I expected</li>
            <li>I was hoping for this kind of money to get a clipper that would take it all off on the first go around, but it requires 2-3 passes to really get it done close.</li>
            <li>Everything about these is great, except that the blades came crooked and and had to align them before I could even use the first time.</li>
            <li>I still have to go over my head more than once, but it is much sharper than the Wahl units.  </li>
            <li>After deciding to go with the Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper with Adjustable Blade, I found that by far, Amazon.com offered the best price for them and still with full manfacturer&#x27;s warranty.</li>
            <li>However, these appear to be superior in several ways.</li>
            <li>These clippers do seem well made, and they probably cut most hair very well, but they did not work well with my hair.</li>
            <li>At the longest setting of its adjustable range, it leaves a sufficiently full looking beard so as not to require use of any attachable plastic combs.  </li>
            <li>After my five year old cut his own hair unbeknownst to me and with those children&#x27;s craft scissors</li>
            <li>good machine will last you life time if you take care of it.</li>
            <li>After reading most of the reviews here on Amazon, I decided to try the Oster fast feed.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the Oster fast feed but not amazed.  </li>
            <li>The clipper should have come with the full range of combs.</li>
            <li>Best thing I bought last year it really cuts my hair and does not pull or hurt thanks for that.</li>
            <li>The cut is so much cleaner and the blades maintain sharpness much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve owned a good, solid clipper.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to be true, you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>Better than &#x27;consumer grade&#x27; quality at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>I love my fast feeds</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s cool too.</li>
            <li>The clippers are good but you should order the smaller seperate blades to cut shorter fades.</li>
            <li>Many thanks, Amazoners.</li>
            <li>When our last Oster died, after almost 15 years, I did a bunch of research to find a quality replacement, and felt really good about the recommendations this clipper got from folks.  </li>
            <li>the damn thing worked so damn good, I went out and bought a second pair.</li>
            <li>Powerful, smooth clippers.</li>
            <li>This clipper is fairly light in the hand and much more quiet and provides a more even cut.</li>
            <li>Really wish I&#x27;d sprung for the top of the line model.  </li>
            <li>It was such a good choice.  </li>
            <li>They seem very well built and much much better</li>
            <li>had it gave me one full use.</li>
            <li>but if you want those super clean lines or designs get a dedicated set of finish clippers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These Oster clippers are built to last and I am looking forward to years of good haircuts!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to maintain it if you want full use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Overall good quality</li>
            <li>This is quiet and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t come with a full set of attachments</li>
            <li>I use Andis Cool Care spray while they&#x27;re on to let the oil work itself in.</li>
            <li>every once in awhile to keep it cool.  </li>
            <li>BUT NOT BAD</li>
            <li>I love the clippers, well worth the $, pays for itself pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>and they are just the right size for a comfortable hand grip and to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>Bought these to replace the cheap Wahl clippers I usually end up buying at Walmart, and i&#x27;m glad I did - these clippers work well, cut smoothe, are light and and fit nicely in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I need a clipper that can manage a full head quickly.</li>
            <li>I can look in the mirror and cut my hair easily and consistently.   </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty easy to operate and care fore.</li>
            <li>It works great on your normal hair but it isn&#x27;t really as fine on short hair.</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth, nice low hum, 00 cut, and it cuts like a Pro, naturally.</li>
            <li>It comes a nice assortment of guards to cut at different lengths, and the adjustable blade can fine tune the length by extending out another 1/8 inch.  </li>
            <li>They cut fine and are nice and quiet.</li>
            <li>Other than that the clippers are great with the purple magnetic guards from andis</li>
            <li>These are great and sharp.</li>
            <li>really liked them, and ordered this current but advanced version of this tried and true clipper.  </li>
            <li>I have tried at least six or more other clippers including cordless types and I can Honestly say these are best in ever way</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty fine, but it cuts it like going through butter, my beard too.  </li>
            <li>I actually kinda enjoy haircut time now! :)</li>
            <li>Made quick work of my super curly hair.</li>
            <li>Ok many people will buy clippers and use them to just do a simple cut.</li>
            <li>Clippers came quickly.</li>
            <li>My husband has the classic which he has had for many years.</li>
            <li>They do heat up fairly quick.</li>
            <li>These have worked decently well for the most part.</li>
            <li>Moral of the story, this clipper is WONDERFUL for human usage, not for animals.</li>
            <li>The Fast Feed cuts easily and cleanly.  </li>
            <li>That process was quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, when I first used this clipper, it was love at first cut.  </li>
            <li>Only knock is that I don&#x27;t really find them great for fading.</li>
            <li>Bought it after the Wahl Peanut Clipper died rather quickly.</li>
            <li>One day I may upgrade to a more expensive pair, but for now these are the perfect price/performance balance for me.</li>
            <li>It works quickly and has never locked or pulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pleased  to see this one hasn&#x27;t changed a bit from the older version.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t do a very close cut at the shortest setting with only the metal clip, otherwise they work great</li>
            <li>Simple, effective, powerful, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I was looking for clippers that would operate just as quickly and efficiently as the ones at the salon, and I feel like these do the trick.</li>
            <li>My fiance learned how to taper my hair fairly quickly with these clippers paired with the comb set.</li>
            <li>It is much heavier duty and has a much more powerful motor and sharper blades.</li>
            <li>I think Oster makes a good professional \\&quot;Fast Feed Clipper.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be lucky if one lasted 3 months.  </li>
            <li>Clippers:&lt;br /&gt;Cut quickly and cleanly&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sound of the clippers is not an obnoxious buzzing either, which I appreciate very much.</li>
            <li>Bit of a premium $, but no doubt these will provide high quality service for many years.  </li>
            <li>The Pro Clippers are exactly as advertised and more; Perfect for home personal, shop, or military applications.  </li>
            <li>Really excellent clipper -- goes right through the thickest hair without stalling in the least.  </li>
            <li>Cuts better than any other clippers we have own.</li>
            <li>They do not seem as powerful and pulled my sons hair so many times that I said if it pulls one more time I will send them back.  </li>
            <li>These clippers were not as precise as I first thought</li>
            <li>I spent an extra 10 dollars at a Sally&#x27;s for the andis master guards, and they fit perfectly!</li>
            <li>Overall a great machine that i am sure will last forever.</li>
            <li>Since I cut my own hair short, I was not disappointed with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I use this clipper in the salon and it runs smoothly without getting too hot.</li>
            <li>Very quiet, the vibration is quite modest, it gives a superb even cut, and seems to be holding up very well indeed.  </li>
            <li>I can cut my hair and the clippers are barely getting warm.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to report that the Oster Fast Feed set is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>I read through many reviews, watched quite a few videos, and ultimately decided that this would probably be the best fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Overall very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>Other Oster products I own like my blender and food processor have given me many years of dependable, reliable service  - and this clipper appears to follow in quality and reliability.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good long term investment.</li>
            <li>You can certainly buy a more dainty clipper, but if you only want to buy one that will last forever, this is it.</li>
            <li>I wound up getting rid of this one and picking up an Oster Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper and the associated blades that allow me to select a good length of hair trim.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is one great American Made product that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I use the most broke after a handful of uses forcing me to order a new set.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get any better than the Pro except new model year introductions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them for many haircuts and they are still like brand new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it, but the noise when the blade is close is slightly concerning.</li>
            <li>works great on black hair</li>
            <li>It is fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It cuts really well, and its easy to grip.</li>
            <li>sure what else to say other than they worked well, very smooth and easy, and cut everything in the first pass.</li>
            <li>But it got hot very fast, the blade got burning too hot for touching the skin</li>
            <li>Very high quality, powerful and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is true that the Oster clipper is fast and very powerful.</li>
            <li>Is a really good clipper, after using an Conair clipper for cutting my own hair for a year, changing to this one is a really good upgrade, is not heavy but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, is really fast and doesn&#x27;t make any sound, the only problem is the guides, I have to buy the Biggers ones which is OK, but I couldn&#x27;t find with the same amazing quality of the original one, which fits as ring to the finger to the clipper!</li>
            <li>Great clipper probably the smoothest cutting clipper around also a great beginner clipper doesn&#x27;t get hot at all</li>
            <li>Overheated and fuse blew on first use!</li>
            <li>These glide through like a hot knife in butter!</li>
            <li>As long as these clippers last more than a year, I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li>it serves my purpose just fine Very highly recomended</li>
            <li>Could use some longer combs, for the top, but that is easy enough to purchase separately.</li>
            <li>Works fairly well, but if I had to purchase one all over again, I&#x27;d get a more powerful one...one that cuts through hair better and isn&#x27;t so difficult to clean.</li>
            <li>Simply put it works great, a very professional feel and cut.</li>
            <li>This is a great clipper for the price, very professional and quiet.</li>
            <li>The adjustable blade feature is OK, but I tend to set and leave it at the most forward position and use the plastic guides from this set (as well as previous sets that fit well) for adjusting the cut.</li>
            <li>I have only had these for about a month or so, but they seem great so far!</li>
            <li>I have large hands, and it was comfortable.</li>
            <li>Unit is tough, and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these for over a year and they are tough as nails and work perfectly every time.  </li>
            <li>By taking the comb off, I&#x27;m able to get a pretty decent shave with the clipper on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>It feels like quality, (steel, not plastic!) and cuts fast and smooth.</li>
            <li>The combs are great quality but the bottom line is this product is a waste of money.</li>
            <li>In the hands of someone who knows what they are doing, these would likely be amazing.  </li>
            <li>The difference between a discount store package clipper and the Fast Feed is huge . . .</li>
            <li>Hope you enjoy yours as much as I do mine.</li>
            <li>Cuts smoothly and fast.</li>
            <li>, they hold firm and feel great.</li>
            <li>It made my taper and my boy&#x27;s taper much cleaner and an accurate blend.</li>
            <li>very quite and works smooth.</li>
            <li>They are quiet and cut smoothly and fit comfortably in my hands.</li>
            <li>Fast, even, smooth buzzes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(It</li>
            <li>The clippers seem very stout and do not feel or look cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>I was using the official Oster combs with it which were an absolute nightmare to fit on the device</li>
            <li>Quiet effective.  </li>
            <li>WELL worth the price</li>
            <li>frankly, these fast feed clippers do not do the job better than the Wahl did, or if they do, it&#x27;s very marginal.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s powerful motor.  </li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>Glad I broke the old one.</li>
            <li>Nice and quiet too.</li>
            <li>Well worth the $$$$.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it came with a few more guide combs.</li>
            <li>It makes the cut around the ears so much more professional and easier.</li>
            <li>For 2-3 x the $$$ this isn&#x27;t worth the investment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We are having a LOT of fun with it all.  </li>
            <li>We laugh and talk through it all.  </li>
            <li>no matter how much fun we are having with them.  </li>
            <li>these things a professional for sure</li>
            <li>In that time it gets only slightly warm.  </li>
            <li>The cord is nice and thick and never gets warm</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve you&#x27;ve ever purchased a cheaper set, this is well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attachments: http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001T0HHB0/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_31</li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I had an old Oster hair clipper for 25 years and this one even does a better job.</li>
            <li>I will consider trying a different oster product because I liked this one while it worked.</li>
            <li>/trim my hair and beard weekly and to clip my Golden Retriever two or three times a year in the summer.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re nice and quiet and they&#x27;re also portable.</li>
            <li>I have used many brands over the years and none of them are this quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li>These clippers are effective for different thickness of hair and length.</li>
            <li>its not as powerful as ive read.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend these if you are looking to cut your own hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no problems so far and am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>The Wahls had gotten to where they were not cutting well at all.  </li>
            <li>Nice quiet motor and just oil it</li>
            <li>Love professional haircut.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better at getting hair off my face than the Norelco, although it doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as close -- a plus if you are going for the five-o&#x27;clock shadow look.</li>
            <li>this item is expected to be better or offer more.</li>
            <li>this item is expected to be better or offer more.</li>
            <li>These clippers were gifted to me to replace the 15 year old Remington clippers I&#x27;d used for years.</li>
            <li>So far I love these clippers.  </li>
            <li>so I figured I should try a more professional grade.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying the generic guards that fit most Oster Clippers.  </li>
            <li>The clippers run cool and don&#x27;t get hot.  </li>
            <li>So if you are looking for a solid set of clippers, look no further the Fast Feed is awesome and you will not regret it.</li>
            <li>The results of those hair-cutting adventures were certainly FAR better than the results when he had me do his hair before with the crappy clippers and scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all in favor of spending my money on American-made products when those products are actually worth the money involved, and these clippers assuredly ARE.</li>
            <li>It is so worth buying the clippers.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Love this thing so far.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>it is worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered these to replace my set of Andis clippers and so far they work much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Absolutely worth the price.</li>
            <li>and then wouldn&#x27;t cut worth a darn.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading that Mr Money Mustache cut his own hair and others&#x27; experience I finally decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>Anything that simplifies my life at this point is good thing and the Oster Professional is clearly one of those things.</li>
            <li>They are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I wanted a more robust, professional unit.</li>
            <li>Powerful.</li>
            <li>and it is far better quality than cheaper chinese-made trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This clipper literally took 90 minutes over three days to complete most of the dog.  </li>
            <li>the plus side, these clippers are far better than Wahl.  </li>
            <li>If you are doing your own hair at home and looking to upgrade what you are currently using because you are getting snagged a lot, stop looking and get these.</li>
            <li>nice solid feel to them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a great pair of clippers that would blind and fade nice and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth it though.  </li>
            <li>I use this every time before i shower because i like maintaining the fresh cut look.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>worth the money after using $25 clippers we found at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the investment</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews for a product</li>
            <li>It is of sturdy construction and operates with a nice low hum.</li>
            <li>Amazon charged me $5.75 to return the combs, which I would not have ordered if the description had been more clear.  </li>
            <li>I love these Oster clippers they are sharp,quality built,lighter,quieter than my old clippers.</li>
            <li>Nice an quiet.</li>
            <li>and even then they only get warm.</li>
            <li>Love the old school look and feel.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve saved $20 :-)</li>
            <li>They clip pretty close, and while no electric clipper will bring you to blade close, these are great to bring me down to a 00 or perhaps 000 closeness on my head.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful and quiet clipper with many size attachments.</li>
            <li>so much Amazon also the representative from customer service was very friendly thanks Aric M.</li>
            <li>The other downside is that it only comes with 4 or 5 guards and they aren&#x27;t the best quality.  </li>
            <li>I liked they way the guards fit on these, they don&#x27;t pop off as easily as other brands I used.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price was much better, and this one is the same quality as our original.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, they do an excellent job at trimming my facial hair for a stubble look.</li>
            <li>A lot quieter and a quick crisp cut.</li>
            <li>With the original equipment 3/8 inch comb this clipper just won&#x27;t cut now, or at best barely cuts perhaps a half inch off my hair, leaving my hair much longer than the desired 3/8 inch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase, so far, and have every reason  to believe that the Oster Fast Feed will last me for many years to come.  </li>
            <li>these are exactly what i wanted, professional clippers,  they do a great job, wish there were a few more guides</li>
            <li>Other than that, a good clipper.</li>
            <li>Read the other reviews and delighted I bought these clippers.</li>
            <li>Easy to use stays cool for multiple cuts and cuts clean.</li>
            <li>This is a good product but its not as sharp as ones I have used before.  </li>
            <li>Cuts great, very fast, feels heavy duty.  </li>
            <li>It turns out I was right.</li>
            <li>, gonna go trim up right now</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just about the right length, seems like about 6 feet or so.  </li>
            <li>Cuts right through my hair in one pass.</li>
            <li>Conair sucked and didn&#x27;t cut right.  </li>
            <li>These go right through all types of hair.  </li>
            <li>Zips right through my hair.</li>
            <li>The blade cuts right through</li>
            <li>Read the comments before your decide which clipper is right for your needs.  </li>
            <li>Included combs are the right length for beards and eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It easily cuts through a variety of hair textures, fine to coarse, without snagging or pulling the hair.</li>
            <li>They run smooth, not loud, light, and do not over heat!</li>
            <li>I thought I had researched this purchase pretty well and decided I did not need the top of the line professional model.  </li>
            <li>The guides make it easy to do much more than a &amp;#34;lice cut&amp;#34; and, with the use of the blending guides, it won&#x27;t be long before you&#x27;re turning out some pretty snappy haircuts</li>
            <li>I wanted some hair clippers that was more profession and did a better job than the average store brand.</li>
            <li>It just plows forward and doesn&#x27;t get hot (just a tiny bit warm).</li>
            <li>I buzz the back, sides &amp; half the top, then just trim the front with scissors to leave some bangs and it comes out great</li>
            <li>Very good machine, the only negative is the flimsy adjustment leaver that&#x27;s made of a very cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cutter to anyone who wants a clean comfortable cut.</li>
            <li>If you just want to cut it all short, it is very easy to do so.</li>
            <li>you do end up buying these, I highly recommend the magnetic guards by Andis, they fit these clippers perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, it gets very hot, very fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten better machines more a lot less money.  </li>
            <li>I got these clippers to buzz my head with, thinking they would give me a better, more even cut than the slightly cheaper clippers I already have.</li>
            <li>FYI, this exact same clipper is advertised for 12 dollars more as &amp;#34;Quiet trimmers&amp;#34; as though it&#x27;s a special edition or something.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY AND ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND IT!!!</li>
            <li>bought this as a gift to a younger relative, he is absolutley thrilled with thier quality,were purchased to replace a lost set and resipiant said they were alot better than what was lost.</li>
            <li>lol no more cheep drug,dollar store for me.</li>
            <li>In general, I stick with a #1 on the sides and a #2 on top for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually bought a mid-priced model ($40 to $60) and was generally happy.  </li>
            <li>My goal was to find quality clippers that do a great job and will last for more than a few months.  </li>
            <li>Nice long cord that seems durable.</li>
            <li>Still compared to some other clippers i have had it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The cord is nice and long.  </li>
            <li>Long cord is nice, also.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price especially new.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used these while still sweating from workouts on hot days and this unit provides a clean, even and fast haircut every time.  </li>
            <li>it work good and cut down the noise.</li>
            <li>For a good, solid pair of family clippers that will last a long time, these are a good investment.</li>
            <li>This is a great clipper – quiet, smooth, sharp (no pulling hair).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they would hold up for heavy duty use, without having to clean them frequently,  but we are happy with them.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d still have the old one, which was also Oster and which I had been using for easily 10 years.</li>
            <li>I purchased these Oster Fast Feed Clippers believing I was stepping up to something more professional.  </li>
            <li>Nice product overall, cuts hair very well.</li>
            <li>Think about it - at $10 bucks a cut, a good clipper is paid off in less than a year.     </li>
            <li>Shaved my whole body today with this thing to start and it went quick</li>
            <li>horably please make sure not to buy this model Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper with Adjustable Blade         </li>
            <li>This clipper is professional quality and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I also purchased the T-Finisher (great buy) and will purchase the Classic 76 in the near future.</li>
            <li>I love things that don&#x27;t waste my time. :)</li>
            <li>, I hoped, would be more powerful, durable, and, especially, quieter.</li>
            <li>I use my clippers every day and would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a professional styling and easy to hold machine.</li>
            <li>I made sure my hair was clean and dry before using the machine, and cleaned and oiled the teeth and cleaned the comb before using the clipper.</li>
            <li>This is a great machine, it runs with a quiet power my only Whal just does not have.  </li>
            <li>They are completely unusable since the main screw stripped out that holds the blades in place it cost more to fix them than what they are worth</li>
            <li>this clipper no t value for Professional name on it ,&lt;br /&gt;it is good enough to use at home for your family&#x27;s members</li>
            <li>The dual magnet fast speed Oster clippers give a comfortable fast haircut.  </li>
            <li>For human hair, even beards, it works absolutely excellent and cuts evenly and without trouble.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to get a nice pair of clippers for a reasonable price, look no further than this.</li>
            <li>It leaves the stubble just a tad longer than I would like, but it is a totally normal length for most clippers, so not really a negative, just something to wish for.</li>
            <li>The actual trim is far superior</li>
            <li>What was I to do until my barber returns?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After researching many barber clippers and haircutting kits on the Internet and YouTube videos on how to cut men&#x27;s hair, I decided to purchase the Oster Professional Fast Feed Clipper.  </li>
            <li>I just used these for the first time yesterday, I they cut through my hair more easily than every other clipper I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I thought it might be time to buy a nicer clipper, and I got this one because it received good reviews and is not as large as the other Oster clipper.  </li>
            <li>But on my Wahl, I can adjust the blade much further, and together with that blade lever thing, I can get the blade very close and do a nice crisp block cut.</li>
            <li>I did not turn on the Wahl clippers, so I cannot report a comparison in noise or vibration, but I am very glad that I chose the Oster clippers, given the other noted differences.</li>
            <li>Quickly became adjusted to it after returning the andis masters because those had all metal casing which got hot really fast.</li>
            <li>Though this would be good for tight zero fades.  </li>
            <li>only criticism is that the plastic attachments are very cheap and the teeth do fall off over time.  </li>
            <li>With a more powerful motor than most commercial hair clippers, it shaves my entire head in no time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Power button and length lever both are made of plastic and feel very, very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very quiet, very smooth.</li>
            <li>These did not cut very fast at all</li>
            <li>An old shoe box will be fine</li>
            <li>I guess it works fine so far.</li>
            <li>The cutters are more comfortable on my noggin than other brands.</li>
            <li>Having trimmed my beard for more than 20 years with straight scissors, I find this clipper to be more reproducible and much less troublesome/fussy.  </li>
            <li>I was under the impression it would be built like a tank---while good, the on/off slide seems a little chinsy.  </li>
            <li>I think this particular Clipper is worth the little extra money compared to the cheaper alternatives because it is superb quality.</li>
            <li>, they are still super sharp and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>After one hair cut, it became really hot and hurt skin when touched.</li>
            <li>If you are willing to pay $150 you can get a pro quality product which this is not.</li>
            <li>Cuts very well!</li>
            <li>short, they don&#x27;t do any better than the Wahl.</li>
            <li>This means when you want to make a crisp cut, you&#x27;re out of luck.</li>
            <li>My husband went to use it for the first time - died within 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>This is so much more solidly built and</li>
            <li>the motor and speed of the clipping is so much higher.</li>
            <li>and I did not expect it to be any better with a better or more expensive clipper.  </li>
            <li>I have been cutting my sons&#x27; hair for 18 years and my own hair for many more.  </li>
            <li>My first haircut with them (performed by my wife), rivals any cut I had ever gotten from a barber shop.....</li>
            <li>I guess they want me to pay $5 more for a simple piece of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the first time around.</li>
            <li>These clippers have a far superior construction, run much quieter, and cut far more smoothly than the Conair, Wahl, and Remington products that I have struggled with in the past.</li>
            <li>With the oster fast feeds u are always FRESH.</li>
            <li>easily  - Very quiet compared to most clippers    Con:  </li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied with my decision in this brand and model.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a variety of different ones and most work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>However, it gets hot immediately and for some reason it shorts the electricity.</li>
            <li>He did a better job the second time.  </li>
            <li>And even a bit better the third time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Firstly, the lowest blade setting on these will not get you to a 0 - I like to keep the sides of my hair extremely short and then fade to a 1 or 2 on top.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These were my first pair of quality clippers, and it looks like I will have to search elsewhere for my intended purpose of getting a close shave.</li>
            <li>But if you are in my camp of self-cutters that like to keep your hair extremely short, it is better you look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I balked at the price at first, but now I&#x27;ve gotten used to using them every two weeks, and after two months, they&#x27;ve paid for themselves.  </li>
            <li>There is no pulling, it is reasonably quiet, and has a satisfying heft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I have standard hair</li>
            <li>then Wahl and others I got at stores and only paid slightly more</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;First things first</li>
            <li>being said I&#x27;m glad my last pair blew up for these clippers cut like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the brand I&#x27;m betting</li>
            <li>Just under a year ago my last hair clippers broke, so I looked around for a more durable alternative</li>
            <li>(it wasn&#x27;t pretty), I thought, why not just do the clipper thing and give him the buzz</li>
            <li>Would recommend these not only for people, but for pets as well :)</li>
            <li>Mine lasted almost exactly one year before no longer working.  </li>
            <li>Oster wil be getting more money from me in the future.</li>
            <li>These clippers have a lot of leverage, so I can cut my hair to the exact length that I want while I have my 1 guard on.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the clippers, the adjustment arm broke.  </li>
            <li>Five years later I bought this thing to get something that would work more efficiently and this truly does the trick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used them one time and already I can tell it is better than others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>top of the line and quiet clippers</li>
            <li>It cut like a hot knife through butter</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t get hot either.</li>
            <li>This is my first set of clippers.</li>
            <li>it could cut fast and easier to me!</li>
            <li>and I find the weight beneficial to steadying my hand on free-hand cuts - especially across the top of the flat-top.  </li>
            <li>After your done with the clippers, unplug them, run drops across the TOP were the blades are(dont overdo) and turn them back on for 10 secs.</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t need clippers that fancy or expensive, and found these to be an excellent alternative.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is about the 10th clipper I&#x27;ve owned over the years and the first semi-nice pair of clippers</li>
            <li>I decided to go with these clippers after reading the reviews and I am not sorry I did.  </li>
            <li>The adjustable blades help give a seamless transition between lengths for smooth fades.</li>
            <li>The Oster Fast Feed clipper is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many of their products and soon after the warranty ended, they all end up in the same place....</li>
            <li>I will probably be able to use it for the next 30-40 years, God willing.</li>
            <li>I love that you can use basic plastic clipper guards</li>
            <li>I have had many different clippers over the years.  </li>
            <li>Its funny</li>
            <li>gets all the hairs on the first pass.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t do no wrong.</li>
            <li>this is the first time not buying a pair of wahl clippers to cut my hair.</li>
            <li>I bought a set of andis purple magnetic combs and work great with these fast feeds no more flimsy combs that fall off.</li>
            <li>but they are exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I think I would prefer the (several hundred) dollar models better</li>
            <li>My first pair was defective.</li>
            <li>The assortment combs are a different style, so I wasn&#x27;t sure they would work.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product and its really  worth the price.</li>
            <li>The Wahls I had had a chrome exterior and got quite hot with lengthy use.</li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t realize the importance of a clipper&#x27;s internal workings.</li>
            <li>My husband has had so many issues with other cheap clippers, so I got him this one due to the popular reviews.</li>
            <li>top quality, will last a lifetime</li>
            <li>The first time I used these clippers they stopped working after about 20min.  </li>
            <li>They are quiet, light weight and keep relatively cool.</li>
            <li>It seems to me that it has more power than the last Wahl I had.  </li>
            <li>Wahl features one for its line of home clippers, and (of course) it&#x27;s available to barbers who use the professional models made by Oster.</li>
            <li>Cuts well and doesn&#x27;t get hot,</li>
            <li>We ended up taking the cover off the Osters and finding out that one of the wires had wore through (after 10 years of giving three boys and one husband hundreds of haircuts), so we clipped the wires, stripped them back, soldered them together, and put shrink over the wires to protect them, and got five more years out of them.  </li>
            <li>These clippers were exactly what we wanted.  </li>
            <li>They run more quietly than the clippers</li>
            <li>My first expensive set of hair clippers and by far the best, never again will I buy cheap cutters.</li>
            <li>I was using a $60 Wahl clipper before this, and the Oster definitely makes a more uniform cut.  </li>
            <li>The blades look more robust, the on/off switch is definitely more solid, and the motor sounds stronger but only a touch louder than the Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Never fail me.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s quiet as hell when used without a guard.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t come with many guards either, just the short ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>news is, it cuts nicely, and has a wide range adjuster for the head.</li>
            <li>This thing cuts my hair like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>Replaced an old set of cheap clippers with this one.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s probably because of the higher quality of materials used.</li>
            <li>Everything feels pretty sturdy and as a guy</li>
            <li>I love the adjustable blade feature for trimming the neck and back of my husband&#x27;s hair between trips to the barber.  </li>
            <li>aware though</li>
            <li>Yeah, I&#x27;m pretty anal about my hair.</li>
            <li>The advantage of needing multiple passes is that you can blend between length sections more</li>
            <li>The Fast Feeds are BEAST!</li>
            <li>the Fast Feeds are what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>They are able to run several minutes without overheating, however, do not cut as close as I would like.</li>
            <li>The motor is much powerful and the blads can cut much closer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The blade guards that come with the clippers are more than enough for us as my husband never uses anything beyond the 1/4&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>On the first pass, about 85% of his hair would be cut.  </li>
            <li>Well that&#x27;s exactly what happened.  </li>
            <li>The construction is way more solid that the walh brand.  </li>
            <li>It is heavier and obviously has a better motor.  </li>
            <li>if you are that sensitive to sound then you have issues.  </li>
            <li>Just bought my first Oster to trim my beard and neck,</li>
            <li>My husband was pleased that these didn&#x27;t pull his hair like our last pair of clippers.  </li>
            <li>My only grip is I love a skin fade</li>
            <li>Broke after first use.</li>
            <li>We are happy with this purchase and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a Clipper to last them a long time.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting it but the first pair of hair clippers that was sent out was stolen off my front porch</li>
            <li>This will go through your hair like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li>It works so much better than my Norelco trimmer on longer facial hair.  </li>
            <li>She used her bosses pair of clippers (she has had them for several years) and immediately fell in love.  </li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time, so I can&#x27;t comment on anything but my first reaction.  </li>
            <li>I love costco return policy &amp;#34; bring it back when ever, even if its out of date, years from now.</li>
            <li>Lightweight to use and very efficient!</li>
            <li>This machine really rocks !</li>
            <li>Much smoother and faster!</li>
            <li>It paid for itself in the first couple of months.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of a clipper.  </li>
            <li>I think they could have used a higher quality switch</li>
            <li>My hubby tried to give our son his first haircut with the clippers that he has had for ???</li>
            <li>Many tears and bald spots later</li>
            <li>These are very quiet compared to the cheaper brands, and cut so much better.</li>
            <li>The clipper has more than enough power.  </li>
            <li>When I cut my hair the clippers didn&#x27;t get hot AT ALL.</li>
            <li>Not too hot.  </li>
            <li>they will get hot and they do make a lot of noise.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get him to sit through the whole process without getting up because I was able to cut his hair in half the time and the noise level was so much lower.</li>
            <li>They are quiet and powerful and the attachments that come with the clippers are really easy to take on and get off.  </li>
            <li>It cuts very well right out of the box.</li>
            <li>I mean this was a great cut with nice sharp blades.  </li>
            <li>It cuts very smooth and, contrary to some of the reviews, does not vibrate much at all, and is fairly quiet.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are certainly way more quiet and a touch cooler than the Wahl&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>blades seem nice and sharp from the factory.  </li>
            <li>and they accepted the return and quickly sent me a new clipper.</li>
            <li>If you are a person who keeps his/her short, you could be saving a lot of money on haircuts, plus you can keep touched up / neat more easily than going back to the barber.    </li>
            <li>Has a nice, heavy feel to it in the hand, powerful motor.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, I knew it was fragile to begin with, so I made sure I did not apply too much pressure.  </li>
            <li>Overall they have been good clippers for my personal use.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a really nice product so far.</li>
            <li>I expect it will provide good service for years to come, since we only use it occasionally for family hair cuts.  </li>
            <li>Guide Combs to go with it, as our old guide combs don&#x27;t fit the Fast Feed.  </li>
            <li>a good solid clipper is what I need for regular weekly use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Lacks variety with guides that come with it would be better if it had more commonly used sizes.</li>
            <li>These clippers are without a doubt a good set to have at home if you are cutting your own hair or your kids</li>
            <li>It certainly seems to be a higher quality construction.</li>
            <li>After having switched to this Oster clipper, I have had ZERO trouble in getting a perfectly even cut, it has more than enough power, and cuts down hair with EASE.</li>
            <li>We bought this to replace an old Costco special.  </li>
            <li>These things buzzed right through my hair with zero hesitation and the guide didn&#x27;t bend and result with the aforementioned &amp;#34;ridges&amp;#34; you get with cheap flimy plastic</li>
            <li>Should a part break on you, even outside of warranty, repair should theoretically be pretty easy.</li>
            <li>I AGREE WITH ALL OF THE POSITIVE REVIEWS.</li>
            <li>It really feels like quality and worked well on the first beard trim.</li>
            <li>Be sure to brush and oil your blades with clipper oil after every use to ensure long blade life.  </li>
            <li>They are quieter, cut really well and never get clogged, and (despite what others have claimed) they do not get hot.</li>
            <li>Well, that pretty much ended it.</li>
            <li>In retrospect I would have ordered the set with more guards but that is a minor factor....</li>
            <li>Pretty much delivers on the advertising.</li>
            <li>I love the long cord and the way it fits in my hand - hair cuts</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and blade stays sharp.</li>
            <li>Though I have had good experiance with this brand in the past.</li>
            <li>Since I save so much money by cutting my own hair I decided to buy a good set of clippers and got this Oster unit.</li>
            <li>Does take a few passes to get all the scragglers, and only comes with 3 guards (you can buy more, but it&#x27;d be nice if they were just there).</li>
            <li>I would not use it cut my dogs hair without letting it cool completely which may take awhile.  </li>
            <li>It is far superior than any we have purchased from Walmart or other box stores.</li>
            <li>Nothing special , just to trim a bit of the top and a little bit here.</li>
            <li>Once again, my hair was clean and dry, and the machine clean and oiled, and adjusted with the lever.    </li>
            <li>If I could make another purchase, I would most likely go with the classic trimmer.</li>
            <li>He was very pleased with the way it works on his face, no pulling and very sharp blades and a smooth and quiet running motor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried the product once so far, but I it cut very easily.  </li>
            <li>These are so much sharper and more accurate than my cheapie clippers - I don&#x27;t have to go over the same spot multiple times to get all the hairs cut.  </li>
            <li>Although my initial opinion was high, I&#x27;m now of the opinion that these are okay</li>
            <li>the the Oster Fast Feed, they cut Great, smooth, fast and much less vibration than any other I have ever used</li>
            <li>This Oster Pro was my quick choice to replace that old gem.</li>
            <li>He cuts his own hair in half the time with these clippers than with the ones he used before.</li>
            <li>An Oster is the standard which all clippers should be judged -easy</li>
            <li>These are easy to handle and fairly quiet to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very quiet and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The clipper and guides are easy to use and are made to last.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was hown much faster the blades moved, providing a much nicer cut.</li>
            <li>He is very particular, and we went through about 3 chippers before we found this one that he likes.</li>
            <li>Yea it&#x27;s sturdy and a solid clipper, but if you want a smooth, crisp, and a to-detail haircut, this is not for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, quiet, and cuts through hair easily.</li>
            <li>the clipper is supremely easy to use, solidly made, fits the hand well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are quiet and fairly easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>already (obviously lubricating the blades every now-and-then to keep it smoothe), and it was still going strong.  </li>
            <li>They are quiet and strong too.</li>
            <li>Bought this 2 years back, and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>A little warm after long term use but still ok..</li>
            <li>A very professional product -- worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Great product, strong like the one other Oster I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li>B001T0HHB0 Oster Professional 10 Universal Comb Set Specially Designed to Fit Oster Clippers]].</li>
            <li>We got the large assortment of Oster spring loaded clamp on ones that Amazon suggests to bundle.  </li>
            <li>I also got a set of the large Andis magnetic guides that go up to 1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I had a cheap Norelco beard trimmer with a built in vacuum, and we first tried using that to cut my hair.</li>
            <li>If you want something that just does the basic job for pretty cheap, go for it, but don&#x27;t expect much out of this one.</li>
            <li>These Oster clippers not only cut far better, but also are much quieter while doing it!  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use them for animal clipping (I believe they require more power and better blades) and not sure if I would use these if I cut hair as a professional.</li>
            <li>so you noise exposure will be limited.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m taking good care of it and hoping it&#x27;ll last a long time !</li>
            <li>They were very effective, quiet and smooth, with very little vibration and no excessive heat.</li>
            <li>but honestly I prefer the other&#x27;s noise over this ones high pitched tone that leaves my ears ringing.</li>
            <li>Easy, quiet, fast - I gave myself a professional looking cut on the very first try</li>
            <li>4 years later my Oster fast feed is still going strong.</li>
            <li>Super powerful, commercial grade clippers.</li>
            <li>fresh Amazon was fast and very professional.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I didn&#x27;t end up going with the Classic 76, because this one suited my needs just fine at less than half the</li>
            <li>Cutter was as  described, and prior positive reviews were accurate.</li>
            <li>Just what we wanted, something light, quiet and quick for our 3 year old&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine, I can do it now like a pro, but initially I was thrown for a loop, so just a heads up to you folks who&#x27;ve never used one yourselves before.  </li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t have different size blades, the guards work just fine.</li>
            <li>and I had very high expectations,</li>
            <li>I researched the models out there and this one came very highly recommended in the intermediate price range.  </li>
            <li>To an amateur, it&#x27;s gonna feel heavy/ run cool and quiet/ shave very smoothly.</li>
            <li>It was a good buy when I first used this Oster clipper for it quiet and sharp blade.</li>
            <li>It gets a little warm without any attachments but its bearable.</li>
            <li>Sharp, fast, and easy to use!</li>
            <li>If it doubt---pay a little more for these clippers and get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li>This sturdiness means it weighs a little bit more and must be plugged into the wall, but for me it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Fast, quiet and accurate.  </li>
            <li>love it, there not much to say but it works very well.</li>
            <li>The clipper works very well, is quiet and problem free.  </li>
            <li>It cut smooth and very quiet .Clean and lube and it is ready to go.</li>
            <li>this is the most I&#x27;ve spent on a unit, and it doesn&#x27;t really feel all that premium.  </li>
            <li>Huge difference there from my old Wahl that was really loud from plastic that was cracked.</li>
            <li>Instead, I went to a store and bought a cheap clipper, only $16.</li>
            <li>And for made in the USA, I expected better quality.</li>
            <li>I have used Oster trimmers before and the vibration is definitely unusual.</li>
            <li>The guides it comes with are all you really need.</li>
            <li>Ive looked at Amazon after I got the ones that dont fit and all over the web for larger and have found nothing.</li>
            <li>Oh well, I just wear my hair that much shorter now.  </li>
            <li>Much sooner.</li>
            <li>For the price, you really should buy it and try it.  </li>
            <li>Those models all stop working after a while and can&#x27;t take much abuse.</li>
            <li>This is where I came across The Oster Fast Feed for about $55.00</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t figure out how these clippers can go through the hair and cut virtually nothing while consuming twice as much electricity.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I owned an inexpensive clipper that was very noisy and didn&#x27;t cut well.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the oster pro 76023-510 fast feed clippers to replace failing wahl clippers that I have used for 12+ years.  </li>
            <li>The Wahl is cooler, and it doesn&#x27;t miss as much hair.  </li>
            <li>The weight of these makes them very maneuverable, and quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He gets an even close, cut whenever he uses it, which is once or twice a week (his hair grows fast).</li>
            <li>Seem to work really well.</li>
            <li>Much quieter than the Wahl.</li>
            <li>Very quiet and light, and I like the longer power cord.</li>
            <li>Like most people, I spent weeks researching hair clippers before deciding to buy this.</li>
            <li>Just go get the real things (cost around $300)</li>
            <li>This Fast Feed clipper, with its pivot motor, is much quieter.  </li>
            <li>This is a real clipper.</li>
            <li>In addition, it heated up fast</li>
            <li>It vibrated so much that I fear either one day I will drop it and hurt my son or cut into his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone who isn&#x27;t looking for a really close cut.</li>
            <li>This clipper doesn&#x27;t vibrate much so our dog is much calmer when we cut her.</li>
            <li>Absolute night and day from cheapo drug store clippers.  </li>
            <li>For the money I expected more.  </li>
            <li>still runs like a champ, the attachments have never broken and I&#x27;ve had the thing for six years.  </li>
            <li>I have used this clipper exclusively for beard trimming for roughly two months, so my comments are more specialized than those offered by others.  </li>
            <li>Appears to be just a very well engineered set of clippers.</li>
            <li>, very sturdy&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>im very upset with this item,while im trimming</li>
            <li>the whole hair clipper is shaking</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews for the \\&quot;fast</li>
            <li>I am very dissapointed.  </li>
            <li>The only con is that you WILL need another pair of blades for precise taping or trimming.  </li>
            <li>The cheap ones use a magnet that pulls the blade back and forth...</li>
            <li>without much power...</li>
            <li>Much quieter and easier</li>
            <li>Once it breaks it&#x27;s unusable because the blade will just slide back and forth freely.</li>
            <li>Very annoying!&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Enter the Oster Pro Fast Feed clippers.</li>
            <li>but they did a awesome job cutting my hair.  </li>
            <li>I feel I saved so much, at the store</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The clippers are very well made and I can&#x27;t imagine having to buy another one ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li>fast feeds are the truth.</li>
            <li>Smooth and quiet.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Excellent cutting clipper.  </li>
            <li>This clipper cuts very well.</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very quality product for those of us that do home haircuts.</li>
            <li>Much cooler than any of cheaper consumer clippers that you buy at discount stores.</li>
            <li>he really likes them.</li>
            <li>Very quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>They are worth every penny for the quietness alone; it’s comparable to a soft humming versus the Wahl brand which would leave my ears ringing.  </li>
            <li>It has worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Expected more but it will do</li>
            <li>; cuts well and seems to be very durable.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t called fast feeds for nothing.</li>
            <li>The fast feed, was not for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real shame because the cipper worked really well before the motor went out.</li>
            <li>but I did not want to spend so much money.</li>
            <li>It never pulls my hair, regardless of how fast I cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I expect that these clippers will last for years and I will continue to enjoy them.</li>
            <li>(yes my boys hair grows that fast)  </li>
            <li>even much cheaper models often offer a storage bag for that purpose.</li>
            <li>I tried bying the 10 piece attachment to go with the clipper however those attachments do not connect with the Oster Fast Feed.</li>
            <li>2- it does not heat as much as wahl clippers    </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased cheap clippers before and they don&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>It cut smoothly and the motor is relatively quiet.</li>
            <li>I adjusted the blade height lever (attempting to oil it)and before it reached the top position it became very loose.  </li>
            <li>But the Universal Comb Set, advertised with it, doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>I used the Andis T-Edjer and was much much much happier.</li>
            <li>And YES I Zero Gapped my fast feed, which helped, but still has nothing on the Andis.</li>
            <li>I did however buy a ceramic blade so that I can zero gap them perfectly because it cannot be zero gaped with the stock cutting blade.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oster fast feed-red with chrome blade</li>
            <li>I initially got this after looking to replace a cheap $15 oyster trimmer.</li>
            <li>power cord is very sturdy and does away with having to worry about batteries.</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>Then we really needed to cutback.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We spent more and got the set of combs with it.  </li>
            <li>Also, the cut was very even.</li>
            <li>I really like my oster clipper.</li>
            <li>They work exactly as expected maybe even better.</li>
            <li>I clip my dogs hair and these work really well.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the solid feel of the on/off switch.</li>
            <li>Cut even and fast.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a very close cut ( almost shaved) ---the</li>
            <li>The motor run very quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li>My husband was just hired as an airport security guard and he is required to maintain a buzz cut, so I did the research and read pages of reviews before deciding on these Oster Fast Feed clippers.</li>
            <li>We used the 1/2 inch guard to achieve a very uniform cut.</li>
            <li>This Fast Feed&#x27;s closest cut is about 3 days&#x27; growth after shaving with the Andis.</li>
            <li>i feel like a real barber now</li>
            <li>They can be adjusted to cut very close.</li>
            <li>The blade is not 100% lined up with the grid, but it doesn&#x27;t really impact the quality of the shave.</li>
            <li>Fast clippers that mow evenly through hair.</li>
            <li>I had a cheap pair prior to these.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that wants to buzz their noggin.  </li>
            <li>Very solid in the hand -- not light-weight (cheap).  </li>
            <li>The minimum length with the Fast Feed is 000</li>
            <li>Fast feeds.</li>
            <li>the fast feeds for touch up and fades.  </li>
            <li>The clippers don&#x27;t cut very well .</li>
            <li>Iv been cutting hair for yrs and these clippers are perfect to add to the collection...</li>
            <li>When he&#x27;s ready, we now have the tool.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the finest cutters I have ever put my hands on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m part of a very hairy family...</li>
            <li>Thanks to youtube, i was looking at some videos to upgrade my arsenal</li>
            <li>I really really like these.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re quiet and smooth and don&#x27;t pull the hair.</li>
            <li>Cuts really well.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Oster Universal 10-pc guide comb set, which didn&#x27;t fit the clippers and will be returned.  </li>
            <li>Relatively quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li>They are quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li>This product shipped really fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not cut \\&quot;very close\\&quot; as the description states and the motor is rather weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m ready to replace, I will look for this item again.</li>
            <li>This product fills that requirement very well.</li>
            <li>You really get what you pay for when it comes to this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Smooth blades and quiet while on.</li>
            <li>considering how much I&#x27;ve saved over the years on trips to the barbershop.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of using the fast feed clippers, the clippers stopped working.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for my husband.</li>
            <li>He also says that it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;pull\\&quot; as much or at all compared to the Wahl that he has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with this clipper for about a year, and finally gave up and bought a cheap Wahl.</li>
            <li>have no idea why it&#x27;s called &#x27;Fast feed&#x27;, as it isn&#x27;t fast, and it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;feed&#x27; on anything.</li>
            <li>no pulled hairs and was fast.</li>
            <li>It leaves just as many &amp;#34;straggler hairs&amp;#34; as the cheaper clippers (having to re-cut the same area MULTIPLE times, and then I still have to go back then with a scissors to get the many hairs it still missed).  </li>
            <li>but they really came through for me.</li>
            <li>very disappointing.waste of money...</li>
            <li>High quality product!</li>
            <li>excelent quality for the price point very quiet and smooth operation&lt;</li>
            <li>Ive never had clippers that wouldnt pull hair if i went to fast.</li>
            <li>A big upgrade from my cheap Wahl clippers.  </li>
            <li>This clipper is very sturdy and seems to be well built.</li>
            <li>These work very well.  </li>
            <li>These clippers work really well without having to oil them all of the time.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t heat up too fast either.</li>
            <li>out a hair cut just to really try them out &amp; these clipper went through my hair like butter.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much oil for it.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to do a buzz cut on yourself, or are ready to stop going to the barber for a haircut you can do yourself.... than this product will work as advertized for you.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>The real question would be how is it working 1, 2, or 3 years from now.  </li>
            <li>very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these clippers for 2 years now, and they are very reliable.  </li>
            <li>but I cancelled one seeing as to how much of a quality clipper this is.</li>
            <li>Ive been cutting my hair for about 15 years and these are the best clippers I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much hair.</li>
            <li>I tried the old trusty purple magnetic set and sure enough, they fit!!!!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>So much better than anything Costco has on sale for nearly the same price.</li>
            <li>I finally threw it away and bought this oster, which so far is much better.  </li>
            <li>They are a but heavy but he uses them to cut his own hair with no problem.</li>
            <li>Has a nice and solid feel to it and is actually really quiet while being used.  </li>
            <li>It gets a tiny bit warm in the hand if you use it longer than ten minutes.  </li>
            <li>I figured out buzzing my own hair a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve probably done my own hair every 2-3 weeks since and the clipper paid for itself within a few cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it is very quiet and still cuts better than my old clippers.  </li>
            <li>I replaced the chain mega store clipper with this more expensive, but far superior Oster clipper.  </li>
            <li>Will be looking for the top grade Wahl model, as the old set lasted for years and countless haircuts.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair almost year round.  </li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t use it everyday, so if you are that kind of guy</li>
            <li>but it cuts much better than our 20+ year old clippers - definitely was time for a replacement!  </li>
            <li>I cut my own hair, and i&#x27;ve probably saved a few thousand dollars in hair cuts since I&#x27;ve bought it.  </li>
            <li>In 35 years, I&#x27;ve never heard he go on about a tool, it was well worth the few dollars more.</li>
            <li>; I cut my own hair with it once a week and touch up a few spots with my electric razor.</li>
            <li>I have used these clippers only twice so far, but they are cutting hair very nicely and feel good in the hand.</li>
            <li>They are very sturdy and cut more consistently than anything I have previously used.  </li>
            <li>The weight of Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed is just right.</li>
            <li>If you are used to $20 clippers at Walmart, the difference with these is very apparent the very first time you use it.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful and quiet.</li>
            <li>These clippers are a significant improvement over anything available at local big box stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been cutting my own hair for more than 25 years - a very flat flat-top - and this clipper is my favorite by far!&lt;br</li>
            <li>seconds after he&#x27;s out of the water his hair is dry which is nice in our climate where it can go very quickly from sunny and warm to chilly.  </li>
            <li>I can easily use it, held in either hand, to trim the insanely long (but blessedly blond) hair on my arms.  </li>
            <li>I could have sheared all his long curly hair off easily with this clipper.</li>
            <li>If you cut your own hair or your kids&#x27; hair, then I would by far recommend this over any other unit on the market.  </li>
            <li>You can not do much without purchasing the additional comb set which costs another $20-22 so the total cost climbs up to $73-75 and the additional combs you buy do not slide in like the original ones.</li>
            <li>moved up from a Whal, glad i did, this sucker cuts clean and FAST.</li>
            <li>I had a $30 shaver from a local big box and this is better but not as good as a $100 pro model I had in the past.  </li>
            <li>The motor is strong, and works its way through my son&#x27;s thick hair and easily handles my thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>Whisper quiet, but the angle you need to hold them to cut is not as user friendly as cheaper clippers I have owned.  </li>
            <li>i still successfully trimmed my hair (a little too short in some places)</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t do that on the third clipper I buy to replace the original.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many clippers to cut my hair and these were the first more expensive ones that I have used.</li>
            <li>Oster does not come with as many accessories like the other cheaper clipper brands.</li>
            <li>Chris Rock circa 1998, then the Oster Professional 76023 would be more like that cool cat you depend on to help you destroy the Empire...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not that sharp but does a better job.</li>
            <li>Definitely a purchase worth making!</li>
            <li>Fast, hardworking, ergonomic, easy to clean, and quiet compared to our other noisy, less effective clippers.</li>
            <li>It feels solid and comfortable in the hand, and appears to be well constructed with high quality materials.</li>
            <li>Easy for personal use due to its size and weight, easy to maneuver around your head.</li>
            <li>Much quieter than the older model I had.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the higher price over the Chinese made ones.</li>
            <li>The Oster fast feeds were decent clippers.  </li>
            <li>The machine seems to be well constructed and would probably last me forever and a day if kept clean and oiled.</li>
            <li>Really wanted a Classic 76 but couldn&#x27;t justify the $150 price tag.</li>
            <li>After another cheap pair of Wal-Mart special clippers broke down on me, I decided I wanted to spend a little more and get a quality pair of clippers.  </li>
            <li>The up / down  blade height lever pivots on a very cheap piece of plastic that sheared off when adjusted.  </li>
            <li>Second, it doesn&#x27;t seem to do as good a job at clipping hair, it seemed to miss more, and I don&#x27;t think it was due to its narrower path when compared to our previous clipper.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But enough was enough, and I decided it was finally time to go pick up a better quality set instead of replacing the cheap Wahl kits</li>
            <li>the whole, a high quality well made product that seems to be a rarity in today&#x27;s disposable culture of planned obsolescence.</li>
            <li>As I said I don&#x27;t use them for high or bald fades and wouldn&#x27;t really recommend them for that style of cut</li>
            <li>Get a decent liner and you&#x27;re good to go, amateur haircut or professional.</li>
            <li>and for sure if you&#x27;re a DIYer for you and your family to save a couple of bucks at the barber) but if you&#x27;re a professional giving haircuts all day long, go for the Classic 76.</li>
            <li>The new Oster clippers I purchased run smoothly and  are relatively quiet.</li>
            <li>ours is sitting unused as we continue to use the old, worn out wahl - which did come with a nice set of guide combs - and all for less than 20 dollars.</li>
            <li>It is relatively quiet compared to my old Remington, and is easy to use and maintain.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a well built set of clippers at a reasonable price point, then I would highly recommend this particular model.</li>
            <li>I charged cheap for my haircuts, about $5 a pop, and I can&#x27;t tell you how long the lines were waiting for me to give haircuts.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The plastic guards, which I at first thought might prove to be cheap junk, turn out to be good-quality plastic and are serving me extremely well.  </li>
            <li>For the past 7+ years, I&#x27;ve been using Walmart-bought Wahl clippers to cut my own hair and my dad&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>A small (efficient) bag or box would have been nice, just to keep it all together in the closet....</li>
            <li>While the clippers still work, the idea that a \\&quot;professional grade\\&quot; machine would become dysfunctional after one person used it once a month for a year is pretty ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it once a week for a full head trim (of what&#x27;s left of it - let&#x27;s say 50%)</li>
            <li>These are quiet and stay cool longer than any of the others I have owned.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice to have a small height adjustment built into the blade.</li>
            <li>Our first shaver was from the early 2000s and a WAHL.</li>
            <li>They say some get hot in your hand, but I took a long time using it for the first time and it didn&#x27;t get hot at all.  </li>
            <li>my barber had the oster 76 classic, which u raelly dont need because that is basicly the same as the fast feed, except u can cut more times a day.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t cut very smoothly, and my wife had to go over the same spot several times to get any consistency.</li>
            <li>Very powerful clipper, without being really heavy like so many of the other powerful clippers.</li>
            <li>but I am a big guy, so best if you expect heavy clippers.... unless you are a big, strong guy, and then they may not seem so heavy to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it comes down to it, the Masters are a more refined clipper, but the longevity of the andis was a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>Its like a car, if you don&#x27;t service it, it will break down on you, or not function as well as it once was able to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve just cut my hair with the Wahl 5-star clipper 8451 (which I bought after Amazon accepted my return for this one) and it&#x27;s hands down a much better clipper than this Oster.</li>
            <li>It is well-made, sturdy, quiet, small, and most of all, easy to cut hair.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if it came in a little carrying case, but I just found an old travel case that I store it in.</li>
            <li>Had it for awhile now, I use it about two times a month and still cuts like it&#x27;s brand new!</li>
            <li>It runs great and comes with several rake height attachments, so I returned the other item I ordered with similar attachments.</li>
            <li>It uses a completely different and much more powerful motor than all the other clippers out there.  </li>
            <li>Fast and New.</li>
            <li>The cord is also very long, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>Previous purchase of product provided more sturdy attachments...</li>
            <li>Had a previous Oster clipper for many years before I wore it out.  </li>
            <li>I wish it came with more comb attachments like our previous one.</li>
            <li>Much better than any of my previous clippers.</li>
            <li>Much better than our previous clippers.  </li>
            <li>During that time I more or less settled on Wahl brand clippers.  </li>
            <li>Less than half the noise level as the last clippers we had, and build quality is superb.  </li>
            <li>love to use it and the only wish that it leaves open is the following:&lt;br</li>
            <li>They can&#x27;t compare to either the Classic 76 or the Model 10.</li>
            <li>A bit spendy but is a decent clip.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get your blade(s) back quick as a wink</li>
            <li>I have tried several brands over the years some last longer and cut better than others.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent for leaving stubble, not a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li>For just about $20 more than the Wahl clippers I got at Wal-Mart a few years ago, I now have a real set clippers.  </li>
            <li>I use it mainly for trimming my goatee.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for many years.</li>
            <li>Clippers are quiet, and cut great through thick hair.</li>
            <li>The clippers work very well and cut nicely, even through thick matted fur.</li>
            <li>I have Oster classic 76 that I use my hair</li>
            <li>I bought these with intent to get the pro Oster classic 76s.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Oster hoping to replace an older Wahl model.  </li>
            <li>I thought a machine of this price and advertised as &amp;#34;Professional...blah&amp;#34; would  indeed provide a decent service.  </li>
            <li>The action on the adjustable blade is solid, and the comb attachments feel secure and I never worry about them popping off.</li>
            <li>Oster Professional motor is quiet, and the pull through any type of hair is smooth.</li>
            <li>This is such better quality than the cheaper Oster I last owned.</li>
            <li>The fast feed sounds more powerful, they weigh more and cost more and the fast feed uses a pivot motor in place of a magnetic one, but when it comes to pulling off a \\&quot;one-pass\\&quot; clean cut down your head - they fail just like the $10 clippers I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>only downsides I can think of is that the clipper gets very hot after using it for over an hour.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;2-Gets very hot after only 10 minutes of use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this clipper.</li>
            <li>THIS RAZOR BY THE FEEL OF IT IS CONSTRUCTED OF HIGH QUALITY.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RAZOR</li>
            <li>I learned how to give haircuts while I was in high school</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>As a barber, I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>Quiet, no hair pulling, smooth cutting with no &amp;#34;flyers&amp;#34;, and just an excellent overall performer.</li>
            <li>These come highly recommended by barbers across the states.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>High quality parts</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>ive been using it for about 4 months, and its extremely high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this clipper.</li>
            <li>The blade guards that came with the Oster are high quality plastic.</li>
            <li>I was used to cheap trimmers that got clogged up if you were cutting more than 5 individual hair, and that overheated when used for more than 2 min.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>They are of high quality.  </li>
            <li>Everything shipped fine as expected.</li>
            <li>so I decided to spend a little more on the cutter itself.</li>
            <li>Professional quality!!  </li>
            <li>but could be a little more versatile with the guide combs.</li>
            <li>If you take it apart to clean more than 4 times, the grooves in the plastic wear thin and no longer does the screw hold the blades in place.</li>
            <li>These are amazing, it&#x27;s definitely a bifl item if you take care of it, the quiet is an added benefit as i didn&#x27;t mind much the loud noise on my old ones as i was just being cheap by cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li>The Oster fast feed is a classic among barbers and professional hairstylist.  </li>
            <li>The Oster Classic 76 is probably the most heavy duty clipper out there.  </li>
            <li>Very good quality and efficiency for cutting hair.</li>
            <li>Sharp blades and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>Extremely sharp and strong.  </li>
            <li>It was definitely worth the $ to get one that is high quality, will last, and doesn&#x27;t pull his hair out.</li>
            <li>professional clipper works very well for me</li>
            <li>B001JJBC9Y Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper with Adjustable Blade]].</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the weight of the Clipper and even the power cord,  as I was used to the much lower priced and lighter hair clippers.  </li>
            <li>I decided to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to a nicer model, so I purchased the \\&quot;Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper with Adjustable Blade\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I have saved so much time with these clippers compared to my old clippers.</li>
            <li>I have been using these for 7 months now and really like these clippers, they replaced old worn out clippers from the 1960&#x27;s (from my parents).</li>
            <li>It would bind up if I cut too fast, and it was loud...  </li>
            <li>Oster Fast Feed is a level above anything I&#x27;ve seen available at the big box stores under $30.  </li>
            <li>It is much quieter than my old clippers.</li>
            <li>Runs much quieter than the old one and cuts cleaner.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and has been working very well so far.  </li>
            <li>The Oster Professional Fast Feed Clipper is adjustable from size 000 to size 1 blade and comes with 4 guide combs.  </li>
            <li>It is quiet and powerful.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d think for the price, they could add a few more.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for personal grooming and it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra money for the quality.</li>
            <li>I use these at least twice a month to cut my own hair and father&#x27;s hair sometimes.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money to get quality.</li>
            <li>(Need help with your Flat-top, perhaps the addition of a hand-help &amp;#34;Flattopper Comb&amp;#34; is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>My clipper has always been pretty quiet but as soon as I put a comb on it buzzes really</li>
            <li>This Oster claimed to be whisper quiet and powerful.  </li>
            <li>It has already paid for itself a few times over and am confident with care, will continue to do so.</li>
            <li>The cheap clippers pulled our hair, ran hot, and gave uneven results.  </li>
            <li>heads up folks: as has been mentioned, this is pretty useless without a good set of guide combs.</li>
            <li>The clippers are very quiet and powerful.  </li>
            <li>The clipper itself is very quiet and powerful.  </li>
            <li>Quiet, powerful, reliable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for over 15 years and this is by far the most durable and well-constructed set of clippers I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li>We bought a set of $15 clippers from a big box store and we got our money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>suggestion would be to add a few more guards and a pouch/case for storage</li>
            <li>Even the motor, sounds powerful yet quiet.</li>
            <li>It does not feel  like a 000 cut I normally get at the barber saloon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them a few times and love them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very quiet, yet powerful.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they make shavers this powerful with a smaller blade anyway, but that being said it&#x27;s a nitpick.  </li>
            <li>The weight, warmth during operation, overall comfort and balance make this a truly professional clipper that should last for many years.</li>
            <li>but to me that&#x27;s worth it since it feels very solid and well</li>
            <li>They are quiet and powerful.</li>
            <li>I started with the 1/2\\&quot; and my hair is longer that normal after a haircut.</li>
            <li>These are good (once zero gapped) but not great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to cut down on the cost of going to the barber shop every few weeks.</li>
            <li>It is much quieter than the old one even when that one was new.  </li>
            <li>Quiet, cuts well and quickly, doesn&#x27;t jam up like my old one.    </li>
            <li>Also, to boot, they&#x27;re not heavy, they&#x27;re super quiet, and the included blade guards stay on no problem.</li>
            <li>Super quiet if you have a noise or vibration sensitive kid.  </li>
            <li>They have a solid feel and construction to them, but they are also easy to service and take apart using only a screwdriver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Started cutting my own hair and bought this based on other good Amazon reviews.  </li>
            <li>This Oster Fast Feed features a pivot motor, which is the high quality motor not usually found on a typical cheap set of clippers.</li>
            <li>I purchased the 10-piece comb set, and kept the tapered \\&quot;left ear\\&quot; and \\&quot;right ear\\&quot; combs from the Sears clipper.  </li>
            <li>I have been using them for years and they only heat up if you don&#x27;t lube em up right.</li>
            <li>I did purchase the complete set of combs and like their  positive locking action unlike the ones that came with the Clipper.  </li>
            <li>It cuts very cleanly and evenly with minimal noise and barely any vibration.</li>
            <li>I still wasn&#x27;t convinced that the blades would last that much longer, so I made sure to set aside some money to buy Classic 76 when this one broke down.  </li>
            <li>I have owned other brands in the past and the quality of these Oster clippers is great.</li>
            <li>I only cut my own hair, and sometimes my boys, but these are so much quieter, sturdier, better cutting that I even bought one for my Dad for Father&#x27;s day.</li>
            <li>The Oster Professional Clipper is a highly upgraded modern version of the 12 year old Oster clippers I have been using.</li>
            <li>Other than that, they cut fantastic.  </li>
            <li>WOW cuts smooth barely any vibrations feels solid in the hands</li>
            <li>, even my old wahl may be  a little better doing fading.     </li>
            <li>I am hoping for another 26 years from the new unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will keep trying them because I don&#x27;t want to have to go through a return process, I hope there is just some sort of learning curve with a new pair of clippers.</li>
            <li>I returned the item in exchange for a new one.  </li>
            <li>I trust the Oster brand and these clippers live up to the name.</li>
            <li>I thought it was suppose to be a BRAND NEW clippers.</li>
            <li>Buy new guards.</li>
            <li>I should have waited before buying them, but live and learn.  </li>
            <li>I have owned this clipper for two plus years and still works like new.</li>
            <li>and as we live in south Florida, its something that I have to do for him.  </li>
            <li>Oster sent me a new one</li>
            <li>If a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; used these &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; clippers, he or she would soon be looking for a new line of work.</li>
            <li>Time for new one.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re new to it, there are a zillion YouTubes that show how to use a clipper.</li>
            <li>Makes shaving your head every other day less of a chore when you have really good clippers.</li>
            <li>QUIET, powerful, fast clean cuts every time, No significant vibration.</li>
            <li>The time they will save me is worth the price alone, but the other positive features just add to the value.</li>
            <li>No nipping the skin nice and smooth cutting.</li>
            <li>I decided to upgrade to the [[ASIN:B00070E8LA Oster 76076-010 Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper]]</li>
            <li>Very professional.</li>
            <li>The first clipper set I used was a few years old, and my husband had never taken it thoroughly apart to clean it.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I had hoped to keep the review updated with my new impressions, but this will be my first and last edit.    </li>
            <li>Very good quality, but a little bit not comfortable when holding it, especially for people who has small hand :)</li>
            <li>decided to spend a little more on my next pair of clippers and got the Oster Fast Feed.  </li>
            <li>and for very little more money.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate as long as you&#x27;re going short.</li>
            <li>When I first used it seemed less powerful than the wahl</li>
            <li>With one pass, it came out just like the professional even though I have been cutting my son&#x27;s hair for over two years with the Wahl and couldn&#x27;t get it that good, clean and fast with multiple passes.</li>
            <li>and I always cut my hair dry with no products in it; so I&#x27;m not sure why there are good reviews about it</li>
            <li>I usually end up having to repeatedly go over my head to make sure all the stray hairs are clipped.</li>
            <li>This one, even though you can adjust it shorter with no guards, leaves too long of a stubble/shadow on my head so it looks like I already have 3 or 4 days of growth when it&#x27;s a fresh cut.  </li>
            <li>iam now doing the exact same thing my barber was doing.</li>
            <li>The price is only slightly higher, but the quality is beyond the value.</li>
            <li>First a brief bit of background info.  </li>
            <li>These are really pretty quiet.</li>
            <li>This clipper elicits a definite &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; when you first use it.</li>
            <li>but these are soo quiet and never get hot like the andis.</li>
            <li>I sometimes did 3 haircuts in a row and and the other ones I would have to wait until they cooled in between; but this one while it still gets hot, it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the others.</li>
            <li>The metal part gets extremely hot in very short time.</li>
            <li>Its pretty quiet as well.</li>
            <li>The only draw back I have seen after having them for about a year now is that the metal is starting to move in the direction in which Im cleaning it most but that can be adjusted over time.</li>
            <li>I have to say from when I opened them to the first use I was blown away by the build quality, the quietness, the low temperature, and the power this trimmer possesses.  </li>
            <li>I use these clippers twice a week they are quiet but they do get really hot after about 15-20min.</li>
            <li>Works much better than the cheaper set I have had for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first use, I can tell that this product cuts differently than the Wahl.</li>
            <li>It was quiet for the first couple minutes, maybe 5.</li>
            <li>Now if I could just get my 15yr old to let me try it on his mop!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not a professional, so this is from the for what it&#x27;s worth dept.</li>
            <li>My first and last Oster.</li>
            <li>She is a Labrador retriever and sheds a small chihuahua&#x27;s sized clump of hair every week, so I had hoped that this would be able to keep her hair trimmed during the summer.</li>
            <li>Product blew out on first use and have yet to hear back about replacing it</li>
            <li>It does come with 4 combs ( short to 1/2&amp;#34;), oil and a brush for cleaning.</li>
            <li>for these first, then will probably buy the same model if that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I found this to be a better model than the basic, but not quite as expensive as the top of the line.</li>
            <li>clipper only con is you have to adjust to get a skin tight fade but other than that cuts all types of haircuts great.</li>
            <li>Cuts nicely but hard to use because of cheap, stiff</li>
            <li>Requires cleaning, and little combs break easily.</li>
            <li>Also do occasional body grooming with it and clean and oil it back up.</li>
            <li>It cuts very well and has the same attachments as my older one did.  </li>
            <li>For home use this should last a number of years and provide a high-quality haircut if the blade is kept clean and oiled prior to use.</li>
            <li>I have trouble raising my arms, so it would be fine for a person who can use their arms normally.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Often missed hairs requiring me to keep going back over the same areas for a clean cut&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>extremely well, clean, and fast&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I keep the equipment clean, sharp, and lubed.  </li>
            <li>Finally, the clippers are very sturdy and of a high quality.</li>
            <li>Ended up switching blade from my old onto the new motor</li>
            <li>The new Oster power cord is considerably better quality and is less likely to twist.</li>
            <li>I feel like I find myself going over my hair multiple times less often with these new clippers, feeling like they don&#x27;t need as many passes over my scalp to get all the hair cut</li>
            <li>I use it for my hair (not much up there any more) and for my face if i&#x27;ve let my beard go for too long to use my Norelco electric razor.  </li>
            <li>Easy to get hair stuck in a few nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li>To me, this is not worth the more than double price, and I&#x27;ve been clipping for 20 years.  </li>
            <li>It is quite quiet, very solid, very fast, and very thorough.  </li>
            <li>The clipper comes with a little tube of oil, but I&#x27;ve found 3-in-1 oil works just fine.</li>
            <li>Some cleaning and oiling is needed, it&#x27;s not like your Braun face shaver that is set and forget, but this machine is truly commercial grade, and could very well out live you.</li>
            <li>but i threw my old clippers out and put the new ones in my old case.</li>
            <li>The best part is that when u get a hair cut , after a week and a half, it stars to fade out, or get a little messy.</li>
            <li>Much better than my previous Andis clipper at the same price.  </li>
            <li>I feel the andis fits the hand better, but the sheer weight takes away from it slightly.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to repeat as many times on the same spot as I had to with the previous ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised after wanting a few videos how easy it was to do a buzz cut hairstyle.  </li>
            <li>Clipper is easy to use and take care of I only wish it had a few more attachments as I like to wear my hair a little longer in the colder weather</li>
            <li>I am pleased find that the new model seems to be unchanged in quality, with only a few cosmetic/ergonomic tweaks.</li>
            <li>I have found that when used in back to back hair cuts the blades can get very hot</li>
            <li>Keep them clean and oiled and they should last a long time.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair now for about 30 years; the Oster is very quiet, keen, and finely tuned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this could be fine for use on a casual basis, but it definitely isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;d call a workhorse clipper by any stretch of the imagination.</li>
            <li>This unit has a real heavy duty feel to it; it&#x27;s quieter than the other trimmers I&#x27;ve used; despite a lack of accessories, it makes beard trimming easy and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, they are great at cutting.</li>
            <li>Great for cutting hair just like the professionals</li>
            <li>It does a great job of cutting hair.  </li>
            <li>Cutting hair is a joy once again.</li>
            <li>Oster Professional Fast Feed Clipper fits the bill entirely.</li>
            <li>You get a clear sense of quality in this product.</li>
            <li>Compared to my old one which was a battery operated simple phillips device, this is a much sturdy item and does the job</li>
            <li>I know this is a mid range model (the professional models may be much nicer, but also pricier)</li>
            <li>Cut clean with less passes, don&#x27;t heat up like masters, and quality manufacturing.</li>
            <li>That said, it&#x27;s solid and reasonably priced for professional clippers.</li>
            <li>Now I use my old clippers for my head, and the Oster Fast Feed for facial hair.</li>
            <li>I guess the options are to spend hundreds and get a truly professional grade clippers, or save a few buck and keep getting the cheap clippers.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, not too difficult to clean (and oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After several cheapo clippers, I was ready to throw in the towel.</li>
            <li>, fast feed is low quality piece of trash, stay away and don&#x27;t believe the hype.</li>
            <li>I was replacing an Oster Professional Clipper that I had purchased in 1986.</li>
            <li>DiscountsJungle far exceeded my expectations for service.</li>
            <li>So far no problems.</li>
            <li>I had my son&#x27;s head buzz-cut in 10 minutes, as opposed to 30 minutes with the old clippers.  </li>
            <li>Easily fixed but a problem for people like me that take the hair one step from bald.    </li>
            <li>I bought this Oster Fast Feed clipper and the 10 piece Oster universal attachments that was recommended by Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far heavier duty, cord included.  </li>
            <li>They cut through hair fast and effortlessly and are relatively quiet considerng</li>
            <li>This feels like a professional model.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always shaved my head with no guard, and my last one was able to cut and leave just a very short rough stubble.  </li>
            <li>they are rather loud once they are against you</li>
            <li>To sum it up the clippers do feel professional as their name suggests but they do not cut professional.  </li>
            <li>Never had a problem so far in the two years that I&#x27;ve owned it</li>
            <li>He wasn&#x27;t nearly as frightened.</li>
            <li>I have been cutting my hair over ten years and this is simply the best quality clipper I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Works like a charm and they feel and sound sturdy and heavy duty, unlike the pieces of junk that you buy for $20 at the store around Christmas time.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this clipper to replace the old magnetic clipper I got over thirty years ago from Sears.</li>
            <li>and I would have to unscrew the blades, clean/lightly sand and oil them frequently.  </li>
            <li>but so far it has worked well.  </li>
            <li>I went with the Oster Professional.  </li>
            <li>They are professional quality</li>
            <li>the Wahl, the noise was so loud that it scared my two years old and made him cried with every hair cut.</li>
            <li>The 10 pieces combs definitely work with the Fast Feeder like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this product to update from Whal, which I have been using so far.</li>
            <li>My old Wahl</li>
            <li>Your results will look professional just like the name suggests.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully it will last much longer</li>
            <li>I bought this for my uncle and so far I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints or issues on it.</li>
            <li>Professional tool.  </li>
            <li>It still works, but with a loud buzz from the crack as you might imagine.</li>
            <li>I cut hair for friends and family members, and my old wal-mart clippers were not doing the job.</li>
            <li>I gave in and bought professional clipper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used these before and was pleasantly surprised to find that they couldn&#x27;t be easier to use.  </li>
            <li>I had a set of oster combs from old unit</li>
            <li>Very rugged, commercial construction.  </li>
            <li>I ENDED UP USING MY OLD CONAIR ELECTRIC RAZOR CASE.</li>
            <li>I also like how the motor is stronger, yet, isn&#x27;t as loud as you might expect.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the quietest and smoothest clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>Much better performance than the cheap units in the big box stores but not too expensive.  </li>
            <li>Well, let me tell you, after 3 years of college (I graduated early)</li>
            <li>Bought these 3 months ago, these are professional clippers and they loosen up with every haircut I do, and even during haircuts...would not suggest them to any stylists working for a living...</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t too loud.</li>
            <li>I use these to cut my husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s hair and they look like a professional cut their hair.</li>
            <li>So far I have had no problems.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast, relatively quiet, and powers through everything I&#x27;ve thrown at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it works well</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t present a real challenge to this clipper</li>
            <li>/&gt;The need to frequently oil blades is old-fashioned.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t have much money and needed a reliable clipper for personal use.  </li>
            <li>I believe these are near professional grade</li>
            <li>Truly professional clippers do not.</li>
            <li>I was used to spending near and around 15 bucks per haircut at the barber, which is a ton when it adds up.</li>
            <li>This two items are needed to complete the clipper.</li>
            <li>We have only used it a few times, so I cannot speak to longevity, but so far it cuts better than the &amp;#34;ConAir&amp;#34</li>
            <li>but this is a professional clipper</li>
            <li>I.e., not for those trying to shave their head or face nearly (but not quite) bald.</li>
            <li>It was also considerable cheaper online than in retail outlets.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve completely given up on this Oster and have changed my rating to two stars.</li>
            <li>I had an old Wahl made in China (purchased from Wally World) set that I have used for 15 years.  </li>
            <li>I just used my old clipper case to store it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional barber and wanted to add this clipper to my arsenal, but I think I&#x27;m going to have to stick to my Wahl Senior, Andis Master and Andis BGRC.</li>
            <li>Bought this trimmer after my old one died after 15 years of use.  </li>
            <li>Who wants to keep charging clippers that you might only use once a month?</li>
            <li>I have never used clippers before, but the haircut looks like a professional job.</li>
            <li>I have a pair of $40 Andis clippers (they broke TWICE which is why I bought these) that cut very close - the closest you can get whilst the stubble of the hair remains outside the skin.</li>
            <li>Bought this to use on my kids who are nervous about loud clippers.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no quieter than my old Wahl.  </li>
            <li>I ended up replacing the blades on my old Wahl and am now using that instead.  </li>
            <li>This really is professional quality.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it.  </li>
            <li>I have gone through a few sets of cheap Whal clippers.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;IT HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR ME, I AM A BARBER IN CALI AND SWITCHED FOR WAHL TO OSTER LAST YEAR</li>
            <li>so we can put the old wahl to the rest it deserves.</li>
            <li>I use it solely on my 9 year old and he no longer complains of pulls.</li>
            <li>The Oster Fast Feed is definitely that.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend this to anyone who shaves their head frequently.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the Only kid on the block with my fast feeds and T-finisher chromed out.</li>
            <li>I replaced a 10+ year old $40 set of Wahl clippers I got at Target.</li>
            <li>We had an old set of clippers from Wahl.</li>
            <li>I use 4 different type of clippers for my customers and the Oster Fast Feed Clippers</li>
            <li>No complaints, it beats my old Wahl Color Pro by leaps and bounds.  </li>
            <li>Every part simply “looks” and “feels” very well made and thought out.</li>
            <li>Been using it for proper manscaping for years, does the trick haha</li>
            <li>this the brand of one of his old clippers, and they are fifty years old.</li>
            <li>time I decided to try a set of professional clipper,</li>
            <li>The paper box it came with won&#x27;t hold up to years of use, so I am storing all the parts in the old Conair box.</li>
            <li>These clippers are professional grade.</li>
            <li>I had an old &amp;#</li>
            <li>Now head vibrating loud clipper anymore.  </li>
            <li>The Oster Professional Fast Feed Clipper with attachments did a good job cutting hair.</li>
            <li>Busy hair stylist.  </li>
            <li>Now here I am early Thursday morning with a quarter of the hair on my head shaved before I head to work.</li>
            <li>He insisted he wanted a professional grade hair trimmer instead</li>
            <li>I also purchased some Oster Professional 76926-800</li>
            <li>if the loud, biting Wahl 305G MC is akin to (let&#x27;s say)</li>
            <li>Relevant background: I have been cutting my own hair for the last 14 years.  </li>
            <li>you want it to not be loud?  </li>
            <li>Also this clipper does not offer a near zero depth cut.  </li>
            <li>Some of the cheaper units can be adjusted to a near shaved result for any unwanted hair areas.  </li>
            <li>Had a Wahl hair clipper before that wouldn&#x27;t cut near as well as this</li>
            <li>It truly feels like a professional tool.</li>
            <li>This thing is fast and quiet!</li>
            <li>I bought this clipper to replace a Wahl Professional clipper that was worn out.</li>
            <li>If you have a beard trimmer you can finish with that or even a razor would have no trouble at all after the Oster was finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These are very quiet and cut very well.  </li>
            <li>This product is very quiet and cuts very well.</li>
            <li>Package comes complete with adjustable blade and all the options.</li>
            <li>They also have the adjustable handle on the side so you can really blend different sizes together.</li>
            <li>my skin is highly sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have not used the guards as I purchased a complete set separately.  </li>
            <li>I went from a 4 year old junk CVS clipper to this.</li>
            <li>Bought clippers as a birthday present for the hubby who is very peculiar about his hair.  </li>
            <li>I have found that changing direction will frequently solve this problem.  </li>
            <li>I compare my experience to watching a professional hair cutter and how effortless their clippers seem to work.  </li>
            <li>not so loud and they hold up too</li>
            <li>I replaced the leaver from an old clipper I had laying around.</li>
            <li>Regrettably my old barber, Roy, has passed on and is now trimming the beards of the Angels.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The guides are marked 1/2\\&quot;, 3/8\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Quiet\\&quot; at all; it&#x27;s not really any more powerful, that I can tell anyway; and if you&#x27;re looking to have the option of the 0 close trim with no guard this will not do it--at least the Wahl did that.  </li>
            <li>The only better thing I can tell so far is the guards clip on tighter and stay on, which I&#x27;ve always had trouble with the Wahl&#x27;s.   </li>
            <li>Crazy good quality and very efficient for the price.</li>
            <li>It is a lot more expensive, but worth it, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Only cons are no case to put it in, and could use a few more attachment size varieties.</li>
            <li>The heavy cord is sort of a nuisance - I&#x27;m used to cordless rechargeable units - but that is more than offset by the comfort of the trim and the obvious quality of construction.</li>
            <li>Have only used a few times, but  I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>It feels nice and heavy duty (doesn&#x27;t have the empty plastic bottle sound when you tap it, the wire is heavy gauge too).</li>
            <li>My Son has been using his Oster clippers regularly for more than 10 years - trouble</li>
            <li>Have only used approximately 6 times but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>My initial impression is good, but, not great.  </li>
            <li>If you need a good set of clippers, you can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t design for thick hair at all, perhaps for kids&#x27; hair it might do an OK job...</li>
            <li>then again, probably because it is slow... :-)</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I could not get a good cut with these.</li>
            <li>They all worked fairly well in the beginning, but all have eventually failed on me.</li>
            <li>and I have heard the boys complain of this, so give it a minute to cool down.  </li>
            <li>I have spent the past 6 months trying to find a new barber but haven&#x27;t found anyone I liked.</li>
            <li>This is defnitely more powerful and cuts better than my other clippers but even after I have went over the same spot over and over again I notice hairs the next day that it failed to get.</li>
            <li>It does get a little bit warm (not hot) after 20 minutes of use, but I believe it is nothing to be alarmed about.</li>
            <li>The cord is is too stiff, it definitely needs to be more flexible like</li>
            <li>They are a little loud, but they make all the cuts look clean and professional.</li>
            <li>The noise is a minor inconvenence, it performs much better than my previous clippers.</li>
            <li>It has a powerful but quiet motor that can cut through hair at a fast speed and the adjustable clippers make it a breeze to quickly add or subtract millimeters of length quickly while cutting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Right out of the box, my heart dropped as the plastic feel, and stiff adjustable lever came to light.</li>
            <li>but I found that beyond a certain length (like beyond 1 inch) you&#x27;re better off using scissors since hair bends and scrunches up before it hits the cutting teeth and thus doesn&#x27;t extend to full length enough to be cut off at the desired 1&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have only owned one other $11 cheap set of clippers.  </li>
            <li>I have used numerous pairs of other clippers and none of the cheap brands seem to work well.  </li>
            <li>It feels strong and sturdy, and is small and lighter to handel.</li>
            <li>, very glad I spent a little extra and got these, my search is now over.</li>
            <li>These clippers did  a very nice job of cutting.</li>
            <li>I looked high and low for a reasonably priced clipper and finally found this one on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I buy these every couple of years, and after about 1 year, I have not noticed too much a decrease in function, but I will likely try a different brand or higher quality product the next time I buy one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This came with 5 plastic guards, oil, and a little brush to clean the blades.  </li>
            <li>With this model, they even give you a tube of oil and a little brush to clean the blade heads.</li>
            <li>Its smaller &amp; lighter &amp; costs less but just as easy to use.</li>
            <li>With my haircut being so easy, it would only take them 10 minutes or less to cut it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d bought a Costco clipper set for $40 or so in order to cut my husband&#x27;s fine hair and it never really worked well in addition to taking a long time.  </li>
            <li>so I particularly like its small size because it is easy to handle doing the back of my head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used all of my hair clippers (and I&#x27;ve had quite a few) with their original 3/8 inch comb.</li>
            <li>This is a powerful machine, as other reviewers have also noted.  </li>
            <li>Okay we are being serious about these clippers.  </li>
            <li>I was going back and forth between these clippers and the Oster Classic 76.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be using Amazon for future purchases, thanks!</li>
            <li>I found my beard trimmer to be a closer cut than these, and have recently resorted to using that as my main weapon of choice.  </li>
            <li>So just be advised that there is a possible limitation to this particular device depending on your needs...    </li>
            <li>I was vacillating between this one and the Classic 76 which I personally knew to be a quality clipper.  </li>
            <li>I only used my Oster for the first time today, but it is a night and day difference from my last clipper.  </li>
            <li>However, the blade becomes too hot after about 5 minutes of use, meaning bigger jobs have to be completed in multiple sittings.</li>
            <li>They did a decent job, but they usually only lasted a couple of years before burning out.  </li>
            <li>Our family uses the larger Oster Classic clipper.  </li>
            <li>However, I can&#x27;t get the super close cut to which I was accustomed with my previous clippers.</li>
            <li>I purchased this unit to replace an older one by the same manufacturer which I have used for over 20 years.</li>
            <li>I read several reviews prior to buying my first clipper.</li>
            <li>Good reviewers have not had unit long enough to experience battery failure.</li>
            <li>But for regular business or gentlemen&#x27;s haircuts along with do-it-yourself haircuts at home, I would highly recommend these clippers.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting the 10 set of universal guides because the guides that come with the clippers are insufficient.</li>
            <li>After showing her several haircutting tutorials on the Internet, she reluctantly agreed to try cutting my hair (mostly side and back trimming and taper since I am bald on top).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only had the chance to cut my hair twice with this new set so far.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive, but works really well and is much quieter than the cheaper version we had previously.</li>
            <li>I have returned my first product, thinking that it could be a rare manufacturing failure.</li>
            <li>It jammed all of the time, it did not have that much power, and it was very loud and did not ensure an even cut.</li>
            <li>these are very quiet and are very sharp and they seriously work great.</li>
            <li>It is very noisy with a strange vibration.  </li>
            <li>The Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed is quiet and cuts smoother than the Andis 24145 Speed Master 2 and about the same as the Forfex (Babyliss) AC Motor Clipper</li>
            <li>I have no regrets so far about this purchase.</li>
            <li>; brand my husband usually gets for cheap.</li>
            <li>I would usually get the cheap Walmart clippers</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I ordered and came days before I expected.</li>
            <li>higher quality then i expected.  </li>
            <li>When I received these clippers, I expected to be in clipping heaven when I powered them up for the first time.</li>
            <li>I bought these Osters because the pair of Wahl clippers that I had were dropped and the blade guard had chipped off a piece, causing direct exposure to the blades, as well as because the combs that came with the Wahls were loose and became VERY noisy when the clippers were turned on.     </li>
            <li>But it is definitely geared for human use only if you are going to clean it regularly.</li>
            <li>Fairly new user, but at this point I can say that this performs far better than any other razor I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in seven years of cutting his hair, he sat there very easily and and let me cut his hair without complaining.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve concluded that the reason for the poor results it that my hair is very fine.</li>
            <li>For the price, I expected a little better.  </li>
            <li>It may just be me...but other than that, clippers are quiet, quick and even cut.</li>
            <li>only thing that would have made this set better was if it came with a hard plastic storage box.  </li>
            <li>I hardly need to pass the clippers on the same spot more than once, and it gives an even cut.</li>
            <li>Finally it was time for a new unit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now had them for several years and they perform as well as they did when new.</li>
            <li>I just spend extra time cleaning it well, and it performs like new again.</li>
            <li>Last year I upgraded to this clipper and I have found the difference from my old Remington to be profound!</li>
            <li>In other words, it has a nice fluid cutting action and also is very quiet compared to most clippers while doing so.    </li>
            <li>Go to a store, buy a cheap set of clippers, go home, and clip my hear until the cheap clippers start to feel like they&#x27;re tearing hair out, as opposed to just cutting</li>
            <li>Quiet running and does a great job cutting close.</li>
            <li>despite how much I love these clippers, they just do not fit the purpose I expected to use them for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike most, it is heavy duty and works on wet or dry&lt;</li>
            <li>just warm.(30 minutes cutting)&lt;br /&gt;its not super powerful but</li>
            <li>Went through a whole collection of various clippers on our Giant Schnauzer.</li>
            <li>I was actually looking at a different brand when he said not so fast.  </li>
            <li>Light in hand, arm doesn&#x27;t get tired as fast.</li>
            <li>I  don&#x27;t need to go to the barber who never remembers me and if I need a quick touch up, it takes just a few minutes.</li>
            <li>This unit slices through thick and damp hair very quickly with no pulling and no pain.  </li>
            <li>i like the slow and more quiet motor on these.  </li>
            <li>So nice to use a product that feels heavy weight/durable - not cheap plastic junk.</li>
            <li>, I tracked down a set of older and better made attachments and went to business as usual.  </li>
            <li>Oster lined four out of the five holes for screws with metal, but the screw that slides the length of the blade up and down is cut right into the plastic.</li>
            <li>The only cons of cutting your own hair is cleaning up the mess, but I will gladly do that to save the cash.</li>
            <li>MAJOR TIP; - Keep blades oiled.</li>
            <li>No need to go back on the same spot multiple times because the first time gets it done.</li>
            <li>I suspect if you gave multiple, back to back cuts it would get really hot.</li>
            <li>Having grown tired of cheap clippers that sounded like a small lawnmower and pulled my hair like a screaming infant, I decided it was time to step up to a more reliable model.</li>
            <li>I think I cut my hair all of four times with the Oster before the adjustable blade handle started becoming a little loose, but it was still useable.</li>
            <li>Also, unlike the previous model that we had tried, this one only gets a little warm.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has very little tolerance for any residue on the blades, so even though I clean it regularily every now and again it will pull hair.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Only half of that is true.  </li>
            <li>The heat of the head is not uncomfortable, the noise and vibration very minimal.</li>
            <li>only thing is the guards are bad, get you some Andis magnet guards with this and your good to go!</li>
            <li>so far they&#x27;ve been extremely dependable and still cut very well.</li>
            <li>I have to go over and over my noggin probably fifteen times to get a decent, but still too long, haircut with the Oster.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quieter than my older model from 1995 so we will see how long it lasts and how well it cuts as time goes on.  </li>
            <li>Quiet, sharp, powerful.  </li>
            <li>The chrome limited editions were definitely worth the ten extra bucks too...</li>
            <li>I was afraid at first, but after a couple uses, was very comfortable with it.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I was a little skeptical buying this one because it was less than half the price of the Classic 76 (as well as only 12 watts in comparison to the 76&#x27;s 26 watts) which sort-of led me to believe it was not as good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I considered the bigger 76 classic but opted for the fast feed because I knew I would be giving consecutive hair cuts and didn&#x27;t want to get tired of holding the MUCH heavier Oster classic 76.  </li>
            <li>I wish they had metal replacement blades of different sizes like the Classic 76 model as the plastic guards are a bit fragile.</li>
            <li>The attachments got so cheap that if you pushed too hard on your head, the attachment would distort.  </li>
            <li>They make a dull \\&quot;buzzing\\&quot; sound when invoked.</li>
            <li>Not a bad clipper, quiet, painless but could trim a little closer.</li>
            <li>The fast feed has a pivot motor in it which is very powerful and smooth cutting compared to clippers you will find at Walmart or other chain stores.  </li>
            <li>I have learned over the years that the joy of buying something cheap is soon lost in the pain of disappointment and failure!    </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the clipper gave amazing cuts but Oster quoted me $40 to refurbish the housing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always owned cheap clippers... and never liked them.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been too busy and believe I&#x27;ve kept it far too long.  </li>
            <li>For the past several years I had been using a cheap Wahl brand hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>In the past I bought cheap clippers which only lasted a year before breaking.</li>
            <li>This clipper cuts very well and am hoping that it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, professional build and very quiet!</li>
            <li>it took me 40 min to shave my head completely with it as I had to pass again and again on the same spot, I ordered the 20 something</li>
            <li>Wow, I was amazed how quiet it run and</li>
            <li>I currently use it to nearly shave my head.  </li>
            <li>This product is used to cut hair on several boys and an adult, so it does get quite a bit of use.</li>
            <li>It replaced a ~20 year old Wal-Mart clipper that finally crapped out on me.</li>
            <li>I have given myself several haircuts using the razor guard which was fixed on the Oster razor when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this clipper daily in a professional setting for over a year now</li>
            <li>They have to be hooked to the back of the metal plate by some force which makes frequent comb changing a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li>ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added the  Oster Professional 10 Universal Comb Set</li>
            <li>The longest attachment is only 1/2&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s a bit shorter than what I prefer for my young son.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by that when I open the package.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really fast what I expected.</li>
            <li>It cuts quite well and is extremely quiet compared to the 30 year old Oster clippers it replaced.</li>
            <li>and wow, they cut evenly and left me so crispy.</li>
            <li>I am a sixty year old guy who lives in a small home with a Golden Retriever in Northern Nevada.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use adjustables for close cuts or fades, I generally only use them for normal clipper-over-comb style cuts and rarely open them all the way up.</li>
            <li>it leaves many hair behind</li>
            <li>Any one looking for a good clipper don&#x27;t be afraid to spend the money on this product.</li>
            <li>I was told it takes about a year to get really good at cutting their hair</li>
            <li>Light family use on thick hair.</li>
            <li>They make light work of my thick hair.  </li>
            <li>Cutting quality is also good.</li>
            <li>If you are doing your own hair and want to step up from the department store set than you can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li>This model clipper is good to begin hair cutting with.</li>
            <li>I got too freaked out to continue using it and usually didn&#x27;t give more than 6 or 7 haircuts in a row before letting the thing cool down for a while, so I can&#x27;t tell you if it would destroy the motor if you used it longer.  </li>
            <li>The issues were usually sudden loud motor sound, grabbing and pulling of hair even when new, or simply not having the power necessary to clip the hair despite slow feeding through hair.  </li>
            <li>I started cutting my own hair after giving up my Natural and not wanting to go back to a Quo Vadis or search for a new barber.</li>
            <li>I have thick, spiky hair and usually have problems cutting quickly and effectively with most clippers.</li>
            <li>They are what everyone say.and some just take your time and learn them and you won&#x27;t want to use another clipper ever I adjusted the blade down to 0 and like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>On the down side, this clipper gets hot to hold after about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>You can buy less expensive clippers, but as I learned, you will not be happy with them.  </li>
            <li>they can&#x27;t go half as fast as my old clippers.  </li>
            <li>They are quiet and easy to handle, even in the delicate face areas.</li>
            <li>With it I managed to give myself a more or less proper haircut, down to my desired 3/8 inch length.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had more expensive clippers in the past, but these are just fine.  </li>
            <li>Only not so great thing is that it doesn&#x27;t bring different Adonis for cutting hair at different sizes.</li>
            <li>the other is much finer.  </li>
            <li>Like other buyers have noted, this is a real machine that cuts your hair or beard evenly.  </li>
            <li>It takes much fewer passes than the other ones I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>they are extremely reliable and cut my hair much faster.</li>
            <li>Man, these sets are the real thing and do not feel flimsy like the other plastic sets.</li>
            <li>One thing you can&#x27;t really tell by the picture is that it&#x27;s very heavy and hard to maneuver even for most guys.  </li>
            <li>This is a high quality clipper with just long enough cord.</li>
            <li>only gripes with this product are the lack of quality attachments, the cheap feeling on/off button, and I wish this trimmer came in a hard plastic box rather than a cardboard</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really use them for edging like my old Wahl&#x27;s as they just don&#x27;t get close enough when adjusted down.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The vibration caused one of the screws to come loose and fall out, but I&#x27;m not sure what besides locktite would actually keep it in and still be able to remove the screws at a later time if I needed to.</li>
            <li>may be walking around with my hair wildly standing out in different directions, because that&#x27;s how my hair grows, and this short it&#x27;s just going to do that.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for about 5 years now, and this is by far the quickest clippers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>At one point I decided that the clippers are only lasting 3 - 5 uses, which would still be cheaper than the professional shop visits.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this clipper a few times, but it&#x27;s so much better than my previous model--a brand professionals use, purchased at Sally&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for nearly 15 years.</li>
            <li>Not heavy use--just cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li>I have used this machine for 2 years so far and here is a list of positive and negative features I have observed so far</li>
            <li>The Andis Master would get really hot in the little amount of time.</li>
            <li>I never had a major issue with the Wahl clippers until recently, when some of the guards started to fall off mid-cut.</li>
            <li>At first I was excited about it and after first use I was disappointed as it didn&#x27;t cut my hair as close as I like or even as close as the Whal.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this 5 stars is, one they don&#x27;t have a 4 1/2 star rating and lastly because of the poor quality of the plastic guide combs which don&#x27;t seat very secure over the cutter.  </li>
            <li>I give these only four stars because I had trouble finding the right guards to go on them.  </li>
            <li>Just had my first cut with the Oster and it&#x27;s head and shoulders above the $40-$50 Wahl I previously owned which would always miss hairs and took forever having to go over my head 3 times.      </li>
            <li>This clipper is lighter and quieter than many other quality clippers, and it has a long cord that does not  easily tangle.</li>
            <li>I had a routine down with my old set and am still trying to figure out a new routine with the Oster&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Definitely much quiter than your average drugstore clippers.</li>
            <li>at least based on the other mostly glowing reviews.</li>
            <li>However as a bonus it is also quieter than my old clippers, giving off just a minor humm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a professional barber but had a professional barber recommend them to me</li>
            <li>I used the old clickety clackity ones for a long time.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t close to the Oster professional I used to have but not far from it.</li>
            <li>I purchased these clippers a few weeks ago and used them for the first time.</li>
            <li>This will probably be the first thing I&#x27;ll take the trouble to return through Amazon.</li>
            <li>The first box that I received was missing all of the included accessories, but had 2 user manuals.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty heavy</li>
            <li>What made it worse was that he had to endure it even longer for me to go over a few more passes to get it to cut the strands it missed, which was an agony for me to see him cried so much</li>
            <li>I have some Wahl clippers that sound like a motorcycle, but the motor in these have little next to no noise, even after cutting for more than 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have been buzzing my hair down to nothing on and off my whole life.  </li>
            <li>But the Fast Feed is half the cost, also heavy duty, lighter in weight, and doesn&#x27;t get hot while using it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper for my oldest son a few years back, and after he moved out, I bought another for my younger son.  </li>
            <li>keep in mind that i haven&#x27;t had this clipper very long, but its solid, durable and as advertised so far!  </li>
            <li>I have reviewed many a clipper, and took back a few after trying, this clipper is very solid, alittle heavy</li>
            <li>I found an old, very inexpensive clipper I haven&#x27;t used for years and decided to finish cutting my hair with it, using its original 3.8 inch comb.</li>
            <li>Our ancient Oster clippers (Model 11) finally died due to a short in the coil winding, so after research I settled on replacing them with the Oster Fast Feed.  </li>
            <li>I used to use my other one to shave my beard off when it was time and it would reduce a beard to tiny stubble but this leaves it still pretty long even on its closest setting.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t what I expected when I purchased item titled new.</li>
            <li>Be careful if you live where its humid as the blade will rust.  </li>
            <li>The motor is quieter, and unit is light and easy to work with, but the result is very disappointing.  </li>
            <li>Had high hopes for this clipper based on other reviews.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You really don&#x27;t need to spend $10 at a barber every week when you got one of these... and it therefore pays for itself in less than 2 months.</li>
            <li>They are much quieter than the previous ConAir clippers I had.</li>
            <li>and it shaved heads much closer and with less repetition.  </li>
            <li>They are much quieter running than my previous clippers and they have not pulled my sons hair.  </li>
            <li>The clipper does not cut adequately, not sure if it is a design or power issue, but it is frequently snagging, so I have to take much longer to cut.</li>
            <li>WOW I cannot believe I waited so long to get such a quality pair of clippers.  </li>
            <li>Dog doesn&#x27;t mind for the first half-hour, but gets impatient for the next hour.  </li>
            <li>I have super thick hair and every set of clippers I had tried always got hung up after about a two inch swipe through my hair.</li>
            <li>Neither of us have super thick hair.</li>
            <li>I decided to go with these because as one reviewer mentioned, the Classic 76 was a bit big and heavy which made it difficult to cut your own hair, which is what I was planning on doing.</li>
            <li>decided it was time to get real professional clippers and went with these Oster due to the rave reviews.</li>
            <li>, I have thin hair and was having trouble with other clippers, this one worked the best, I did have to go over a few times but not a big thing,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many reviews complaining about how the trimmer heads are too tight or too loose, but I haven&#x27;t had any trouble.</li>
            <li>so until they get a clue, pony up the extra to make your BMW road worthy or buy 3 wahls and get used to slow haircuts.</li>
            <li>Through the years I went to other brands like Wahl and Andis, I must say that these clippers are right up there with other brands that you will get in the same line.  </li>
            <li>Next is going to be the black Oster Speed Line and blue Fast Feeds.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;ll be as sharp as new.  </li>
            <li>The cord is tough as rocks and securely fastened to the casing.</li>
            <li>The blade is adjustable and doesn&#x27;t slide out easily (which sometimes happens if you press hard on other machines).       </li>
            <li>I have burned through so many of the cheaper models and they turn dull after just a few uses.</li>
            <li>I initially thought a breaker was blown or that the electrical receptacle was bad, so I tried a known good outlet.</li>
            <li>i can understand some of the negative feedback some people give on the adjustable arm being made of cheap plastic and could break, but if you are careful i don&#x27;t see that as a big deal.  </li>

            <li> Best trimmer</li>
            <li> the best feature about this item is it doesn&#x27;t give you razor bumps.</li>
            <li> but it is a great addition to my set!</li>

            <li> The best deal and best haircut yet.</li>
            <li> I knocked off a star for the heat and noise because in my mind a perfect rating has to be earned, not given just for doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE CLIPPERS!!!</li>
            <li> Oster makes excellent products all the time and this clipper is one nice machine!!  </li>
            <li> I rate them as a very good buy.</li>
            <li> Very good.  </li>
            <li> Also, the combs don&#x27;t do a very good job.  </li>
            <li> very good clipper.</li>
            <li> But one thing the plastic heads do not stay on very good.</li>
            <li> Very good product.</li>
            <li> this model is VERY good for the price .</li>
            <li> A very good clipper.</li>
            <li> Very good Clippers.</li>
            <li> very good likes the price</li>
            <li> Very good clipper for haircuts and beards.</li>
            <li> Very good quality</li>
            <li> Very good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> She used the techniques we saw on YouTube that involved using the guide combs and the results were very good.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, works great.</li>
            <li> I spoke to a couple barbers and they agreed that it&#x27;s not the ideal tool for beard trimming and styling.  </li>
            <li> Great product...not the best for a close shaved head.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Definitely good buy!</li>
            <li> We are delighted!</li>
            <li> He absolutely loved them!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and good value, used twice per week for over a year with no problems.</li>
            <li> Purrs like a kitten, cuts beautifully, looks and feels like quality merchandise.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the cuts were because the blades weren&#x27;t perfectly aligned, but either way still not as good as the Osters.  </li>
            <li> very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li> and it works great.</li>
            <li> The clippers did a great job when I cut my husband&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> They make great stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Another great product from Oster</li>
            <li> I was not that happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know a couple of friends who cut their own hair, so I started to research which would be the best clippers for a beginner to buy.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> The clippers work great</li>

            <li> The clippers worked great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because it was great while it worked</li>
            <li> My boys were so happy they didn&#x27;t get their hair pulled or their skin pinched anymore.</li>
            <li> I came to this quite by accident, but I&#x27;m happy to have discovered this no maintenance summer haircut for my son.  </li>
            <li> Great for kids</li>
            <li> Great price and a well made clipper.  </li>
            <li> So after a month of happily using the clipper, I called Oster and discovered that this model DOES NOT have replaceable metal combs...  </li>

            <li> great though].  </li>

            <li> -in-all after about 5 years of owning this clipper and over 1000 haircuts with it, I can honestly say this was probably the best investment I ever made.  </li>

            <li> Oster is a great manufacture who also makes blenders, waffle machines, and etc.</li>
            <li> Best buzzer I own to date.</li>
            <li> , he found these on Amazon for a great price.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s very nice.  </li>
            <li> (Reason for the 4 v 5 rating) I did buy the attachments that are sold separately and they are amazing!</li>
            <li> so we knew it was a good brand, and the price at Amazon was great.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers they are perfect for tapering and even fading i would recommend these clippers to anyone!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suffice it to say, we are very happy with our clippers and are so glad we bought them.</li>
            <li> The clippers work GREAT for my husband and surprisingly, also on our dog.</li>
            <li> Co-workers, family, and friends were all customers of mine and they were most impressed with the job I did as well as the smootheness of the clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works great, good power.  </li>
            <li> .Oster did a wonderful job fitting everything in a lightweight package.</li>

            <li> If you consistently clean the clipper with the bade oil and blade wash, then there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem with the clipper at all!!!</li>
            <li> Very good price too:)</li>
            <li> We thought those were good clippers until we used the Oster clippers.</li>

            <li> This is good stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I was hesitant to use something with a cord, but I attached this cord to a good extension cord and there was no problem at all doing it where I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Not as good a job as the reviews lead me to believe but still</li>

            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use this without any extenders, but it does not give a super close trim.... if you want to go truly bald... this is not the best clippers for doing that.</li>
            <li> It comes with a variety of guards for differing lengths and is exceptional for hair and beards.</li>

            <li> Still have for many years, works great.</li>
            <li> i would say it is ok,, nothing great</li>
            <li> Works flawless and can tell it&#x27;s quality by the build just make sure you get a good sanitizing and cleaning spray for after use to keep the blades lubricated and running free of clogs.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I went with these.</li>

            <li> Very pleased with clippers</li>
            <li> I have a golden and am having difficulty getting the knack of blending, but for trimming fur on the belly and between the pads of her paws, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Good weight, nice feel in your hands.</li>
            <li> Very strong motor and good blades.</li>

            <li> I love these clippers!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
            <li> I love this clipper!  </li>
            <li> Great pricing and easy to use.</li>
            <li> the guards that come with it are just fine and work great</li>
            <li> Does a GREAT job on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> And as a result, it&#x27;s effectiveness may largely depend on which personality best meshes with your process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The weight is fine for managing one handed with a cord, and they have a good heft, giving me a good sense of a substantial motor.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not fond of the guards, but then I don&#x27;t use them for the length I want.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What was I thinking these are what the pros use and they are amazing.</li>
            <li> The motor is great, runs smooth</li>
            <li> this clipper was amazing and worked like the day I got it.  </li>
            <li> Amazing clipper</li>
            <li> Works amazing.</li>
            <li> the gradient is amazing and it never cuts my skin.</li>
            <li> All of the techniques that I used before to make him look better seem to me now like an effort to disguise the lack of a good clipper.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so would have liked a comb for 1 inch.</li>
            <li> I was getting people saying the haircut looks nice even though I could tell (because I scrutinized) that I screwed up.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just have nice friends(or</li>
            <li> He uses it without the attachments, and it gives him a nice, close cut.  </li>
            <li> These Oster clippers are in a class of their own.</li>
            <li> but I rigged that on my own.</li>
            <li> They cut nicely.</li>
            <li> Mine is the kind that if there&#x27;s no hair gel in it, it flops around in the slightest breeze.</li>
            <li> but they are the absolute best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Did a nice job.</li>
            <li> gets the job done and feels nice and sturdy, no frills, no frustration.</li>
            <li> Their vinyl bag is nice, too.</li>
            <li> They never snagged and they cut really nice and evenly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I invested in a good hair clipper.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair</li>
            <li> I honestly wish I could return it</li>
            <li> You could tell it used to be nice at one point.</li>
            <li> The even level of the cut seems way superior to Wahl and leagues better than the crappy Conair clippers.  </li>
            <li> glad oster still makes a good product.</li>
            <li> I ordered the razor to do my own burr haircuts.  </li>
            <li> Cut my own hair with additional combs I ordered.</li>
            <li> i also own an andis fade master</li>
            <li> So, I decided to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> Now my boys are doing their own hair and it is standing up to the abuse of teens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my own hair since the 7th grade</li>
            <li> Nicely made.</li>
            <li> Cut your own hair and save the hassle and money.</li>
            <li> I can set this clipper at the length I like without attachments and buzz my own head with the help of a hand held mirror.</li>
            <li> Like anything if you treat it nice, it will treat you nice.</li>
            <li> have found that for my uses the Oster Fast feed is not an excellent product.  </li>
            <li> I cut my own hair</li>
            <li> and it does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> These clippers are really nice.</li>
            <li> Best used after cleaning hair and combing it straight.</li>
            <li> I have cut my own hair two times with them and a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> to add my own take after reading the reviews -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> clippers did get quite warm...</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my Oster Fast Feed Clippers.  </li>
            <li> But now with this oster I have build my confidence and started doing my own fade haircut.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The Oster Fast feed is probably one of the best adjustable clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I am adding my enthusiastic approval to the pile.  </li>
            <li> and I cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> I currently own whal and andis clippers ,but have never owned oster clipper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buzzing my own hair for about 12 years now.</li>
            <li> I do my own hair once a week</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband to do his own buzzcuts.  </li>
            <li> We learned how to cut our own hair and used them for about a year.  </li>
            <li> He and his roommates are very happy with this Oster Prof Fast Feed Clipper.  </li>
            <li> These are quieter and cut nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice price</li>
            <li> gives me a nice even cut.  </li>
            <li> On one believes i cut my own hair</li>
            <li> At a reasonable price, it provides excellent value</li>
            <li> Nice weight to it.</li>
            <li> so I purchased my own set of clippers.</li>
            <li> We hope to get a lot of use out of this nice trimmer.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it came with some kind of case</li>
            <li> I thought I might as well invest in my own clipper and save money by doing it myself.</li>
            <li> Price was within my budget, others have liked also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Wahl clipper for years now, as I cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> so I may not ever need the combs.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a really nice precision cut too,</li>
            <li> The Oster fast feed is one of the best clippers you can get period.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it came with a bag or container too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been clippering my own head for 20 years and never had clippers act like this.</li>
            <li> they get the job done nicely.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give them a 4 as some type of case would have been nice.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone who needs a nice set of clippers.</li>
            <li> It runs perfectly and cuts really well.</li>
            <li> and then they start to warm up.  </li>
            <li> wish the cord was just a bit longer, and it would&#x27;ve been nice if it came with a case of some kind, as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality and the accessories are fine, too.  </li>
            <li> keep these clean and oiled and you will have a great clipper for years.</li>
            <li> Excellent clippers, highly recommend</li>
            <li> My really cheap but GREAT old trimmer from Best Buy died after about 25 years of service.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that to be true, but they&#x27;re great nonetheless.</li>
            <li> With so many choices we&#x27;re very pleased with this purchase.</li>

            <li> Does a great job quickly.</li>
            <li> It would also be a good idea to set these to a zero gap its fairly easy and makes a difference.</li>

            <li> Easy to use and results are good.</li>

            <li> There are a lot of professional clippers that I&#x27;m sure are wonderful</li>
            <li> Excellent for a skilled professional.</li>

            <li> I use the 000 setting, and it was very smooth going over the skin.</li>
            <li> Very light in weight and a prefect compliment to my Andis Fade Masters.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product because it cuts very smoothly.</li>
            <li> I have cut my own hair for 20 years and this is the first good pair of clipper I have owned.</li>
            <li> I think these are nice and strong clippers.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes we get overzealous when we find a good product, but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re exagerating when we make the claim that these are super clippers.  </li>
            <li> These clippers made it easy for me to cut my own</li>
            <li> Love the Clippers very precise</li>
            <li> It has almost been two years since i purchased this clipper, and so far its been very good to me.</li>
            <li> So far the durability has been very good</li>
            <li> and it was a huge mistake!</li>
            <li> Love this Clipper, have no issues with this been a year now since i have it</li>
            <li> That worked better.</li>
            <li> A lot better than Wahl.</li>
            <li> I am 100% pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to any person looking for a top quality consumer grade clipper.</li>
            <li> I used various techniques to make his hair look at its best</li>
            <li> and I now love to give my husband a haircut.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make my husbands hair grow faster to make me use it more often....</li>
            <li> I just wish it had more attachments with it.  </li>
            <li> I have already recomended it to many family members and friends.</li>
            <li> I found myself much more dexterous with the took and more confident in my and the clipper&#x27;s abilities.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even recall how I snagged such a great price on this!</li>
            <li> It worked okay, but not as well as our Wahl.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve since purchased another inexpensive Wahl clipper, and it works much better.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be best suited for basic use, like giving someone a buzz cut.  </li>
            <li> I can say i got every penny out of them and more, but its time to move on.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> This also gives a better, neater, more even cut.  </li>
            <li> Now i&#x27;ve been going to a barber for many years, and I get a Taper hair cut which runs about 17 bucks.</li>
            <li> and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this clipper.</li>
            <li> I guess because the blade is adjustable, but I&#x27;d recommend buying additional attachments for more variety.</li>
            <li> No complaints, faster, better haircuts and it&#x27;s made in the USA.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i wish clippers would come with a more flexible cord, which none seem to do.</li>
            <li> I love it since the day I got it.</li>
            <li> I looked around at clippers and figured I would only be buying this once and would buy the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this unit.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the clippers for a couple months, but they work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> and I expect many years of service.</li>
            <li> We are definitely satisfied.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it will cost alot more.</li>
            <li> These clippers are really outstanding.  </li>
            <li> It costs more</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, I decided to get this one.  </li>
            <li> One more cut and it will have paid for itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them many times over a couple of years, on me and on dogs.</li>
            <li> It pays for itself tenfold or more.</li>
            <li> I give myself a standard buzzcut sometimes and the included 3/8 and 1/4 guides work perfectly for that</li>
            <li> &gt;* more durable attachments - the set they sell ($25) is more than most clippers</li>
            <li> and we are enjoying them.  </li>
            <li> I do think these are good quality clippers that probably are great for a specific purpose in a barber&#x27;s arsenal of tools.  </li>
            <li> These clippers are outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Feels much more substantial than cheaper models bought at Walmart, Target, etc.  </li>
            <li> I moved the top blade a bit</li>
            <li> I was thinking this would be so much better and quieter</li>
            <li> The problem is that when cleaning it, if you remove all of the screws to remove the cut hairs more than 4-5 times, the screws no longer hold their grip because the grooves are in plastic and break off.</li>
            <li> and I love them.  </li>
            <li> and I am so glad I listened.</li>
            <li> i was especting it to cut more shorter or cleaner</li>
            <li> and I would probably give it 5 if it was made better.</li>
            <li> I know these may not be better than the Andis Masters</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s practical and looks cute.  </li>
            <li> This works so much better.</li>
            <li> and I get better and faster results with a 15 dollar pair of WAHL.</li>
            <li> Even with out the attachments it had to be shaved many times over for it to cut most of the hair.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Wahl was better quality, but, still didn&#x27;t seem to give an even cut.  </li>
            <li> Great clipper with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to write a review of this product as I have been the proud owner of one for over 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was easily able to give about 5 haircuts an hour.  </li>
            <li> Just wish I was a better cat groomer.  </li>
            <li> but I am glad I chose this clipper.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair and that of my son every two - three weeks ,My son love it because it never pull and it glides through effortlessly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought Wahl clippers that were 10x better than these</li>
            <li> (Looks and feels a lot better</li>
            <li> with okay guards</li>
            <li> I will purchase more for grooming my dog.</li>
            <li> It has paid for itself many times over.</li>
            <li> Much better than any Wahls I ever owned.</li>
            <li> Greatest clipper ever used really quiet</li>
            <li> The Oster feels way more durable.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I use it to trim my cats and its just ok.</li>
            <li> though I use it without guides as I want buzz cut...should come with more attachments for the price</li>
            <li> This was used for sure</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> But a friend bought these and recommended, and my wife and I are glad he did.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and the cheap stuff from drugs stores wasn&#x27;t getting it done anymore.</li>
            <li> Love love love these clippers.</li>
            <li> I look forward to many years of service and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> These clippers are orders of magnitude better that any of the $15 to $20 clippers we&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Buying a hair clipper is the most rewarding home economy tip.</li>
            <li> so I thought Oster will be faster and better to do fading</li>
            <li> more could you want?</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a problem, more of an irritant.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> So far these have fit the bill perfectly for my needs.</li>
            <li> I love love love my clippers.</li>
            <li> More than I care to admit.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think many people will get to it.</li>
            <li> I think it does a good job, but think she was looking for one that was a bit more powerful.</li>
            <li> Most around $20.  </li>
            <li> I was able with lots of nursing to cut my hair</li>
            <li> Either way i&#x27;m glad i have both.</li>
            <li> and i like them, but after using the Andis, i&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> Could come with a more comprehensive comb set.</li>
            <li> I have been barbering for many years and these clippers just make my job easier.</li>
            <li> so even better.</li>
            <li> Although I was the cutter not the cutter, even cleanup was so much better.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend buying the add on attachments if you want more variety in lengths.</li>
            <li> Oster clipper quality is top notch.</li>
            <li> I had a Oster clipper before and used it for more than 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve had many clippers before this one and this one is definitely the best.</li>
            <li> I wanted more.  </li>
            <li> i wish i had bought this years ago.&lt;br /&gt;far better than the wahl trimmer i have just thrown in the trash.</li>
            <li> I am glad I got it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s astonishing.    </li>
            <li> The durability alone would make the price point worthwhile.</li>
            <li> But this Oster has held up for me very well, and I&#x27;m extremely happy with</li>
            <li> These are way better.</li>
            <li> I love the blending comb attachment.</li>
            <li> I think if you buy these clippers you will be glad you did.  </li>
            <li> Oster clippers work better, cooler.</li>
            <li> are a way better design than the Oster guards with clip on.</li>
            <li> I had a cheaper brand and it worked ok.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and I have been using the cheap clippers which pull your hair out.</li>
            <li> This is the best haircutting regiman I have ever had and see no reason that I will change in the future.</li>
            <li> The motor is ok.. ..</li>
            <li> For the quality and price you can&#x27;t do much better.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, I decided to try the Oster (paid $55 for it).  </li>
            <li> I decided to invest in a better pair of clippers.  </li>
            <li> DOES IN MY OPINION BETTER JOB THAN THE WAHL SENIOR&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to many more years of faithful Oster service from my well-maintained clippers.  </li>
            <li> I love these things.</li>
            <li> It is so much better than store bought clippers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just nice to have quality rather than the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> It cuts better than any wahl i&#x27;ve ever had but the whisper-quiet motor is a bunch of B***S</li>
            <li> These guards are better than the guards that come with the clippers.</li>
            <li> It could come with more clipping guards though.</li>
            <li> I think it is better than the Wahl but time will tell.</li>
            <li> , I can definitely say I made a great choice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have this clipper for years to come.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re hesitating, on the fence about investing in a better quality clipper, I suggest you go for it.  </li>
            <li> Compared to a Conair, this thing is not only a joy to use, but gives superior buzzes, too.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this clipper.</li>
            <li> This clipper did the job, made nice smooth cuts.  </li>
            <li> So clippers are an important tool in our house!  </li>
            <li> We looked at many.</li>
            <li> Be sure and pick up some oil for it as well from Oster.</li>
            <li> So I use scissors on top, electric shears everywhere else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cuts rather than pulls my hair and has a better build quality.</li>
            <li> We are totally pleased.  </li>
            <li> Overall, great clippers for the price!</li>
            <li> good price,weight but not so powerful...</li>
            <li> One more haircut</li>
            <li> and it looks a lot better.</li>
            <li> and i love the fact that it is electric and don&#x27;t have to charge it beforehand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> This model appears to have a better switch and an added plus is the support of the cord at the clipper.</li>
            <li> better than advertised.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I chose these</li>
            <li> work good, not as good as using metal blade attachments like professional clippers</li>
            <li> just okay.  </li>
            <li> We were even able to take the comb off and trim his mustache.</li>
            <li> We have used these clippers a handful of times since receiving them and I am mostly satisfied.  </li>
            <li> This was one of the best products I&#x27;ve bought online recently.</li>
            <li> An excellent deal for the low price.</li>
            <li> This device pays for itself in a short time - an excellent investment.</li>
            <li> and I love the way it works</li>
            <li> But for the price of 20-30 some bucks to replace every year or so, it was ok.  </li>
            <li> Definitely better than a cheapo set.  </li>
            <li> Its ok,not like the way it was written in the review i read about it being the 3rd best hair clipper</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product, as described, now i just hope it holds up to its reviews.</li>
            <li> This one works much better.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> On top of that, just using them to shave my face</li>
            <li> I wish they came with more guide combs</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s soo much better and easier</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> sure to purchase some sort of blade wash with this - blade wash</li>
            <li> They are so quiet, and yet do the job perfect.</li>
            <li> Much much better quality than the andis and whal trimmer</li>
            <li> My son and I love the quietness of it too.</li>
            <li> It has paid for itself many times over.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m looking forward to never paying for a haircut again :-)</li>
            <li> Use it every week and everytime I&#x27;m getting better and faster at just getting a buzz cut.  </li>
            <li> Had to order a better assortment of combs, though.  </li>
            <li> The one I bought from Costco for $25 - $30 dollars is so much better.</li>
            <li> The baby liked the smooth vibration and there were no tears this time.</li>
            <li> Ok product when compared to price and quality .</li>
            <li> For a guy that shaves his head about twice a week, I couldn&#x27;t ask for better trimmers.</li>
            <li> Better than the ones they replace.</li>
            <li> Many of the alternatives charged $25.00 to $40.00.  </li>
            <li> My problems with it involve it&#x27;s tendency to accumulate hair on the top of the clipper comb and that reduces it&#x27;s ability to feed and cut hair.  </li>
            <li> I guess most of my problems are &amp;#34;user caused&amp;#34; and I just need to practice more.  </li>
            <li> For the money, it&#x27;s a good deal and worth the cost...</li>
            <li> When I cut my cousin&#x27;s hair I noticed a lil more about the heat.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers.</li>
            <li> This top of the line clipper is everything the description implied it to be.  </li>
            <li> They have yet to give more than two haircuts in a day, but odds are slim that they&#x27;ll see more than that.</li>
            <li> and I love these clippers.</li>
            <li> Stay on top of the maintenance for these clippers and you will&lt;br /&gt;save</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s satisfied and we will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> they work as advertised and cut hair better than the one it replaced</li>
            <li> All Roy had to do was give me a number three on top and a two on the sides.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will figure it out</li>
            <li> And so far, so good!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, good smooth clipping!  </li>
            <li> does get kind of warm, but not scolding hot.</li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job, cuts through my hair very easily, does an even job, never chokes up.</li>
            <li> great product highly recommeded</li>
            <li> A good quality clipper, much better than those available in most drugstores and well worth its price.  </li>
            <li> The product works very well,  is easy to use and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to handle and cut very precisely.</li>
            <li> The cool thing is that every  time I cut my own hair, I realize that I am saving $15.</li>
            <li> At first this was a good shaver but over times it&#x27;s not shaving as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the 76 is worth every penny to those with the need, but the Fast Feed seems ideal for home use.</li>
            <li> The first was good, cut well, and lasted 5 or 6 years, till I lost them.  </li>
            <li> good exactly what we wanted....</li>
            <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve bought in a long time.</li>
            <li> Best investment I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> Very nice complement to your oster classic 76 if you don&#x27;t already have them.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me say that the experience of making a purchase on Amazon.com was both pleasant and easy.</li>
            <li> Really happy with my new Wahl&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Maybe because it&#x27;s new, but works great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use &amp; love how the blade is adjustable.  </li>
            <li> Outstanding reviews made the choice easy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super picky with the things i own</li>
            <li> Was able to give myself and my son a pro haircut very quickly.</li>
            <li> use this clipper without issues, I am faster, the cut is more precise and it looks better than ever.  </li>
            <li> but these are more precise and offer a better cut all around.  </li>
            <li> I really hope it would that good for more than two yrears</li>
            <li> also looks great; the red in the photo is actually a nice retro burgundy.)</li>
            <li> (Own two sets that both work perfect) highly recommend these clippers for professional use.</li>
            <li> Cuts great so far!</li>
            <li> Leaves a clean cut!</li>
            <li> From the glowing reviews on this product, I can assume they work just fine for most people.  </li>
            <li> Had some $20 Wahl clippers for many years and did the job just fine</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure if I called the company they would have replaced the guard, however it works fine</li>
            <li> A very good buy overall, and aside from have to replace a blade because I dropped it</li>
            <li> This clipper works good, I would have liked it to cut a little shorter, but all in all a good clipper.  </li>
            <li> In compared to the andis&#x27;s polished metal feel, and silky smooth adjuster lever, the oster feel more like a toy than a tool.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I use to have a cheap Conair clipper and they worked better than these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beyond pleased to see that these clippers are still available.</li>
            <li> purchased the Oster Professional for a friend for a birthday, great product.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, replacement parts are widely available and the design has mostly been unchanged for decades.  </li>
            <li> MY OLD CONAIR RAZOR CASE WORKED OUT GREAT.</li>
            <li> This is as close to professional clippers at a great price that you will ever get.</li>
            <li> Great set of clippers with the classy color.</li>
            <li> So, for what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m sure most people will love the Oster,</li>
            <li> They have a spring mechanism to keep the guard more securely fastened to the clippers.</li>
            <li> This is quiet, fit my hand nice and does a great job.</li>
            <li> They are smooth and give a fantastic cut!</li>
            <li> Great handling with lightweigt professional clippers.  </li>
            <li> I chose this Oster clipper because it had consistently good reviews and a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> In any case to be fair, the clipper has worked very well</li>
            <li> and I really wanted to get a good, long-lasting clipper.  </li>
            <li> If I can offload my fast feeds for a fair price I might have to try to go with a pair of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought the Oster Pro 510 Fast Feed Clipper on a whim (I like good tools).  </li>
            <li> To do a perfect job took me about 30 minutes to cut my hair because you have to make many passes from where the attachments push the hair down and</li>
            <li> My husband has extremely fine hair, so I was a bit concerned that the clippers wouldn&#x27;t be effective and in fact, on the first pass we both thought they didn&#x27;t work because we couldn&#x27;t hear any hair making contact, but sure enough the clippers made a perfect track right up the backside of his head!</li>
            <li> It cuts easily and cleanly and I should have bought it years ago!  </li>
            <li> good weight, cuts great and very sharp.  </li>
            <li> I was really impressed with how quickly they cut and how quiet the motor was.</li>
            <li> It is strong, the grip is good, it clips fast</li>
            <li> (I tried other brands before, and this is clearly the best I experienced)</li>
            <li> Right out of the box, with its own (included) guards, the blades cut through my hair effortlessly.</li>
            <li> easy to use, easy to clean!</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT, QUIET AND VERY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> Very good, quiet my first haircut was so easy, I did it myself nice and even</li>
            <li> And just a VERY CLEAN SMOOTH CUT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> This is the best $38 I have ever spent!</li>
            <li> Overall good value!</li>
            <li> Talk about quick and easy fades!  </li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t know how crappy my original clippers were until i splurged to buy a better brand and heavier duty clippers.</li>
            <li> Other than that, these are the best clippers I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> For about twice the price of the cheap one, this is easily ten times the clipper, and a very good value.</li>
            <li> This clipper is affordable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is a very powerful Clipper and cuts very cleanly.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t expect anything better, quiet and strong sounding , great choice on my part</li>
            <li> It was easy: just a couple of minutes with a screwdriver.  </li>
            <li> but it cuts much more cleanly.  </li>
            <li> It cuts well and is easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li> .i know i could not return it or exchange it to better one thtat can clean closer to the blade.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li> I used it to cut my hair and it cuts well and is easy to keep it maintain, Comes with oil.</li>
            <li> lever strips out too easy</li>
            <li> Its easy to hold which makes for easy fading and styling.</li>
            <li> most of the time and one of the smaller attachments does a great job of keeping it in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The adjustable lever that moves the clipper blade along is easy to overextend, and the blades are not interchangeable.</li>
            <li> cut closely and effortlessly and are easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re also a lot quieter than cheaper magnetic motor clippers I have used previously.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The motor is much more powerful than my Andis Master and can cut more evenly than my Andis Master.</li>
            <li> construction and materials.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and easy operation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> go for a cheaper one that will work just as well (or better), or go for a better product that would be worth it.</li>
            <li> But with shears it&#x27;s as easy as mowing the lawn.</li>
            <li> It does however, cut more effectively, I don&#x27;t need to go over it as much.</li>
            <li> so picking up a better, and more quality set of attachments would be useful</li>
            <li> Easy to use, makes an even cut.</li>
            <li> Use them once every couple months to cut my hair, and they make the job so easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and seemed to cut the hair well.</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 years ago and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> I strongly advise getting this instead of the rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend it, strongly.  </li>
            <li> and they are still running strong.  </li>
            <li> This clipper is high quality for a good price.</li>
            <li> Smooth and cuts clean!</li>
            <li> Fantastic tranaction fast shipingtrims up nice love</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this clipper it performs very well.</li>
            <li> quiet, well-made, and works beautifully.</li>
            <li> I would think the Oster fast feed costing more than the Oster Salon pro would be a better hair clipper since it cost more but its not.</li>
            <li> This Oster cuts clean and smooth and that&#x27;s what I like most about it.</li>
            <li> these clippers are awesome very powerful and extremely quiet.i also</li>
            <li> Best of all, the Oster Fast Feed is enormously quieter than anything with a cheap magnetic motor--which makes haircutting much more relaxing.</li>
            <li> great clippers tho real, quiet for the most part, dont pull on your hair, great overall</li>
            <li> I would suggest if you will be trimming any kind of thicker hair than a human&#x27;s, or want a good experience with an animal clipper to purchase a more powerful unit.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet, I need more time,but I think that this product is excellent.</li>
            <li> but it still isn&#x27;t as fine as the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The problem is it misses fine hairs even when going over and over.  </li>
            <li> It was actually easy to get comfortable with &amp; get a feel for how to use it.  </li>
            <li> and it works fine.</li>
            <li> but it seems fine.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t layer or add the fine touches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work with this clipper just fine.</li>
            <li> Hair is not pulled and noise level is fine.  </li>
            <li> For me, that&#x27;s perfectly fine because I felt the Wahl cut too close for what I wanted.</li>
            <li> When I first turned them on, I was also impressed by how quiet they are!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The included attachments are fine, by the way.</li>
            <li> I could have skipped them and been fine with just the clippers.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for home use about 15 months ago and its still working perfectly fine today.</li>
            <li> It has always worked fine on the humans, but we did try them on the dog once and the clippers got overwhelmed.  </li>
            <li> But I like the clipper just fine.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> It adjusts from 0 to 1/2 which suits my purpose fine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a breeze to maintain, and the included combs do the job just fine for my hair-type.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> of my favorite things about the andis was the purple clip-on comb set which made for a quick change in sizes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It cuts most hair in one passing, and quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love that they are super durable.</li>
            <li> Luckily, we were still able to return through Amazon.</li>
            <li> clippers aren&#x27;t very loud, and the cord is a good length.  </li>
            <li> My old Wahl clipper was falling apart and it had never been the best of qualities, so I decided to get a new set.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very powerful and strong motor.</li>
            <li> Nice, quiet, quick cut, good comb attachments, seems like a quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> Very easy to handle and do not get hot.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for about 11 months then the motor experienced a sudden loss of power and it wont even clip hair without ripping it out.</li>
            <li> oster fast feed clippers feel amazing compared to those cheap wahls, and they really aren&#x27;t that much more!  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good if you&#x27;re worried about nicking a little ones skin, but not so good when cleaning up the neck and around the ears.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into the Cleanhead look, so I cut my own, more streamlined version of my Natural.  </li>
            <li> : Being corded gives this machine a huge power advantage over the battery operated ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> machine cuts hair accurately.</li>
            <li> Huge improvement over the Wahl lithium and groomsman models I keep buying, everything about it seems well built.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the adjustable blade and also the attachments that came with it.  </li>
            <li> Solid, high-quality, great product.</li>
            <li> Its quite and smooth.</li>
            <li> Cheap hair clippers</li>
            <li> Never again will I buy that cheap garbage sold at grocery and pharmacy stores.</li>
            <li> They just do not perform as well as the garden variety Wahl Clippers available at WalMart.  </li>
            <li> for FREE.</li>
            <li> Not something that I enjoy taking the time to do.    </li>
            <li> Only drawback is no case for stoarage and the attachments are not that great.</li>
            <li> but they are cheap and</li>
            <li> We almost always used it with an attachment, and the attachments don&#x27;t line up precisely with the guard teeth of the clipper, so that they block some of the slots in which hair can enter to be cut.  </li>
            <li> They fit well in his hand and are comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> This Oster Fast feed is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have the Andis Master and the magnetic guards fit both machines.</li>
            <li> I have owned all kinds of cheap department store clippers.</li>
            <li> I had a cheap wall that died on me years ago.</li>
            <li> This clipper cuts great, it will last my lifetime no doubt.</li>
            <li> These are great for someone just starting out.</li>
            <li> So smooth on the hair during cut.  </li>
            <li> So if you need a great clipper, look no further.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic set of clippers, purchased with attachments separately</li>
            <li> Has a nice hum and seems very sturdy.</li>
            <li> This was primarily for my husband.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I get a really smooth cut with them.</li>
            <li> Quieter and faster than cheap ones.</li>
            <li> These worked just as advertised and cut through my hair smoothly.</li>
            <li> but the combs that come with it are cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> I enjoy cooking, the outdoors and reading</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also great for giving myself taper fades and fading out the back of my hair.</li>
            <li> IT IS A TRULY GREAT AMERICAN PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Which is precisely what I did.  </li>
            <li> These clippers have a smooth running motor with a &amp;#34;cool to the touch&amp;#34; comfortable feel.</li>
            <li> I would recomend getting the Andis magnetic gaurds with these clippers since the guards that come with it are cheap and have a tendancy to fall off</li>
            <li> This Oster Clipper is fantastic product and it has been working 2 years now.</li>
            <li> I also know that these are not $200 dollar clippers, however they don&#x27;t give as smooth of a cut that I was hoping they would.</li>
            <li> The clippers felt cheap as compared to my andis masters.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the most powerful clipper on the market.</li>
            <li> These are of excellent quality and heavy duty.</li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job everytime.  </li>
            <li> Really easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> As i said in the headline this is a great clipper, it is a solid piece of equipment that gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It cuts vs. pulls, unlike the cheap drugstore</li>
            <li> These work great on my breed and human hair</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great for keeping facial hair neat and trimmed.  </li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t had any issues with overheating and they are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> LIGHT AND CUTS WELL</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t feel like cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light as ever unlike the Andis Master.</li>
            <li> I use my Andis Nano Magnet guards and they do fit this clipper.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from cheap 15 dollar machine to this</li>
            <li> They get the job done and run smoothly.</li>
            <li> Arrived 4 days earlier then suppose to, that was great.</li>
            <li> USE THIS MACHINE ON THE DAILY, IT CUTS GREAT</li>
            <li> /&gt;Powerful&lt;br /&gt;Attachments fit well&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cheap $25-30 models will not cut it.  </li>
            <li> Beat wishes and enjoy.</li>
            <li> cuts so smooth ul feel like \\&quot;</li>
            <li> I very much enjoy the way it looks and feels.</li>
            <li> guard to fit these clippers.  </li>
            <li> Also the guards fit them well.  </li>
            <li> I use a $1 shower curtain from a dollar store to drape over the sink for easy clean up.</li>
            <li> beats the cheap ones by 1000 and doesn&#x27;t pull your hair when it cuts</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get all backed up with hair in the guards like cheap clippers do.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, fantastic product.</li>
            <li> ** and are as smooth as momma&#x27;s a</li>
            <li> I bought this razor to replace a cheap Whal hat I bought from Costco about 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t catch hair like my cheap one from conair..</li>
            <li> and smooth.</li>
            <li> but like the light weight</li>
            <li> Turned an hour job with a cheap cutter into a 5 minute one.  </li>
            <li> This is a great clipper for someone like me who only uses it about once a month.  </li>
            <li> So overall I am happy.</li>
            <li> Clipper worked well, smooth cut.  </li>
            <li> Amazon reshipped the hair clippers overnight free of charge</li>
            <li> Durable , light , and</li>
            <li> It pays for itself in five or six haircuts, the results look fantastic, and it takes 1/3 the time to cut their hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought them primarily for shaving my head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a few months now and it is nice !!!</li>
            <li> These really mow through the hair and give a nice finished product.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic purchase,</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper, very similar to the andis master in performance.</li>
            <li> Purchased these after using cheap conair brand for years to shave my head.</li>
            <li> Hello if ya&#x27;ll don&#x27;t know these Fast Feeds are amazing.</li>
            <li> Some 400-500 hair cuts later, they still work great.</li>
            <li> I bought these fast feed clippers because I thought they would do a better job on my hair where I basically cut all the top with a #6 and the side with a #4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Well, so far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I use it for my own personal use to fade my own hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for nearly 2 years and it is as good as they day</li>
            <li> These are far superior to any of the cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> The motor is FAR superior.</li>
            <li> Many reviews said the clipper stays cool, but I am not finding that true with mine.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is far superior than all those consumer cordless trimmers that I&#x27;ve been through.  </li>
            <li> A super clean cut!  </li>
            <li> I have this thing about quality and doing things right, reliability is my top buying criteria, This one</li>
            <li> It runs cool and it&#x27;s easy to hold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp, accurate, and the range on the adjustable blade is ideal.</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful and durable clipper.</li>
            <li> The motor frequency is very low pitched, so its very nice to use.</li>
            <li> Very powerful.</li>
            <li> It is fast, clean, and does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> Not the greatest one he&#x27;s ever used, but of decent quality and fairly quiet.</li>
            <li> The Oster Classic 76 is better, but more than I need.  </li>
            <li> The problem is that the Walh clippers dulled relatively quickly, got clogged with hair easily and took many passes to get it right because of the inferior attachments and the attachments popping off.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;And how eco friendly not to have to drive to the barber or salon, this way you have an appointment whenever you like and for free.  </li>
            <li> Exactly why I was looking for after years of using the best walmart brand I could buy, these are absolutely ideal for the home enthusiast cutting his families hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried many kinds and brands and this is my favorite so far!!</li>
            <li> The clippers are great, but I was expecting a higher professional feel yo them.</li>
            <li> They cut good and don&#x27;t get hot as fast.</li>
            <li> Super easy to zero gap.</li>
            <li> I owned an old pair of Remington clippers and was pretty happy with them..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quick and easy maintenance.</li>
            <li> Because of this it really does make giving myself a haircut very easy and enjoyable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These clippers are much more powerful and they cut quickly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> These clippers were so smooth and easy to use that I took over just because it looked like fun.</li>
            <li> The original clippers were Sears branded</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of just going for the original 76</li>
            <li> well worth the money!  </li>
            <li> So far I em very satisfied with the seller and product.</li>
            <li> For under a hundred clams it is worth the investment!</li>
            <li> Not sure I can recommend buying it until I&#x27;ve had it for a while so best of luck if you choose to get it too.</li>
            <li> This is one powerful clipper!</li>
            <li> Cuts it the first time, and I&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
            <li> and this was a buy well worth it!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this in hopes that it would have the power to trim my dogs hair well.</li>
            <li> It does get hot like people say, so I would not recommend using it without attachments for more than 15 minutes without a break.  </li>
            <li> Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Feel heavier than last pair I&#x27;m hoping they continue to be effective and give a precise cute.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and feels like barber shop quality clippers!  </li>
            <li> Got it for self-buzz cuts, was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I store it in the original box, but it&#x27;s not convenient.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have previously owned Oster clippers and received very good service.  </li>
            <li> It has a certain heft to it unlike many trimmers which feel like cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> The Oster is very light and cuts quickly and doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li> Owned an andis masters clipper before these for roughly 2.5 years, and i thought i loved those, and i&#x27;d never find something better.</li>
            <li> , it would grab instead of cut cleanly at times</li>
            <li> Fun and easy to use</li>
            <li> Clippers cut through hair quickly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> I love them, but i&#x27;m glad i kept my old ones for fading and taping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly the clipper grant a clean</li>
            <li> Luckily I had backup cheap clippers.</li>
            <li> It pulled my sons hair out, it didn&#x27;t cut cleanly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Functionally the clippers are great, but the skimping on $1 worth of plastic combs is so intention, such a cash grab that oster should be ashamed of themselves.</li>
            <li> The product was packed securely to protect the clippers and the shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> These cut as cleanly as any others I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I lubricate the blades after every couple of hair cuts and take the blade off and clean it every couple of months.</li>
            <li> Let them drip for another 5 min, clean the excess</li>
            <li> I cut my boys as well as my own hair, and actually enjoy it now that I have a professional pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> Cuts clean.</li>
            <li> you cannot get a bald closeness cut, like if you are trying to clean up and outline a beard.  </li>
            <li> Clean non stoppable clipping and hair grooming.</li>
            <li> to clean and I wish it was wireless though...</li>
            <li> quite... ez clean up...</li>
            <li> this is a very high-quality clipper that has a lot of professional users that give it great reviews.</li>
            <li> Now, following considerable use, I can  emphatically state that this is a excellent hair clipper.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I pamper this clipper--- use a toothbrush to thoroughly clean it and apply drops of oil, before and after use.  </li>
            <li> Good clipper, definitely a step-up in quality from the cheap $20 clippers at Walmart.</li>
            <li> The Oster Professional fast feed works great.  </li>
            <li> recommend buying a cleaner spray that can clean, lube, and disinfect your clippers.</li>
            <li> but I think I will try vinegar &amp; hydrogen peroxide to clean &amp; disinfect.</li>
            <li> keeps it clean and sanitized.</li>
            <li> plus, I haven&#x27;t had to do anything but clean and oil them between cuttings</li>
            <li> Really easy to use and smooth; doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li> They are powerful enough that they cut very nicely and evenly.  </li>
            <li> reason I&#x27;ve not given it a full 5 is that, even when set to its lowest distance, I can&#x27;t get quite as close of a shave as I&#x27;d like for the areas I want to keep clean shaven.  </li>
            <li> It is a good idea to buy additional comb attachments to have more choices, as other reviewers have suggested.</li>
            <li> They clean up very easily, and come with 4 different comb lengths that provide me with many options for hair length.  </li>
            <li> Cuts right thru the hair!</li>
            <li> the reviews were right!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the Classic 76 can do a better job, but if you have fine hair, you might be better off paying for a real haircut.</li>
            <li> One must oil and clean the blades regularly for optimum performance.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, but not too heavy to hold.</li>
            <li> They could improve on a few things, but, it&#x27;s probably the best you can do without having to pay ungodly amounts for higher costing clippers.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t say enough great things about the OSTER Fast Feed!  </li>
            <li> Great just what I expected</li>
            <li> I was hoping for this kind of money to get a clipper that would take it all off on the first go around, but it requires 2-3 passes to really get it done close.</li>
            <li> Everything about these is great, except that the blades came crooked and and had to align them before I could even use the first time.</li>
            <li> I still have to go over my head more than once, but it is much sharper than the Wahl units.  </li>
            <li> After deciding to go with the Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper with Adjustable Blade, I found that by far, Amazon.com offered the best price for them and still with full manfacturer&#x27;s warranty.</li>
            <li> However, these appear to be superior in several ways.</li>
            <li> These clippers do seem well made, and they probably cut most hair very well, but they did not work well with my hair.</li>
            <li> At the longest setting of its adjustable range, it leaves a sufficiently full looking beard so as not to require use of any attachable plastic combs.  </li>
            <li> After my five year old cut his own hair unbeknownst to me and with those children&#x27;s craft scissors</li>
            <li> good machine will last you life time if you take care of it.</li>
            <li> After reading most of the reviews here on Amazon, I decided to try the Oster fast feed.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the Oster fast feed but not amazed.  </li>
            <li> The clipper should have come with the full range of combs.</li>
            <li> Best thing I bought last year it really cuts my hair and does not pull or hurt thanks for that.</li>
            <li> The cut is so much cleaner and the blades maintain sharpness much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve owned a good, solid clipper.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to be true, you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> Better than &#x27;consumer grade&#x27; quality at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> I love my fast feeds</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s cool too.</li>
            <li> The clippers are good but you should order the smaller seperate blades to cut shorter fades.</li>
            <li> Many thanks, Amazoners.</li>
            <li> When our last Oster died, after almost 15 years, I did a bunch of research to find a quality replacement, and felt really good about the recommendations this clipper got from folks.  </li>
            <li> the damn thing worked so damn good, I went out and bought a second pair.</li>
            <li> Powerful, smooth clippers.</li>
            <li> This clipper is fairly light in the hand and much more quiet and provides a more even cut.</li>
            <li> Really wish I&#x27;d sprung for the top of the line model.  </li>
            <li> It was such a good choice.  </li>
            <li> They seem very well built and much much better</li>
            <li> had it gave me one full use.</li>
            <li> but if you want those super clean lines or designs get a dedicated set of finish clippers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These Oster clippers are built to last and I am looking forward to years of good haircuts!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to maintain it if you want full use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Overall good quality</li>
            <li> This is quiet and does a good job.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t come with a full set of attachments</li>
            <li> I use Andis Cool Care spray while they&#x27;re on to let the oil work itself in.</li>
            <li> every once in awhile to keep it cool.  </li>
            <li> BUT NOT BAD</li>
            <li> I love the clippers, well worth the $, pays for itself pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> and they are just the right size for a comfortable hand grip and to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> Bought these to replace the cheap Wahl clippers I usually end up buying at Walmart, and i&#x27;m glad I did - these clippers work well, cut smoothe, are light and and fit nicely in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I need a clipper that can manage a full head quickly.</li>
            <li> I can look in the mirror and cut my hair easily and consistently.   </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty easy to operate and care fore.</li>
            <li> It works great on your normal hair but it isn&#x27;t really as fine on short hair.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth, nice low hum, 00 cut, and it cuts like a Pro, naturally.</li>
            <li> It comes a nice assortment of guards to cut at different lengths, and the adjustable blade can fine tune the length by extending out another 1/8 inch.  </li>
            <li> They cut fine and are nice and quiet.</li>
            <li> Other than that the clippers are great with the purple magnetic guards from andis</li>
            <li> These are great and sharp.</li>
            <li> really liked them, and ordered this current but advanced version of this tried and true clipper.  </li>
            <li> I have tried at least six or more other clippers including cordless types and I can Honestly say these are best in ever way</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty fine, but it cuts it like going through butter, my beard too.  </li>
            <li> I actually kinda enjoy haircut time now! :)</li>
            <li> Made quick work of my super curly hair.</li>
            <li> Ok many people will buy clippers and use them to just do a simple cut.</li>
            <li> Clippers came quickly.</li>
            <li> My husband has the classic which he has had for many years.</li>
            <li> They do heat up fairly quick.</li>
            <li> These have worked decently well for the most part.</li>
            <li> Moral of the story, this clipper is WONDERFUL for human usage, not for animals.</li>
            <li> The Fast Feed cuts easily and cleanly.  </li>
            <li> That process was quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, when I first used this clipper, it was love at first cut.  </li>
            <li> Only knock is that I don&#x27;t really find them great for fading.</li>
            <li> Bought it after the Wahl Peanut Clipper died rather quickly.</li>
            <li> One day I may upgrade to a more expensive pair, but for now these are the perfect price/performance balance for me.</li>
            <li> It works quickly and has never locked or pulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pleased  to see this one hasn&#x27;t changed a bit from the older version.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t do a very close cut at the shortest setting with only the metal clip, otherwise they work great</li>
            <li> Simple, effective, powerful, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was looking for clippers that would operate just as quickly and efficiently as the ones at the salon, and I feel like these do the trick.</li>
            <li> My fiance learned how to taper my hair fairly quickly with these clippers paired with the comb set.</li>
            <li> It is much heavier duty and has a much more powerful motor and sharper blades.</li>
            <li> I think Oster makes a good professional \\&quot;Fast Feed Clipper.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be lucky if one lasted 3 months.  </li>
            <li> Clippers:&lt;br /&gt;Cut quickly and cleanly&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sound of the clippers is not an obnoxious buzzing either, which I appreciate very much.</li>
            <li> Bit of a premium $, but no doubt these will provide high quality service for many years.  </li>
            <li> The Pro Clippers are exactly as advertised and more; Perfect for home personal, shop, or military applications.  </li>
            <li> Really excellent clipper -- goes right through the thickest hair without stalling in the least.  </li>
            <li> Cuts better than any other clippers we have own.</li>
            <li> They do not seem as powerful and pulled my sons hair so many times that I said if it pulls one more time I will send them back.  </li>
            <li> These clippers were not as precise as I first thought</li>
            <li> I spent an extra 10 dollars at a Sally&#x27;s for the andis master guards, and they fit perfectly!</li>
            <li> Overall a great machine that i am sure will last forever.</li>
            <li> Since I cut my own hair short, I was not disappointed with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I use this clipper in the salon and it runs smoothly without getting too hot.</li>
            <li> Very quiet, the vibration is quite modest, it gives a superb even cut, and seems to be holding up very well indeed.  </li>
            <li> I can cut my hair and the clippers are barely getting warm.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy to report that the Oster Fast Feed set is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I read through many reviews, watched quite a few videos, and ultimately decided that this would probably be the best fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Overall very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> Other Oster products I own like my blender and food processor have given me many years of dependable, reliable service  - and this clipper appears to follow in quality and reliability.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good long term investment.</li>
            <li> You can certainly buy a more dainty clipper, but if you only want to buy one that will last forever, this is it.</li>
            <li> I wound up getting rid of this one and picking up an Oster Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper and the associated blades that allow me to select a good length of hair trim.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one great American Made product that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use the most broke after a handful of uses forcing me to order a new set.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than the Pro except new model year introductions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them for many haircuts and they are still like brand new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it, but the noise when the blade is close is slightly concerning.</li>
            <li> works great on black hair</li>
            <li> It is fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It cuts really well, and its easy to grip.</li>
            <li> sure what else to say other than they worked well, very smooth and easy, and cut everything in the first pass.</li>
            <li> But it got hot very fast, the blade got burning too hot for touching the skin</li>
            <li> Very high quality, powerful and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is true that the Oster clipper is fast and very powerful.</li>
            <li> Is a really good clipper, after using an Conair clipper for cutting my own hair for a year, changing to this one is a really good upgrade, is not heavy but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, is really fast and doesn&#x27;t make any sound, the only problem is the guides, I have to buy the Biggers ones which is OK, but I couldn&#x27;t find with the same amazing quality of the original one, which fits as ring to the finger to the clipper!</li>
            <li> Great clipper probably the smoothest cutting clipper around also a great beginner clipper doesn&#x27;t get hot at all</li>
            <li> Overheated and fuse blew on first use!</li>
            <li> These glide through like a hot knife in butter!</li>
            <li> As long as these clippers last more than a year, I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> it serves my purpose just fine Very highly recomended</li>
            <li> Could use some longer combs, for the top, but that is easy enough to purchase separately.</li>
            <li> Works fairly well, but if I had to purchase one all over again, I&#x27;d get a more powerful one...one that cuts through hair better and isn&#x27;t so difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> Simply put it works great, a very professional feel and cut.</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper for the price, very professional and quiet.</li>
            <li> The adjustable blade feature is OK, but I tend to set and leave it at the most forward position and use the plastic guides from this set (as well as previous sets that fit well) for adjusting the cut.</li>
            <li> I have only had these for about a month or so, but they seem great so far!</li>
            <li> I have large hands, and it was comfortable.</li>
            <li> Unit is tough, and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for over a year and they are tough as nails and work perfectly every time.  </li>
            <li> By taking the comb off, I&#x27;m able to get a pretty decent shave with the clipper on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> It feels like quality, (steel, not plastic!) and cuts fast and smooth.</li>
            <li> The combs are great quality but the bottom line is this product is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> In the hands of someone who knows what they are doing, these would likely be amazing.  </li>
            <li> The difference between a discount store package clipper and the Fast Feed is huge . . .</li>
            <li> Hope you enjoy yours as much as I do mine.</li>
            <li> Cuts smoothly and fast.</li>
            <li> , they hold firm and feel great.</li>
            <li> It made my taper and my boy&#x27;s taper much cleaner and an accurate blend.</li>
            <li> very quite and works smooth.</li>
            <li> They are quiet and cut smoothly and fit comfortably in my hands.</li>
            <li> Fast, even, smooth buzzes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(It</li>
            <li> The clippers seem very stout and do not feel or look cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> I was using the official Oster combs with it which were an absolute nightmare to fit on the device</li>
            <li> Quiet effective.  </li>
            <li> WELL worth the price</li>
            <li> frankly, these fast feed clippers do not do the job better than the Wahl did, or if they do, it&#x27;s very marginal.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s powerful motor.  </li>
            <li> Worth</li>
            <li> Glad I broke the old one.</li>
            <li> Nice and quiet too.</li>
            <li> Well worth the $$$$.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it came with a few more guide combs.</li>
            <li> It makes the cut around the ears so much more professional and easier.</li>
            <li> For 2-3 x the $$$ this isn&#x27;t worth the investment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We are having a LOT of fun with it all.  </li>
            <li> We laugh and talk through it all.  </li>
            <li> no matter how much fun we are having with them.  </li>
            <li> these things a professional for sure</li>
            <li> In that time it gets only slightly warm.  </li>
            <li> The cord is nice and thick and never gets warm</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve you&#x27;ve ever purchased a cheaper set, this is well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attachments: http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001T0HHB0/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_31</li>
            <li> Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I had an old Oster hair clipper for 25 years and this one even does a better job.</li>
            <li> I will consider trying a different oster product because I liked this one while it worked.</li>
            <li> /trim my hair and beard weekly and to clip my Golden Retriever two or three times a year in the summer.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re nice and quiet and they&#x27;re also portable.</li>
            <li> I have used many brands over the years and none of them are this quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li> These clippers are effective for different thickness of hair and length.</li>
            <li> its not as powerful as ive read.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend these if you are looking to cut your own hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems so far and am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> The Wahls had gotten to where they were not cutting well at all.  </li>
            <li> Nice quiet motor and just oil it</li>
            <li> Love professional haircut.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better at getting hair off my face than the Norelco, although it doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as close -- a plus if you are going for the five-o&#x27;clock shadow look.</li>
            <li> this item is expected to be better or offer more.</li>
            <li> this item is expected to be better or offer more.</li>
            <li> These clippers were gifted to me to replace the 15 year old Remington clippers I&#x27;d used for years.</li>
            <li> So far I love these clippers.  </li>
            <li> so I figured I should try a more professional grade.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying the generic guards that fit most Oster Clippers.  </li>
            <li> The clippers run cool and don&#x27;t get hot.  </li>
            <li> So if you are looking for a solid set of clippers, look no further the Fast Feed is awesome and you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> The results of those hair-cutting adventures were certainly FAR better than the results when he had me do his hair before with the crappy clippers and scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all in favor of spending my money on American-made products when those products are actually worth the money involved, and these clippers assuredly ARE.</li>
            <li> It is so worth buying the clippers.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Love this thing so far.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> it is worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered these to replace my set of Andis clippers and so far they work much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Absolutely worth the price.</li>
            <li> and then wouldn&#x27;t cut worth a darn.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading that Mr Money Mustache cut his own hair and others&#x27; experience I finally decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> Anything that simplifies my life at this point is good thing and the Oster Professional is clearly one of those things.</li>
            <li> They are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I wanted a more robust, professional unit.</li>
            <li> Powerful.</li>
            <li> and it is far better quality than cheaper chinese-made trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This clipper literally took 90 minutes over three days to complete most of the dog.  </li>
            <li> the plus side, these clippers are far better than Wahl.  </li>
            <li> If you are doing your own hair at home and looking to upgrade what you are currently using because you are getting snagged a lot, stop looking and get these.</li>
            <li> nice solid feel to them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a great pair of clippers that would blind and fade nice and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth it though.  </li>
            <li> I use this every time before i shower because i like maintaining the fresh cut look.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> worth the money after using $25 clippers we found at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the investment</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews for a product</li>
            <li> It is of sturdy construction and operates with a nice low hum.</li>
            <li> Amazon charged me $5.75 to return the combs, which I would not have ordered if the description had been more clear.  </li>
            <li> I love these Oster clippers they are sharp,quality built,lighter,quieter than my old clippers.</li>
            <li> Nice an quiet.</li>
            <li> and even then they only get warm.</li>
            <li> Love the old school look and feel.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve saved $20 :-)</li>
            <li> They clip pretty close, and while no electric clipper will bring you to blade close, these are great to bring me down to a 00 or perhaps 000 closeness on my head.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful and quiet clipper with many size attachments.</li>
            <li> so much Amazon also the representative from customer service was very friendly thanks Aric M.</li>
            <li> The other downside is that it only comes with 4 or 5 guards and they aren&#x27;t the best quality.  </li>
            <li> I liked they way the guards fit on these, they don&#x27;t pop off as easily as other brands I used.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price was much better, and this one is the same quality as our original.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, they do an excellent job at trimming my facial hair for a stubble look.</li>
            <li> A lot quieter and a quick crisp cut.</li>
            <li> With the original equipment 3/8 inch comb this clipper just won&#x27;t cut now, or at best barely cuts perhaps a half inch off my hair, leaving my hair much longer than the desired 3/8 inch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase, so far, and have every reason  to believe that the Oster Fast Feed will last me for many years to come.  </li>
            <li> these are exactly what i wanted, professional clippers,  they do a great job, wish there were a few more guides</li>
            <li> Other than that, a good clipper.</li>
            <li> Read the other reviews and delighted I bought these clippers.</li>
            <li> Easy to use stays cool for multiple cuts and cuts clean.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but its not as sharp as ones I have used before.  </li>
            <li> Cuts great, very fast, feels heavy duty.  </li>
            <li> It turns out I was right.</li>
            <li> , gonna go trim up right now</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just about the right length, seems like about 6 feet or so.  </li>
            <li> Cuts right through my hair in one pass.</li>
            <li> Conair sucked and didn&#x27;t cut right.  </li>
            <li> These go right through all types of hair.  </li>
            <li> Zips right through my hair.</li>
            <li> The blade cuts right through</li>
            <li> Read the comments before your decide which clipper is right for your needs.  </li>
            <li> Included combs are the right length for beards and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It easily cuts through a variety of hair textures, fine to coarse, without snagging or pulling the hair.</li>
            <li> They run smooth, not loud, light, and do not over heat!</li>
            <li> I thought I had researched this purchase pretty well and decided I did not need the top of the line professional model.  </li>
            <li> The guides make it easy to do much more than a &amp;#34;lice cut&amp;#34; and, with the use of the blending guides, it won&#x27;t be long before you&#x27;re turning out some pretty snappy haircuts</li>
            <li> I wanted some hair clippers that was more profession and did a better job than the average store brand.</li>
            <li> It just plows forward and doesn&#x27;t get hot (just a tiny bit warm).</li>
            <li> I buzz the back, sides &amp; half the top, then just trim the front with scissors to leave some bangs and it comes out great</li>
            <li> Very good machine, the only negative is the flimsy adjustment leaver that&#x27;s made of a very cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cutter to anyone who wants a clean comfortable cut.</li>
            <li> If you just want to cut it all short, it is very easy to do so.</li>
            <li> you do end up buying these, I highly recommend the magnetic guards by Andis, they fit these clippers perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, it gets very hot, very fast.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten better machines more a lot less money.  </li>
            <li> I got these clippers to buzz my head with, thinking they would give me a better, more even cut than the slightly cheaper clippers I already have.</li>
            <li> FYI, this exact same clipper is advertised for 12 dollars more as &amp;#34;Quiet trimmers&amp;#34; as though it&#x27;s a special edition or something.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY AND ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND IT!!!</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift to a younger relative, he is absolutley thrilled with thier quality,were purchased to replace a lost set and resipiant said they were alot better than what was lost.</li>
            <li> lol no more cheep drug,dollar store for me.</li>
            <li> In general, I stick with a #1 on the sides and a #2 on top for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually bought a mid-priced model ($40 to $60) and was generally happy.  </li>
            <li> My goal was to find quality clippers that do a great job and will last for more than a few months.  </li>
            <li> Nice long cord that seems durable.</li>
            <li> Still compared to some other clippers i have had it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> The cord is nice and long.  </li>
            <li> Long cord is nice, also.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price especially new.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used these while still sweating from workouts on hot days and this unit provides a clean, even and fast haircut every time.  </li>
            <li> it work good and cut down the noise.</li>
            <li> For a good, solid pair of family clippers that will last a long time, these are a good investment.</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper – quiet, smooth, sharp (no pulling hair).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they would hold up for heavy duty use, without having to clean them frequently,  but we are happy with them.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d still have the old one, which was also Oster and which I had been using for easily 10 years.</li>
            <li> I purchased these Oster Fast Feed Clippers believing I was stepping up to something more professional.  </li>
            <li> Nice product overall, cuts hair very well.</li>
            <li> Think about it - at $10 bucks a cut, a good clipper is paid off in less than a year.     </li>
            <li> Shaved my whole body today with this thing to start and it went quick</li>
            <li> horably please make sure not to buy this model Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper with Adjustable Blade         </li>
            <li> This clipper is professional quality and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I also purchased the T-Finisher (great buy) and will purchase the Classic 76 in the near future.</li>
            <li> I love things that don&#x27;t waste my time. :)</li>
            <li> , I hoped, would be more powerful, durable, and, especially, quieter.</li>
            <li> I use my clippers every day and would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a professional styling and easy to hold machine.</li>
            <li> I made sure my hair was clean and dry before using the machine, and cleaned and oiled the teeth and cleaned the comb before using the clipper.</li>
            <li> This is a great machine, it runs with a quiet power my only Whal just does not have.  </li>
            <li> They are completely unusable since the main screw stripped out that holds the blades in place it cost more to fix them than what they are worth</li>
            <li> this clipper no t value for Professional name on it ,&lt;br /&gt;it is good enough to use at home for your family&#x27;s members</li>
            <li> The dual magnet fast speed Oster clippers give a comfortable fast haircut.  </li>
            <li> For human hair, even beards, it works absolutely excellent and cuts evenly and without trouble.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to get a nice pair of clippers for a reasonable price, look no further than this.</li>
            <li> It leaves the stubble just a tad longer than I would like, but it is a totally normal length for most clippers, so not really a negative, just something to wish for.</li>
            <li> The actual trim is far superior</li>
            <li> What was I to do until my barber returns?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After researching many barber clippers and haircutting kits on the Internet and YouTube videos on how to cut men&#x27;s hair, I decided to purchase the Oster Professional Fast Feed Clipper.  </li>
            <li> I just used these for the first time yesterday, I they cut through my hair more easily than every other clipper I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be time to buy a nicer clipper, and I got this one because it received good reviews and is not as large as the other Oster clipper.  </li>
            <li> But on my Wahl, I can adjust the blade much further, and together with that blade lever thing, I can get the blade very close and do a nice crisp block cut.</li>
            <li> I did not turn on the Wahl clippers, so I cannot report a comparison in noise or vibration, but I am very glad that I chose the Oster clippers, given the other noted differences.</li>
            <li> Quickly became adjusted to it after returning the andis masters because those had all metal casing which got hot really fast.</li>
            <li> Though this would be good for tight zero fades.  </li>
            <li> only criticism is that the plastic attachments are very cheap and the teeth do fall off over time.  </li>
            <li> With a more powerful motor than most commercial hair clippers, it shaves my entire head in no time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Power button and length lever both are made of plastic and feel very, very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very quiet, very smooth.</li>
            <li> These did not cut very fast at all</li>
            <li> An old shoe box will be fine</li>
            <li> I guess it works fine so far.</li>
            <li> The cutters are more comfortable on my noggin than other brands.</li>
            <li> Having trimmed my beard for more than 20 years with straight scissors, I find this clipper to be more reproducible and much less troublesome/fussy.  </li>
            <li> I was under the impression it would be built like a tank---while good, the on/off slide seems a little chinsy.  </li>
            <li> I think this particular Clipper is worth the little extra money compared to the cheaper alternatives because it is superb quality.</li>
            <li> , they are still super sharp and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> After one hair cut, it became really hot and hurt skin when touched.</li>
            <li> If you are willing to pay $150 you can get a pro quality product which this is not.</li>
            <li> Cuts very well!</li>
            <li> short, they don&#x27;t do any better than the Wahl.</li>
            <li> This means when you want to make a crisp cut, you&#x27;re out of luck.</li>
            <li> My husband went to use it for the first time - died within 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This is so much more solidly built and</li>
            <li> the motor and speed of the clipping is so much higher.</li>
            <li> and I did not expect it to be any better with a better or more expensive clipper.  </li>
            <li> I have been cutting my sons&#x27; hair for 18 years and my own hair for many more.  </li>
            <li> My first haircut with them (performed by my wife), rivals any cut I had ever gotten from a barber shop.....</li>
            <li> I guess they want me to pay $5 more for a simple piece of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the first time around.</li>
            <li> These clippers have a far superior construction, run much quieter, and cut far more smoothly than the Conair, Wahl, and Remington products that I have struggled with in the past.</li>
            <li> With the oster fast feeds u are always FRESH.</li>
            <li> easily  - Very quiet compared to most clippers    Con:  </li>
            <li> Overall I am satisfied with my decision in this brand and model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a variety of different ones and most work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> However, it gets hot immediately and for some reason it shorts the electricity.</li>
            <li> He did a better job the second time.  </li>
            <li> And even a bit better the third time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Firstly, the lowest blade setting on these will not get you to a 0 - I like to keep the sides of my hair extremely short and then fade to a 1 or 2 on top.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These were my first pair of quality clippers, and it looks like I will have to search elsewhere for my intended purpose of getting a close shave.</li>
            <li> But if you are in my camp of self-cutters that like to keep your hair extremely short, it is better you look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I balked at the price at first, but now I&#x27;ve gotten used to using them every two weeks, and after two months, they&#x27;ve paid for themselves.  </li>
            <li> There is no pulling, it is reasonably quiet, and has a satisfying heft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I have standard hair</li>
            <li> then Wahl and others I got at stores and only paid slightly more</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;First things first</li>
            <li> being said I&#x27;m glad my last pair blew up for these clippers cut like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the brand I&#x27;m betting</li>
            <li> Just under a year ago my last hair clippers broke, so I looked around for a more durable alternative</li>
            <li> (it wasn&#x27;t pretty), I thought, why not just do the clipper thing and give him the buzz</li>
            <li> Would recommend these not only for people, but for pets as well :)</li>
            <li> Mine lasted almost exactly one year before no longer working.  </li>
            <li> Oster wil be getting more money from me in the future.</li>
            <li> These clippers have a lot of leverage, so I can cut my hair to the exact length that I want while I have my 1 guard on.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the clippers, the adjustment arm broke.  </li>
            <li> Five years later I bought this thing to get something that would work more efficiently and this truly does the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used them one time and already I can tell it is better than others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> top of the line and quiet clippers</li>
            <li> It cut like a hot knife through butter</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t get hot either.</li>
            <li> This is my first set of clippers.</li>
            <li> it could cut fast and easier to me!</li>
            <li> and I find the weight beneficial to steadying my hand on free-hand cuts - especially across the top of the flat-top.  </li>
            <li> After your done with the clippers, unplug them, run drops across the TOP were the blades are(dont overdo) and turn them back on for 10 secs.</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t need clippers that fancy or expensive, and found these to be an excellent alternative.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is about the 10th clipper I&#x27;ve owned over the years and the first semi-nice pair of clippers</li>
            <li> I decided to go with these clippers after reading the reviews and I am not sorry I did.  </li>
            <li> The adjustable blades help give a seamless transition between lengths for smooth fades.</li>
            <li> The Oster Fast Feed clipper is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many of their products and soon after the warranty ended, they all end up in the same place....</li>
            <li> I will probably be able to use it for the next 30-40 years, God willing.</li>
            <li> I love that you can use basic plastic clipper guards</li>
            <li> I have had many different clippers over the years.  </li>
            <li> Its funny</li>
            <li> gets all the hairs on the first pass.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do no wrong.</li>
            <li> this is the first time not buying a pair of wahl clippers to cut my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought a set of andis purple magnetic combs and work great with these fast feeds no more flimsy combs that fall off.</li>
            <li> but they are exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I think I would prefer the (several hundred) dollar models better</li>
            <li> My first pair was defective.</li>
            <li> The assortment combs are a different style, so I wasn&#x27;t sure they would work.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product and its really  worth the price.</li>
            <li> The Wahls I had had a chrome exterior and got quite hot with lengthy use.</li>
            <li> Most people don&#x27;t realize the importance of a clipper&#x27;s internal workings.</li>
            <li> My husband has had so many issues with other cheap clippers, so I got him this one due to the popular reviews.</li>
            <li> top quality, will last a lifetime</li>
            <li> The first time I used these clippers they stopped working after about 20min.  </li>
            <li> They are quiet, light weight and keep relatively cool.</li>
            <li> It seems to me that it has more power than the last Wahl I had.  </li>
            <li> Wahl features one for its line of home clippers, and (of course) it&#x27;s available to barbers who use the professional models made by Oster.</li>
            <li> Cuts well and doesn&#x27;t get hot,</li>
            <li> We ended up taking the cover off the Osters and finding out that one of the wires had wore through (after 10 years of giving three boys and one husband hundreds of haircuts), so we clipped the wires, stripped them back, soldered them together, and put shrink over the wires to protect them, and got five more years out of them.  </li>
            <li> These clippers were exactly what we wanted.  </li>
            <li> They run more quietly than the clippers</li>
            <li> My first expensive set of hair clippers and by far the best, never again will I buy cheap cutters.</li>
            <li> I was using a $60 Wahl clipper before this, and the Oster definitely makes a more uniform cut.  </li>
            <li> The blades look more robust, the on/off switch is definitely more solid, and the motor sounds stronger but only a touch louder than the Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Never fail me.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s quiet as hell when used without a guard.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with many guards either, just the short ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> news is, it cuts nicely, and has a wide range adjuster for the head.</li>
            <li> This thing cuts my hair like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li> Replaced an old set of cheap clippers with this one.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s probably because of the higher quality of materials used.</li>
            <li> Everything feels pretty sturdy and as a guy</li>
            <li> I love the adjustable blade feature for trimming the neck and back of my husband&#x27;s hair between trips to the barber.  </li>
            <li> aware though</li>
            <li> Yeah, I&#x27;m pretty anal about my hair.</li>
            <li> The advantage of needing multiple passes is that you can blend between length sections more</li>
            <li> The Fast Feeds are BEAST!</li>
            <li> the Fast Feeds are what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> They are able to run several minutes without overheating, however, do not cut as close as I would like.</li>
            <li> The motor is much powerful and the blads can cut much closer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The blade guards that come with the clippers are more than enough for us as my husband never uses anything beyond the 1/4&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> On the first pass, about 85% of his hair would be cut.  </li>
            <li> Well that&#x27;s exactly what happened.  </li>
            <li> The construction is way more solid that the walh brand.  </li>
            <li> It is heavier and obviously has a better motor.  </li>
            <li> if you are that sensitive to sound then you have issues.  </li>
            <li> Just bought my first Oster to trim my beard and neck,</li>
            <li> My husband was pleased that these didn&#x27;t pull his hair like our last pair of clippers.  </li>
            <li> My only grip is I love a skin fade</li>
            <li> Broke after first use.</li>
            <li> We are happy with this purchase and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a Clipper to last them a long time.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting it but the first pair of hair clippers that was sent out was stolen off my front porch</li>
            <li> This will go through your hair like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li> It works so much better than my Norelco trimmer on longer facial hair.  </li>
            <li> She used her bosses pair of clippers (she has had them for several years) and immediately fell in love.  </li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time, so I can&#x27;t comment on anything but my first reaction.  </li>
            <li> I love costco return policy &amp;#34; bring it back when ever, even if its out of date, years from now.</li>
            <li> Lightweight to use and very efficient!</li>
            <li> This machine really rocks !</li>
            <li> Much smoother and faster!</li>
            <li> It paid for itself in the first couple of months.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of a clipper.  </li>
            <li> I think they could have used a higher quality switch</li>
            <li> My hubby tried to give our son his first haircut with the clippers that he has had for ???</li>
            <li> Many tears and bald spots later</li>
            <li> These are very quiet compared to the cheaper brands, and cut so much better.</li>
            <li> The clipper has more than enough power.  </li>
            <li> When I cut my hair the clippers didn&#x27;t get hot AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Not too hot.  </li>
            <li> they will get hot and they do make a lot of noise.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get him to sit through the whole process without getting up because I was able to cut his hair in half the time and the noise level was so much lower.</li>
            <li> They are quiet and powerful and the attachments that come with the clippers are really easy to take on and get off.  </li>
            <li> It cuts very well right out of the box.</li>
            <li> I mean this was a great cut with nice sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> It cuts very smooth and, contrary to some of the reviews, does not vibrate much at all, and is fairly quiet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are certainly way more quiet and a touch cooler than the Wahl&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> blades seem nice and sharp from the factory.  </li>
            <li> and they accepted the return and quickly sent me a new clipper.</li>
            <li> If you are a person who keeps his/her short, you could be saving a lot of money on haircuts, plus you can keep touched up / neat more easily than going back to the barber.    </li>
            <li> Has a nice, heavy feel to it in the hand, powerful motor.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, I knew it was fragile to begin with, so I made sure I did not apply too much pressure.  </li>
            <li> Overall they have been good clippers for my personal use.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a really nice product so far.</li>
            <li> I expect it will provide good service for years to come, since we only use it occasionally for family hair cuts.  </li>
            <li> Guide Combs to go with it, as our old guide combs don&#x27;t fit the Fast Feed.  </li>
            <li> a good solid clipper is what I need for regular weekly use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lacks variety with guides that come with it would be better if it had more commonly used sizes.</li>
            <li> These clippers are without a doubt a good set to have at home if you are cutting your own hair or your kids</li>
            <li> It certainly seems to be a higher quality construction.</li>
            <li> After having switched to this Oster clipper, I have had ZERO trouble in getting a perfectly even cut, it has more than enough power, and cuts down hair with EASE.</li>
            <li> We bought this to replace an old Costco special.  </li>
            <li> These things buzzed right through my hair with zero hesitation and the guide didn&#x27;t bend and result with the aforementioned &amp;#34;ridges&amp;#34; you get with cheap flimy plastic</li>
            <li> Should a part break on you, even outside of warranty, repair should theoretically be pretty easy.</li>
            <li> I AGREE WITH ALL OF THE POSITIVE REVIEWS.</li>
            <li> It really feels like quality and worked well on the first beard trim.</li>
            <li> Be sure to brush and oil your blades with clipper oil after every use to ensure long blade life.  </li>
            <li> They are quieter, cut really well and never get clogged, and (despite what others have claimed) they do not get hot.</li>
            <li> Well, that pretty much ended it.</li>
            <li> In retrospect I would have ordered the set with more guards but that is a minor factor....</li>
            <li> Pretty much delivers on the advertising.</li>
            <li> I love the long cord and the way it fits in my hand - hair cuts</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and blade stays sharp.</li>
            <li> Though I have had good experiance with this brand in the past.</li>
            <li> Since I save so much money by cutting my own hair I decided to buy a good set of clippers and got this Oster unit.</li>
            <li> Does take a few passes to get all the scragglers, and only comes with 3 guards (you can buy more, but it&#x27;d be nice if they were just there).</li>
            <li> I would not use it cut my dogs hair without letting it cool completely which may take awhile.  </li>
            <li> It is far superior than any we have purchased from Walmart or other box stores.</li>
            <li> Nothing special , just to trim a bit of the top and a little bit here.</li>
            <li> Once again, my hair was clean and dry, and the machine clean and oiled, and adjusted with the lever.    </li>
            <li> If I could make another purchase, I would most likely go with the classic trimmer.</li>
            <li> He was very pleased with the way it works on his face, no pulling and very sharp blades and a smooth and quiet running motor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried the product once so far, but I it cut very easily.  </li>
            <li> These are so much sharper and more accurate than my cheapie clippers - I don&#x27;t have to go over the same spot multiple times to get all the hairs cut.  </li>
            <li> Although my initial opinion was high, I&#x27;m now of the opinion that these are okay</li>
            <li> the the Oster Fast Feed, they cut Great, smooth, fast and much less vibration than any other I have ever used</li>
            <li> This Oster Pro was my quick choice to replace that old gem.</li>
            <li> He cuts his own hair in half the time with these clippers than with the ones he used before.</li>
            <li> An Oster is the standard which all clippers should be judged -easy</li>
            <li> These are easy to handle and fairly quiet to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very quiet and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The clipper and guides are easy to use and are made to last.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was hown much faster the blades moved, providing a much nicer cut.</li>
            <li> He is very particular, and we went through about 3 chippers before we found this one that he likes.</li>
            <li> Yea it&#x27;s sturdy and a solid clipper, but if you want a smooth, crisp, and a to-detail haircut, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, quiet, and cuts through hair easily.</li>
            <li> the clipper is supremely easy to use, solidly made, fits the hand well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are quiet and fairly easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> already (obviously lubricating the blades every now-and-then to keep it smoothe), and it was still going strong.  </li>
            <li> They are quiet and strong too.</li>
            <li> Bought this 2 years back, and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> A little warm after long term use but still ok..</li>
            <li> A very professional product -- worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Great product, strong like the one other Oster I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li> B001T0HHB0 Oster Professional 10 Universal Comb Set Specially Designed to Fit Oster Clippers]].</li>
            <li> We got the large assortment of Oster spring loaded clamp on ones that Amazon suggests to bundle.  </li>
            <li> I also got a set of the large Andis magnetic guides that go up to 1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I had a cheap Norelco beard trimmer with a built in vacuum, and we first tried using that to cut my hair.</li>
            <li> If you want something that just does the basic job for pretty cheap, go for it, but don&#x27;t expect much out of this one.</li>
            <li> These Oster clippers not only cut far better, but also are much quieter while doing it!  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use them for animal clipping (I believe they require more power and better blades) and not sure if I would use these if I cut hair as a professional.</li>
            <li> so you noise exposure will be limited.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m taking good care of it and hoping it&#x27;ll last a long time !</li>
            <li> They were very effective, quiet and smooth, with very little vibration and no excessive heat.</li>
            <li> but honestly I prefer the other&#x27;s noise over this ones high pitched tone that leaves my ears ringing.</li>
            <li> Easy, quiet, fast - I gave myself a professional looking cut on the very first try</li>
            <li> 4 years later my Oster fast feed is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Super powerful, commercial grade clippers.</li>
            <li> fresh Amazon was fast and very professional.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I didn&#x27;t end up going with the Classic 76, because this one suited my needs just fine at less than half the</li>
            <li> Cutter was as  described, and prior positive reviews were accurate.</li>
            <li> Just what we wanted, something light, quiet and quick for our 3 year old&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine, I can do it now like a pro, but initially I was thrown for a loop, so just a heads up to you folks who&#x27;ve never used one yourselves before.  </li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t have different size blades, the guards work just fine.</li>
            <li> and I had very high expectations,</li>
            <li> I researched the models out there and this one came very highly recommended in the intermediate price range.  </li>
            <li> To an amateur, it&#x27;s gonna feel heavy/ run cool and quiet/ shave very smoothly.</li>
            <li> It was a good buy when I first used this Oster clipper for it quiet and sharp blade.</li>
            <li> It gets a little warm without any attachments but its bearable.</li>
            <li> Sharp, fast, and easy to use!</li>
            <li> If it doubt---pay a little more for these clippers and get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li> This sturdiness means it weighs a little bit more and must be plugged into the wall, but for me it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Fast, quiet and accurate.  </li>
            <li> love it, there not much to say but it works very well.</li>
            <li> The clipper works very well, is quiet and problem free.  </li>
            <li> It cut smooth and very quiet .Clean and lube and it is ready to go.</li>
            <li> this is the most I&#x27;ve spent on a unit, and it doesn&#x27;t really feel all that premium.  </li>
            <li> Huge difference there from my old Wahl that was really loud from plastic that was cracked.</li>
            <li> Instead, I went to a store and bought a cheap clipper, only $16.</li>
            <li> And for made in the USA, I expected better quality.</li>
            <li> I have used Oster trimmers before and the vibration is definitely unusual.</li>
            <li> The guides it comes with are all you really need.</li>
            <li> Ive looked at Amazon after I got the ones that dont fit and all over the web for larger and have found nothing.</li>
            <li> Oh well, I just wear my hair that much shorter now.  </li>
            <li> Much sooner.</li>
            <li> For the price, you really should buy it and try it.  </li>
            <li> Those models all stop working after a while and can&#x27;t take much abuse.</li>
            <li> This is where I came across The Oster Fast Feed for about $55.00</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out how these clippers can go through the hair and cut virtually nothing while consuming twice as much electricity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I owned an inexpensive clipper that was very noisy and didn&#x27;t cut well.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the oster pro 76023-510 fast feed clippers to replace failing wahl clippers that I have used for 12+ years.  </li>
            <li> The Wahl is cooler, and it doesn&#x27;t miss as much hair.  </li>
            <li> The weight of these makes them very maneuverable, and quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He gets an even close, cut whenever he uses it, which is once or twice a week (his hair grows fast).</li>
            <li> Seem to work really well.</li>
            <li> Much quieter than the Wahl.</li>
            <li> Very quiet and light, and I like the longer power cord.</li>
            <li> Like most people, I spent weeks researching hair clippers before deciding to buy this.</li>
            <li> Just go get the real things (cost around $300)</li>
            <li> This Fast Feed clipper, with its pivot motor, is much quieter.  </li>
            <li> This is a real clipper.</li>
            <li> In addition, it heated up fast</li>
            <li> It vibrated so much that I fear either one day I will drop it and hurt my son or cut into his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone who isn&#x27;t looking for a really close cut.</li>
            <li> This clipper doesn&#x27;t vibrate much so our dog is much calmer when we cut her.</li>
            <li> Absolute night and day from cheapo drug store clippers.  </li>
            <li> For the money I expected more.  </li>
            <li> still runs like a champ, the attachments have never broken and I&#x27;ve had the thing for six years.  </li>
            <li> I have used this clipper exclusively for beard trimming for roughly two months, so my comments are more specialized than those offered by others.  </li>
            <li> Appears to be just a very well engineered set of clippers.</li>
            <li> , very sturdy&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> im very upset with this item,while im trimming</li>
            <li> the whole hair clipper is shaking</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for the \\&quot;fast</li>
            <li> I am very dissapointed.  </li>
            <li> The only con is that you WILL need another pair of blades for precise taping or trimming.  </li>
            <li> The cheap ones use a magnet that pulls the blade back and forth...</li>
            <li> without much power...</li>
            <li> Much quieter and easier</li>
            <li> Once it breaks it&#x27;s unusable because the blade will just slide back and forth freely.</li>
            <li> Very annoying!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Enter the Oster Pro Fast Feed clippers.</li>
            <li> but they did a awesome job cutting my hair.  </li>
            <li> I feel I saved so much, at the store</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The clippers are very well made and I can&#x27;t imagine having to buy another one ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> fast feeds are the truth.</li>
            <li> Smooth and quiet.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Excellent cutting clipper.  </li>
            <li> This clipper cuts very well.</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very quality product for those of us that do home haircuts.</li>
            <li> Much cooler than any of cheaper consumer clippers that you buy at discount stores.</li>
            <li> he really likes them.</li>
            <li> Very quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> They are worth every penny for the quietness alone; it’s comparable to a soft humming versus the Wahl brand which would leave my ears ringing.  </li>
            <li> It has worked very well.  </li>
            <li> Expected more but it will do</li>
            <li> ; cuts well and seems to be very durable.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t called fast feeds for nothing.</li>
            <li> The fast feed, was not for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real shame because the cipper worked really well before the motor went out.</li>
            <li> but I did not want to spend so much money.</li>
            <li> It never pulls my hair, regardless of how fast I cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expect that these clippers will last for years and I will continue to enjoy them.</li>
            <li> (yes my boys hair grows that fast)  </li>
            <li> even much cheaper models often offer a storage bag for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I tried bying the 10 piece attachment to go with the clipper however those attachments do not connect with the Oster Fast Feed.</li>
            <li> 2- it does not heat as much as wahl clippers    </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased cheap clippers before and they don&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> It cut smoothly and the motor is relatively quiet.</li>
            <li> I adjusted the blade height lever (attempting to oil it)and before it reached the top position it became very loose.  </li>
            <li> But the Universal Comb Set, advertised with it, doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> I used the Andis T-Edjer and was much much much happier.</li>
            <li> And YES I Zero Gapped my fast feed, which helped, but still has nothing on the Andis.</li>
            <li> I did however buy a ceramic blade so that I can zero gap them perfectly because it cannot be zero gaped with the stock cutting blade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oster fast feed-red with chrome blade</li>
            <li> I initially got this after looking to replace a cheap $15 oyster trimmer.</li>
            <li> power cord is very sturdy and does away with having to worry about batteries.</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> Then we really needed to cutback.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We spent more and got the set of combs with it.  </li>
            <li> Also, the cut was very even.</li>
            <li> I really like my oster clipper.</li>
            <li> They work exactly as expected maybe even better.</li>
            <li> I clip my dogs hair and these work really well.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the solid feel of the on/off switch.</li>
            <li> Cut even and fast.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a very close cut ( almost shaved) ---the</li>
            <li> The motor run very quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li> My husband was just hired as an airport security guard and he is required to maintain a buzz cut, so I did the research and read pages of reviews before deciding on these Oster Fast Feed clippers.</li>
            <li> We used the 1/2 inch guard to achieve a very uniform cut.</li>
            <li> This Fast Feed&#x27;s closest cut is about 3 days&#x27; growth after shaving with the Andis.</li>
            <li> i feel like a real barber now</li>
            <li> They can be adjusted to cut very close.</li>
            <li> The blade is not 100% lined up with the grid, but it doesn&#x27;t really impact the quality of the shave.</li>
            <li> Fast clippers that mow evenly through hair.</li>
            <li> I had a cheap pair prior to these.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that wants to buzz their noggin.  </li>
            <li> Very solid in the hand -- not light-weight (cheap).  </li>
            <li> The minimum length with the Fast Feed is 000</li>
            <li> Fast feeds.</li>
            <li> the fast feeds for touch up and fades.  </li>
            <li> The clippers don&#x27;t cut very well .</li>
            <li> Iv been cutting hair for yrs and these clippers are perfect to add to the collection...</li>
            <li> When he&#x27;s ready, we now have the tool.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the finest cutters I have ever put my hands on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m part of a very hairy family...</li>
            <li> Thanks to youtube, i was looking at some videos to upgrade my arsenal</li>
            <li> I really really like these.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re quiet and smooth and don&#x27;t pull the hair.</li>
            <li> Cuts really well.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Oster Universal 10-pc guide comb set, which didn&#x27;t fit the clippers and will be returned.  </li>
            <li> Relatively quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li> They are quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product shipped really fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not cut \\&quot;very close\\&quot; as the description states and the motor is rather weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m ready to replace, I will look for this item again.</li>
            <li> This product fills that requirement very well.</li>
            <li> You really get what you pay for when it comes to this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Smooth blades and quiet while on.</li>
            <li> considering how much I&#x27;ve saved over the years on trips to the barbershop.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of using the fast feed clippers, the clippers stopped working.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for my husband.</li>
            <li> He also says that it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;pull\\&quot; as much or at all compared to the Wahl that he has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with this clipper for about a year, and finally gave up and bought a cheap Wahl.</li>
            <li> have no idea why it&#x27;s called &#x27;Fast feed&#x27;, as it isn&#x27;t fast, and it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;feed&#x27; on anything.</li>
            <li> no pulled hairs and was fast.</li>
            <li> It leaves just as many &amp;#34;straggler hairs&amp;#34; as the cheaper clippers (having to re-cut the same area MULTIPLE times, and then I still have to go back then with a scissors to get the many hairs it still missed).  </li>
            <li> but they really came through for me.</li>
            <li> very disappointing.waste of money...</li>
            <li> High quality product!</li>
            <li> excelent quality for the price point very quiet and smooth operation&lt;</li>
            <li> Ive never had clippers that wouldnt pull hair if i went to fast.</li>
            <li> A big upgrade from my cheap Wahl clippers.  </li>
            <li> This clipper is very sturdy and seems to be well built.</li>
            <li> These work very well.  </li>
            <li> These clippers work really well without having to oil them all of the time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up too fast either.</li>
            <li> out a hair cut just to really try them out &amp; these clipper went through my hair like butter.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much oil for it.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to do a buzz cut on yourself, or are ready to stop going to the barber for a haircut you can do yourself.... than this product will work as advertized for you.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> The real question would be how is it working 1, 2, or 3 years from now.  </li>
            <li> very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these clippers for 2 years now, and they are very reliable.  </li>
            <li> but I cancelled one seeing as to how much of a quality clipper this is.</li>
            <li> Ive been cutting my hair for about 15 years and these are the best clippers I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much hair.</li>
            <li> I tried the old trusty purple magnetic set and sure enough, they fit!!!!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> So much better than anything Costco has on sale for nearly the same price.</li>
            <li> I finally threw it away and bought this oster, which so far is much better.  </li>
            <li> They are a but heavy but he uses them to cut his own hair with no problem.</li>
            <li> Has a nice and solid feel to it and is actually really quiet while being used.  </li>
            <li> It gets a tiny bit warm in the hand if you use it longer than ten minutes.  </li>
            <li> I figured out buzzing my own hair a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve probably done my own hair every 2-3 weeks since and the clipper paid for itself within a few cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it is very quiet and still cuts better than my old clippers.  </li>
            <li> I replaced the chain mega store clipper with this more expensive, but far superior Oster clipper.  </li>
            <li> Will be looking for the top grade Wahl model, as the old set lasted for years and countless haircuts.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair almost year round.  </li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t use it everyday, so if you are that kind of guy</li>
            <li> but it cuts much better than our 20+ year old clippers - definitely was time for a replacement!  </li>
            <li> I cut my own hair, and i&#x27;ve probably saved a few thousand dollars in hair cuts since I&#x27;ve bought it.  </li>
            <li> In 35 years, I&#x27;ve never heard he go on about a tool, it was well worth the few dollars more.</li>
            <li> ; I cut my own hair with it once a week and touch up a few spots with my electric razor.</li>
            <li> I have used these clippers only twice so far, but they are cutting hair very nicely and feel good in the hand.</li>
            <li> They are very sturdy and cut more consistently than anything I have previously used.  </li>
            <li> The weight of Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed is just right.</li>
            <li> If you are used to $20 clippers at Walmart, the difference with these is very apparent the very first time you use it.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful and quiet.</li>
            <li> These clippers are a significant improvement over anything available at local big box stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair for more than 25 years - a very flat flat-top - and this clipper is my favorite by far!&lt;br</li>
            <li> seconds after he&#x27;s out of the water his hair is dry which is nice in our climate where it can go very quickly from sunny and warm to chilly.  </li>
            <li> I can easily use it, held in either hand, to trim the insanely long (but blessedly blond) hair on my arms.  </li>
            <li> I could have sheared all his long curly hair off easily with this clipper.</li>
            <li> If you cut your own hair or your kids&#x27; hair, then I would by far recommend this over any other unit on the market.  </li>
            <li> You can not do much without purchasing the additional comb set which costs another $20-22 so the total cost climbs up to $73-75 and the additional combs you buy do not slide in like the original ones.</li>
            <li> moved up from a Whal, glad i did, this sucker cuts clean and FAST.</li>
            <li> I had a $30 shaver from a local big box and this is better but not as good as a $100 pro model I had in the past.  </li>
            <li> The motor is strong, and works its way through my son&#x27;s thick hair and easily handles my thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> Whisper quiet, but the angle you need to hold them to cut is not as user friendly as cheaper clippers I have owned.  </li>
            <li> i still successfully trimmed my hair (a little too short in some places)</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t do that on the third clipper I buy to replace the original.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many clippers to cut my hair and these were the first more expensive ones that I have used.</li>
            <li> Oster does not come with as many accessories like the other cheaper clipper brands.</li>
            <li> Chris Rock circa 1998, then the Oster Professional 76023 would be more like that cool cat you depend on to help you destroy the Empire...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not that sharp but does a better job.</li>
            <li> Definitely a purchase worth making!</li>
            <li> Fast, hardworking, ergonomic, easy to clean, and quiet compared to our other noisy, less effective clippers.</li>
            <li> It feels solid and comfortable in the hand, and appears to be well constructed with high quality materials.</li>
            <li> Easy for personal use due to its size and weight, easy to maneuver around your head.</li>
            <li> Much quieter than the older model I had.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the higher price over the Chinese made ones.</li>
            <li> The Oster fast feeds were decent clippers.  </li>
            <li> The machine seems to be well constructed and would probably last me forever and a day if kept clean and oiled.</li>
            <li> Really wanted a Classic 76 but couldn&#x27;t justify the $150 price tag.</li>
            <li> After another cheap pair of Wal-Mart special clippers broke down on me, I decided I wanted to spend a little more and get a quality pair of clippers.  </li>
            <li> The up / down  blade height lever pivots on a very cheap piece of plastic that sheared off when adjusted.  </li>
            <li> Second, it doesn&#x27;t seem to do as good a job at clipping hair, it seemed to miss more, and I don&#x27;t think it was due to its narrower path when compared to our previous clipper.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But enough was enough, and I decided it was finally time to go pick up a better quality set instead of replacing the cheap Wahl kits</li>
            <li> the whole, a high quality well made product that seems to be a rarity in today&#x27;s disposable culture of planned obsolescence.</li>
            <li> As I said I don&#x27;t use them for high or bald fades and wouldn&#x27;t really recommend them for that style of cut</li>
            <li> Get a decent liner and you&#x27;re good to go, amateur haircut or professional.</li>
            <li> and for sure if you&#x27;re a DIYer for you and your family to save a couple of bucks at the barber) but if you&#x27;re a professional giving haircuts all day long, go for the Classic 76.</li>
            <li> The new Oster clippers I purchased run smoothly and  are relatively quiet.</li>
            <li> ours is sitting unused as we continue to use the old, worn out wahl - which did come with a nice set of guide combs - and all for less than 20 dollars.</li>
            <li> It is relatively quiet compared to my old Remington, and is easy to use and maintain.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a well built set of clippers at a reasonable price point, then I would highly recommend this particular model.</li>
            <li> I charged cheap for my haircuts, about $5 a pop, and I can&#x27;t tell you how long the lines were waiting for me to give haircuts.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The plastic guards, which I at first thought might prove to be cheap junk, turn out to be good-quality plastic and are serving me extremely well.  </li>
            <li> For the past 7+ years, I&#x27;ve been using Walmart-bought Wahl clippers to cut my own hair and my dad&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> A small (efficient) bag or box would have been nice, just to keep it all together in the closet....</li>
            <li> While the clippers still work, the idea that a \\&quot;professional grade\\&quot; machine would become dysfunctional after one person used it once a month for a year is pretty ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it once a week for a full head trim (of what&#x27;s left of it - let&#x27;s say 50%)</li>
            <li> These are quiet and stay cool longer than any of the others I have owned.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice to have a small height adjustment built into the blade.</li>
            <li> Our first shaver was from the early 2000s and a WAHL.</li>
            <li> They say some get hot in your hand, but I took a long time using it for the first time and it didn&#x27;t get hot at all.  </li>
            <li> my barber had the oster 76 classic, which u raelly dont need because that is basicly the same as the fast feed, except u can cut more times a day.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t cut very smoothly, and my wife had to go over the same spot several times to get any consistency.</li>
            <li> Very powerful clipper, without being really heavy like so many of the other powerful clippers.</li>
            <li> but I am a big guy, so best if you expect heavy clippers.... unless you are a big, strong guy, and then they may not seem so heavy to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it comes down to it, the Masters are a more refined clipper, but the longevity of the andis was a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> Its like a car, if you don&#x27;t service it, it will break down on you, or not function as well as it once was able to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve just cut my hair with the Wahl 5-star clipper 8451 (which I bought after Amazon accepted my return for this one) and it&#x27;s hands down a much better clipper than this Oster.</li>
            <li> It is well-made, sturdy, quiet, small, and most of all, easy to cut hair.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if it came in a little carrying case, but I just found an old travel case that I store it in.</li>
            <li> Had it for awhile now, I use it about two times a month and still cuts like it&#x27;s brand new!</li>
            <li> It runs great and comes with several rake height attachments, so I returned the other item I ordered with similar attachments.</li>
            <li> It uses a completely different and much more powerful motor than all the other clippers out there.  </li>
            <li> Fast and New.</li>
            <li> The cord is also very long, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Previous purchase of product provided more sturdy attachments...</li>
            <li> Had a previous Oster clipper for many years before I wore it out.  </li>
            <li> I wish it came with more comb attachments like our previous one.</li>
            <li> Much better than any of my previous clippers.</li>
            <li> Much better than our previous clippers.  </li>
            <li> During that time I more or less settled on Wahl brand clippers.  </li>
            <li> Less than half the noise level as the last clippers we had, and build quality is superb.  </li>
            <li> love to use it and the only wish that it leaves open is the following:&lt;br</li>
            <li> They can&#x27;t compare to either the Classic 76 or the Model 10.</li>
            <li> A bit spendy but is a decent clip.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get your blade(s) back quick as a wink</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands over the years some last longer and cut better than others.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent for leaving stubble, not a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> For just about $20 more than the Wahl clippers I got at Wal-Mart a few years ago, I now have a real set clippers.  </li>
            <li> I use it mainly for trimming my goatee.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for many years.</li>
            <li> Clippers are quiet, and cut great through thick hair.</li>
            <li> The clippers work very well and cut nicely, even through thick matted fur.</li>
            <li> I have Oster classic 76 that I use my hair</li>
            <li> I bought these with intent to get the pro Oster classic 76s.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oster hoping to replace an older Wahl model.  </li>
            <li> I thought a machine of this price and advertised as &amp;#34;Professional...blah&amp;#34; would  indeed provide a decent service.  </li>
            <li> The action on the adjustable blade is solid, and the comb attachments feel secure and I never worry about them popping off.</li>
            <li> Oster Professional motor is quiet, and the pull through any type of hair is smooth.</li>
            <li> This is such better quality than the cheaper Oster I last owned.</li>
            <li> The fast feed sounds more powerful, they weigh more and cost more and the fast feed uses a pivot motor in place of a magnetic one, but when it comes to pulling off a \\&quot;one-pass\\&quot; clean cut down your head - they fail just like the $10 clippers I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> only downsides I can think of is that the clipper gets very hot after using it for over an hour.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;2-Gets very hot after only 10 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this clipper.</li>
            <li> THIS RAZOR BY THE FEEL OF IT IS CONSTRUCTED OF HIGH QUALITY.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RAZOR</li>
            <li> I learned how to give haircuts while I was in high school</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As a barber, I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Quiet, no hair pulling, smooth cutting with no &amp;#34;flyers&amp;#34;, and just an excellent overall performer.</li>
            <li> These come highly recommended by barbers across the states.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> High quality parts</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> ive been using it for about 4 months, and its extremely high quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this clipper.</li>
            <li> The blade guards that came with the Oster are high quality plastic.</li>
            <li> I was used to cheap trimmers that got clogged up if you were cutting more than 5 individual hair, and that overheated when used for more than 2 min.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> They are of high quality.  </li>
            <li> Everything shipped fine as expected.</li>
            <li> so I decided to spend a little more on the cutter itself.</li>
            <li> Professional quality!!  </li>
            <li> but could be a little more versatile with the guide combs.</li>
            <li> If you take it apart to clean more than 4 times, the grooves in the plastic wear thin and no longer does the screw hold the blades in place.</li>
            <li> These are amazing, it&#x27;s definitely a bifl item if you take care of it, the quiet is an added benefit as i didn&#x27;t mind much the loud noise on my old ones as i was just being cheap by cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li> The Oster fast feed is a classic among barbers and professional hairstylist.  </li>
            <li> The Oster Classic 76 is probably the most heavy duty clipper out there.  </li>
            <li> Very good quality and efficiency for cutting hair.</li>
            <li> Sharp blades and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> Extremely sharp and strong.  </li>
            <li> It was definitely worth the $ to get one that is high quality, will last, and doesn&#x27;t pull his hair out.</li>
            <li> professional clipper works very well for me</li>
            <li> B001JJBC9Y Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper with Adjustable Blade]].</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the weight of the Clipper and even the power cord,  as I was used to the much lower priced and lighter hair clippers.  </li>
            <li> I decided to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to a nicer model, so I purchased the \\&quot;Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper with Adjustable Blade\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have saved so much time with these clippers compared to my old clippers.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for 7 months now and really like these clippers, they replaced old worn out clippers from the 1960&#x27;s (from my parents).</li>
            <li> It would bind up if I cut too fast, and it was loud...  </li>
            <li> Oster Fast Feed is a level above anything I&#x27;ve seen available at the big box stores under $30.  </li>
            <li> It is much quieter than my old clippers.</li>
            <li> Runs much quieter than the old one and cuts cleaner.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and has been working very well so far.  </li>
            <li> The Oster Professional Fast Feed Clipper is adjustable from size 000 to size 1 blade and comes with 4 guide combs.  </li>
            <li> It is quiet and powerful.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think for the price, they could add a few more.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for personal grooming and it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the extra money for the quality.</li>
            <li> I use these at least twice a month to cut my own hair and father&#x27;s hair sometimes.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra money to get quality.</li>
            <li> (Need help with your Flat-top, perhaps the addition of a hand-help &amp;#34;Flattopper Comb&amp;#34; is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> My clipper has always been pretty quiet but as soon as I put a comb on it buzzes really</li>
            <li> This Oster claimed to be whisper quiet and powerful.  </li>
            <li> It has already paid for itself a few times over and am confident with care, will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> The cheap clippers pulled our hair, ran hot, and gave uneven results.  </li>
            <li> heads up folks: as has been mentioned, this is pretty useless without a good set of guide combs.</li>
            <li> The clippers are very quiet and powerful.  </li>
            <li> The clipper itself is very quiet and powerful.  </li>
            <li> Quiet, powerful, reliable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for over 15 years and this is by far the most durable and well-constructed set of clippers I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li> We bought a set of $15 clippers from a big box store and we got our money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> suggestion would be to add a few more guards and a pouch/case for storage</li>
            <li> Even the motor, sounds powerful yet quiet.</li>
            <li> It does not feel  like a 000 cut I normally get at the barber saloon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them a few times and love them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very quiet, yet powerful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they make shavers this powerful with a smaller blade anyway, but that being said it&#x27;s a nitpick.  </li>
            <li> The weight, warmth during operation, overall comfort and balance make this a truly professional clipper that should last for many years.</li>
            <li> but to me that&#x27;s worth it since it feels very solid and well</li>
            <li> They are quiet and powerful.</li>
            <li> I started with the 1/2\\&quot; and my hair is longer that normal after a haircut.</li>
            <li> These are good (once zero gapped) but not great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to cut down on the cost of going to the barber shop every few weeks.</li>
            <li> It is much quieter than the old one even when that one was new.  </li>
            <li> Quiet, cuts well and quickly, doesn&#x27;t jam up like my old one.    </li>
            <li> Also, to boot, they&#x27;re not heavy, they&#x27;re super quiet, and the included blade guards stay on no problem.</li>
            <li> Super quiet if you have a noise or vibration sensitive kid.  </li>
            <li> They have a solid feel and construction to them, but they are also easy to service and take apart using only a screwdriver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Started cutting my own hair and bought this based on other good Amazon reviews.  </li>
            <li> This Oster Fast Feed features a pivot motor, which is the high quality motor not usually found on a typical cheap set of clippers.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 10-piece comb set, and kept the tapered \\&quot;left ear\\&quot; and \\&quot;right ear\\&quot; combs from the Sears clipper.  </li>
            <li> I have been using them for years and they only heat up if you don&#x27;t lube em up right.</li>
            <li> I did purchase the complete set of combs and like their  positive locking action unlike the ones that came with the Clipper.  </li>
            <li> It cuts very cleanly and evenly with minimal noise and barely any vibration.</li>
            <li> I still wasn&#x27;t convinced that the blades would last that much longer, so I made sure to set aside some money to buy Classic 76 when this one broke down.  </li>
            <li> I have owned other brands in the past and the quality of these Oster clippers is great.</li>
            <li> I only cut my own hair, and sometimes my boys, but these are so much quieter, sturdier, better cutting that I even bought one for my Dad for Father&#x27;s day.</li>
            <li> The Oster Professional Clipper is a highly upgraded modern version of the 12 year old Oster clippers I have been using.</li>
            <li> Other than that, they cut fantastic.  </li>
            <li> WOW cuts smooth barely any vibrations feels solid in the hands</li>
            <li> , even my old wahl may be  a little better doing fading.     </li>
            <li> I am hoping for another 26 years from the new unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will keep trying them because I don&#x27;t want to have to go through a return process, I hope there is just some sort of learning curve with a new pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> I returned the item in exchange for a new one.  </li>
            <li> I trust the Oster brand and these clippers live up to the name.</li>
            <li> I thought it was suppose to be a BRAND NEW clippers.</li>
            <li> Buy new guards.</li>
            <li> I should have waited before buying them, but live and learn.  </li>
            <li> I have owned this clipper for two plus years and still works like new.</li>
            <li> and as we live in south Florida, its something that I have to do for him.  </li>
            <li> Oster sent me a new one</li>
            <li> If a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; used these &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; clippers, he or she would soon be looking for a new line of work.</li>
            <li> Time for new one.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re new to it, there are a zillion YouTubes that show how to use a clipper.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving your head every other day less of a chore when you have really good clippers.</li>
            <li> QUIET, powerful, fast clean cuts every time, No significant vibration.</li>
            <li> The time they will save me is worth the price alone, but the other positive features just add to the value.</li>
            <li> No nipping the skin nice and smooth cutting.</li>
            <li> I decided to upgrade to the [[ASIN:B00070E8LA Oster 76076-010 Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper]]</li>
            <li> Very professional.</li>
            <li> The first clipper set I used was a few years old, and my husband had never taken it thoroughly apart to clean it.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I had hoped to keep the review updated with my new impressions, but this will be my first and last edit.    </li>
            <li> Very good quality, but a little bit not comfortable when holding it, especially for people who has small hand :)</li>
            <li> decided to spend a little more on my next pair of clippers and got the Oster Fast Feed.  </li>
            <li> and for very little more money.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate as long as you&#x27;re going short.</li>
            <li> When I first used it seemed less powerful than the wahl</li>
            <li> With one pass, it came out just like the professional even though I have been cutting my son&#x27;s hair for over two years with the Wahl and couldn&#x27;t get it that good, clean and fast with multiple passes.</li>
            <li> and I always cut my hair dry with no products in it; so I&#x27;m not sure why there are good reviews about it</li>
            <li> I usually end up having to repeatedly go over my head to make sure all the stray hairs are clipped.</li>
            <li> This one, even though you can adjust it shorter with no guards, leaves too long of a stubble/shadow on my head so it looks like I already have 3 or 4 days of growth when it&#x27;s a fresh cut.  </li>
            <li> iam now doing the exact same thing my barber was doing.</li>
            <li> The price is only slightly higher, but the quality is beyond the value.</li>
            <li> First a brief bit of background info.  </li>
            <li> These are really pretty quiet.</li>
            <li> This clipper elicits a definite &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; when you first use it.</li>
            <li> but these are soo quiet and never get hot like the andis.</li>
            <li> I sometimes did 3 haircuts in a row and and the other ones I would have to wait until they cooled in between; but this one while it still gets hot, it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the others.</li>
            <li> The metal part gets extremely hot in very short time.</li>
            <li> Its pretty quiet as well.</li>
            <li> The only draw back I have seen after having them for about a year now is that the metal is starting to move in the direction in which Im cleaning it most but that can be adjusted over time.</li>
            <li> I have to say from when I opened them to the first use I was blown away by the build quality, the quietness, the low temperature, and the power this trimmer possesses.  </li>
            <li> I use these clippers twice a week they are quiet but they do get really hot after about 15-20min.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the cheaper set I have had for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first use, I can tell that this product cuts differently than the Wahl.</li>
            <li> It was quiet for the first couple minutes, maybe 5.</li>
            <li> Now if I could just get my 15yr old to let me try it on his mop!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not a professional, so this is from the for what it&#x27;s worth dept.</li>
            <li> My first and last Oster.</li>
            <li> She is a Labrador retriever and sheds a small chihuahua&#x27;s sized clump of hair every week, so I had hoped that this would be able to keep her hair trimmed during the summer.</li>
            <li> Product blew out on first use and have yet to hear back about replacing it</li>
            <li> It does come with 4 combs ( short to 1/2&amp;#34;), oil and a brush for cleaning.</li>
            <li> for these first, then will probably buy the same model if that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a better model than the basic, but not quite as expensive as the top of the line.</li>
            <li> clipper only con is you have to adjust to get a skin tight fade but other than that cuts all types of haircuts great.</li>
            <li> Cuts nicely but hard to use because of cheap, stiff</li>
            <li> Requires cleaning, and little combs break easily.</li>
            <li> Also do occasional body grooming with it and clean and oil it back up.</li>
            <li> It cuts very well and has the same attachments as my older one did.  </li>
            <li> For home use this should last a number of years and provide a high-quality haircut if the blade is kept clean and oiled prior to use.</li>
            <li> I have trouble raising my arms, so it would be fine for a person who can use their arms normally.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Often missed hairs requiring me to keep going back over the same areas for a clean cut&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> extremely well, clean, and fast&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I keep the equipment clean, sharp, and lubed.  </li>
            <li> Finally, the clippers are very sturdy and of a high quality.</li>
            <li> Ended up switching blade from my old onto the new motor</li>
            <li> The new Oster power cord is considerably better quality and is less likely to twist.</li>
            <li> I feel like I find myself going over my hair multiple times less often with these new clippers, feeling like they don&#x27;t need as many passes over my scalp to get all the hair cut</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair (not much up there any more) and for my face if i&#x27;ve let my beard go for too long to use my Norelco electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Easy to get hair stuck in a few nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li> To me, this is not worth the more than double price, and I&#x27;ve been clipping for 20 years.  </li>
            <li> It is quite quiet, very solid, very fast, and very thorough.  </li>
            <li> The clipper comes with a little tube of oil, but I&#x27;ve found 3-in-1 oil works just fine.</li>
            <li> Some cleaning and oiling is needed, it&#x27;s not like your Braun face shaver that is set and forget, but this machine is truly commercial grade, and could very well out live you.</li>
            <li> but i threw my old clippers out and put the new ones in my old case.</li>
            <li> The best part is that when u get a hair cut , after a week and a half, it stars to fade out, or get a little messy.</li>
            <li> Much better than my previous Andis clipper at the same price.  </li>
            <li> I feel the andis fits the hand better, but the sheer weight takes away from it slightly.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to repeat as many times on the same spot as I had to with the previous ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised after wanting a few videos how easy it was to do a buzz cut hairstyle.  </li>
            <li> Clipper is easy to use and take care of I only wish it had a few more attachments as I like to wear my hair a little longer in the colder weather</li>
            <li> I am pleased find that the new model seems to be unchanged in quality, with only a few cosmetic/ergonomic tweaks.</li>
            <li> I have found that when used in back to back hair cuts the blades can get very hot</li>
            <li> Keep them clean and oiled and they should last a long time.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair now for about 30 years; the Oster is very quiet, keen, and finely tuned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this could be fine for use on a casual basis, but it definitely isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;d call a workhorse clipper by any stretch of the imagination.</li>
            <li> This unit has a real heavy duty feel to it; it&#x27;s quieter than the other trimmers I&#x27;ve used; despite a lack of accessories, it makes beard trimming easy and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, they are great at cutting.</li>
            <li> Great for cutting hair just like the professionals</li>
            <li> It does a great job of cutting hair.  </li>
            <li> Cutting hair is a joy once again.</li>
            <li> Oster Professional Fast Feed Clipper fits the bill entirely.</li>
            <li> You get a clear sense of quality in this product.</li>
            <li> Compared to my old one which was a battery operated simple phillips device, this is a much sturdy item and does the job</li>
            <li> I know this is a mid range model (the professional models may be much nicer, but also pricier)</li>
            <li> Cut clean with less passes, don&#x27;t heat up like masters, and quality manufacturing.</li>
            <li> That said, it&#x27;s solid and reasonably priced for professional clippers.</li>
            <li> Now I use my old clippers for my head, and the Oster Fast Feed for facial hair.</li>
            <li> I guess the options are to spend hundreds and get a truly professional grade clippers, or save a few buck and keep getting the cheap clippers.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, not too difficult to clean (and oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After several cheapo clippers, I was ready to throw in the towel.</li>
            <li> , fast feed is low quality piece of trash, stay away and don&#x27;t believe the hype.</li>
            <li> I was replacing an Oster Professional Clipper that I had purchased in 1986.</li>
            <li> DiscountsJungle far exceeded my expectations for service.</li>
            <li> So far no problems.</li>
            <li> I had my son&#x27;s head buzz-cut in 10 minutes, as opposed to 30 minutes with the old clippers.  </li>
            <li> Easily fixed but a problem for people like me that take the hair one step from bald.    </li>
            <li> I bought this Oster Fast Feed clipper and the 10 piece Oster universal attachments that was recommended by Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far heavier duty, cord included.  </li>
            <li> They cut through hair fast and effortlessly and are relatively quiet considerng</li>
            <li> This feels like a professional model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always shaved my head with no guard, and my last one was able to cut and leave just a very short rough stubble.  </li>
            <li> they are rather loud once they are against you</li>
            <li> To sum it up the clippers do feel professional as their name suggests but they do not cut professional.  </li>
            <li> Never had a problem so far in the two years that I&#x27;ve owned it</li>
            <li> He wasn&#x27;t nearly as frightened.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my hair over ten years and this is simply the best quality clipper I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and they feel and sound sturdy and heavy duty, unlike the pieces of junk that you buy for $20 at the store around Christmas time.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this clipper to replace the old magnetic clipper I got over thirty years ago from Sears.</li>
            <li> and I would have to unscrew the blades, clean/lightly sand and oil them frequently.  </li>
            <li> but so far it has worked well.  </li>
            <li> I went with the Oster Professional.  </li>
            <li> They are professional quality</li>
            <li> the Wahl, the noise was so loud that it scared my two years old and made him cried with every hair cut.</li>
            <li> The 10 pieces combs definitely work with the Fast Feeder like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this product to update from Whal, which I have been using so far.</li>
            <li> My old Wahl</li>
            <li> Your results will look professional just like the name suggests.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it will last much longer</li>
            <li> I bought this for my uncle and so far I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints or issues on it.</li>
            <li> Professional tool.  </li>
            <li> It still works, but with a loud buzz from the crack as you might imagine.</li>
            <li> I cut hair for friends and family members, and my old wal-mart clippers were not doing the job.</li>
            <li> I gave in and bought professional clipper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used these before and was pleasantly surprised to find that they couldn&#x27;t be easier to use.  </li>
            <li> I had a set of oster combs from old unit</li>
            <li> Very rugged, commercial construction.  </li>
            <li> I ENDED UP USING MY OLD CONAIR ELECTRIC RAZOR CASE.</li>
            <li> I also like how the motor is stronger, yet, isn&#x27;t as loud as you might expect.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the quietest and smoothest clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Much better performance than the cheap units in the big box stores but not too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Well, let me tell you, after 3 years of college (I graduated early)</li>
            <li> Bought these 3 months ago, these are professional clippers and they loosen up with every haircut I do, and even during haircuts...would not suggest them to any stylists working for a living...</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t too loud.</li>
            <li> I use these to cut my husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s hair and they look like a professional cut their hair.</li>
            <li> So far I have had no problems.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast, relatively quiet, and powers through everything I&#x27;ve thrown at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far it works well</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t present a real challenge to this clipper</li>
            <li> /&gt;The need to frequently oil blades is old-fashioned.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t have much money and needed a reliable clipper for personal use.  </li>
            <li> I believe these are near professional grade</li>
            <li> Truly professional clippers do not.</li>
            <li> I was used to spending near and around 15 bucks per haircut at the barber, which is a ton when it adds up.</li>
            <li> This two items are needed to complete the clipper.</li>
            <li> We have only used it a few times, so I cannot speak to longevity, but so far it cuts better than the &amp;#34;ConAir&amp;#34</li>
            <li> but this is a professional clipper</li>
            <li> I.e., not for those trying to shave their head or face nearly (but not quite) bald.</li>
            <li> It was also considerable cheaper online than in retail outlets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve completely given up on this Oster and have changed my rating to two stars.</li>
            <li> I had an old Wahl made in China (purchased from Wally World) set that I have used for 15 years.  </li>
            <li> I just used my old clipper case to store it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional barber and wanted to add this clipper to my arsenal, but I think I&#x27;m going to have to stick to my Wahl Senior, Andis Master and Andis BGRC.</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer after my old one died after 15 years of use.  </li>
            <li> Who wants to keep charging clippers that you might only use once a month?</li>
            <li> I have never used clippers before, but the haircut looks like a professional job.</li>
            <li> I have a pair of $40 Andis clippers (they broke TWICE which is why I bought these) that cut very close - the closest you can get whilst the stubble of the hair remains outside the skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use on my kids who are nervous about loud clippers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no quieter than my old Wahl.  </li>
            <li> I ended up replacing the blades on my old Wahl and am now using that instead.  </li>
            <li> This really is professional quality.  </li>
            <li> So far I like it.  </li>
            <li> I have gone through a few sets of cheap Whal clippers.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;IT HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR ME, I AM A BARBER IN CALI AND SWITCHED FOR WAHL TO OSTER LAST YEAR</li>
            <li> so we can put the old wahl to the rest it deserves.</li>
            <li> I use it solely on my 9 year old and he no longer complains of pulls.</li>
            <li> The Oster Fast Feed is definitely that.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend this to anyone who shaves their head frequently.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the Only kid on the block with my fast feeds and T-finisher chromed out.</li>
            <li> I replaced a 10+ year old $40 set of Wahl clippers I got at Target.</li>
            <li> We had an old set of clippers from Wahl.</li>
            <li> I use 4 different type of clippers for my customers and the Oster Fast Feed Clippers</li>
            <li> No complaints, it beats my old Wahl Color Pro by leaps and bounds.  </li>
            <li> Every part simply “looks” and “feels” very well made and thought out.</li>
            <li> Been using it for proper manscaping for years, does the trick haha</li>
            <li> this the brand of one of his old clippers, and they are fifty years old.</li>
            <li> time I decided to try a set of professional clipper,</li>
            <li> The paper box it came with won&#x27;t hold up to years of use, so I am storing all the parts in the old Conair box.</li>
            <li> These clippers are professional grade.</li>
            <li> I had an old &amp;#</li>
            <li> Now head vibrating loud clipper anymore.  </li>
            <li> The Oster Professional Fast Feed Clipper with attachments did a good job cutting hair.</li>
            <li> Busy hair stylist.  </li>
            <li> Now here I am early Thursday morning with a quarter of the hair on my head shaved before I head to work.</li>
            <li> He insisted he wanted a professional grade hair trimmer instead</li>
            <li> I also purchased some Oster Professional 76926-800</li>
            <li> if the loud, biting Wahl 305G MC is akin to (let&#x27;s say)</li>
            <li> Relevant background: I have been cutting my own hair for the last 14 years.  </li>
            <li> you want it to not be loud?  </li>
            <li> Also this clipper does not offer a near zero depth cut.  </li>
            <li> Some of the cheaper units can be adjusted to a near shaved result for any unwanted hair areas.  </li>
            <li> Had a Wahl hair clipper before that wouldn&#x27;t cut near as well as this</li>
            <li> It truly feels like a professional tool.</li>
            <li> This thing is fast and quiet!</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper to replace a Wahl Professional clipper that was worn out.</li>
            <li> If you have a beard trimmer you can finish with that or even a razor would have no trouble at all after the Oster was finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These are very quiet and cut very well.  </li>
            <li> This product is very quiet and cuts very well.</li>
            <li> Package comes complete with adjustable blade and all the options.</li>
            <li> They also have the adjustable handle on the side so you can really blend different sizes together.</li>
            <li> my skin is highly sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have not used the guards as I purchased a complete set separately.  </li>
            <li> I went from a 4 year old junk CVS clipper to this.</li>
            <li> Bought clippers as a birthday present for the hubby who is very peculiar about his hair.  </li>
            <li> I have found that changing direction will frequently solve this problem.  </li>
            <li> I compare my experience to watching a professional hair cutter and how effortless their clippers seem to work.  </li>
            <li> not so loud and they hold up too</li>
            <li> I replaced the leaver from an old clipper I had laying around.</li>
            <li> Regrettably my old barber, Roy, has passed on and is now trimming the beards of the Angels.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The guides are marked 1/2\\&quot;, 3/8\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Quiet\\&quot; at all; it&#x27;s not really any more powerful, that I can tell anyway; and if you&#x27;re looking to have the option of the 0 close trim with no guard this will not do it--at least the Wahl did that.  </li>
            <li> The only better thing I can tell so far is the guards clip on tighter and stay on, which I&#x27;ve always had trouble with the Wahl&#x27;s.   </li>
            <li> Crazy good quality and very efficient for the price.</li>
            <li> It is a lot more expensive, but worth it, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Only cons are no case to put it in, and could use a few more attachment size varieties.</li>
            <li> The heavy cord is sort of a nuisance - I&#x27;m used to cordless rechargeable units - but that is more than offset by the comfort of the trim and the obvious quality of construction.</li>
            <li> Have only used a few times, but  I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> It feels nice and heavy duty (doesn&#x27;t have the empty plastic bottle sound when you tap it, the wire is heavy gauge too).</li>
            <li> My Son has been using his Oster clippers regularly for more than 10 years - trouble</li>
            <li> Have only used approximately 6 times but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> My initial impression is good, but, not great.  </li>
            <li> If you need a good set of clippers, you can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t design for thick hair at all, perhaps for kids&#x27; hair it might do an OK job...</li>
            <li> then again, probably because it is slow... :-)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I could not get a good cut with these.</li>
            <li> They all worked fairly well in the beginning, but all have eventually failed on me.</li>
            <li> and I have heard the boys complain of this, so give it a minute to cool down.  </li>
            <li> I have spent the past 6 months trying to find a new barber but haven&#x27;t found anyone I liked.</li>
            <li> This is defnitely more powerful and cuts better than my other clippers but even after I have went over the same spot over and over again I notice hairs the next day that it failed to get.</li>
            <li> It does get a little bit warm (not hot) after 20 minutes of use, but I believe it is nothing to be alarmed about.</li>
            <li> The cord is is too stiff, it definitely needs to be more flexible like</li>
            <li> They are a little loud, but they make all the cuts look clean and professional.</li>
            <li> The noise is a minor inconvenence, it performs much better than my previous clippers.</li>
            <li> It has a powerful but quiet motor that can cut through hair at a fast speed and the adjustable clippers make it a breeze to quickly add or subtract millimeters of length quickly while cutting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right out of the box, my heart dropped as the plastic feel, and stiff adjustable lever came to light.</li>
            <li> but I found that beyond a certain length (like beyond 1 inch) you&#x27;re better off using scissors since hair bends and scrunches up before it hits the cutting teeth and thus doesn&#x27;t extend to full length enough to be cut off at the desired 1&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have only owned one other $11 cheap set of clippers.  </li>
            <li> I have used numerous pairs of other clippers and none of the cheap brands seem to work well.  </li>
            <li> It feels strong and sturdy, and is small and lighter to handel.</li>
            <li> , very glad I spent a little extra and got these, my search is now over.</li>
            <li> These clippers did  a very nice job of cutting.</li>
            <li> I looked high and low for a reasonably priced clipper and finally found this one on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I buy these every couple of years, and after about 1 year, I have not noticed too much a decrease in function, but I will likely try a different brand or higher quality product the next time I buy one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This came with 5 plastic guards, oil, and a little brush to clean the blades.  </li>
            <li> With this model, they even give you a tube of oil and a little brush to clean the blade heads.</li>
            <li> Its smaller &amp; lighter &amp; costs less but just as easy to use.</li>
            <li> With my haircut being so easy, it would only take them 10 minutes or less to cut it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d bought a Costco clipper set for $40 or so in order to cut my husband&#x27;s fine hair and it never really worked well in addition to taking a long time.  </li>
            <li> so I particularly like its small size because it is easy to handle doing the back of my head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used all of my hair clippers (and I&#x27;ve had quite a few) with their original 3/8 inch comb.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful machine, as other reviewers have also noted.  </li>
            <li> Okay we are being serious about these clippers.  </li>
            <li> I was going back and forth between these clippers and the Oster Classic 76.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be using Amazon for future purchases, thanks!</li>
            <li> I found my beard trimmer to be a closer cut than these, and have recently resorted to using that as my main weapon of choice.  </li>
            <li> So just be advised that there is a possible limitation to this particular device depending on your needs...    </li>
            <li> I was vacillating between this one and the Classic 76 which I personally knew to be a quality clipper.  </li>
            <li> I only used my Oster for the first time today, but it is a night and day difference from my last clipper.  </li>
            <li> However, the blade becomes too hot after about 5 minutes of use, meaning bigger jobs have to be completed in multiple sittings.</li>
            <li> They did a decent job, but they usually only lasted a couple of years before burning out.  </li>
            <li> Our family uses the larger Oster Classic clipper.  </li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t get the super close cut to which I was accustomed with my previous clippers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit to replace an older one by the same manufacturer which I have used for over 20 years.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews prior to buying my first clipper.</li>
            <li> Good reviewers have not had unit long enough to experience battery failure.</li>
            <li> But for regular business or gentlemen&#x27;s haircuts along with do-it-yourself haircuts at home, I would highly recommend these clippers.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting the 10 set of universal guides because the guides that come with the clippers are insufficient.</li>
            <li> After showing her several haircutting tutorials on the Internet, she reluctantly agreed to try cutting my hair (mostly side and back trimming and taper since I am bald on top).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had the chance to cut my hair twice with this new set so far.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, but works really well and is much quieter than the cheaper version we had previously.</li>
            <li> I have returned my first product, thinking that it could be a rare manufacturing failure.</li>
            <li> It jammed all of the time, it did not have that much power, and it was very loud and did not ensure an even cut.</li>
            <li> these are very quiet and are very sharp and they seriously work great.</li>
            <li> It is very noisy with a strange vibration.  </li>
            <li> The Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed is quiet and cuts smoother than the Andis 24145 Speed Master 2 and about the same as the Forfex (Babyliss) AC Motor Clipper</li>
            <li> I have no regrets so far about this purchase.</li>
            <li> ; brand my husband usually gets for cheap.</li>
            <li> I would usually get the cheap Walmart clippers</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I ordered and came days before I expected.</li>
            <li> higher quality then i expected.  </li>
            <li> When I received these clippers, I expected to be in clipping heaven when I powered them up for the first time.</li>
            <li> I bought these Osters because the pair of Wahl clippers that I had were dropped and the blade guard had chipped off a piece, causing direct exposure to the blades, as well as because the combs that came with the Wahls were loose and became VERY noisy when the clippers were turned on.     </li>
            <li> But it is definitely geared for human use only if you are going to clean it regularly.</li>
            <li> Fairly new user, but at this point I can say that this performs far better than any other razor I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in seven years of cutting his hair, he sat there very easily and and let me cut his hair without complaining.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve concluded that the reason for the poor results it that my hair is very fine.</li>
            <li> For the price, I expected a little better.  </li>
            <li> It may just be me...but other than that, clippers are quiet, quick and even cut.</li>
            <li> only thing that would have made this set better was if it came with a hard plastic storage box.  </li>
            <li> I hardly need to pass the clippers on the same spot more than once, and it gives an even cut.</li>
            <li> Finally it was time for a new unit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now had them for several years and they perform as well as they did when new.</li>
            <li> I just spend extra time cleaning it well, and it performs like new again.</li>
            <li> Last year I upgraded to this clipper and I have found the difference from my old Remington to be profound!</li>
            <li> In other words, it has a nice fluid cutting action and also is very quiet compared to most clippers while doing so.    </li>
            <li> Go to a store, buy a cheap set of clippers, go home, and clip my hear until the cheap clippers start to feel like they&#x27;re tearing hair out, as opposed to just cutting</li>
            <li> Quiet running and does a great job cutting close.</li>
            <li> despite how much I love these clippers, they just do not fit the purpose I expected to use them for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike most, it is heavy duty and works on wet or dry&lt;</li>
            <li> just warm.(30 minutes cutting)&lt;br /&gt;its not super powerful but</li>
            <li> Went through a whole collection of various clippers on our Giant Schnauzer.</li>
            <li> I was actually looking at a different brand when he said not so fast.  </li>
            <li> Light in hand, arm doesn&#x27;t get tired as fast.</li>
            <li> I  don&#x27;t need to go to the barber who never remembers me and if I need a quick touch up, it takes just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This unit slices through thick and damp hair very quickly with no pulling and no pain.  </li>
            <li> i like the slow and more quiet motor on these.  </li>
            <li> So nice to use a product that feels heavy weight/durable - not cheap plastic junk.</li>
            <li> , I tracked down a set of older and better made attachments and went to business as usual.  </li>
            <li> Oster lined four out of the five holes for screws with metal, but the screw that slides the length of the blade up and down is cut right into the plastic.</li>
            <li> The only cons of cutting your own hair is cleaning up the mess, but I will gladly do that to save the cash.</li>
            <li> MAJOR TIP; - Keep blades oiled.</li>
            <li> No need to go back on the same spot multiple times because the first time gets it done.</li>
            <li> I suspect if you gave multiple, back to back cuts it would get really hot.</li>
            <li> Having grown tired of cheap clippers that sounded like a small lawnmower and pulled my hair like a screaming infant, I decided it was time to step up to a more reliable model.</li>
            <li> I think I cut my hair all of four times with the Oster before the adjustable blade handle started becoming a little loose, but it was still useable.</li>
            <li> Also, unlike the previous model that we had tried, this one only gets a little warm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has very little tolerance for any residue on the blades, so even though I clean it regularily every now and again it will pull hair.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Only half of that is true.  </li>
            <li> The heat of the head is not uncomfortable, the noise and vibration very minimal.</li>
            <li> only thing is the guards are bad, get you some Andis magnet guards with this and your good to go!</li>
            <li> so far they&#x27;ve been extremely dependable and still cut very well.</li>
            <li> I have to go over and over my noggin probably fifteen times to get a decent, but still too long, haircut with the Oster.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quieter than my older model from 1995 so we will see how long it lasts and how well it cuts as time goes on.  </li>
            <li> Quiet, sharp, powerful.  </li>
            <li> The chrome limited editions were definitely worth the ten extra bucks too...</li>
            <li> I was afraid at first, but after a couple uses, was very comfortable with it.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, I was a little skeptical buying this one because it was less than half the price of the Classic 76 (as well as only 12 watts in comparison to the 76&#x27;s 26 watts) which sort-of led me to believe it was not as good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I considered the bigger 76 classic but opted for the fast feed because I knew I would be giving consecutive hair cuts and didn&#x27;t want to get tired of holding the MUCH heavier Oster classic 76.  </li>
            <li> I wish they had metal replacement blades of different sizes like the Classic 76 model as the plastic guards are a bit fragile.</li>
            <li> The attachments got so cheap that if you pushed too hard on your head, the attachment would distort.  </li>
            <li> They make a dull \\&quot;buzzing\\&quot; sound when invoked.</li>
            <li> Not a bad clipper, quiet, painless but could trim a little closer.</li>
            <li> The fast feed has a pivot motor in it which is very powerful and smooth cutting compared to clippers you will find at Walmart or other chain stores.  </li>
            <li> I have learned over the years that the joy of buying something cheap is soon lost in the pain of disappointment and failure!    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the clipper gave amazing cuts but Oster quoted me $40 to refurbish the housing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always owned cheap clippers... and never liked them.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been too busy and believe I&#x27;ve kept it far too long.  </li>
            <li> For the past several years I had been using a cheap Wahl brand hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> In the past I bought cheap clippers which only lasted a year before breaking.</li>
            <li> This clipper cuts very well and am hoping that it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, professional build and very quiet!</li>
            <li> it took me 40 min to shave my head completely with it as I had to pass again and again on the same spot, I ordered the 20 something</li>
            <li> Wow, I was amazed how quiet it run and</li>
            <li> I currently use it to nearly shave my head.  </li>
            <li> This product is used to cut hair on several boys and an adult, so it does get quite a bit of use.</li>
            <li> It replaced a ~20 year old Wal-Mart clipper that finally crapped out on me.</li>
            <li> I have given myself several haircuts using the razor guard which was fixed on the Oster razor when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this clipper daily in a professional setting for over a year now</li>
            <li> They have to be hooked to the back of the metal plate by some force which makes frequent comb changing a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li> ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added the  Oster Professional 10 Universal Comb Set</li>
            <li> The longest attachment is only 1/2&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s a bit shorter than what I prefer for my young son.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by that when I open the package.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really fast what I expected.</li>
            <li> It cuts quite well and is extremely quiet compared to the 30 year old Oster clippers it replaced.</li>
            <li> and wow, they cut evenly and left me so crispy.</li>
            <li> I am a sixty year old guy who lives in a small home with a Golden Retriever in Northern Nevada.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use adjustables for close cuts or fades, I generally only use them for normal clipper-over-comb style cuts and rarely open them all the way up.</li>
            <li> it leaves many hair behind</li>
            <li> Any one looking for a good clipper don&#x27;t be afraid to spend the money on this product.</li>
            <li> I was told it takes about a year to get really good at cutting their hair</li>
            <li> Light family use on thick hair.</li>
            <li> They make light work of my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Cutting quality is also good.</li>
            <li> If you are doing your own hair and want to step up from the department store set than you can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> This model clipper is good to begin hair cutting with.</li>
            <li> I got too freaked out to continue using it and usually didn&#x27;t give more than 6 or 7 haircuts in a row before letting the thing cool down for a while, so I can&#x27;t tell you if it would destroy the motor if you used it longer.  </li>
            <li> The issues were usually sudden loud motor sound, grabbing and pulling of hair even when new, or simply not having the power necessary to clip the hair despite slow feeding through hair.  </li>
            <li> I started cutting my own hair after giving up my Natural and not wanting to go back to a Quo Vadis or search for a new barber.</li>
            <li> I have thick, spiky hair and usually have problems cutting quickly and effectively with most clippers.</li>
            <li> They are what everyone say.and some just take your time and learn them and you won&#x27;t want to use another clipper ever I adjusted the blade down to 0 and like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li> On the down side, this clipper gets hot to hold after about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> You can buy less expensive clippers, but as I learned, you will not be happy with them.  </li>
            <li> they can&#x27;t go half as fast as my old clippers.  </li>
            <li> They are quiet and easy to handle, even in the delicate face areas.</li>
            <li> With it I managed to give myself a more or less proper haircut, down to my desired 3/8 inch length.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had more expensive clippers in the past, but these are just fine.  </li>
            <li> Only not so great thing is that it doesn&#x27;t bring different Adonis for cutting hair at different sizes.</li>
            <li> the other is much finer.  </li>
            <li> Like other buyers have noted, this is a real machine that cuts your hair or beard evenly.  </li>
            <li> It takes much fewer passes than the other ones I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> they are extremely reliable and cut my hair much faster.</li>
            <li> Man, these sets are the real thing and do not feel flimsy like the other plastic sets.</li>
            <li> One thing you can&#x27;t really tell by the picture is that it&#x27;s very heavy and hard to maneuver even for most guys.  </li>
            <li> This is a high quality clipper with just long enough cord.</li>
            <li> only gripes with this product are the lack of quality attachments, the cheap feeling on/off button, and I wish this trimmer came in a hard plastic box rather than a cardboard</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really use them for edging like my old Wahl&#x27;s as they just don&#x27;t get close enough when adjusted down.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The vibration caused one of the screws to come loose and fall out, but I&#x27;m not sure what besides locktite would actually keep it in and still be able to remove the screws at a later time if I needed to.</li>
            <li> may be walking around with my hair wildly standing out in different directions, because that&#x27;s how my hair grows, and this short it&#x27;s just going to do that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for about 5 years now, and this is by far the quickest clippers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> At one point I decided that the clippers are only lasting 3 - 5 uses, which would still be cheaper than the professional shop visits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this clipper a few times, but it&#x27;s so much better than my previous model--a brand professionals use, purchased at Sally&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for nearly 15 years.</li>
            <li> Not heavy use--just cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this machine for 2 years so far and here is a list of positive and negative features I have observed so far</li>
            <li> The Andis Master would get really hot in the little amount of time.</li>
            <li> I never had a major issue with the Wahl clippers until recently, when some of the guards started to fall off mid-cut.</li>
            <li> At first I was excited about it and after first use I was disappointed as it didn&#x27;t cut my hair as close as I like or even as close as the Whal.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this 5 stars is, one they don&#x27;t have a 4 1/2 star rating and lastly because of the poor quality of the plastic guide combs which don&#x27;t seat very secure over the cutter.  </li>
            <li> I give these only four stars because I had trouble finding the right guards to go on them.  </li>
            <li> Just had my first cut with the Oster and it&#x27;s head and shoulders above the $40-$50 Wahl I previously owned which would always miss hairs and took forever having to go over my head 3 times.      </li>
            <li> This clipper is lighter and quieter than many other quality clippers, and it has a long cord that does not  easily tangle.</li>
            <li> I had a routine down with my old set and am still trying to figure out a new routine with the Oster&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Definitely much quiter than your average drugstore clippers.</li>
            <li> at least based on the other mostly glowing reviews.</li>
            <li> However as a bonus it is also quieter than my old clippers, giving off just a minor humm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional barber but had a professional barber recommend them to me</li>
            <li> I used the old clickety clackity ones for a long time.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t close to the Oster professional I used to have but not far from it.</li>
            <li> I purchased these clippers a few weeks ago and used them for the first time.</li>
            <li> This will probably be the first thing I&#x27;ll take the trouble to return through Amazon.</li>
            <li> The first box that I received was missing all of the included accessories, but had 2 user manuals.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty heavy</li>
            <li> What made it worse was that he had to endure it even longer for me to go over a few more passes to get it to cut the strands it missed, which was an agony for me to see him cried so much</li>
            <li> I have some Wahl clippers that sound like a motorcycle, but the motor in these have little next to no noise, even after cutting for more than 40 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have been buzzing my hair down to nothing on and off my whole life.  </li>
            <li> But the Fast Feed is half the cost, also heavy duty, lighter in weight, and doesn&#x27;t get hot while using it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper for my oldest son a few years back, and after he moved out, I bought another for my younger son.  </li>
            <li> keep in mind that i haven&#x27;t had this clipper very long, but its solid, durable and as advertised so far!  </li>
            <li> I have reviewed many a clipper, and took back a few after trying, this clipper is very solid, alittle heavy</li>
            <li> I found an old, very inexpensive clipper I haven&#x27;t used for years and decided to finish cutting my hair with it, using its original 3.8 inch comb.</li>
            <li> Our ancient Oster clippers (Model 11) finally died due to a short in the coil winding, so after research I settled on replacing them with the Oster Fast Feed.  </li>
            <li> I used to use my other one to shave my beard off when it was time and it would reduce a beard to tiny stubble but this leaves it still pretty long even on its closest setting.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected when I purchased item titled new.</li>
            <li> Be careful if you live where its humid as the blade will rust.  </li>
            <li> The motor is quieter, and unit is light and easy to work with, but the result is very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this clipper based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You really don&#x27;t need to spend $10 at a barber every week when you got one of these... and it therefore pays for itself in less than 2 months.</li>
            <li> They are much quieter than the previous ConAir clippers I had.</li>
            <li> and it shaved heads much closer and with less repetition.  </li>
            <li> They are much quieter running than my previous clippers and they have not pulled my sons hair.  </li>
            <li> The clipper does not cut adequately, not sure if it is a design or power issue, but it is frequently snagging, so I have to take much longer to cut.</li>
            <li> WOW I cannot believe I waited so long to get such a quality pair of clippers.  </li>
            <li> Dog doesn&#x27;t mind for the first half-hour, but gets impatient for the next hour.  </li>
            <li> I have super thick hair and every set of clippers I had tried always got hung up after about a two inch swipe through my hair.</li>
            <li> Neither of us have super thick hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to go with these because as one reviewer mentioned, the Classic 76 was a bit big and heavy which made it difficult to cut your own hair, which is what I was planning on doing.</li>
            <li> decided it was time to get real professional clippers and went with these Oster due to the rave reviews.</li>
            <li> , I have thin hair and was having trouble with other clippers, this one worked the best, I did have to go over a few times but not a big thing,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many reviews complaining about how the trimmer heads are too tight or too loose, but I haven&#x27;t had any trouble.</li>
            <li> so until they get a clue, pony up the extra to make your BMW road worthy or buy 3 wahls and get used to slow haircuts.</li>
            <li> Through the years I went to other brands like Wahl and Andis, I must say that these clippers are right up there with other brands that you will get in the same line.  </li>
            <li> Next is going to be the black Oster Speed Line and blue Fast Feeds.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;ll be as sharp as new.  </li>
            <li> The cord is tough as rocks and securely fastened to the casing.</li>
            <li> The blade is adjustable and doesn&#x27;t slide out easily (which sometimes happens if you press hard on other machines).       </li>
            <li> I have burned through so many of the cheaper models and they turn dull after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I initially thought a breaker was blown or that the electrical receptacle was bad, so I tried a known good outlet.</li>
            <li> i can understand some of the negative feedback some people give on the adjustable arm being made of cheap plastic and could break, but if you are careful i don&#x27;t see that as a big deal.  </li>
            <li> The high quality plastic only gets slightly warmer.    </li>
            <li> Plus it has dual ( cord and cordless) power and can be used in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, thanks to several of the previous buyers for their valuable input!</li>
            <li> Received my Oster fast feed hair clippers today and I cut my sons hair in half the time!</li>
            <li> These clippers are as solid as a Kirby vacuum cleaner.</li>
            <li> I use it on thick hair and it plows right through.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it glides right through without a hiccup.  </li>
            <li> based on the reviews I decided to order one, I can tell you by experience this clipper is not sharp and powerful enough to cut hair in a home setting let alone for professionals, if you are a pro using this, you must be wasting so much time cutting and maintaining this piece of trash called Pro clipper..</li>
            <li> I like a high and tight cut...  </li>
            <li> these clippers are a fantastic finishing tool for fades, when in the right hands, they produce a sharp cutting finish.  </li>
            <li> These are great clippers do not get hotat all if cutting one persons hair still extremely cool if cutting multiple people compared to whal and andis.</li>
            <li> My normal barbershop is closed for several months because the owner has an unknown medical problem.</li>
            <li> At the shortest, it is capable of creating a clear beard line that still requires shaving with a blade on the lower part of my neck:  not a surprise or a serious problem, to my mind.      </li>
            <li> I used some cheap Oster clippers that did a decent job of cutting.  </li>
            <li> so I try to unscrew the blade to see if I can fix or clean the blade, but when putting it back the plastic body of the screw hole of the adjustable handle broken.</li>
            <li> Not bad for a guy who cuts his hair about every 7-10 days and used to cut his friends&#x27; hair to make a little extra money back in the poor high school/college days.</li>
            <li> This old clipper, while not very good, cut my hair far better than the expensive Oster being reviewed here.    </li>
            <li> The attachments from the previous unit still work on the new Oster.</li>
            <li> I typically replace after about a year, ordering new blades never seems to work for me.  </li>
            <li> First off, it&#x27;s ridiculous that they can&#x27;t even include a few more common guide combs</li>
            <li> I removed the guard to clean up the neckline and then used my scissors to trim behind the ears.</li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair(not much of it) and with the past clippers she had to make several passes.</li>
            <li> My last pair were Remington, they didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> : As long as you do the maintenance like cleaning properly and applying oil to the blades, you can assume it will last a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional barber, but I have 360 waves and wanted to start cutting my own hair to save money.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am not able to return the item again which I would certainly do.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a big deal if you&#x27;re used to the noise, but it did help settle my young boys down some to have a quieter clipper.</li>
            <li> I previously used two rechargeable models: the first, a Remington, \\&quot;Short Cut\\&quot; was awful; but I thought the second one, a Norelco QC5550, was great until it came apart in my hands.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because my son&#x27;s hair is SO thick, our other clipper could not cut it cleanly.  </li>
            <li> Bought this Oster Professional through Amazon, and it cuts just like the opening hair cutting scene in Full Metal Jacket: zip zip zip!</li>
            <li> As of two weeks ago I&#x27;ve had to hit it pretty hard with my hand for the blade to oscillate at the speed it needs to to cut hair...</li>
            <li> Also, this is pretty hard to move on a scalp without gouging chunks of skin.</li>
            <li> Since I have very little hair I recoiled at the idea of paying that much.  </li>
            <li> I have a rare medical condition which leads to an abnormal amount of body hair in sensitive regions if you know what I mean and this buzzer has done the job in a jiffy!!</li>
            <li> I had previously tried clippers in the $20 range and they were too cheap and dull, didn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> No more barber shop prices, pays for itself  fast</li>
            <li> For the 2 past two years it&#x27;s been very dependable.</li>
            <li> Truthfully I never really noticed it because I&#x27;m a cheap ass and only think about the money saved (approximately $1000 per year).  </li>
            <li> and I expect that it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to rate durability.</li>
            <li> You just pick one of the combs based on how long or short you want the hair to be, then run the clippers through the hair.  </li>
            <li> For the price I would buy it again depending on how long it ends up lasting.</li>
            <li> Truth is, if you take care of your clippers, they should last a long time.</li>
            <li> We will see how long they last.  </li>
            <li> It may be a good tool to have to blend lines, but for overall heavy duty cutting, this clipper is not going to cut it.</li>
            <li> I should have purchased these in the first place instead of slowly climbing the ladder of quality.</li>
            <li> After I got married and moved out, I slowly built a small-scale haircutting business on the side, with myFast Feed Clipper in hand.  </li>
            <li> set has dark spots on the red casing, scratch marks on the black \\&quot;Fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reluctant to spend a lot of money on a clipper set, but I&#x27;ve gotten really tired of the flimsy little cord that comes with most.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I have a cowlick on the top of my head towards the back that spirals my hair down, which became really difficult to cut because I would have to angle the clippers in the opposite direction of the hair&#x27;s growth.</li>
            <li> You can tell just by holding it that this will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> After purchasing numerous less expensive clippers over the years, I finally decided to take a chance on Oster and I have been nothing but pleased.</li>
            <li> I expected much better from this fairly expensive machine.    </li>
            <li> As for the headers that come with it i find them enough to do the stuff i want because you can adjust the machines cutting length as well. :)</li>
            <li> so did a slight modification with my Dremel to a comb I had for my old clipper</li>
            <li> I finally decided to try this one out and rationalized that at least I could make my money back on it and then save up a bit to buy the Classic 76 if need be.  </li>
            <li> Hair clippers were relatively quiet and cut the way I expected with all the essential accessories</li>
            <li> It only offers a few lengths.</li>
            <li> My oldest son has thick coarse hair and this was a big problem for his hair particularly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, our old and almost broken clipper cuts his hair much shorter than this one does.</li>
            <li> My only compliant is that that the blade width is just a little too wide which makes certain areas on my head (like behind my ears) harder to get at, but not impossible.  </li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick and has wrecked multiple cheaper brands of hair clippers in the past and this is the first pair of clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned that lasted longer than half a year.</li>
            <li> the old expensive one did the job right the 1st time.</li>
            <li> and they are not very loud.  </li>
            <li> This one will NOT cut wet hair, and it barely cuts dry hair.</li>
            <li> :) Only bad thing is that their is only 4 combs so it gives a short cut!</li>
            <li> The long cord is stiff, cumbersome and unnecessary for most in-home users.</li>
            <li> I am always a little surprised when I see a consumer product that&#x27;s still made in America.  </li>
            <li> It is a little loud when using it though.</li>
            <li> The Oster Pro 76023-510 Fast Feed hardly heats up at all compared with both the Andis and the Forfex by Babyliss.</li>
            <li> The Oster clippers have some heft to it (a little heavy), but it&#x27;s because of the higher quality material.</li>
            <li> This clipper is worth the price, and i will highly recommend for home cutting.</li>
            <li> If I had to guess the length of my hair at the time of cutting it, it was 1 1/2\\&quot; at the shortest but more probably 2\\&quot; long.</li>
            <li> I used to buy cheap clippers at WalMart, they&#x27;d do a mediocre job from the start and go downhill from there.  </li>
            <li> still working ok but lost its cutting edge to soon for me</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve repeatedly bought sets of cheap clippers that have failed.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s bald on top, so where his hair starts for some reason gets longer, or maybe just stays flatter, and I have a harder time cutting those hairs to the same length as the rest of his hair.  </li>
            <li> So now, I use these Osters for cutting only big patches of hair, or hair I&#x27;m holding with a comb, and I use my old Wahl to make the crisp cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but, it doesn&#x27;t take me a long time to clip my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heavy duty, professional model.   </li>
            <li> And when you turn it on, it just hums with no loud noise.</li>
            <li> Regardless of the hair, the operation takes twice as long with the Oster clippers.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Wahls for years and finally spent the extra money on these</li>
            <li> I thought that maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t as long as I thought, so I put on the 1\\&quot; comb.</li>
            <li> After careful thought and looking at countless reviews</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t a problem at all, especially with the minimal noise, vibration and unnoticeable</li>
            <li> AND DIDN&#x27;T WANT TO WASTE MY TIME OR MONEY ON A PROFESSIONAL BARBER</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m not a professional and can&#x27;t offer an informed comment on that use, my 5 star rating is for quality, price, and suitability in a home setting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bodybuilder, haven&#x27;t shaved my body in a long time.</li>
            <li> well...as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> LET ME START OFF BY SAYING THAT I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL BARBER.</li>
            <li> my apartment and the long cord is bothersome.  </li>
            <li> too heavy, loud noise too</li>
            <li> It paid for itself a long time ago.</li>
            <li> My uncle has had the Oster Professional clippers for a few years and wholeheartedly recommends them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as quiet as can be expected and even if it broke today I&#x27;d still get another one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional.</li>
            <li> is how long the blades will keep their edge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice long hairs sticking out</li>
            <li> I am not a professional</li>
            <li> This thing is built in the USA, heavy, old school in every way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy and not overly loud.</li>
            <li> I looked for a long time and read a lot of reviews before settling on this clipper</li>
            <li> like that the cord is long and gives plenty of flexibility to cut hair</li>
            <li> I expect this is the set I keep for a long time.</li>
            <li> The clippers do not clog or pull as long as you keep them oiled.  </li>
            <li> long.</li>
            <li> There is not much to say, take care of it and it will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> The first ones we got were broken and were not whisper quiet.</li>
            <li> Either I have some really thick hair or these clippers don&#x27;t feed as fast as Oster thinks they do.</li>
            <li> after first week the blades screws got loose I have to tight them everyday .</li>
            <li> The only disadvantage is that the clippers do not cut hair down as short as I would like it.  </li>
            <li> When I was researching clippers, I figured out what I was doing wrong in maintaining the previous clippers, and so I am even more amazed that a low-end pair of clippers, that were abused, held up for so long.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed with how quickly the motor blew, and the cut is nowhere near professional quality.  </li>
            <li> I have had many less expensive clippers that have lasted years.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve done this as much as I have, you know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> I was unhappy with their performance because they all left strips of hair that I would have to constantly go over and over again to get a clean cut.  </li>
            <li> Although it is not directly mentioned, these clippers are limited to the closeness it can cut - &amp;#34;000&amp;#34; 1/50 and after speaking to Oster the blade type (adjustable) can be replaced but can&#x27;t  be changed (0000 1/100 or 00000 1/125).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have those little hairs that need a second or third pass.</li>
            <li> However, I remember other reviewers having the same experience.  </li>
            <li> But they basically cut the same length as any other set of Wahl clippers that you can get a lot places.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a couple of times but it works exactly as I expected it to!</li>
            <li> I have had several other brands but none have compared to these.</li>
            <li> My son simply waits and then goes off as opposed to the other one where he was scared, cried and pulled away.</li>
            <li> We bought these earlier in the year to cut each other&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> , I have only had to replace the blade level due to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Along with my masters this clipper is a workhorse and might actually run a little cooler than the master clippers actually!</li>
            <li> This little red devil clipper taught me different though!</li>
            <li> hope they last like my other ones.  </li>
            <li> Not as quiet as other trimmers I have used.</li>
            <li> , the blades don&#x27;t quite get close enough compared to some other clippers, but that&#x27;s why I also use a precision trimmer for my neck and sideburns.  </li>
            <li> While I can use the lube for other things, I would really only ever use the 1/16 and 1/8\\&quot; combs since the clippers come with 1/4, 3/8, and 1/2\\</li>
            <li> Very quiet compared to other models.</li>
            <li> It feels very solid and well built (no rattling or anything like seen in some of the other clippers).</li>
            <li> It pays for itself in the long run!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little tricky cutting your own hair, even with a mirror.</li>
            <li> , I flushed enough money down the toilet on Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it very long</li>
            <li> FX690BX on the other hand was way too heavy as well as very loud.</li>
            <li> But I hope the beginner or first time buyer who&#x27;s a little doubtful about whether he can cut his own hair with this is feeling a little at ease.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very quiet and doesn&#x27;t sound like I&#x27;m running a lawnmower in the bathroom when I&#x27;m cutting my hair.  </li>
            <li> I wish the cord was longer, but that is my only complaint so far.</li>
            <li> use them for my personal cut and in the Coast Guard to cut my shipmates hair on the cutter.&lt;br /&gt;Where the andis is heavy, the oster is featherlight.&lt;br /&gt;Where the andis is rather loud, the oster is half that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My last clipper, the predecessor to this model, finally gave out after a number of years and heavy use.</li>
            <li> After the handle became looser over the last few months I finally decided to try and tighten the screw that holds the handle on the clipper.</li>
            <li> It takes twice as long for me to trim my head now these clippers are not powerful enough, paid 50</li>
            <li> A few days ago, I went to trim my hair for only the third time and it would not turn on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the highest (professional) type, but there&#x27;s no reason why these clippers shouldn&#x27;t last at least 5 years of home use.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair for a few years now.</li>
            <li> day I got pissed and decided to invest a few extra bucks in my next set.  </li>
            <li> The first time was a bit tough...</li>
            <li> This clipper doesn&#x27;t miss a single hair using any of the clips that come with it from 1/2\\</li>
            <li> Very little maintenance required so far.</li>
            <li> He has used Braun, Philips, and other well known shavers but since those are shavers not trimmers, the trimmer blade gets dull fast and starts to pull</li>
            <li> hair is VERY thick and consistently jammed &amp;#34;over-the-counter&amp;#34; clippers commonly found at most stores.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at 1st when they did not make as much noise cutting my hair but with each pass big hair balls would fall to the floor.</li>
            <li> My 3yr old son don&#x27;t cry no more</li>
            <li> Bought the Wahl Professional Mambo Combo before buying these, thinking I was buying a &amp;#34;Professional&amp;#34; set of clippers instead of the usual Walmart variety.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to be a stylist as long as your partner is not very picky</li>
            <li> These seem like they will hold up over time as long as I am careful.</li>
            <li> but I can already tell it&#x27;s much sturdier than the other brands I&#x27;ve been using to cut my son&#x27;s thick hair.</li>
            <li> Does extremely well in cutting doesn&#x27;t leave little hair ends unless you go super fast.</li>
            <li> Also, the lever that adjusts the blade tend to come loose.  </li>
            <li> Also, the on off switch feels flimsy and loose and that in time it could be an issue</li>
            <li> only negative comment, and it&#x27;s not worth deducting a star, is that it can be a little slippery, and because of it&#x27;s heft I think a fall to a tile floor could damage it, so just be aware of that and handle it</li>
            <li> But they always broke down and fell apart after several months of use.</li>
            <li> With the blade all the way down for the closest cut it doesn&#x27;t quite get close enough to the skin.  </li>
            <li> This review is way down the list chronologically</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like to shave regularly so he just clips his beard down once or twice a month</li>
            <li> I still need to use the Norelco to get it down to stubble, but it only takes about 60 seconds to do so.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised since they are high end industrial clippers and expensive so.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing I disliked about the cheap cits - the guides that you put on them were cheap flimsy plastic, and as such if you applied pressure when cutting your hair, you&#x27;d end up with weird ridges in your hair.</li>
            <li> You can easily carry on a conversation with the person cutting your hair.  </li>
            <li> Make cutting hair so easy.</li>
            <li> They are very quiet compared to my previous clippers bought at places like Walmart.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the adjustable blade is controlled by a lever that is of pretty low quality and that doesn&#x27;t set into place, so it&#x27;s difficult to tell what cut setting you are on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 1- May be not sure this will last longer than cheaper wahl clippers, I only had it for a week and used it twice</li>
            <li> For the past 3 years I have been cutting my own hair.  </li>
            <li> and they&#x27;d last me 6 or 7 months (sometimes less)</li>
            <li> his previous clippers (Remington and Wahl) NEVER last.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband last year as a Christmas gift and we&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times during the year, no more than 5 times I would say.</li>
            <li> The only additional item I would like from these clippers would be a slightly closer cut.</li>
            <li> The blade is sharp, quiet and doesn&#x27;t pull hairs out of my head like some other shaver&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The less crud in moving parts, the longer it&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li> They can cut through both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> And hey, even in the hands of a total newbie to cutting hair, not bad at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it didn&#x27;t slow down for the whole time I worked on it.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair, what little is left, for the past thirty (30) plus years.  </li>
            <li> so I was surprised it was generally unavailable for a few months in late 2013.</li>
            <li> After cutting his hair the first time, I had to go back over the same areas and trim again so that all of his hair was even.  </li>
            <li> However, if you want to stay as tight as possible with almost no noticeable hair, then this may not be the product for you.</li>
            <li> Further, with multiple passes it exhausted my small hand fast and doomed for mistakes.</li>
            <li> This is a very limited selection.</li>
            <li> i leave it at 1/4, maybe a little open with the lever, AND DOES THIS MACHINE BLEND.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair and my boy&#x27;s hair with this clipper and there was only a little bit of heat comparing to the scorching touch of the Andis Master.</li>
            <li> Little power, a blade adjustment that didn&#x27;t work properly...</li>
            <li> Requires taking hundreds of little bites at the job, then smoothing the result later.  </li>
            <li> This clipper can last you years and years, or even a lifetime, if you don&#x27;t smash the little thing on the floor.</li>
            <li> The blade guard is slightly rounded, causing no discomfort or irritation when doing the finishing touches (sideburns, nape of neck, etc) compared to the Wahls squared, harsh, almost sharp guard which frequently caused irritation and sometimes cuts.</li>
            <li> in our consumer society, people choose the cheapest thing available and companies pander to our desires by cutting costs.</li>
            <li> I like how quite and smooth cutting they are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for years and these blow any of the cheap sets you can buy at Walmart (Wahl) away.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it didnt come with a case and a variety of attachments in different sizes.  </li>
            <li> My old clipper, my son complained that it hurt when I cut his hair.  </li>
            <li> I would like to return it, but realize it&#x27;s far too late to do that.</li>
            <li> Have used these at least 10 times now, and wow.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> The attachments do NOT fit this model and I cant find any larger then 1/2 inch??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used countless Wahl brand clippers and a few Remingtons from walmart.</li>
            <li> My wife hated the old clippers but now actually seems to enjoy using the Oster clipper.  </li>
            <li> and they are not fast feed by any means.  </li>
            <li> (I used it on wet hair)</li>
            <li> However, as a detailer, it&#x27;s too wide to get around the ears.  </li>
            <li> These clippers work but not very well.  </li>
            <li> not much to say.  </li>
            <li> But after looking around I eventually decided that the big heavy duty units weren&#x27;t what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It never really worked that well</li>
            <li> Expected the speed to be faster than it was.</li>
            <li> I got this roughly 3 years ago</li>
            <li> It cuts through wet hair without any difficulty.  </li>
            <li> I have never abused them or been rough with them.</li>
            <li> It came faster than expected and even though the tracking system seemed wierd it came before estimated time.  </li>
            <li> The other time we actually shaved our cat after he had gotten in to some weird liquid outside, which was no small feat.</li>
            <li> This occurred after minimal pressure was placed on the arm to try and adjust the guard.  </li>
            <li> In that time, I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands.  </li>
            <li> All-in-all, I spent about $120.  </li>
            <li> It is red in color and rather heavy to the touch</li>
            <li> This is expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> The body is heavy, solid, and stable.</li>
            <li> Passing through my scalp was rough.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper based on a military mans review.</li>
            <li> The reality is that this machine is too slow for cutting hair and therefore the user would have to pass it through the same area more than once.  </li>
            <li> Have recovered the $$$$ spent on clippers already from the haircuts of two men.  </li>
            <li> Not really what I expected.</li>
            <li> but I must say that it was money well spent.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty cord and relatively quiet operation.</li>
            <li> These things could shave a wet yeti.</li>
            <li> We bought a kids size head shaver a few years back</li>
            <li> I am going to have to say this is money well spent.</li>
            <li> , so if you are thinking of using it abroad, you will need an extra (heavy) inverter.</li>
            <li> There is really no comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only comes with a few clipper sizes</li>
            <li> so we had to be careful with the detail work</li>
            <li> Big Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Oster, Wahl, Andis - really no complaints on any of these brands.</li>
            <li> Not much power..</li>
            <li> I have used it only a few times, I hope it lasts</li>
            <li> Some reviews said it could be used on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Everything was received and works as expected.  </li>
            <li> downside is that it only comes with a few guiding combs...</li>
            <li> , guide combs not very durable.</li>
            <li> It came in sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> It cuts my extra thick hair with such ease and silence</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s heavy enough to feel heavy duty, but not so heavy as to hinder cutting my own hair for half-an-hour.  </li>
            <li> The only downsides is that it might get a little warmer/louder than what I remember of the others I&#x27;ve used and without a guard, it doesn&#x27;t get quite as close as some of the other clippers.  </li>
            <li> Better than a few other pairs I&#x27;ve owned that were not designed for cutting.  </li>
            <li> plain and simply, it doesn&#x27;t cut well.  </li>
            <li> It is clearly not the typical battery powered discount store variety.</li>
            <li> It does come with a few different sizes as one other post mentioned.</li>
            <li> I usually have to go over the same spot on my head 2-3 times before I get all of the loose</li>
            <li> The color is a darker red than the photo, and feels a little small in the hand (I have big hands).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure he knew I was actually cutting his hair because the cut was so smooth and the blades cut straight through his thick hair.</li>
            <li> I would definately recommend for anyone who is serious about cutting their own hair.</li>
            <li> After I gave Discount Jungle a review of 3 stars (for sending the original dirty clippers), they called me and asked me to remove my review.</li>
            <li> Not much to add to what&#x27;s already been said in other reviews</li>
            <li> Instead it has only a few, and the extra combs cost $20 and shipping, usually</li>
            <li> These are my third or fourth set of clippers in the past few years.</li>
            <li> Finally I put on the 7/8\\&quot; comb and saw a little bit of results, but nothing like I expected from the previous reviews.    </li>
            <li> He had so much fun cutting my hair that when I woke up in the morning, he was looking down at me and said, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s time for your next haircut.&amp;#34;  I pointed out to him that he just cut my hair.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> They usually don&#x27;t last that long or struggle to cut thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Combs seem a little long</li>
            <li> I keep a very simple &amp;#34;buzz style&amp;#34; short hair cut, and bought this unit hoping for a better quality cut than the $20-$25 units - but I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It rusted a little, and finally got dull enough to notice.  </li>
            <li> It feels solid with very little vibration.</li>
            <li> And if you tend to move quickly while cutting you need to be careful that the plastic length attachment (or</li>
            <li> (relative to my limited and negative experiences).  </li>
            <li> They are sharp.  </li>
            <li> my son is part Puerto rican, I&#x27;m black, my brother in law is half white-half black all of us with different hair textures...</li>
            <li> No crisp cut with these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased in the past from big retail stores</li>
            <li> You must purchase the other attachments.  </li>
            <li> I checked other Internet retail sites and Amazon&#x27;s price (purchase plus shipping)</li>
            <li> Cut extremely well</li>
            <li> the money spent!</li>
            <li> It is so hot that it is uncomfortable against the skin.  </li>
            <li> He said it does not cut as close as other clippers</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sturdy and sharp, and they get the job done with ease.    </li>
            <li> which other clippers don&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Further, I have a small hand so handling</li>
            <li> I understand that this clipper is probably overkill for simple beard trimming and appreciate that it might fall slightly short for professional barbers cutting longer hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have my hair pulled like with the other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I always used \\&quot;Conair\\&quot; or some other Drug Store brand clippers that cost $10.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> (the other set lasted about two years).</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m looking for the other clipper but not Oster anymore.</li>
            <li> They are effect at home haircuts with the same if not better results.</li>
            <li> They also provide oil and recommend using it before each cut which the other brand did not even discuss.</li>
            <li> Have used other clippers and there&#x27;s no comparing the two.  </li>
            <li> Save yourself the time and the money, buy this quality Oster clipper first and you won&#x27;t be sorry.  </li>
            <li> It took me a while to make up my mind about this product comparing it with other brands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other clippers in this range, and they don&#x27;t compare at all.</li>
            <li> have used other Oster trimmers for years to trim our horses&#x27; manes and faces.</li>
            <li> There has been no pulling unlike other ones that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;outstanding and been using it every other night to shave my head.</li>
            <li> Wish I’d have purchased these first instead of messing around with 4 or 5 cheaper ones, Can not go wrong here</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t see any difference than other wahl clippers</li>
            <li> Besides doing my twice-weekly beard trim, I&#x27;ve cut a cheapskate friend&#x27;s extremely dense hair with it twice.  </li>
            <li> I was never able to get hair out of our last clippers.  </li>
            <li> I will concur with the other reviews I read....</li>
            <li> They are quieter and cooler than their Andis counterpart with only one small issue keeping them from being a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> I spent another £12 to buy transformer!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers state, it does NOT cut &amp;quot;very close&amp;quot; as the product description says.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband who refuses to be clean-shaven due to skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see a reason to order any other ones like some people</li>
            <li> The kit includes oil, various guides and a small brush.  </li>
            <li> Its sharp and does not pull hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need anything other than a 1/4&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Other than that I have no complaints to date.</li>
            <li> This was one of the deciding factors for me, since other comparable clippers I looked at videos for sounded like they were quite noisy by comparison.</li>
            <li> I paired them up with the Wahl Hero 5 Star trimmer and they compliment each other well.</li>
            <li> I was extremely dissapointed and Amazon has refunded the amount but not replied with regard to shipping costs to be refunded.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day---</li>
            <li> When they died we got these based on other reviews on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Took no time at all, and it cut the sides of his hair and the nape of his neck extremely well (4.5 stars).  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it gets hot and lacks the power to efficiently cut my dogs thicker hair.</li>
            <li> When I actually did, I got a weak hum - weaker than my $25 clippers I bought at the local store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the plus side, this clipper is quieter than any other that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Instruction do recommended other Oster cleaners/lube/disinfectant</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still working well without any issues, maintenance (other than oiling the blades) or sharpenings.</li>
            <li> maybe was an adjustment for those already used to some other clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He loves them and has used this same brand in the past.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a well-built device with some heft and a long, fairly heavy power cord.</li>
            <li> I posted a close up picture of my adjustment on the blades closed position.(4th picture down)</li>
            <li> , I noticed that the cut was VERY rough compared to the Andis.</li>
            <li> My one complaint, and it&#x27;s significant, is that when cutting my husband&#x27;s hair I had to go over areas twice before everything was the same length.  </li>
            <li> Its easy to poke someone with them, causing a painful scrape.</li>
            <li> It is possible to feed too fast... and it can pull if you do that... but that almost never happens as it&#x27;s cutting capacity is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 37 years old and when I started cutting my hair at 14 years old</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I expected the clippers to be heavy, it was lighter than I expected</li>
            <li> attachment, so I wasn&#x27;t missing anything with the limited accessories.  </li>
            <li> It is not powerful enough and cutting requires much over shaving.</li>
            <li> This set of Oster clippers feels like it&#x27;s slicing through thin air; I now cut my hair in about half the time it normally would take me.</li>
            <li> but if you have other lengths from a previous pair of osters or perhaps even other clippers they may work to clip onto these.</li>
            <li> I researched a lot of other clippers and settled on this set due to previous reviews, perceived quality, and price point.  </li>
            <li> I got through a cut in half the time due to a quicker hand because of the lightness(im used to the weight of the masters).</li>
            <li> I can be lazy with the Andi&#x27;s and use it every 2 weeks where the Fast Feed forces me to trim weekly, and i&#x27;m lazy!!</li>
            <li> If I had pick something bad about the clippers, it would be that the on/off switch feels cheap.</li>
            <li> The vibration and noise are average and it is not heavly.</li>
            <li> It was not worth my money.</li>
            <li> These clippers are not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> This only comes with a few small combs...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually one to never complain about something I bought, but this clipper is not good for normal hair.</li>
            <li> I thought this is what the average barber uses</li>
            <li> The only negative i&#x27;d say is the lever that opens and closes the blade seems flimsy...</li>
            <li> The only negative is that they don&#x27;t come with a Number 1 guard.  </li>
            <li> of the negative comments on here are atypical, I believe.  </li>
            <li> Also, the guides are somewhat long and can make it a bit difficult to do any beard/mustache trimming near your nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick that hair that grows in a lot of different directions.</li>
            <li> Haircuts are expensive, particularly for those of us not interested in getting styled.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a few attachments if you prefer a less than military appearance.  </li>
            <li> The negative reviews are typically from people that didn&#x27;t do proper research on the inherent limitations of the product or just happened to have received a faulty item</li>
            <li> I have thick, medium course hair and this clipper cuts wet or dry with no problem.  </li>
            <li> &quot; all the way down to the blending clip.  </li>
            <li> 5 minutes max to shave my head down to peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> The problem is that as I ran the clippers through my hair, my hair would just fall down and not get cut.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I just break down and deal with the problem this way a lot sooner?        </li>
            <li> I guess my options are reduced down to one: spend the $120 and get what I want.</li>
            <li> , the adjustable blade had sometime didn&#x27;t move up or down</li>
            <li> and it would go down again, would have to continue to turn it off and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these now for 6 months and they show no signs of slowing down.  </li>
            <li> You could use a voltage step down adapter I guess if you&#x27;re where the electrical system is 220 volt.</li>
            <li> Hands down</li>
            <li> Does not seem to cut down to the skin as well as</li>
            <li> Clippers bog down a lot.  </li>
            <li> it shows no sign of slowing down.</li>
            <li> He used it to shave down his bear with one of the shorter combs</li>
            <li> After 4 uses, it shut down and could not be revived.</li>
            <li> With the blades at 00 cut, I have not cut or nicked myself, and the blades glide right over my skin, cutting the air to about 1 days growth.</li>
            <li> My only complaint, and it&#x27;s a small one, is that the shortest setting is a little too long for me.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair at least once a week and with minor upkeep (brushing the hairs off and oiling every other use or so)</li>
            <li> &quot; we&#x27;re extremely oiled and there was little black dots all inside the box and on the clippers which I figured was hair, my husband agreed.</li>
            <li> However, if you are not a professional and only have one pair of clippers, you will probably be disappointed, especially if you keep your hair very short.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer was a real P.O.S. and was very poorly made.</li>
            <li> Works fine cutting my son&#x27;s and husband&#x27;s thick wiry hair.  </li>
            <li> the past 12 months I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair and that of 4 boys on a regular basis, it has performed very well so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave a few haircuts every now and then using other people&#x27;s clippers.  </li>
            <li> minor gripe I do have with these is that the adjustable lever tends to lower itself while cutting, so it needs to be pushed back up constantly.</li>
            <li> Very sharp.</li>
            <li> I have very thick beard hair which is difficult to cut and my cheap trimmers just weren&#x27;t doing the job</li>
            <li> I went a little crazy and bought two of these, two of the Limited Edition Chrome ones, and I just bought the Oster Topaz Fast Feeds...</li>
            <li> This model is less robust than its predecessor, but then again, we probably won&#x27;t be using it for the animals as well.</li>
            <li> I selected the Oster 76023-510 to be compatible with the previous unit.</li>
            <li> I bought the correct attachments and the one I use, #2, split in half after 3 to 4 uses.</li>
            <li> had purchased the plastic black spring loaded comb set for the oster</li>
            <li> By purchasing it here, I paid$40 less that retail.  </li>
            <li> , it is quieter and vibrates less</li>
            <li> none the less.</li>
            <li> using the previous model.</li>
            <li> The variety is essential and the spring clips are serious.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trimming my hair and beard to 1/8 inch for almost 20 years and a pair of clippers typically lasts ~ 2years.</li>
            <li> Down-side is that it has less attachments if you want a longer length than 1/2&amp;#34; cut.</li>
            <li> speedline- black with gold blade</li>
            <li> black with black blade</li>
            <li> Will definantly buy the 76s for interchagable blade system less guards to use.</li>
            <li> Compared to my previous $30 Wahl clipper</li>
            <li> I previously had the oster mini</li>
            <li> No comparison to the $14 no-name set previously used.  </li>
            <li> The attachments have an odd angle compared to my replaced clippers.  </li>
            <li> The 0 blade can be adjusted up to 000 I believe, which is just a slightly longer, rougher looking 0.</li>
            <li> They are an improvement over the target bought Wahl clippers I previously owned.  </li>
            <li> None the less</li>
            <li> It took me about an hour and a half to cut my hair with this thing.</li>
            <li> It now takes less than half the time with no pulls-smooth cut.  </li>
            <li> The clippers have an adjustable gate on the blades for a slightly less than shaved look.  </li>
            <li> It makes less noise than my Norelco trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It is slightly noisier than the cheapo things</li>
            <li> My wife Jean, who could care less about the quality of a tool, raved about this Clipper in comparison to the Costco bought Conair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent, but not great!</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the guards they come with have very sharp points!</li>
            <li> The pivoting lever on the adjustable blade has a small plastic piece that moves the blade back and forth and is poorly made as it broke on me for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> Strangely it broke while I was not even moving it: in the middle of a haircut when I paused for a second it just fell apart, leaving the clippers useless!</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that the on/off switch was really stiff.</li>
            <li> For the past 2 years I have been giving my husband his military haircut.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the angle of the blade was a bit awkward</li>
            <li> The problem with the cheapoes is the cord would always mess up on them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always spent like $30 on clippers, and usually get 12-24 months out of set.</li>
            <li> The blade will get hot after extended use, so if you need to use them with the guard off at some point, I would advise doing so before a lengthy cutting session if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As most reviewers don&#x27;t mention facial hair cutting ability you will not be unhappy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I use these for precision blending, fading out to higher levels of cutting.</li>
            <li> The cord is thick and long, so you probably will pack it in a drawer every time if you like to keep your counters neat.</li>
            <li> I finally got tired of paying other people to cut my hair.</li>
            <li> Wish they made one half the size as this as it is a little clunky on beards.</li>
            <li> I had Wahl clippers previous to this for home haircuts and they usually got dull after several months.</li>
            <li> Blending (tapering/fading ) are a little bit easier with a slight touch than the masters.</li>
            <li> These immediately bogged down and stalled.  </li>
            <li> When it broke down to the point of being unusable, I knew I wanted something heavy duty.</li>
            <li> After 3-4 uses the blade would not stay tight and just kept coming off</li>
            <li> He has very thick fur with a soft undercoat that stymied all the clippers I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li> The switch is a little tight, but it won&#x27;t accidentally turn off.</li>
            <li> While they were adequate, they would often pull my sons&#x27; hair and it was painful for them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Including shipping, I paid over $60 (sold by DiscountsJungle)for a product that worked less than a few weeks and cut my hair twice.</li>
            <li> The only negative, and it&#x27;s a small one</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they are heavy!</li>
            <li> My old Wahl Sucks compared to this one!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this model for about four years because I became tired of the wally world type clippers for $20 that would break down in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> This little gem is made in the USA and the quality is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Stands up to lots of little boy haircuts.</li>
            <li> This little clipper has a pivot motor.  </li>
            <li> I have been barbering for a little over six years now</li>
            <li> I was little concerned about the combs as I didn&#x27;t see a 1/8&amp;#34; comb listed.  </li>
            <li> Since there are a number of little parts, you&#x27;ll want to designate a box or bag to contain all the goodies.  </li>
            <li> in all, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, there are other options out there that are lower priced and work just as well if not better.</li>
            <li> It needed so little maintenance and just a couple of drops of oil each year or so.</li>
            <li> I can only say that i am disgusted, bought also an accumulator to change power from 2.2 to 1.1 and still burned the clipper, was happy only for 5 minutes:(</li>
            <li> With other clippers I always was annoyed how I would have stray long hairs after buzzing.</li>
            <li> It seems like it is having a lot of trouble cutting super thick hair</li>
            <li> Yes, a little heavy,</li>
            <li> A LITTLE ON THE HEAVY SIDE.</li>
            <li> The fast load attachments are an advantage and do speed up the hair cutting process.  </li>
            <li> I dont think a fast feed would make it through a day of cutting 15 +</li>
            <li> (http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/05/30/get-rich-with-the-universal-mens-grooming-device/)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to start cutting my own hair after having had yet another disappointing haircut by a barber.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a bit of hairy guy (guilty), it can clear your chest hair off in a minute, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also noised and heavy.</li>
            <li> Heavy.</li>
            <li> Plus, it does not trim the sideburns all that well, missing some hairs - so I have to go over it with a shaver.</li>
            <li> They do not fit.  </li>
            <li> Heavy duty and powers through hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time trying to save money on clippers.</li>
            <li> For now, I would still recommend it but not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> so they are heavy</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do any helping to my tired hand or to my son&#x27;s fragile skin.</li>
            <li> When your family is poor you don&#x27;t get proper haircuts.</li>
            <li> every few years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> As a bald man, I have gone through a few clippers.</li>
            <li> I used the product for personal use, maybe 6 times and the adjustable clipper attachment was so poorly made it no longer adjusts.  </li>
            <li> ...sadly, wasted money...</li>
            <li> The benefits of a pivot motor is that its a lot quieter, and can cut wet and thick hair with ease.</li>
            <li> With this clipper and a few attachments I now cut my hair about every 2 or 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Tried a few until I bought this one...</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few months now at home</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a few years now.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy trimmer with lots of vibration.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers because I was tired of paying for a haircut when all I do is cut it short at one length.  </li>
            <li> Not too heavy, not light.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> if you want you can buy a thin hair blade as a extra, oster is a brand to stick with for me</li>
            <li> I was tired of wasting time and money going back n forth to the barber</li>
            <li> We had a  Conair clipper a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> Pays for itself in a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;Great for maintaining a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> heavy duty.</li>
            <li> those were really a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Just cuts it smoothly - no fuss, no skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is quite heavy and not ergonomically designed for the face.</li>
            <li> Battery kept got noticeably weaker with every charge, now completely dead and cannot be revived.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I got a few yrs.</li>
            <li> out of them but had I known about these I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted money or uneven hair cuts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but dang near.  </li>
            <li> Wanted to wait a few cuts before my review.</li>
            <li> Then it gets noisy and has an annoying buzzing sound.</li>
            <li> i rate it it at its quality and heavy duty hair clippers....</li>
            <li> A bit heavy</li>
            <li> This clipper is heavy duty and cuts with confidence.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> The unit itself is heavy and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> it took us a few minutes to figure that out.</li>
            <li> Paid for itself with a few uses.</li>
            <li> The clippers are heavy duty, which is a plus, but the weight is noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this Oster Prof 76023 for my college aged son after he complained that his roommate&#x27;s cordless clipper had no power and took \\&quot;forever\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I cut my hair without a plastic guard and have had no problems with cuts from the blades that a few reviewers report.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my dead Oster clippers that I suppose my family purchased years ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy</li>
            <li> A few drops of oil on the blades before i use them and brush them off when done.  </li>
            <li> The attachments are thin without being flimsy, so you don&#x27;t have to go over the same place over and over.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally I can do my hair cut in few minutes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been to a barber in 12+ years with the exception of a few weddings, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;Updated: I have also started using this to shave my face when I don&#x27;t shave for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Pays for itself in just a few uses, depending on your dog and groomer fees.</li>
            <li> It should pay for itself in a few months.</li>
            <li> The adjustment lever is firm and stays where you put it.  </li>
            <li> We have been using Costco purchased clipper sets for a few years.  </li>
            <li> - even had a few people ask where I get my hair done,</li>
            <li> Before getting these I would buy the Wal-Mart specials (approximately one every six months) and finally got fed up when my cheapos died in Afghanistan...</li>
            <li> they cut very slow and they&#x27;re very weak , I like the wahl senior because they cut very fast</li>
            <li> The blades are powerful, and I have no problem cutting the hair behind my ears like the other cheaper clippers.</li>
            <li> a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers cut well, but not better than a set you can buy from WalMart for half the price.  </li>
            <li> Get the Topaz it&#x27;s color black!</li>
            <li> I got fed up with clippers from the drugstore than were loud, vibrated like a particularly vigorous sex toy, did a lousy cutting job, and broke after a year or two.  </li>
            <li> I spent a little over a week on-line looking at hair cutting tools and finally whittled it down to this one.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair that I shave ever other week, and this clipper goes through like butter.</li>
            <li> I shaved off about 4&amp;#34; of thick hair like it was nothing, while still keeping sharp control over tapers and fading.</li>
            <li> quite, however its not a strong machine, but</li>
            <li> Even if you use all the attachments, it&#x27;s not easy to get an even cut with this.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not super thick or thin, but this thing works efficiently and quietly.</li>
            <li> Cuts through hair easily, no pull.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair with these clippers since high school.</li>
            <li> All the bad reviews for this product is probably because they didn&#x27;t take care of them on a CONSISTENT basis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a barber, but the adjustable blade feature on this makes it unnecessary to clip on a guide for a buzz-cut about 1/8 inch long.</li>
            <li> Heavy and quiet and solid grip as well as serious cutting power...</li>
            <li> and they always complained about my other clippers pinching them and pulling their hair!  </li>
            <li> The Oster on the other hand is a serious machine.  </li>
            <li> I basically keep the hair I have at a very tight crop, practically bald but not quite.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it just isn&#x27;t heavy duty enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Puerto-Rican and have insanely thick hair.</li>
            <li> I finally got tired of being let down by barbers in my area running behind and butchering my hair</li>
            <li> In this capacity, it leaves very little to be desired, though.  </li>
            <li> Had very little power.</li>
            <li> Upon arrival, we both noticed it was a little slow</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say anything bad about these, they are performing so well.</li>
            <li> My husband had used Oster in the past, (we still had all of the guides)</li>
            <li> It is clumsy to use with the heavy cord.</li>
            <li> I now cut friends hair and its unbelievable</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I have been cutting mine and my son&#x27;s hair for a long time, but after seven years of cutting his hair, I was tired of him fighting me every step of the way with cheap clippers.  </li>
            <li> So....over the course of the past 15 years...I&#x27;ve continued tradition.</li>
            <li> So I started cutting it all off with an old trimmer my Dad gave to me.</li>
            <li> I chose 4 stars because I have in the past used Oster products</li>
            <li> These are by far the smoothest cutting clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned as an &amp;#34;around the house&amp;#34; barber.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these in past and have worn it out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to keep it, however.    </li>
            <li> now so I&#x27;m not sure how durable it is</li>
            <li> , you dont know how awful they are until you get something better.  </li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s used it alot so far cutting the boys&#x27; hair when needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used drug-store Wahl clippers in the past, and they&#x27;ve worked well... until they don&#x27;t, which is after a couple of years.  </li>
            <li> However, the last Wahl clipper I bought did not hold up well and became useless within a year.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it will hold up longer than the Wahl clippers I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> my husband and I always worried we&#x27;d spawn the missing link!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my family&#x27;s hair for nearly 20 years, using $20 Conair and Wahl clippers from Walmart.  </li>
            <li> What should take 10 minutes usually takes 30-40 because I have to go over and over my head to catch all the hairs this clipper misses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t buy it earlier.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the $20 clippers at the store, and they were never able to cut my hair.  </li>
            <li> No more trips to the groomer.</li>
            <li> No more $13 trips to the barber shop and waiting to get a chair.  </li>
            <li> She was sure she would do a terrible job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how these guides relate to the numbers Roy used to cut my hair.</li>
            <li> In the past I have ran through problems with other clippers that leave a lot of patches of hair behind, however with these clippers I have yet to come across any patch problems.      </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy also.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that these clippers have a very heavy duty cord.</li>
            <li> These cut through my hair so well with no snagging or pulling at all and very few passes are needed.  </li>
            <li> Very heavy duty cord</li>
            <li> About 5 years ago we tried to replace our previous Oster with some other $20 brand (not going to name any names) because it would periodically stop working if you tipped it the wrong way.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get new blades for those inexpensive</li>
            <li> but it was slow and they grabbed hair the whole time making it painful.  </li>
            <li> Plastic guides are useless, they collect hair in the far tooth and bog worse.  </li>
            <li> I started losing my hair towards the end of high school wasn&#x27;t going to be one of those guys who picks a bad hairstyle to try and \\&quot;disguise\\</li>
            <li> I tried cutting with both dry hair and wet hair with the same disappointing results.</li>
            <li> where in general the clippers don&#x27;t get unless you brush the clogged hair out for every 6 or so inches of hair cutting.  </li>
            <li> However, It&#x27;s really disappointed me and much below its reputation.</li>
            <li> The ceramic teeth of the Andis 24145 Speed Master 2 felt a bit sticky and the plastic clip ons were too soft and flimsy making them a poor guide causing uneven cutting.</li>
            <li> Very upset and disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t specifically say this one is not suitable.  </li>
            <li> These clippers are a little weak.</li>
            <li> Cost was $54.00 and since we had been paying $55 at the new groomers for a bad cut</li>
            <li> After cutting my hair, usually within about 3 days my hair has grown back in.</li>
            <li> - Clips that come with this clipper are sharp and will hurt you if the person cutting your hair isn&#x27;t careful!</li>
            <li> This decreased cut time by half.</li>
            <li> Two weeks after receiving it the adjustable handle broke which made the whole clipper loose and useless.&lt;br /&gt;The nightmare continues with the return and all the run around which in the end leaves me feeling very unhappy!</li>
            <li> I bought clippers with limited length and 10 useless attachments.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair by myself every week for almost 20 years now and this is quite inferior to my two previous Wahl (firt broke after a very hard fall and the second one is at my mother&#x27;s house for when I go visit during the holidays).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s had to learn how to hold the thing, how to not press too hard against my scalp, or go too light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this item due to it&#x27;s fragility and average cutting ability.</li>
            <li> Have a hard time zeroing the blade.</li>
            <li> No matter how hard you try to zero gap these clippers</li>
            <li> They are dull.</li>
            <li> You need to order them separately and they can be hard to find on Amazon sometimes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> so, no matter how hard you push on your head, the attachments will never pop off.  </li>
            <li> It could of came with a hard box to store this product.</li>
            <li> Thin, or course dark hair!  </li>
            <li> My son comes over to get his haircuts as well, and he has very thick heavy hair.</li>
            <li> No catching hairs, or grabbing of skin.</li>
            <li> THERE IS NOTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT THIS CLIPPER.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big and bulky and by the time I&#x27;m done cutting my hair</li>
            <li> It was to late to return the device.    </li>
            <li> if you buy this and fancy having hair longer than 1/2 inch, you&#x27;re going to have to pay the sucker tax of $20 for the 1&amp;#34; and 1 1/4&amp;#34; combs</li>
            <li> With proper care I have never had pulling or problems cutting.</li>
            <li> Hair cutting was such a chore until I purchased these.  </li>
            <li> I Just tried cutting my hair with this Oster clipper again, and for the last time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with a beard and a low-tolerance for shoddy tools.  </li>
            <li> A silent hair cutting monster.  </li>
            <li> The cutting blade in the blade assembly is too coarse and does not cut as close as its predecessor but does have plenty of power for thick hair.</li>
            <li> The Wahl clippers were heavier and uncomfortable in my hand, the cord was thin and much shorter in length, the guards were flimsy and though Wahl included a case, it was difficult to stuff everything inside.</li>
            <li> I used walmart brand whal clippers, and two proffesional clippers for at least 7+ years.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is with the guides that allow you to set the length at which you cut your hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  used them for at least 15 years.</li>
            <li> Clipper is quiet while cutting hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;And, again, I will change or delete my review if my experience is common.  </li>
            <li> People seemed to complaint about the noise-</li>
            <li> It was painfully slow in cutting my hair, requiring over 30 passes over each individual segment.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by these now, and she wouldn&#x27;t dream of going back to cutting our boys&#x27; hair with scissors.  </li>
            <li> idea was for my wife to cut my hair at least until my barber reopens his shop.  </li>
            <li> I also use it to cut my on-again off-again beard and that sucker is thick, so</li>
            <li> It will take a couple passes to trim a thick beard.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and this trimmer goes through it effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cut thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick hair and this cut like a gem.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and the blares of the others</li>
            <li> I have fairly thick hair</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t go slow, these clippers will either bog or miss some hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> It hums and shreds my thick hair with ease.</li>
            <li> I have dense, thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair and these things mow it down no problem; almost like the blades are disappointed there&#x27;s no challenge.  </li>
            <li> So, if you want to get closer cut/shave reach out to previous customers and my comments so you don&#x27;t make the same mistake I have made &amp; be disappointed.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m a little disappointed on how fragile the guards are.</li>
            <li> Buy this over other clippers you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> 2- it does a bad job shaving your face, I used wahl clippers to shave my face as quick shave, but it seems oster is very bad with short hair clipping.     </li>
            <li> I am not a professional but have been cutting my husbands hair for about 10 years now.  </li>
            <li> Serious and pro...</li>
            <li> i have a serious beard,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I think it would take some serious abuse to break these.</li>
            <li> The only cons I have about these bad boys</li>
            <li> but I burned it out (stupidly) plugging it directly into the wall in Argentina.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably not a fair thing to do.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re losing your hair or just like it short, eventually you&#x27;ll get sick of going to the barber and realize you can just do this at home.</li>
            <li> Blades are sharp, but not so close/sharp that you need worry about cutting yourself.  </li>
            <li> someone recommended this to me as a quiet for the sound-sensitive kids, but i was fairly disappointed as it is louder than the $30 dollar wahl (which i was trying to replace).  </li>
            <li> posted my 1st review with 4 stars as I assumed, by past experience, that the cutters would be like all my others and would be uncomfortable when used on edge.</li>
            <li> Bought the Oster several months ago based on the reviews and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> It tends to just &amp;#34;run over&amp;#34; the hair and press it down instead of cutting it.  </li>
            <li> They are very hard to put on and take off.</li>
            <li> THEY ALWAYS BREAK DOWN ONCE THE WARRANTY ENDS!!!!    </li>
            <li> Previously to purchasing this product, I used cheaper clippers that would prolong cutting of my hair via missed hairs and pulling of my hair.  </li>
            <li> It powered through my hair, which was about half an inch before cutting it.</li>
            <li> The oiling step is very commonly over-looked.</li>
            <li> One of my sons has very thick hair</li>
            <li> My boys have very thick hair</li>
            <li> This clipper cuts very slow.</li>
            <li> (you have to move it through the hair very slowly</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, and this thing cuts it effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that you can hear the clipper cutting those little hairs when you are smoothing the hair cut out.</li>
            <li> Kept on stopping while I was cutting the little hair that I have.</li>
            <li> but it is impossible due to the unbearable heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But in this range you can do a lot worse.  </li>
            <li> but they were total crap.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not really happy with the spring loaded attachments.  </li>
            <li> My youngest son is autistic and it is always a challenge cutting his hair.</li>
            <li> I ran it through my hair, but there was no sound of cutting.</li>
            <li> two of them have broken inside of a year.  </li>
            <li> Growing up our family was somewhat poor.</li>
            <li> This was not working well and seems to be broken before use.</li>
            <li> It is frustrating and I will never go with this brand again.</li>
            <li> But I found this to be actually worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve dropped it a couple of times and it isn&#x27;t worse for wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I realized the lever was broken.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was tired of the poor quality of the Wahl motors, with them burning out after once a week use for six months.</li>
            <li> However I havnt ever broken one.</li>
            <li> The dog eventually tired of it</li>
            <li> This clipper came with a few cutting guides, some lube, and a cleaning brush.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I was tired of single-purpose beard trimmers that pinch and nick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using clippers for approximately 25 years.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see, but I&#x27;m not impressed with how it cuts thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and it doesn&#x27;t miss anything.  </li>
            <li> very god machine.terrible repeat terrible electrical cord.</li>
            <li> I had come to the conclusion that I was tired and frustrated over the time spent waiting on a haircut at barber shops and also the rising prices[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve always been crazy noisy, and not very effective.  </li>
            <li> Still, very little cutting.</li>
            <li> Product comes with small amount of oil and 4 cutting lengths.</li>
            <li> Not good and Not happy !!!!!!</li>
            <li> The Oster Pro had no problem cutting through the hair and didn&#x27;t leave any gaps; a problem that has plagued the lower end consumer models that I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I mean can you at least not scrimp so bad that it defeats the purpose of the product?  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am now out of the window to return the item and have no choice but to keep the broken item.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have thin hair</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my husband&#x27;s course, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have real thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The Wahl, Conair, and Philips sets always had trouble cutting the hair behind my ears, and I always worry about them giving out on me while I&#x27;m cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> There was always a point in using that other one where I was afraid it would stop before I was done with my head, and that would have been very lame.</li>
            <li> Not only the heat and time, what made it worse was the terrible vibration.</li>
            <li> but I was left very disappointed in the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t keep charging them all the time, the battery gets very weak and they do not work well,</li>
            <li> If you are using (or tired of using) box-stores&#x27; brands, this is the one for you!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> It also has a very annoying whine/tone that irritates me when its next to my ear.</li>
            <li> I have yet to cut my hair wrong with these clippers.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this item at all!</li>
            <li> I oil the blades without fail, I also oil between guide changes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The second was terrible, I got them at a wherehouse store for $25.  </li>
            <li> We took it apart and tested all the connections and the switch and could not find any thing wrong.  </li>
            <li> I believe you cannot go wrong with buying an Oster.</li>
            <li> However, some people (like me) with difficult hair, will not like it.    </li>
            <li> nothing wrong with them</li>
            <li> Now there is nothing to hold the blade in position and the clippers are useless.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unlikely to buy again.</li>
            <li> I learned the expensive way.</li>
            <li> in this case, i&#x27;d say oster is doing the wrong thing.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s sometimes difficult to get an even cut.  </li>
            <li> It seems a tad expensive.</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical before buying.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Another problem for me is that it&#x27;s sometimes difficult to get hair to feed into the comb so it can be cut.  </li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s, been cutting my hair for over twenty years.</li>
            <li> Cutting my son&#x27;s hair no longer feels like a stressful chore.</li>
            <li> Then he started cutting my hair with them.  </li>
            <li> I can even listen to the radio while cutting my hair with no problem.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t like to cut through dirty hair or hair with any product already in it.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that the clipper worked at all on our dog since the medium priced Oster animal shaver I bought was useless.     </li>
            <li> Cutting hair with these is a breeze.</li>
            <li> Then after about a year, the blade would start to rust and would not be even, then it would start cutting my neck.  </li>
            <li> Have been cutting hair at home for 20 yrs.</li>
            <li> The distance between the cutting blades and the metal comb attached to the clipper is adjustable with a lever.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>

            <li> Disappointment after disappointment after disappointment.</li>
            <li> I am not a barber, but that doesn&#x27;t stop me from cutting my son&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> for cutting hair with the guides, it works&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> I had been using a cheaper Whal hair cutting system.  </li>
            <li> I saw another review where the guy said if you arent cutting hair for the marines, you don&#x27;t need the 76, which made some sense to me.  </li>
            <li> and it is consistently cutting hair well.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get stuck during cutting.</li>
            <li> I took it out of the box oiled up the cutting surfaces and went to town with no complaints.</li>
            <li> I have used it for about 2 months, cutting 3 heads of hair every 2 to 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> My dad has a pair for cutting his 3 dogs hair as well and enjoys them.</li>
            <li> is it even cutting \\&quot;</li>

            <li> I ended up taking the combs off and tried cutting without them.  </li>

            <li> I noticed when I started cutting my kids hair</li>
            <li> WTF!?</li>
            <li> mad</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>

            <li> I won&#x27;t say anything bad about the crome pro because it was durable and did cut well all these years</li>
            <li> My bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like writting bad reviews but this clipper overheated and the motor went out as I was finishing my haircut.</li>
            <li> Hopefully they stop sending out their bad products.</li>
            <li> Badly.</li>
            <li> i know when clipper is bad when it keeps getting stuck on my hair</li>
            <li> so I invested in these bad boys.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t have been so bad</li>
            <li> (I must have missed that in the description - my bad I guess.)  </li>
            <li> The noise isn&#x27;t bad at all - it&#x27;s noisier using the plastic combs, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> BAD IDEA.</li>
            <li> I am so sick of going to the barber shop and &amp;#34;John&amp;#34; not being there...</li>
            <li> And when I do, rarely am I disappointed in the quality.  </li>
            <li> I must say I am disappointed with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> your situation sounds like what I dealt with all my life, then pick these up, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite disappointed with this clipper:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another annoying thing I have come across with these brands is they have always pulled my hair and at times would grab at my skin.</li>
            <li> The attachments are crap...  </li>
            <li> I hate to say it</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s alot louder--especially with the guards on--to the point that it&#x27;s annoying to use...</li>
            <li> This hair cutting effort was the worst experience I&#x27;ve had with this clipper yet.</li>
            <li> the one thing I hate about amazon is there after a month no return policy.</li>
            <li> My son hated it.</li>
            <li> He hated getting his hair cut.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Feeling very disappointed and ripped off.</li>
            <li> evil ones, depends on how you look at it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cord on this thing is AWFUL!  </li>
            <li> The worst is after 1 and a 1/2 year of using once every two month</li>
            <li> I was Wrong !!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works as expected. No complaints.</li>
            <li> As described, excellent clipper for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this Clipper, have no issues with this been a year now since i have it and it works great.</li>
            <li> Very pleased!! Did a great job on my husbands hair !!</li>
            <li> I did research before I purchased my clipper and I thought this is a excellent. However, It&#x27;s really disappointed me and much below its reputation. I bought this clipper and had to return it next day. After one hair cut, it became really hot and hurt skin when touched. It is also noised and heavy. Instead, I went to a store and bought a cheap clipper, only $16. That worked better.</li>
            <li> Quiet effective.  Combs seem a little long</li>
            <li> The clippers did a great job when I cut my husband&#x27;s hair.  They are sharp.  I enjoy the adjustable blade and also the attachments that came with it.  Oster is the brand my husband preferred.</li>
            <li> After several cheapo clippers, I was ready to throw in the towel. But I bought these, and love em! It feels like quality, (steel, not plastic!) and cuts fast and smooth. I actually kinda enjoy haircut time now! :)</li>
            <li> The best clipper I bought</li>
            <li> If you are willing to pay $150 you can get a pro quality product which this is not. But in this range you can do a lot worse.  I imagine it will last some time since a cut my hair once per week. If you used it one hour per day I imagine it would burn out in a years time. The vibration and noise are average and it is not heavly. You could use it for a pet but I don&#x27;t.  I took one off for quality</li>
            <li> Fast and New. Thank you!</li>
            <li> 5th set of clippers in 17 years!  I have tried many kinds and brands and this is my favorite so far!! Sturdy, professional build and very quiet! Cuts very well!</li>
            <li> Solid, high-quality, great product. I had another one but I burned it out (stupidly) plugging it directly into the wall in Argentina. Had I not done that, I&#x27;d still have the old one, which was also Oster and which I had been using for easily 10 years. They make great stuff.</li>
            <li> This model is less robust than its predecessor, but then again, we probably won&#x27;t be using it for the animals as well.</li>
            <li> I have cut my own hair for 20 years and this is the first good pair of clipper I have owned. What was I thinking these are what the pros use and they are amazing.</li>
            <li> These clippers are GREAT!!! LOVE IT!!! Used it on ANY texture hair....my son is part Puerto rican, I&#x27;m black, my brother in law is half white-half black all of us with different hair textures...worked magnificently. WELL worth the price</li>
            <li> Cuts better than any other clippers we have own. Wife&#x27;s, been cutting my hair for over twenty years. A lot better than Wahl. Great product.</li>
            <li> For the past 7+ years, I&#x27;ve been using Walmart-bought Wahl clippers to cut my own hair and my dad&#x27;s hair. I bought these fast feed clippers because I thought they would do a better job on my hair where I basically cut all the top with a #6 and the side with a #4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, they don&#x27;t do any better than the Wahl. For one thing, when I received the clippers, the blade was not adjusted evenly. Second, even with the blade adjusted so it&#x27;s as close to the edge as possible, it&#x27;s still not close enough. This means when you want to make a crisp cut, you&#x27;re out of luck. I don&#x27;t know if this is just on mine or if they all are like this. But on my Wahl, I can adjust the blade much further, and together with that blade lever thing, I can get the blade very close and do a nice crisp block cut. No crisp cut with these. So now, I use these Osters for cutting only big patches of hair, or hair I&#x27;m holding with a comb, and I use my old Wahl to make the crisp cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But frankly, these fast feed clippers do not do the job better than the Wahl did, or if they do, it&#x27;s very marginal. It was not worth my money. And for made in the USA, I expected better quality.</li>
            <li> based on the reviews I decided to order one, I can tell you by experience this clipper is not sharp and powerful enough to cut hair in a home setting let alone for professionals, if you are a pro using this, you must be wasting so much time cutting and maintaining this piece of trash called Pro clipper..it leaves many hair behind it took me 40 min to shave my head completely with it as I had to pass again and again on the same spot, I ordered the 20 something bucks  wahl pro and it took me 10 minutes to do the same job, fast feed is low quality piece of trash, stay away and don&#x27;t believe the hype.</li>
            <li> Its quite and smooth. Does extremely well in cutting doesn&#x27;t leave little hair ends unless you go super fast. Feels like a solid piece of engineering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for about 16 years now. Clippers usually last between 1-3 years. Used a ton of different brand names. This one is different. Heavy. Quiet. I don&#x27;t have those little hairs that need a second or third pass. Perfect for my needs. The only thing is there is no case. So what?!? Get a canvas bag! An old shoe box will be fine</li>
            <li> professional clipper works very well for me</li>
            <li> Whisper quiet, but the angle you need to hold them to cut is not as user friendly as cheaper clippers I have owned.  Nevertheless, they are great at cutting.</li>
            <li> Recommended tripper! It is quiet and powerful. In addition, the adjustable blades make the hair-cutting to be easier. Another great product from Oster</li>
            <li> I was replacing an Oster Professional Clipper that I had purchased in 1986. The original Oster operated flawlessly for 27 years. Finally it was time for a new unit. I selected the Oster 76023-510 to be compatible with the previous unit. The attachments from the previous unit still work on the new Oster. The new Oster power cord is considerably better quality and is less likely to twist. I am hoping for another 26 years from the new unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Oster from DiscountsJungle. The unit was ordered at 4:48pm on Thursday, June 13th with an anticipated delivery between Wednesday, June 19th and Monday, June 24th. The Oster unit was delivered from DiscountsJungle on Saturday, June 15th. Outstanding customer service! The product was exactly what I ordered and came days before I expected. DiscountsJungle far exceeded my expectations for service.</li>
            <li> My husband went to use it for the first time - died within 15 minutes.  We couldn&#x27;t figure out what happened.  However, I remember other reviewers having the same experience.  I guess you can say we bought a lemon.  Ended up returning and looking for a different brand name.</li>
            <li> Last year I upgraded to this clipper and I have found the difference from my old Remington to be profound! This is so much more solidly built and the motor and speed of the clipping is so much higher. However as a bonus it is also quieter than my old clippers, giving off just a minor humm. I have a feeling that this pair of clippers will last me for years to come.</li>
            <li> I bought this Oster Clipper a couple years ago. So far no problems. I am very satisfied with it with one exception, the cord. The cord is is too stiff, it definitely needs to be more flexible like SO cord used on power tools. If you decide to buy this unit, buy the Oster Plastic Comb Assortment, Part No. 76926-800. Don&#x27;t bother buying the Universal Combs that Oster makes. Made In USA.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace a set up Vidal Sasson clippers.  I had my son&#x27;s head buzz-cut in 10 minutes, as opposed to 30 minutes with the old clippers.  My husband had used Oster in the past, (we still had all of the guides) so we knew it was a good brand, and the price at Amazon was great.</li>
            <li> I am always a little surprised when I see a consumer product that&#x27;s still made in America.  And when I do, rarely am I disappointed in the quality.  This little gem is made in the USA and the quality is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave my head to a close crop (000) and then let it grow out for 3 or 4 weeks.  So I need a clipper that can manage a full head quickly.I&#x27;ve used a number of the $25 and under clippers over the years.  They&#x27;ve always been crazy noisy, and not very effective.  I usually end up having to repeatedly go over my head to make sure all the stray hairs are clipped. Not any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to spend a little more on my next pair of clippers and got the Oster Fast Feed.  It is quite quiet, very solid, very fast, and very thorough.  I can go at a moderate pace and every hair gets clipped, so I don&#x27;t have to make my scalp sore with repeated passes.  I am 100% pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to any person looking for a top quality consumer grade clipper.</li>
            <li> I must say I am disappointed with this trimmer.  It is very noisy with a strange vibration.  I have used Oster trimmers before and the vibration is definitely unusual. Plus, it does not trim the sideburns all that well, missing some hairs - so I have to go over it with a shaver.</li>
            <li> My really cheap but GREAT old trimmer from Best Buy died after about 25 years of service. This Oster Pro was my quick choice to replace that old gem. Well, so far, so good. It really feels like quality and worked well on the first beard trim. A small (efficient) bag or box would have been nice, just to keep it all together in the closet.... but, oh well.</li>
            <li> This clipper is affordable and easy to use. The guides it comes with are all you really need. I wish the cord was longer, but that is my only complaint so far.</li>
            <li> My wife has cut my hair for years. We had a pair of clippers that were purchased from a local box store. We thought those were good clippers until we used the Oster clippers. The difference is measurable in the cut and comfort.</li>
            <li> Cuts great, very fast, feels heavy duty.  I cut my hair every two weeks and expect this clipper to last 20 + years.  Much better than my previous Andis clipper at the same price.  The only downside is that it comes with only three guard sizes; 1/4\\&quot;, 1/8\\&quot;. and a blending shear-(close to a 1/16\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> My only problem is that the comb... thing... can be crooked. Easily fixed but a problem for people like me that take the hair one step from bald.    Other than that, a good clipper. Made quick work of my super curly hair. I have not, and probably will not, used the comb clip on things.</li>
            <li> I bought this Oster Fast Feed clipper and the 10 piece Oster universal attachments that was recommended by Amazon. The attachments do NOT fit this model and I cant find any larger then 1/2 inch?? WTF!? I want to cut my hair 3/4 or 1 inch in the winter. Ive looked at Amazon after I got the ones that dont fit and all over the web for larger and have found nothing. I bought clippers with limited length and 10 useless attachments. Im sure the clippers are great if you want your hair 1/2\\&quot; or shorter, but I dont. I feel totally ripped off after spending [...]+ with shipping.</li>
            <li> For the past 2 years I have been giving my husband his military haircut.  I started out well and I continued to improve my skill over the years.  I used various techniques to make his hair look at its best and I did not expect it to be any better with a better or more expensive clipper.  My old Wahl clipper was falling apart and it had never been the best of qualities, so I decided to get a new set.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item and I now love to give my husband a haircut.  All of the techniques that I used before to make him look better seem to me now like an effort to disguise the lack of a good clipper.&lt;br /&gt;I use this clipper without issues, I am faster, the cut is more precise and it looks better than ever.  He looks like after a trip to the barber and all that I changed was the clipper.&lt;br /&gt;This clipper was the best thing that happened to me in my history of being my husbands personal barber.&lt;br /&gt;I love to use it and the only wish that it leaves open is the following:&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make my husbands hair grow faster to make me use it more often....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really don&#x27;t need to spend $10 at a barber every week when you got one of these... and it therefore pays for itself in less than 2 months.</li>
            <li> I have many cheaper Wahl clippers over the years, and this is by far the best.  I still have to go over my head more than once, but it is much sharper than the Wahl units.  It&#x27;s far heavier duty, cord included.  I just wish it had more attachments with it.  You&#x27;d think for the price, they could add a few more.  Oh well, I just wear my hair that much shorter now.  If you cut your own hair or your kids&#x27; hair, then I would by far recommend this over any other unit on the market.  Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.  Wish I would have had it sooner.  Much sooner.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very good and cut hair easily.  The fast load attachments are an advantage and do speed up the hair cutting process.  The only disadvantage is that the clippers do not cut hair down as short as I would like it.  After cutting my hair, usually within about 3 days my hair has grown back in.</li>
            <li> The separate attachments that are listed with the Oster Pro 76023-510 will not work.  They do not fit.  These clip to the back of the clipper and the Oster Pro&#x27;s attachments clip or slide into the sides of the clipper&#x27;s head.  It is clumsy to use with the heavy cord. I was not that happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10/22/2013:  I bought the correct attachments and the one I use, #2, split in half after 3 to 4 uses.</li>
            <li> These clippers are the best I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  They cut through hair fast and effortlessly and are relatively quiet considerng it&#x27;s powerful motor.  Cheap hair clippers I&#x27;ve purchased in the past from big retail stores ended up in the trash after maybe 10 haircuts despite taking care of them after every cut.  The issues were usually sudden loud motor sound, grabbing and pulling of hair even when new, or simply not having the power necessary to clip the hair despite slow feeding through hair.  None of those problems plague these clippers.  Be sure to brush and oil your blades with clipper oil after every use to ensure long blade life.  Don&#x27;t blame the clippers for failing if you you&#x27;re not taking care of them properly.</li>
            <li> The Oster 76023-510 Clipper is a solid product for personal use.  It&#x27;s built solid.  Yes, a little heavy, but, it doesn&#x27;t take me a long time to clip my hair.  The product comes with 4 different length blades.  For the price, you really should buy it and try it.  I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> I bought this for personal grooming and it was worth every penny. It&#x27;s a heavy duty, professional model.   Never again will I buy that cheap garbage sold at grocery and pharmacy stores. Those models all stop working after a while and can&#x27;t take much abuse. Also, I&#x27;ve taken some apart and it&#x27;s mind blowing how low quality their internals are. The Oster on the other hand is a serious machine.  If you&#x27;re looking for a personal or family groomer, get this over any of the consumer grade models you might otherwise buy. It&#x27;s worth the extra money for the quality. You get what you pay for with groomers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hair clippers for over 10 years now. I&#x27;ve used countless Wahl brand clippers and a few Remingtons from walmart. But they always broke down and fell apart after several months of use. Another annoying thing I have come across with these brands is they have always pulled my hair and at times would grab at my skin. Also, they tended to be loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently became fed up with this, and decided to check the internet for reviews on different models, even proffessional models. This is where I came across The Oster Fast Feed for about $55.00 This feels like a professional model. It feels strong and sturdy, and is small and lighter to handel. And when you turn it on, it just hums with no loud noise. I used it and it was VERY VERY SMOOTH. No catching hairs, or grabbing of skin. And just a VERY CLEAN SMOOTH CUT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the ten years of using clippers, I never came across one like this. I have already recomended it to many family members and friends. Me Gusta! Me Gusta!</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my sons&#x27; hair for 18 years and my own hair for many more.  I have been through 4 different electric clippers.  The original clippers were Sears branded and I still use them to this day for daily beard trimming.  I purchased these Oster Fast Feed Clippers believing I was stepping up to something more professional.  I have been working with, or perhaps I should say against, these clippers for several months. They just do not perform as well as the garden variety Wahl Clippers available at WalMart.  One of my sons has very thick hair the other is much finer.  Regardless of the hair, the operation takes twice as long with the Oster clippers.  I can&#x27;t figure out how these clippers can go through the hair and cut virtually nothing while consuming twice as much electricity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers come with a couple combs but nothing else.  You must purchase the other attachments.  The comb set cost around 25 dollars.  The combs are great quality but the bottom line is this product is a waste of money. Keep buying the cheepie Wahls and you will be ahead.  The Oster performance is hype. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me say that the experience of making a purchase on Amazon.com was both pleasant and easy. I had come to the conclusion that I was tired and frustrated over the time spent waiting on a haircut at barber shops and also the rising prices[[ASIN:B001JJBC9Y Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper with Adjustable Blade]]. I know a couple of friends who cut their own hair, so I started to research which would be the best clippers for a beginner to buy. After deciding to go with the Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper with Adjustable Blade, I found that by far, Amazon.com offered the best price for them and still with full manfacturer&#x27;s warranty. My first haircut with them (performed by my wife), rivals any cut I had ever gotten from a barber shop.....for FREE. I rate them as a very good buy.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, works great.</li>
            <li> Nice product overall, cuts hair very well. Noise level of clipper increases with attachments installed.</li>
            <li> BACKGROUND: My standard haircut is a \\&quot;0\\&quot; (zero) everywhere.  I owned an inexpensive clipper that was very noisy and didn&#x27;t cut well.  The clipper became so unpleasant to use that 1) I couldn&#x27;t recruit family members to cut my hair so 2) I was spending $15 for cuts at the local barber.    RESEARCH: I used the ratings and reviews on Amazon for research.  I chose this Oster clipper because it had consistently good reviews and a reasonable price.  I checked other Internet retail sites and Amazon&#x27;s price (purchase plus shipping) was the lowest.    RESULTS: Quiet hum.  Cut extremely well (relative to my limited and negative experiences).  In four weeks, recouped $30 by not going to the barber.  My wife hated the old clippers but now actually seems to enjoy using the Oster clipper.  I&#x27;m a happy and satisfied Oster and Amazon customer.</li>
            <li> Quiet, cuts well and quickly, doesn&#x27;t jam up like my old one.    The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it, is that it doesn&#x27;t cut short enough.  I&#x27;ve always shaved my head with no guard, and my last one was able to cut and leave just a very short rough stubble.  This one, even though you can adjust it shorter with no guards, leaves too long of a stubble/shadow on my head so it looks like I already have 3 or 4 days of growth when it&#x27;s a fresh cut.  Now I have to cut my hair twice a week instead of just once.  Not something that I enjoy taking the time to do.    Next time I&#x27;ll pay attention to the description of the shortest length, and buy a model that cuts shorter than this one.</li>
            <li> Great product. Heavy duty and powers through hair. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quite noisy though. So keep that in mind if it is an issue.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wahls for years and finally spent the extra money on these and I don&#x27;t think I will be going back anytime soon. Worth the money spent! Only drawback is no case for stoarage and the attachments are not that great. (Reason for the 4 v 5 rating) I did buy the attachments that are sold separately and they are amazing!</li>
            <li> I ordered the oster pro 76023-510 fast feed clippers to replace failing wahl clippers that I have used for 12+ years.  They do not seem as powerful and pulled my sons hair so many times that I said if it pulls one more time I will send them back.  They did not pull anymore that hair cut so I figured I would give them another chance.  As for their quietness....  they are quieter to the operator but not to the one getting the hair cut.  they are rather loud once they are against you head.  they just have a nice hum to the one cutting.  They did come with height adapters but they are cheap and maybe part of the reason for the pulling.  they don&#x27;t seem to slide well and scratch your head.  To sum it up the clippers do feel professional as their name suggests but they do not cut professional.  and they are not fast feed by any means.  they can&#x27;t go half as fast as my old clippers.  I will keep trying them because I don&#x27;t want to have to go through a return process, I hope there is just some sort of learning curve with a new pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> Very good.  No more barber shop prices, pays for itself  fast</li>
            <li> This product came with a cleaning brush, a tube of lubricating oil and hair size guide/combs. up to 1/2 inch. I like my hair longer so would have liked a comb for 1 inch. I guess they want me to pay $5 more for a simple piece of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skills weren&#x27;t great with it the first time. i still successfully trimmed my hair (a little too short in some places) the first time around. (I used it on wet hair) I was getting people saying the haircut looks nice even though I could tell (because I scrutinized) that I screwed up. Maybe I just have nice friends(or evil ones, depends on how you look at it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so I went and did a touch up job on my hair a week later. I found myself much more dexterous with the took and more confident in my and the clipper&#x27;s abilities. I know probably not the kind of review most of you expect. But I hope the beginner or first time buyer who&#x27;s a little doubtful about whether he can cut his own hair with this is feeling a little at ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on May 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair clipper is still going strong! for about a year now, this is being used for two haircuts a month! Also do occasional body grooming with it and clean and oil it back up. This is the best $38 I have ever spent! I don&#x27;t even recall how I snagged such a great price on this!</li>
            <li> Just what we wanted, something light, quiet and quick for our 3 year old&#x27;s hair.  Would recommend.  Could use some longer combs, for the top, but that is easy enough to purchase separately.</li>
            <li> We used a cheap Wahl clipper for years and didn&#x27;t take very good care of it.  It rusted a little, and finally got dull enough to notice.  We used it about 20 times a year.  I thought it might be time to buy a nicer clipper, and I got this one because it received good reviews and is not as large as the other Oster clipper.  It worked okay, but not as well as our Wahl.  We have two complaints.  First, it gets very hot, very fast.  It is so hot that it is uncomfortable against the skin.  Second, it doesn&#x27;t seem to do as good a job at clipping hair, it seemed to miss more, and I don&#x27;t think it was due to its narrower path when compared to our previous clipper.  We almost always used it with an attachment, and the attachments don&#x27;t line up precisely with the guard teeth of the clipper, so that they block some of the slots in which hair can enter to be cut.  We&#x27;ve since purchased another inexpensive Wahl clipper, and it works much better.  The Wahl is cooler, and it doesn&#x27;t miss as much hair.  The blades of the Wahl attachment combs line up with the metal cutter guard so that they don&#x27;t cover slots where hair can enter.</li>
            <li> Great for cutting hair just like the professionals</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with attachment kit several months ago.  One thing you can&#x27;t really tell by the picture is that it&#x27;s very heavy and hard to maneuver even for most guys.  It seems to be best suited for basic use, like giving someone a buzz cut.  However, as a detailer, it&#x27;s too wide to get around the ears.  Also, the combs don&#x27;t do a very good job.  Even if you use all the attachments, it&#x27;s not easy to get an even cut with this.  If I could make another purchase, I would most likely go with the classic trimmer.</li>
            <li> Owned an andis masters clipper before these for roughly 2.5 years, and i thought i loved those, and i&#x27;d never find something better. But it looks like ive changed my heart toward them.&lt;br /&gt;I use them for my personal cut and in the Coast Guard to cut my shipmates hair on the cutter.&lt;br /&gt;Where the andis is heavy, the oster is featherlight.&lt;br /&gt;Where the andis is rather loud, the oster is half that.&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the box, my heart dropped as the plastic feel, and stiff adjustable lever came to light. In compared to the andis&#x27;s polished metal feel, and silky smooth adjuster lever, the oster feel more like a toy than a tool.&lt;br /&gt;But the thing is soooo darn light!! I got through a cut in half the time due to a quicker hand because of the lightness(im used to the weight of the masters). I feel the andis fits the hand better, but the sheer weight takes away from it slightly. The weight of these makes them very maneuverable, and quick.&lt;br /&gt;If i were using the masters, all day, every day, i&#x27;d probably get used to the weight.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the plastic body, these do not heat up as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite things about the andis was the purple clip-on comb set which made for a quick change in sizes.&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased the plastic black spring loaded comb set for the oster but they were total crap. I tried the old trusty purple magnetic set and sure enough, they fit!!!!&lt;br /&gt;When it comes down to it, the Masters are a more refined clipper, but the longevity of the andis was a deal breaker. I can say i got every penny out of them and more, but its time to move on.&lt;br /&gt;Best thing of all, they are made in the USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers</li>
            <li> Obviously quality. I have only owned one other $11 cheap set of clippers.  My reviews are consisent with others, only thing to point out, I have a very short haircut and have to keep the neck area well trimmed.  These clippers cannot get to the extremely low setting that some others can, thus, you will need this to cut the hair, and another device to trim your neck, sideburns, etc.  Just keep that in mind when factoring in your total cost of having to buy another trimmer.</li>
            <li> Much quieter than the older model I had.  This also gives a better, neater, more even cut.  Glad I broke the old one.</li>
            <li> I ordered these clippers because I thought they would provide a tighter cut without any attachment. But they basically cut the same length as any other set of Wahl clippers that you can get a lot places. However, these appear to be superior in several ways. They are quieter, cut really well and never get clogged, and (despite what others have claimed) they do not get hot. It comes with a sufficient number of attachments but the tiny brush leaves a bit to be desired. And they don&#x27;t come with any sort of carrying case which is a drawback.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a couple of times but it works exactly as I expected it to! Nice and quiet too.</li>
            <li> The clippers work great but I&#x27;m not really happy with the spring loaded attachments.  They are very hard to put on and take off. It feels like they bend and may be damaged doing so</li>
            <li> These clippers were a gift for my husband.  He says he likes the weight of them.  They fit well in his hand and are comfortable to hold.  They do a good job for the price.  He uses it without the attachments, and it gives him a nice, close cut.  Overall good value!</li>
            <li> Very powerful and strong motor. Blades will cut through anything! Never had a problem so far in the two years that I&#x27;ve owned it and I have to say that Oster is the best brand for hair trimmers!</li>
            <li> After purchasing numerous less expensive clippers over the years, I finally decided to take a chance on Oster and I have been nothing but pleased. These clippers have a far superior construction, run much quieter, and cut far more smoothly than the Conair, Wahl, and Remington products that I have struggled with in the past. I now remember that, as a youngster, my father always used a set of Oster clippers to cut our hair and he never had to buy a replacement set! I am not ashamed to admit that sometimes \\&quot;father knows best\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> When I realized I was going bald, I knew that I needed to start cutting my own hair.  I looked high and low for a reasonably priced clipper and finally found this one on Amazon.  By purchasing it here, I paid$40 less that retail.  The cool thing is that every  time I cut my own hair, I realize that I am saving $15. I was getting my hair cut twice a month, so I am saving $30 every month.  The clipper has already paid for itself.  The only cons of cutting your own hair is cleaning up the mess, but I will gladly do that to save the cash.</li>
            <li> Ok many people will buy clippers and use them to just do a simple cut. Nothing special , just to trim a bit of the top and a little bit here. Now i&#x27;ve been going to a barber for many years, and I get a Taper hair cut which runs about 17 bucks. I bought this machine, AND YES WITH TIME AND PRACTICE ( AND A COUPLE OF MISTAKES !!!! ) iam now doing the exact same thing my barber was doing. This Oster Fast feed is amazing. for example on the back of my head. I do 1/16, than a 1/8, towards the middle i leave it at 1/4, maybe a little open with the lever, AND DOES THIS MACHINE BLEND. it leaves a perfect taper. Same goes for the side. now to outline thats a different story n u need a different machine ( andis t outline).... Iam amazed how well this machine blends. I now cut friends hair and its unbelievable the results this machine gives off. Its a money saver. The best part is that when u get a hair cut , after a week and a half, it stars to fade out, or get a little messy. With the oster fast feeds u are always FRESH. I bought it becasue my barber had the oster 76 classic, which u raelly dont need because that is basicly the same as the fast feed, except u can cut more times a day. I dont think a fast feed would make it through a day of cutting 15 + plus customers a day. ( it is basically only to tape up/ fade/ blend) but since iam the only one using it i use it for everything. The motor is great, runs smooth n quite, however its not a strong machine, but i think this is great because thats what allow to blend... GREAT PRODUCT YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I have been cutting mine and my son&#x27;s hair for a long time, but after seven years of cutting his hair, I was tired of him fighting me every step of the way with cheap clippers.  I can say without hesitation that these clippers worked like a charm.  They cut very smoothly; there is no pulling and they are not very loud.  For the first time in seven years of cutting his hair, he sat there very easily and and let me cut his hair without complaining.  Finally, the clippers are very sturdy and of a high quality.</li>
            <li> I purchased this clipper for my husband.  He said it does not cut as close as other clippers he&#x27;s used.  It&#x27;s decent, but not great!</li>
            <li> Bought clipper because i love to cut hair!! My old Wahl Sucks compared to this one!! I would recommend this to anyone. Leaves a clean cut! Cuts right thru the hair! there is no need to be going over it again! I am really satisfied with y purchase! :) Only bad thing is that their is only 4 combs so it gives a short cut!</li>
            <li> Previously to purchasing this product, I used cheaper clippers that would prolong cutting of my hair via missed hairs and pulling of my hair.  This clipper doesn&#x27;t miss a single hair using any of the clips that come with it from 1/2\\&quot; all the way down to the blending clip.  In other words, it has a nice fluid cutting action and also is very quiet compared to most clippers while doing so.    Pros:  - Cuts through hair easily  - Very quiet compared to most clippers    Con:  - Clips that come with this clipper are sharp and will hurt you if the person cutting your hair isn&#x27;t careful!</li>
            <li> I tried the clippers on myself before using them on my sons. I was really impressed with how quickly they cut and how quiet the motor was. My youngest son is autistic and it is always a challenge cutting his hair. I was able to get him to sit through the whole process without getting up because I was able to cut his hair in half the time and the noise level was so much lower. He wasn&#x27;t nearly as frightened. I&#x27;m not sure he knew I was actually cutting his hair because the cut was so smooth and the blades cut straight through his thick hair. Cutting my son&#x27;s hair no longer feels like a stressful chore. That was the biggest test for me and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this clipper. I have the Andis Master and the magnetic guards fit both machines. This is a great clipper. Well worth the $$$$.</li>
            <li> These clippers are not worth the price.  These clippers work but not very well.  My wife cuts my hair and she has to go over and over and over again.  I use to have a cheap Conair clipper and they worked better than these.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. He gets an even close, cut whenever he uses it, which is once or twice a week (his hair grows fast). It doesn&#x27;t come with attachments (just guards) I guess because the blade is adjustable, but I&#x27;d recommend buying additional attachments for more variety.</li>
            <li> Broke immediately, think it was just this pair.  bought silver ones instead</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this trimmer. It has a certain heft to it unlike many trimmers which feel like cheap plastic. It powered through my hair, which was about half an inch before cutting it. A lot of people complain about the lack of different guides, however, I have no need for anything besides a 1/4 inch guide.     I&#x27;ve only used it once so I can&#x27;t speak for its longevity, but it feels like a quality product and I expect that it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This thing is great, barber-quality. There is not much to say, take care of it and it will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the weight of the Clipper and even the power cord,  as I was used to the much lower priced and lighter hair clippers.  It is a very powerful Clipper and cuts very cleanly.  I did purchase the complete set of combs and like their  positive locking action unlike the ones that came with the Clipper.  The Clipper does not come with a case.  The 4 combs that come with the Clipper are just snap on plastic.  I can not fault the Clipper but I think it is somewhat over priced.</li>
            <li> Seem to work really well. I had a cheapy Wahl clipper (one of the made in China ones) and I kept getting lines were I would cut too deep and places that I would miss. With this one, that is no longer a problem. No complaints, faster, better haircuts and it&#x27;s made in the USA. Well worth the higher price over the Chinese made ones.</li>
            <li> These clippers work well. They&#x27;re sturdy and sharp, and they get the job done with ease.    If you are a person who keeps his/her short, you could be saving a lot of money on haircuts, plus you can keep touched up / neat more easily than going back to the barber.    I only regret not getting them sooner. Think of all the money I could have saved!</li>
            <li> After buying el cheapo clippers over the years I finally treated myself to this moderately priced clipper.  What a difference!  These work really great.</li>
            <li> not much to say.  they cut hair.  no jams, no pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;solid on/off switch...which other clippers don&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wish clippers would come with a more flexible cord, which none seem to do.</li>
            <li> Much quieter than the Wahl. Works well. Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to rate durability.</li>
            <li> These are the best clippers I have owned. I have had several other brands but none have compared to these. They cut very nice without pulling your hair.</li>
            <li> If you are using (or tired of using) box-stores&#x27; brands, this is the one for you! I have been cutting my hair over ten years and this is simply the best quality clipper I have ever used. I love it since the day I got it. The price is only slightly higher, but the quality is beyond the value. It is well-made, sturdy, quiet, small, and most of all, easy to cut hair. It does get a little bit warm (not hot) after 20 minutes of use, but I believe it is nothing to be alarmed about. I highly recommend this clipper. You won&#x27;t regret it. Made in USA!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair clipper thinking I was moving up in quality. I bought a Wahl hair clipper in 1973, used it almost 20 yrs. with no problem. It needed sharpening, but I bought another Wahl hair clipper instead. That one lasted approx. 18 yrs. with no problems. THEN! I bought this Oster hair clipper, and the 2nd time I used it, the spacer kept jumping off and then broke. I put another spacer on and it kept jumping off. NOT GOOD!I contacted them and did not get any help.</li>
            <li> These clippers are great.  I use the 1/4 inch guard with the blade at its shortest position (equal to a \\&quot;#2\\&quot;) for my head and no guard with the blade at its longest position for my beard/scruff.  Works like a charm and they feel and sound sturdy and heavy duty, unlike the pieces of junk that you buy for $20 at the store around Christmas time.  FYI, I still use one of the \\&quot;pieces of junk\\&quot; to trim up my hair line over my ears and around my neck.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair for years. I have owned all kinds of cheap department store clippers. These Oster clippers are in a class of their own. They are extremely powerful and cut great. You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This clipper works good, I would have liked it to cut a little shorter, but all in all a good clipper.  Very quiet and light, and I like the longer power cord.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re losing your hair or just like it short, eventually you&#x27;ll get sick of going to the barber and realize you can just do this at home. Think about it - at $10 bucks a cut, a good clipper is paid off in less than a year.     I looked around at clippers and figured I would only be buying this once and would buy the best. I had a cheap wall that died on me years ago. But after looking around I eventually decided that the big heavy duty units weren&#x27;t what I wanted. I&#x27;m glad I got this unit. Doing your own hair, lighter is better. This clipper cuts great, it will last my lifetime no doubt. I also use it to cut my on-again off-again beard and that sucker is thick, so no doubt it will do your hair too.    I wish it came with a velcro cord wrap on the cord but I rigged that on my own. Otherwise, love it.</li>
            <li> Simply put it works great, a very professional feel and cut. Can&#x27;t expect anything better, quiet and strong sounding , great choice on my part</li>
            <li> Was just saving money up for the Masters. These are good (once zero gapped) but not great.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers they are perfect for tapering and even fading i would recommend these clippers to anyone! Great Buy</li>
            <li> What can I say?  Fast, quiet and accurate.  I use it on the lowest setting and without guides.  5 minutes max to shave my head down to peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> These are great for someone just starting out. They cut nicely. I have saved a ton of money now by cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the clippers for a couple months, but they work wonderfully. The last Oster clipper owned, I had for 15 years. This one appears to be built the same way and I expect many years of service.</li>
            <li> Cant complain these clippers are the best I have had thus far. No nipping the skin nice and smooth cutting. A little warm after long term use but still ok..</li>
            <li> Like most people, I spent weeks researching hair clippers before deciding to buy this. I was going back and forth between these clippers and the Oster Classic 76. I decided to go with these because as one reviewer mentioned, the Classic 76 was a bit big and heavy which made it difficult to cut your own hair, which is what I was planning on doing. I received the clippers and the 10-piece recommended comb set and ran to the bathroom to get to work. I put on the 1 1/4\\&quot; comb and got to work. I ran it through my hair, but there was no sound of cutting. I thought that maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t as long as I thought, so I put on the 1\\&quot; comb. Still, very little cutting. Finally I put on the 7/8\\&quot; comb and saw a little bit of results, but nothing like I expected from the previous reviews.    I&#x27;ve concluded that the reason for the poor results it that my hair is very fine. Don&#x27;t confuse this with thinning hair. Mine is the kind that if there&#x27;s no hair gel in it, it flops around in the slightest breeze. If I had to guess the length of my hair at the time of cutting it, it was 1 1/2\\&quot; at the shortest but more probably 2\\&quot; long. The problem is that as I ran the clippers through my hair, my hair would just fall down and not get cut. I tried cutting with both dry hair and wet hair with the same disappointing results. Additionally, I have a cowlick on the top of my head towards the back that spirals my hair down, which became really difficult to cut because I would have to angle the clippers in the opposite direction of the hair&#x27;s growth. You can imagine the sight as I tried to steer the clippers using a mirror to see.    These clippers do seem well made, and they probably cut most hair very well, but they did not work well with my hair. I don&#x27;t know if the Classic 76 can do a better job, but if you have fine hair, you might be better off paying for a real haircut.</li>
            <li> Unit is tough, and works perfectly. I used it to trim my beard and shave my head. My son comes over to get his haircuts as well, and he has very thick heavy hair. This was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Got this for hubby. He loves it. He cuts his own hair in half the time with these clippers than with the ones he used before. We are definitely satisfied. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This does not work on poodles. Don&#x27;t waste your time trying to save money on clippers. Just go get the real things (cost around $300)</li>
            <li> Not sure yet, I need more time,but I think that this product is excellent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this clipper to replace the old magnetic clipper I got over thirty years ago from Sears. This Fast Feed clipper, with its pivot motor, is much quieter.  It does a great job of cutting hair.  I purchased the 10-piece comb set, and kept the tapered \\&quot;left ear\\&quot; and \\&quot;right ear\\&quot; combs from the Sears clipper.  Both kinds of combs fit this clipper perfectly.  I also adjusted this clipper to trim closer to the skin on my neckline.  It was easy: just a couple of minutes with a screwdriver.  The clipper comes with a little tube of oil, but I&#x27;ve found 3-in-1 oil works just fine.</li>
            <li> So smooth on the hair during cut.  So much better than anything Costco has on sale for nearly the same price.</li>
            <li> Had a wahl, can&#x27;t recall which model that I used for several years.  It never really worked that well, it would grab instead of cut cleanly at times and I would have to unscrew the blades, clean/lightly sand and oil them frequently.  I finally threw it away and bought this oster, which so far is much better.  When I first used it seemed less powerful than the wahl, it is quieter and vibrates less but it cuts much more cleanly.  Haven&#x27;t had it very long but so far it has worked well.  It would be nice if it came with a few more guide combs.</li>
            <li> For about $60 I would think its a great deal, I think there is better product out there but I&#x27;m sure it will cost alot more. For now, I would still recommend it but not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair with these clippers since high school. Twenty years and countless drops later I have buy another. I&#x27;m beyond pleased to see that these clippers are still available. Stick with what you know. I wouldn&#x27;t consider switching clippers. These clippers are durable and give me the perfect cut every time. I&#x27;ve replaced the blades once, about 10 years ago. Not bad for a guy who cuts his hair about every 7-10 days and used to cut his friends&#x27; hair to make a little extra money back in the poor high school/college days.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair for 15 yrs with a Wahl crome pro.  I won&#x27;t say anything bad about the crome pro because it was durable and did cut well all these years ( I cut my hair every week, thats 780 cuts).  But nothing last forever and this year I did have to replace it.  After careful thought and looking at countless reviews I went with the Oster Professional.  Wow, I was amazed how quiet it run and how well it cuts.  My only complaint is that it didnt come with a case and a variety of attachments in different sizes.  Have only used approximately 6 times but so far so good.  I should save my review and release it in about 15 years.  Any one looking for a good clipper don&#x27;t be afraid to spend the money on this product.</li>
            <li> someone recommended this to me as a quiet for the sound-sensitive kids, but i was fairly disappointed as it is louder than the $30 dollar wahl (which i was trying to replace).  I missed the return deadline...</li>
            <li> The Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed is quiet and cuts smoother than the Andis 24145 Speed Master 2 and about the same as the Forfex (Babyliss) AC Motor Clipper FX690BX. The weight of Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed is just right. The ceramic teeth of the Andis 24145 Speed Master 2 felt a bit sticky and the plastic clip ons were too soft and flimsy making them a poor guide causing uneven cutting. The Forfex (Babyliss) AC Motor Clipper FX690BX on the other hand was way too heavy as well as very loud. The Oster Pro 76023-510 Fast Feed hardly heats up at all compared with both the Andis and the Forfex by Babyliss. It&#x27;s a keeper for me.</li>
            <li> Best hair cut machine out there I even cut my hair by myself with it</li>
            <li> Great deal. Inexpensive, but works really well and is much quieter than the cheaper version we had previously. Stands up to lots of little boy haircuts.</li>
            <li> These clippers are really outstanding.  They are professional quality so they are heavy but they are the absolute best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I&#x27;ve used these for over a year and they are tough as nails and work perfectly every time.  You can certainly buy a more dainty clipper, but if you only want to buy one that will last forever, this is it.</li>
            <li> I bought this after buying a WAHL ( see my review of that piece of junk). This is a real clipper. It costs more but then you get what you pay for. QUIET, powerful, fast clean cuts every time, No significant vibration. Cutting hair is a joy once again. My son simply waits and then goes off as opposed to the other one where he was scared, cried and pulled away. I can look in the mirror and cut my hair easily and consistently.   What a joy!  Buy this with confidence. It was well packaged with all the accessories.</li>
            <li> Did a nice job. Expected the speed to be faster than it was. This is not a cordless product. Product comes with small amount of oil and 4 cutting lengths.</li>
            <li> These clippers are great.  They are relatively quiet, don&#x27;t heat up, and don&#x27;t &#x27;pull&#x27; on your hair.  My only complaint, and it&#x27;s a small one, is that the shortest setting is a little too long for me.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair, what little is left, for the past thirty (30) plus years.  My last clipper, the predecessor to this model, finally gave out after a number of years and heavy use. (I also keep my beard short) An Oster is the standard which all clippers should be judged -easy to use, a nice weight and precision cutting blades.  With minimum maintaince they last and last. So if you need a great clipper, look no further.  Take it from someone who knows.</li>
            <li> purchased the Oster Professional for a friend for a birthday, great product.  I will definitely be using Amazon for future purchases, thanks!</li>
            <li> Ad sounded like what I wanted after some unsatisfactory cheaper ones. It turns out I was right. The Oster is very light and cuts quickly and doesn&#x27;t get hot.Yime will tell but as of now it fills the bill.</li>
            <li> 4 years later my Oster fast feed is still going strong. The cord is tough as rocks and securely fastened to the casing. I use these at least twice a month to cut my own hair and father&#x27;s hair sometimes. Don&#x27;t forget to oil the blades regularly! Works great with andis magnetic guide comb set.</li>
            <li> I love the clippers, well worth the $, pays for itself pretty quickly. Fun and easy to use, gonna go trim up right now</li>
            <li> I AGREE WITH ALL OF THE POSITIVE REVIEWS. THERE IS NOTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT THIS CLIPPER. IT WORKED FLAWLESSLY. I RECOMMEND BUYING THE OSTER UNIVERSAL COMB SET AND YOU ARE GOOD TO GO.</li>
            <li> I love this clipper! This is one great product! It cuts very cleanly and evenly with minimal noise and barely any vibration. With one pass, it came out just like the professional even though I have been cutting my son&#x27;s hair for over two years with the Wahl and couldn&#x27;t get it that good, clean and fast with multiple passes. Further, I have a small hand so handling it wasn&#x27;t a problem at all, especially with the minimal noise, vibration and unnoticeable heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Wahl, the noise was so loud that it scared my two years old and made him cried with every hair cut. What made it worse was that he had to endure it even longer for me to go over a few more passes to get it to cut the strands it missed, which was an agony for me to see him cried so much and it was such a waste of time  when you don&#x27;t have much time in a day. Further, with multiple passes it exhausted my small hand fast and doomed for mistakes. In addition, it heated up fast doesn&#x27;t do any helping to my tired hand or to my son&#x27;s fragile skin. Not only the heat and time, what made it worse was the terrible vibration. It vibrated so much that I fear either one day I will drop it and hurt my son or cut into his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one great American Made product that I highly recommend. I also recommend the T-finisher. It makes the cut around the ears so much more professional and easier. The 10 pieces combs definitely work with the Fast Feeder like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hooray for Oster and hooray for Made in the USA!</li>
            <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve been using clippers sold from walmart before purchasing this one. Just to give you an idea the ones i bought from Walmart are the ones sold for about $30. This Oster cuts clean and smooth and that&#x27;s what I like most about it. I like to do fades and the clippers I bought from Walmart would leave missed strands of hair. This pair does not. Overall I am satisfied with my decision in this brand and model. I have only had this for 2 months so I am hoping it will last awhile.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, I decided to get this one.  I&#x27;ve been using a variety of different ones and most work pretty well.  This one continues that trend.  It cuts well and is easy to maintain.  The only downsides is that it might get a little warmer/louder than what I remember of the others I&#x27;ve used and without a guard, it doesn&#x27;t get quite as close as some of the other clippers.  I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone who isn&#x27;t looking for a really close cut.</li>
            <li> This clipper doesn&#x27;t vibrate much so our dog is much calmer when we cut her. Cost was $54.00 and since we had been paying $55 at the new groomers for a bad cut it was a no-brainer. I was told it takes about a year to get really good at cutting their hair so I have about 10 months to go and the dog doesn&#x27;t seem to mind. Also, unlike the previous model that we had tried, this one only gets a little warm. One more cut and it will have paid for itself.</li>
            <li> I got this roughly 3 years ago so I could shave my head regularly.  Still in great condition and I use it twice a month.</li>
            <li> They can&#x27;t compare to either the Classic 76 or the Model 10. If any one knows of an adjustable clipper of the same size that can let me know.</li>
            <li> Wonderful clippers. I&#x27;ve used them many times over a couple of years, on me and on dogs.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to update from Whal, which I have been using so far. It is true that the Oster clipper is fast and very powerful. However, it gets hot immediately and for some reason it shorts the electricity. I have returned my first product, thinking that it could be a rare manufacturing failure. Nevertheless, the second one also has got the same problem, after which I returned it to the seller. So, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My wife is my barber and she uses the Oster to trim the hair on my neck the way all my barbers used to do. She finds the Oster easy to use and claims it feels good in the hand. It is also a quiet machine and seems built to last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> gets the job done and feels nice and sturdy, no frills, no frustration. i&#x27;ve used it 5 or so times now to shave my boyfriend&#x27;s head having never touched a clipper before. it&#x27;s pretty easy to operate and care fore. can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> It pays for itself tenfold or more. Not much to add to what&#x27;s already been said in other reviews but these are excellent clippers. Absolute night and day from cheapo drug store clippers.  It&#x27;s also very quiet and doesn&#x27;t sound like I&#x27;m running a lawnmower in the bathroom when I&#x27;m cutting my hair.  I give myself a standard buzzcut sometimes and the included 3/8 and 1/4 guides work perfectly for that so no need to buy any extras.</li>
            <li> I bought this item about a year ago. For the money I expected more.  The attachments are crap...  two of them have broken inside of a year.  The cord on this thing is AWFUL!  It&#x27;s big and bulky and by the time I&#x27;m done cutting my hair it&#x27;s wrapped itself into a knot it would take a sailor to unravel.  My old Wahl I bought at target for $18 still runs like a champ, the attachments have never broken and I&#x27;ve had the thing for six years.  For 2-3 x the $$$ this isn&#x27;t worth the investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Improvements Needed:&lt;br /&gt;* swivel mechanism where the cord inserts into the clippers&lt;br /&gt;* more durable attachments - the set they sell ($25) is more than most clippers</li>
            <li> This is my third set of clippers.  I should have purchased these in the first place instead of slowly climbing the ladder of quality.</li>
            <li> Talk about quick and easy fades!  If you have some experience with cheaper clippers and then compare them to these there is no comparison.  Fades and blends are so simple to do with these clippers.  Your results will look professional just like the name suggests.  I recommend investing in a pair of these if you cut hair.</li>
            <li> WE BOUGHT THIS ITEM BECAUSE I HAVE OPTED TO BE TOTALLY BALD AND DIDN&#x27;T WANT TO WASTE MY TIME OR MONEY ON A PROFESSIONAL BARBER ANYMORE.  IT WAS A GREAT CHOICE AND MY WIFE HAS MASTERED THE TECHNIQUE MAKING ME TOTALLY BALD EVERY COUPLE OF WEEKS OR SO.</li>
            <li> We bought these earlier in the year to cut each other&#x27;s hair.  It does a good job and we are enjoying them.  My husband has never cut a head of hair until we bought these.  Then he started cutting my hair with them.  He had so much fun cutting my hair that when I woke up in the morning, he was looking down at me and said, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s time for your next haircut.&amp;#34;  I pointed out to him that he just cut my hair.&amp;#34;  He said, &amp;#34;That was yesterday!&amp;#34;  Well, he had to wait a while for my hair to grow enough to cut it again.  He did a better job the second time.  And even a bit better the third time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be walking around with my hair wildly standing out in different directions, because that&#x27;s how my hair grows, and this short it&#x27;s just going to do that.  We are having a LOT of fun with it all.  We laugh and talk through it all.  He&#x27;s had to learn how to hold the thing, how to not press too hard against my scalp, or go too light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind you, the clippers are great.  But I&#x27;ve made my husband promise to not cut anyone else&#x27;s hair with them, no matter how much fun we are having with them.  In the hands of someone who knows what they are doing, these would likely be amazing.  And hey, even in the hands of a total newbie to cutting hair, not bad at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suffice it to say, we are very happy with our clippers and are so glad we bought them.</li>
            <li> Clippers came quickly. They are very quiet compared to my previous clippers bought at places like Walmart. I can even listen to the radio while cutting my hair with no problem. Clippers cut through hair quickly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> these things a professional for sure had them now over a year and i cut my hair once a week with them and these this cut .just mad i did not get a them sooner . a must have for do it yourself hair cuts</li>
            <li> I do think these are good quality clippers that probably are great for a specific purpose in a barber&#x27;s arsenal of tools.  However, if you are not a professional and only have one pair of clippers, you will probably be disappointed, especially if you keep your hair very short.  Firstly, the lowest blade setting on these will not get you to a 0 - I like to keep the sides of my hair extremely short and then fade to a 1 or 2 on top.  I found my beard trimmer to be a closer cut than these, and have recently resorted to using that as my main weapon of choice.  Additionally, the adjustable blade is controlled by a lever that is of pretty low quality and that doesn&#x27;t set into place, so it&#x27;s difficult to tell what cut setting you are on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were my first pair of quality clippers, and it looks like I will have to search elsewhere for my intended purpose of getting a close shave. From the glowing reviews on this product, I can assume they work just fine for most people.  But if you are in my camp of self-cutters that like to keep your hair extremely short, it is better you look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a substitute to hair cuts.  They work incredibly well, and chicks dig that Oster logo!  I have thick, coarse hair and these things mow it down no problem; almost like the blades are disappointed there&#x27;s no challenge.  I balked at the price at first, but now I&#x27;ve gotten used to using them every two weeks, and after two months, they&#x27;ve paid for themselves.  If you&#x27;re on the fence, I say &amp;#34;go for it&amp;#34;!  Also, to boot, they&#x27;re not heavy, they&#x27;re super quiet, and the included blade guards stay on no problem.</li>
            <li> I have used this clipper exclusively for beard trimming for roughly two months, so my comments are more specialized than those offered by others.  In this capacity, it leaves very little to be desired, though.  At the longest setting of its adjustable range, it leaves a sufficiently full looking beard so as not to require use of any attachable plastic combs.  At the shortest, it is capable of creating a clear beard line that still requires shaving with a blade on the lower part of my neck:  not a surprise or a serious problem, to my mind.      There is no pulling, it is reasonably quiet, and has a satisfying heft.  Having trimmed my beard for more than 20 years with straight scissors, I find this clipper to be more reproducible and much less troublesome/fussy.  Why didn&#x27;t I just break down and deal with the problem this way a lot sooner?        I understand that this clipper is probably overkill for simple beard trimming and appreciate that it might fall slightly short for professional barbers cutting longer hair.  Since I&#x27;m not a professional and can&#x27;t offer an informed comment on that use, my 5 star rating is for quality, price, and suitability in a home setting.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I spent a little over a week on-line looking at hair cutting tools and finally whittled it down to this one.  It seems to have the best price/performance ratio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s heavy enough to feel heavy duty, but not so heavy as to hinder cutting my own hair for half-an-hour.  In that time it gets only slightly warm.  My hair is pretty fine, but it cuts it like going through butter, my beard too.  The cord is nice and thick and never gets warm and it&#x27;s just about the right length, seems like about 6 feet or so.  When you pick it up you can feel the quality of the materials and workmanship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had it month, so I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s longevity.  I purchased a can of the Oster Blade Cleaner, which I use after each trim, followed by 2-3 drops of the Oster Blade Lube.  This seems like sensible, low cost maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative comment, and it&#x27;s not worth deducting a star, is that it can be a little slippery, and because of it&#x27;s heft I think a fall to a tile floor could damage it, so just be aware of that and handle it accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase, so far, and have every reason  to believe that the Oster Fast Feed will last me for many years to come.  I&#x27;ll report back in a year and let you know how it&#x27;s doing.</li>
            <li> This little clipper has a pivot motor.  That makes it a bit more expensive but also gives it twice the power of regular (magnetic) motors.  It cuts through wet hair without any difficulty.  It&#x27;s a good clipper for professionals.    The unit is the quiet.  It just makes a low hum.  The attachments are good.  I&#x27;m just learning when and how to use them.      I recommend this clipper without hesitation because of the quality and value.</li>
            <li> This works great and I bought it for my teen son. My husband has the classic which he has had for many years. Keeper!</li>
            <li> Great clippers, they work very well!     Only complaint is the guards they come with have very sharp points! Its easy to poke someone with them, causing a painful scrape.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for years. I could have been saving a lot of time if I had had this clipper. Does a great job quickly.</li>
            <li> I purchased these clippers a few weeks ago and used them for the first time. They worked Great! I hope they will continue to clip well in future uses.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers 8 months ago, and I had to come back to write a review.  These clippers are outstanding.  It cuts most hair in one passing, and quickly.  It still is a quiet and solid machine, and I imagine it will last me several years.  I would definately recommend for anyone who is serious about cutting their own hair.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Feels much more substantial than cheaper models bought at Walmart, Target, etc.  So far so good. Hopefully it will last much longer 0since I have burned through so many of the cheaper models and they turn dull after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> My old clipper, my son complained that it hurt when I cut his hair.  I decided to try this one based on the reviews &amp; made a great decision.  It&#x27;s easy to use &amp; love how the blade is adjustable.  I love it!  Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> It works great on your normal hair but it isn&#x27;t really as fine on short hair. I used to use my other one to shave my beard off when it was time and it would reduce a beard to tiny stubble but this leaves it still pretty long even on its closest setting. I moved the top blade a bit but it still isn&#x27;t as fine as the others I&#x27;ve used. It also has a very annoying whine/tone that irritates me when its next to my ear. I was thinking this would be so much better and quieter then the last one I used but honestly I prefer the other&#x27;s noise over this ones high pitched tone that leaves my ears ringing.</li>
            <li> These are the best clippers i have ever used. I have been cutting my own hair for a couple years now and i can finally do it with ease with these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bodybuilder, haven&#x27;t shaved my body in a long time. Shaved my whole body today with this thing to start and it went quick, it didn&#x27;t slow down for the whole time I worked on it. Has a nice, heavy feel to it in the hand, powerful motor. Very quiet. And I didn&#x27;t cut myself once!</li>
            <li> debated for weeks whether to stay with the Wahls I&#x27;ve had or move to Oster. I hate to say it but I haven&#x27;t noticed the difference, Wahl just as good and cheaper.</li>
            <li> Fantastic set of clippers, purchased with attachments separately (they are also great attachments). Has a nice hum and seems very sturdy. Appears to be just a very well engineered set of clippers. I&#x27;ve you&#x27;ve ever purchased a cheaper set, this is well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attachments: http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001T0HHB0/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_31</li>
            <li> I have now used it for 3 years and it&#x27;s been the best hair cutter I have used over the year:&lt;br /&gt;- never a problem, very sturdy&lt;br /&gt;- cuts great, very fast blade. I don&#x27;t have my hair pulled like with the other products I have used.</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift to a younger relative, he is absolutley thrilled with thier quality,were purchased to replace a lost set and resipiant said they were alot better than what was lost.</li>
            <li> I use it for my own personal use to fade my own hair. The clippers are great, but I was expecting a higher professional feel yo them. Good clippers none the less. They do heat up fairly quick.</li>
            <li> I had a $30 shaver from a local big box and this is better but not as good as a $100 pro model I had in the past.  The problem is it misses fine hairs even when going over and over.  the old expensive one did the job right the 1st time.</li>
            <li> This was primarily for my husband.  We started out with the attachment for a longer length, just to be cautious.  It was actually easy to get comfortable with &amp; get a feel for how to use it.  He now gives himself hair cuts with ease.  He&#x27;s so happy with it!</li>
            <li> im very upset with this item,while im trimming the whole hair clipper is shaking i would like to give that back i hope they will taked back its realy horably please make sure not to buy this model Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper with Adjustable Blade         i hope it will help for the future customer&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I have been buzzing my hair down to nothing on and off my whole life.  I always used \\&quot;Conair\\&quot; or some other Drug Store brand clippers that cost $10. I was unhappy with their performance because they all left strips of hair that I would have to constantly go over and over again to get a clean cut.  After reading the reviews for the \\&quot;fast feed\\&quot; I thought that I had found a solution without the $120 price tag of the ones that you see at the barber shops.  I am very dissapointed.  The fast feed sounds more powerful, they weigh more and cost more and the fast feed uses a pivot motor in place of a magnetic one, but when it comes to pulling off a \\&quot;one-pass\\&quot; clean cut down your head - they fail just like the $10 clippers I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I&#x27;m pretty sure I have standard hair and I always cut my hair dry with no products in it; so I&#x27;m not sure why there are good reviews about it considering my experience.  I guess my options are reduced down to one: spend the $120 and get what I want.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my uncle and so far I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints or issues on it. I guess it works fine so far.</li>
            <li> These have worked decently well for the most part. Doesn&#x27;t like to cut through dirty hair or hair with any product already in it. I don&#x27;t feel like I get a really smooth cut with them.</li>
            <li> The clippers work GREAT for my husband and surprisingly, also on our dog. But it is definitely geared for human use only if you are going to clean it regularly. If you take it apart to clean more than 4 times, the grooves in the plastic wear thin and no longer does the screw hold the blades in place. Oster lined four out of the five holes for screws with metal, but the screw that slides the length of the blade up and down is cut right into the plastic. The problem is that when cleaning it, if you remove all of the screws to remove the cut hairs more than 4-5 times, the screws no longer hold their grip because the grooves are in plastic and break off. The first clipper set I used was a few years old, and my husband had never taken it thoroughly apart to clean it. I figured I should remove the dog hair before he used it again. I won&#x27;t do that on the third clipper I buy to replace the original.     I was shocked that the clipper worked at all on our dog since the medium priced Oster animal shaver I bought was useless.     Moral of the story, this clipper is WONDERFUL for human usage, not for animals.</li>
            <li> Quieter and faster than cheap ones. Owned about 1 year</li>
            <li> I recieved these as a gift and I love them.  The only con is that you WILL need another pair of blades for precise taping or trimming.  Other than that, these babies cut through my hair like butter.  I love them, but i&#x27;m glad i kept my old ones for fading and taping.</li>
            <li> I have yet to cut my hair wrong with these clippers. The blades are factory sharpened and do not need to be touched. I have some Wahl clippers that sound like a motorcycle, but the motor in these have little next to no noise, even after cutting for more than 40 minutes. I&#x27;m not a professional barber but had a professional barber recommend them to me and I am so glad I listened. In the past I have ran through problems with other clippers that leave a lot of patches of hair behind, however with these clippers I have yet to come across any patch problems.      The blade is adjustable and doesn&#x27;t slide out easily (which sometimes happens if you press hard on other machines).       My only problem is that they don&#x27;t come with a case or something to store them in. That&#x27;s why I give it a 4 out of 5. Maybe the lack of case is because these clippers are meant to be hung in a barber shop, I don&#x27;t know.      Clippers used on coarse hair. Get a decent liner and you&#x27;re good to go, amateur haircut or professional.</li>
            <li> Professional tool.  You can feel the quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always owned cheap clippers... and never liked them.  The cheap ones use a magnet that pulls the blade back and forth... without much power... so the blade doesn&#x27;t always move well back and forth... so they grabs hair and pulls it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one uses a motor to move the blade back and forth.  There is almost no comparison.  This one is awesome.  It is possible to feed too fast... and it can pull if you do that... but that almost never happens as it&#x27;s cutting capacity is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this one again and refer it to friends.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper to replace its predecessor which I purchased in 1982 and recently dropped on a tile floor, cracking the case. It still works, but with a loud buzz from the crack as you might imagine. I am pleased find that the new model seems to be unchanged in quality, with only a few cosmetic/ergonomic tweaks. I started cutting my own hair after giving up my Natural and not wanting to go back to a Quo Vadis or search for a new barber. I&#x27;m not into the Cleanhead look, so I cut my own, more streamlined version of my Natural.  I have tried the competitor. This  is an excellent clipper for Afro hair. I even managed to delight a couple of adolescents of both genders with home cuts (!!!) using the previous model. Do, however, invest in the Pro comb set. The variety is essential and the spring clips are serious. Their vinyl bag is nice, too.</li>
            <li> Just received the clippers today.  Cut my hair with no problem.  Much quieter and easier then Wahl and others I got at stores and only paid slightly more</li>
            <li> Not a bad clipper, quiet, painless but could trim a little closer. A bit spendy but is a decent clip.</li>
            <li> I cut hair for friends and family members, and my old wal-mart clippers were not doing the job. They would grab hair and pull occasionally, and they would leave the hair looking fuzzy.&lt;br /&gt;So I gave in and bought professional clipper. These are great! They are a little loud, but they make all the cuts look clean and professional. Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I am so sick of going to the barber shop and &amp;#34;John&amp;#34; not being there...Now I don&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;Everything I use it....I save 25 dollars...Go ahead John..take that day off.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;First things first I poppa freaks all the honies, dummies, playboy bunnies those wanting money.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly the clipper grant a clean cut!&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer only used them once but wanted to give my initial reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second reflection is the weight.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s heavy!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t imagine traveling with these at all as I did with my last pair of Osters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: if you&#x27;re traveling abroad please ensure clippers can handle the voltage!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said I&#x27;m glad my last pair blew up for these clippers cut like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the brand I&#x27;m betting it will be this way for a while to come. My last pair survived about 12 years!&lt;br /&gt;(Got them in college)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace</li>
            <li> I have a rare medical condition which leads to an abnormal amount of body hair in sensitive regions if you know what I mean and this buzzer has done the job in a jiffy!!</li>
            <li> i was especting it to cut more shorter or cleaner .i know i could not return it or exchange it to better one thtat can clean closer to the blade.</li>
            <li> Just under a year ago my last hair clippers broke, so I looked around for a more durable alternative (the other set lasted about two years). I think I cut my hair all of four times with the Oster before the adjustable blade handle started becoming a little loose, but it was still useable. Well, it is no longer so. After the handle became looser over the last few months I finally decided to try and tighten the screw that holds the handle on the clipper. Well, that pretty much ended it. The handle now sways in the wind; the \\&quot;adjustable\\&quot; blade is now stationary. While the clippers still work, the idea that a \\&quot;professional grade\\&quot; machine would become dysfunctional after one person used it once a month for a year is pretty ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I selected this product because of what I&#x27;d read online, and the reviews. Hopefully my review will get some folks to reconsider and buy another item instead. I will not be buying Oster products in the future.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I had an old Oster hair clipper for 25 years and this one even does a better job.</li>
            <li> great product highly recommeded</li>
            <li> Very good quality, but a little bit not comfortable when holding it, especially for people who has small hand :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many clippers to cut my hair and these were the first more expensive ones that I have used. First off, it&#x27;s ridiculous that they can&#x27;t even include a few more common guide combs so you&#x27;ll have to purchase those separately. The first thing I noticed was the angle of the blade was a bit awkward but that&#x27;s probably something I just had to get used to; after a while I didn&#x27;t notice anymore.  The clippers worked great. I have thick, spiky hair and usually have problems cutting quickly and effectively with most clippers. These worked just as advertised and cut through my hair smoothly. They never snagged and they cut really nice and evenly. I never had to go over my hair repeatedly and it never left any spikeys.  Well, until they broke that is. I had them for about 6 months. The pivoting lever on the adjustable blade has a small plastic piece that moves the blade back and forth and is poorly made as it broke on me for no apparent reason. This has also happened to others. I have never abused them or been rough with them. Strangely it broke while I was not even moving it: in the middle of a haircut when I paused for a second it just fell apart, leaving the clippers useless! Luckily I had backup cheap clippers. Once it breaks it&#x27;s unusable because the blade will just slide back and forth freely. I always fade my hair so it is essential for me to have the flexibility of an adjustable blade. I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because it was great while it worked and I would probably give it 5 if it was made better. I will consider trying a different oster product because I liked this one while it worked. Do NOT buy this product.</li>
            <li> very good clipper. just keep it oiled.</li>
            <li> It came faster than expected and even though the tracking system seemed wierd it came before estimated time.  Everything works great!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a proper hair cut in....well...as long as I can remember. Growing up our family was somewhat poor. When your family is poor you don&#x27;t get proper haircuts. You, and your brothers, get your heads buzzed with some $15 clippers that your folks bought at walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so that&#x27;s what I was raised to believe was proper. So....over the course of the past 15 years...I&#x27;ve continued tradition. Go to a store, buy a cheap set of clippers, go home, and clip my hear until the cheap clippers start to feel like they&#x27;re tearing hair out, as opposed to just cutting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But enough was enough, and I decided it was finally time to go pick up a better quality set instead of replacing the cheap Wahl kits I&#x27;d get every few years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I disliked about the cheap cits - the guides that you put on them were cheap flimsy plastic, and as such if you applied pressure when cutting your hair, you&#x27;d end up with weird ridges in your hair. Very annoying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Oster Pro Fast Feed clippers. These things buzzed right through my hair with zero hesitation and the guide didn&#x27;t bend and result with the aforementioned &amp;#34;ridges&amp;#34; you get with cheap flimy plastic guides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your situation sounds like what I dealt with all my life, then pick these up, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am 37 years old and when I started cutting my hair at 14 years old I used some cheap Oster clippers that did a decent job of cutting.  The problem with the cheapoes is the cord would always mess up on them.  Through the years I went to other brands like Wahl and Andis, I must say that these clippers are right up there with other brands that you will get in the same line.  I know these may not be better than the Andis Masters but they did a awesome job cutting my hair.  I mean this was a great cut with nice sharp blades.  I am thinking about getting another set in case they stop making them!!!!!</li>
            <li> Sharp, fast, and easy to use! I&#x27;m so glad I invested in a good hair clipper. I feel I saved so much, at the store these same clippers were $100. My boys were so happy they didn&#x27;t get their hair pulled or their skin pinched anymore. Fast delivery. Just love my Oster clippers!!!!</li>
            <li> This clipper does an excellent job.  I currently use it to nearly shave my head.  This clipper is professional quality and easy to use.  I have no regrets so far about this purchase.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and efficiency for cutting hair. Product arrived on time. Cutter was as  described, and prior positive reviews were accurate.</li>
            <li> love it, there not much to say but it works very well. But one thing the plastic heads do not stay on very good.</li>
            <li> The Fast Feed cuts easily and cleanly.  I cut my own hair so I particularly like its small size because it is easy to handle doing the back of my head.</li>
            <li> I came to this quite by accident, but I&#x27;m happy to have discovered this no maintenance summer haircut for my son.  After my five year old cut his own hair unbeknownst to me and with those children&#x27;s craft scissors (it wasn&#x27;t pretty), I thought, why not just do the clipper thing and give him the buzz cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Oster Professional Fast Feed Clipper fits the bill entirely. I&#x27;ve never used these before and was pleasantly surprised to find that they couldn&#x27;t be easier to use.  You just pick one of the combs based on how long or short you want the hair to be, then run the clippers through the hair.  Voila!  So Easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two seconds after he&#x27;s out of the water his hair is dry which is nice in our climate where it can go very quickly from sunny and warm to chilly.  It&#x27;s practical and looks cute.  The clippers are very well made and I can&#x27;t imagine having to buy another one ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And how eco friendly not to have to drive to the barber or salon, this way you have an appointment whenever you like and for free.  Great for kids but would also be good for anyone wanting this cut.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve only actually used these twice, once to shave our dog, which is why we got them. They did an excellent job with that. The other time we actually shaved our cat after he had gotten in to some weird liquid outside, which was no small feat. They worked well, even though he had some gunk all over his fur. Would recommend these not only for people, but for pets as well :)</li>
            <li> Mine lasted almost exactly one year before no longer working.  I had hoped it&#x27;d last longer.  I took care of it and cleaned it regularly, but now the blades do not function.</li>
            <li> Item as described, works well!</li>
            <li> these are the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. Oster wil be getting more money from me in the future. Thank you.</li>
            <li> They are what everyone say.and some just take your time and learn them and you won&#x27;t want to use another clipper ever I adjusted the blade down to 0 and like a hot knife through butter. My 3yr old son don&#x27;t cry no more lol no more cheep drug,dollar store for me.</li>
            <li> Destroys the $22 one I got at the mart of walls. There was always a point in using that other one where I was afraid it would stop before I was done with my head, and that would have been very lame. This works so much better.</li>
            <li> This was not working well and seems to be broken before use. I honestly wish I could return it but I&#x27;ve been too busy and believe I&#x27;ve kept it far too long.  I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> fast feeds are the truth. Serious and pro...only thing is the guards are bad, get you some Andis magnet guards with this and your good to go!</li>
            <li> Is this only supposed to last two years? As of two weeks ago I&#x27;ve had to hit it pretty hard with my hand for the blade to oscillate at the speed it needs to to cut hair...</li>
            <li> higher quality then i expected.  but the combs that come with it are cheap plastic. I had a set of oster combs from old unit so all is good.</li>
            <li> Great price and a well made clipper.  a must have for beginners I recommend to any and everyone</li>
            <li> What else can I say!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several shavers over the last couple decades and this is the only one that has made an impression on me.  Very rugged, commercial construction.  If you are used to $20 clippers at Walmart, the difference with these is very apparent the very first time you use it.  Additionally, replacement parts are widely available and the design has mostly been unchanged for decades.  Should a part break on you, even outside of warranty, repair should theoretically be pretty easy.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this clipper based on other reviews. I keep my head Buzzed and was thinking that these clippers would do the trick. It takes twice as long for me to trim my head now these clippers are not powerful enough, paid 50+ dollars for these and I get better and faster results with a 15 dollar pair of WAHL. If you have all day to cut hair then these are good but I feel like I wasted my money. The only thing &amp;#34;fast feed&amp;#34; about these things is the amount of time you should throw them in the trash!!</li>
            <li> good machine will last you life time if you take care of it. i wish they have the rechargebale version of that cause i travel a lot.</li>
            <li> Howdy,    First a brief bit of background info.  I am a sixty year old guy who lives in a small home with a Golden Retriever in Northern Nevada.  I enjoy cooking, the outdoors and reading and I am a custom rifle builder.  I have learned over the years that the joy of buying something cheap is soon lost in the pain of disappointment and failure!    I bought this clipper to cut/trim my hair and beard weekly and to clip my Golden Retriever two or three times a year in the summer.  I thought I had researched this purchase pretty well and decided I did not need the top of the line professional model.  I did think that I could purchase a screw-on metal comb of the thickness I wanted once I had decided what I needed.    So after a month of happily using the clipper, I called Oster and discovered that this model DOES NOT have replaceable metal combs...  Darn!  It was to late to return the device.    In any case to be fair, the clipper has worked very well and I use it regularly, I just have to use the plastic combs.    So just be advised that there is a possible limitation to this particular device depending on your needs...    TCD</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional barber, but I have 360 waves and wanted to start cutting my own hair to save money. These clippers have a lot of leverage, so I can cut my hair to the exact length that I want while I have my 1 guard on. They&#x27;re also great for giving myself taper fades and fading out the back of my hair. They&#x27;re nice and quiet and they&#x27;re also portable. Great product. I recommend buying with the magnetic Andis guards.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this item at all! It pulled my sons hair out, it didn&#x27;t cut cleanly. Even with out the attachments it had to be shaved many times over for it to cut most of the hair. I often went over thier hair with scissors the next day. I wouldn&#x27;t recomend these to anyone. I suggest going with a differant product. Though I have had good experiance with this brand in the past. It just seems to be this model.</li>
            <li> I have been very satisfied with this clipper. Smooth and quiet. One caution: don&#x27;t put it away without oiling the blade. I did, and the next time I used it, it had started rusting.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the clippers, the adjustment arm broke.  I could turn the arm in a circle and nothing would happen.  This occurred after minimal pressure was placed on the arm to try and adjust the guard.  I returned the item in exchange for a new one.  That process was quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about seven months of use, (about once a month to cut my hair and my two sons), the adjustment arm broke again.  Keep in mind, I knew it was fragile to begin with, so I made sure I did not apply too much pressure.  Unfortunately, I am not able to return the item again which I would certainly do.  This time for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers cut well, but not better than a set you can buy from WalMart for half the price.  I would not recommend this item due to it&#x27;s fragility and average cutting ability.</li>
            <li> These are the best clippers I&#x27;ve used! I also purchased the T-Finisher (great buy) and will purchase the Classic 76 in the near future. It would also be a good idea to set these to a zero gap its fairly easy and makes a difference. I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> Love it. I started losing my hair towards the end of high school wasn&#x27;t going to be one of those guys who picks a bad hairstyle to try and \\&quot;disguise\\&quot; the hair loss. So I started cutting it all off with an old trimmer my Dad gave to me. You could tell it used to be nice at one point. lol Five years later I bought this thing to get something that would work more efficiently and this truly does the trick. Cuts right through my hair in one pass. I love things that don&#x27;t waste my time. :)</li>
            <li> Fast, hardworking, ergonomic, easy to clean, and quiet compared to our other noisy, less effective clippers. Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> At first this was a good shaver but over times it&#x27;s not shaving as well and it also pinches. It&#x27;s very heavy also.</li>
            <li> It was a good buy when I first used this Oster clipper for it quiet and sharp blade. But it got hot very fast, the blade got burning too hot for touching the skin, the adjustable blade had sometime didn&#x27;t move up or down I had to use 2 thumps to push it. The worst is after 1 and a 1/2 year of using once every two month it&#x27;s stop working now so I try to unscrew the blade to see if I can fix or clean the blade, but when putting it back the plastic body of the screw hole of the adjustable handle broken. Now I&#x27;m looking for the other clipper but not Oster anymore.</li>
            <li> LET ME START OFF BY SAYING THAT I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL BARBER. I AM ONLY A HOME USER ONLY. I WANTED TO BUY A GOOD ELECTRIC RAZOR/HAIR TRIMMER. AFTER SOME EXTENSIVE RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND PRODUCT REVIEW ON AMAZON. I  CAME UP WITH THIS MODEL RAZOR. THIS RAZOR BY THE FEEL OF IT IS CONSTRUCTED OF HIGH QUALITY. ALL I CAN SAY IS EXCELLENT. WORKS GREAT, QUIET AND VERY SMOOTH. A LITTLE ON THE HEAVY SIDE. BUT NOT BAD AT ALL. THIS RAZOR IS BUILT IN THE USA. IT IS A TRULY GREAT AMERICAN PRODUCT. THE ONLY DOWNFALL I CAN SEE IS  THAT IT DOSENT COME WITH ANY STORAGE CASE. I ENDED UP USING MY OLD CONAIR ELECTRIC RAZOR CASE. MY OLD CONAIR RAZOR CASE WORKED OUT GREAT. THE ACUALL ELECTRIC  RAZOR/HAIR TRIMMER DIDN&#x27;T. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RAZOR TO ANYBODY LOOKING FOR A HOME RAZOR. BRONX, NY</li>
            <li> I have been doing the home haircut thing now for about 3 or 4 years.  In that time, I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands.  Conair sucked and didn&#x27;t cut right.  Wahl was better quality, but, still didn&#x27;t seem to give an even cut.  After reading most of the reviews here on Amazon, I decided to try the Oster fast feed.  I&#x27;ve only used them one time and already I can tell it is better than others I&#x27;ve tried.  The even level of the cut seems way superior to Wahl and leagues better than the crappy Conair clippers.  I also like how the motor is stronger, yet, isn&#x27;t as loud as you might expect.  Yeah, it makes noise as all clippers will.  In time, the clippers may have defects.  Who knows?  My initial impression is good, but, not great.  For the price, I expected a little better.  Which is why I didn&#x27;t give the clippers 5 stars and went with 4.  I am satisfied with the Oster fast feed but not amazed.  They could improve on a few things, but, it&#x27;s probably the best you can do without having to pay ungodly amounts for higher costing clippers.  It does the job and that&#x27;s what matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8/25/2012: The Oster fast feeds were decent clippers.  Although my initial opinion was high, I&#x27;m now of the opinion that these are okay clippers[not great though].  These clippers were not as precise as I first thought and you can get just as good a clipper by getting the Wahl Lithium Ion cordless @ Wal-Mart.  Which is precisely what I did.  The oster clippers almost threw the electric breaker @ my apartment and the long cord is bothersome.  Save yourself some effort &amp; money and buy the Wahl Ion cordless clippers.  They are effect at home haircuts with the same if not better results.</li>
            <li> Would never use anything else !</li>
            <li> Great clipper with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for nearly 2 years and it is as good as they day I bought it. I use it once a week for a full head trim (of what&#x27;s left of it - let&#x27;s say 50%) I had been buying $15 pieces if junk from Walmart prior to this and will never do so again. This is a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> son says the clipper works well and he likes it. He likes the quality of Oster.</li>
            <li> As a bald man, I have gone through a few clippers. This is by far the quietest and smoothest clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned. It feels solid with very little vibration. Easy to hold and maneuver. You get a clear sense of quality in this product.</li>
            <li> seen it at my local sallys for $100, found them here for $50... any questions?  top of the line and quiet clippers</li>
            <li> The clipper should have come with the full range of combs. Instead it has only a few, and the extra combs cost $20 and shipping, usually $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you buy this and fancy having hair longer than 1/2 inch, you&#x27;re going to have to pay the sucker tax of $20 for the 1&amp;#34; and 1 1/4&amp;#34; combs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Functionally the clippers are great, but the skimping on $1 worth of plastic combs is so intention, such a cash grab that oster should be ashamed of themselves.</li>
            <li> Excellent cutting clipper.  Very quiet and cuts well.  My only gripe is the angle of the head/blade.  When cutting your own hair you always have a tendency to lead the clipper upwards to get a close cut.  With this clipper it will snag on your head on the smallest imperfection.</li>
            <li> Best thing I bought last year it really cuts my hair and does not pull or hurt thanks for that.</li>
            <li> too heavy, loud noise too</li>
            <li> This clipper cuts very well. I replaced a generic one purchased from a big box store before stepping up to the Oster. The cut is so much cleaner and the blades maintain sharpness much better. They also provide oil and recommend using it before each cut which the other brand did not even discuss. These are easy to handle and fairly quiet to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripes with this product are the lack of quality attachments, the cheap feeling on/off button, and I wish this trimmer came in a hard plastic box rather than a cardboard one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very quality product for those of us that do home haircuts.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers. I use it trim my beard. It is fast and easy to use. It is well made with obvious quality. For what I use it for it will last a lifetime. I think the price is fair.</li>
            <li> The clipper works very well, is quiet and problem free.  Much better performance than the cheap units in the big box stores but not too expensive.  The only reason it does not get 5 stars is because the on/off switch feels flimsy and for the money it should have a plastic box to hold it and its attachments.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers from Discount Jungle through Amazon. They arrived in a \\&quot;used\\&quot; condition (finger prints, hair on it). I contacted Discount Jungle and they accepted the return and quickly sent me a new clipper. They work great! They are much quieter than the previous ConAir clippers I had. They give even cuts and didn&#x27;t nick or pull the hair of either of my sons during the hair cut. I would definitely buy these again!    After I gave Discount Jungle a review of 3 stars (for sending the original dirty clippers), they called me and asked me to remove my review. In exchange they gave me a 90 day warranty vs the 30 day. I figured I could go back and re-write the review. However, it appears Amazon doesn&#x27;t give you the option of rewriting?  I guess Discount Jungle didn&#x27;t like the 3 star review and wanted it off their record.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to write a review of this product as I have been the proud owner of one for over 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me begin by saying why I ordered one.  I learned how to give haircuts while I was in high school and after I went to college I gave a few haircuts every now and then using other people&#x27;s clippers.  My friends finally convinced me to invest in a clipper, since I was the only one on my floor that knew how to give haircuts.  I knew Oster was a good make and I really wanted to get a good, long-lasting clipper.  I was vacillating between this one and the Classic 76 which I personally knew to be a quality clipper.  To be honest, I was a little skeptical buying this one because it was less than half the price of the Classic 76 (as well as only 12 watts in comparison to the 76&#x27;s 26 watts) which sort-of led me to believe it was not as good.  I finally decided to try this one out and rationalized that at least I could make my money back on it and then save up a bit to buy the Classic 76 if need be.  I ordered the T-Finisher to compliment my set, as well as a carrying case to hold all my stuff together.  All-in-all, I spent about $120.  Let me tell you, when I first used this clipper, it was love at first cut.  It cut like a hot knife through butter and I was easily able to give about 5 haircuts an hour.  I charged cheap for my haircuts, about $5 a pop, and I can&#x27;t tell you how long the lines were waiting for me to give haircuts.  I had given over a hundred haircuts already (obviously lubricating the blades every now-and-then to keep it smoothe), and it was still going strong.  I still wasn&#x27;t convinced that the blades would last that much longer, so I made sure to set aside some money to buy Classic 76 when this one broke down.  Well, let me tell you, after 3 years of college (I graduated early) this clipper was amazing and worked like the day I got it.  After I got married and moved out, I slowly built a small-scale haircutting business on the side, with myFast Feed Clipper in hand.  Co-workers, family, and friends were all customers of mine and they were most impressed with the job I did as well as the smootheness of the clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all after about 5 years of owning this clipper and over 1000 haircuts with it, I can honestly say this was probably the best investment I ever made.  I&#x27;m happy I didn&#x27;t end up going with the Classic 76, because this one suited my needs just fine at less than half the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides I can think of is that the clipper gets very hot after using it for over an hour.  I got too freaked out to continue using it and usually didn&#x27;t give more than 6 or 7 haircuts in a row before letting the thing cool down for a while, so I can&#x27;t tell you if it would destroy the motor if you used it longer.  The other downside is that it only comes with 4 or 5 guards and they aren&#x27;t the best quality.  After a while, I bought the spring-loaded guards rather than just the ones that slip onto the clipper and I was set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up in one sentence: Great clippers if you are running a small-scale barber shop (and for sure if you&#x27;re a DIYer for you and your family to save a couple of bucks at the barber) but if you&#x27;re a professional giving haircuts all day long, go for the Classic 76.</li>
            <li> I have a receding hair line so I shave my head about once a month. This is defnitely more powerful and cuts better than my other clippers but even after I have went over the same spot over and over again I notice hairs the next day that it failed to get.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve owned a good, solid clipper.  I trust the Oster brand and these clippers live up to the name.</li>
            <li> works great, good power.  Just wish I was a better cat groomer.  Cat agrees.  Ha</li>
            <li> Oster makes excellent products all the time and this clipper is one nice machine!!  Have used other clippers and there&#x27;s no comparing the two.  Oster are made to last practically forever and perform every time you pick them up to use.  Cheaper clippers are designed to last for a bit and then you have to replace them over and over.  Save yourself the time and the money, buy this quality Oster clipper first and you won&#x27;t be sorry.  Whenever you need the blade(s) sharpened, follow the instructions and send them directly back to Oster.  You&#x27;ll get your blade(s) back quick as a wink and they&#x27;ll be as sharp as new.  Buy Oster and Be A Happy Clipper!!</li>
            <li> I have had this clipper since March and have had two separate issues.  Unfortunately, I am now out of the window to return the item and have no choice but to keep the broken item.  I used the product for personal use, maybe 6 times and the adjustable clipper attachment was so poorly made it no longer adjusts.  I purchased this knowing the name Oster and I had very high expectations, but I was left very disappointed in the quality of the product. I have had many less expensive clippers that have lasted years.</li>
            <li> had this same product,even the same color,for over 20 years,  I trim a beard with it......same great product, just thew right amount of power.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that it looks like the clippers have been used before. I thought it was suppose to be a BRAND NEW clippers.</li>
            <li> These clippers are great! Very strong motor and good blades. I could probably mow the lawn with them in the afternoon and then trim my beard in time to go out for dinner. I just wish the guards it came with weren&#x27;t made from recycled tupperware lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Cutting hair with these is a breeze. Buy new guards.</li>
            <li> Plastic-type attachments. Previous purchase of product provided more sturdy attachments...</li>
            <li> It took me a while to make up my mind about this product comparing it with other brands but I am glad I chose this clipper. It cut smooth and very quiet .Clean and lube and it is ready to go.I cut my hair and that of my son every two - three weeks ,My son love it because it never pull and it glides through effortlessly. Very good product.</li>
            <li> These clippers have a smooth running motor with a &amp;#34;cool to the touch&amp;#34; comfortable feel. Much cooler than any of cheaper consumer clippers that you buy at discount stores. I have used many brands over the years and none of them are this quiet and smooth. I should have bought these years ago.</li>
            <li> I used it to cut my hair and it cuts well and is easy to keep it maintain, Comes with oil.</li>
            <li> Bought these 3 months ago, these are professional clippers and they loosen up with every haircut I do, and even during haircuts...would not suggest them to any stylists working for a living...I&#x27;ve bought Wahl clippers that were 10x better than these...sadly, wasted money...</li>
            <li> I have used these clippers only twice so far, but they are cutting hair very nicely and feel good in the hand. The sound of the clippers is not an obnoxious buzzing either, which I appreciate very much. These are really pretty quiet. I previoiusly had a lower end clipper and I can definately tell the difference between the two.  I also bought the extra attachments, but found that the 3 combs that came with the clippers will be the only ones I use.  I should have waited before buying them, but live and learn.  The product was packed securely to protect the clippers and the shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Great clippers, still using them 18 months without a hitch.  These things have saved me an astronomical amount of money.  Im glad oster still makes a good product.</li>
            <li> Works great on trimming up our Shepadoodle. I was worried the buzzing would make her jittery but it wasn&#x27;t too loud.</li>
            <li> It has almost been two years since i purchased this clipper, and so far its been very good to me. Yes the guards they come with suck, but its all about the clipper anyways. I spent an extra 10 dollars at a Sally&#x27;s for the andis master guards, and they fit perfectly! The clippers sold at department stores all use a magnetic motor, meaning they move a lot faster, but do not deliver the same amount of torque a pivot motor can.  The benefits of a pivot motor is that its a lot quieter, and can cut wet and thick hair with ease. Some say that the clippers pulled their hair, its not the clippers fault! One must oil and clean the blades regularly for optimum performance. Its like a car, if you don&#x27;t service it, it will break down on you, or not function as well as it once was able to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Feels solid in the hands&lt;br /&gt;Quality blades (Looks and feels a lot better then my wahl)&lt;br /&gt;Does not need any adjustment when compared to magnetic clippers&lt;br /&gt;Solid power cord&lt;br /&gt;Very grippy on the sides&lt;br /&gt;Powerful motor,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The open/ close lever does not have markings&lt;br /&gt;Comes with okay guards</li>
            <li> Very nice.  They are powerful enough that they cut very nicely and evenly.  I will purchase more for grooming my dog.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair for decades. I have always used bargain brand clippers. I always had to tweek the motor and cutter settings to get them to cut satisfactorily. Since I save so much money by cutting my own hair I decided to buy a good set of clippers and got this Oster unit. It&#x27;s like driving a Cadillac after being stuck with a Yugo. If you need a good set of clippers, you can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> keep in mind that i haven&#x27;t had this clipper very long, but its solid, durable and as advertised so far!  i can understand some of the negative feedback some people give on the adjustable arm being made of cheap plastic and could break, but if you are careful i don&#x27;t see that as a big deal.  very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I think these are nice and strong clippers.  I think the cutter guards be nicer, but they do the job.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers! I have four boys and they always complained about my other clippers pinching them and pulling their hair!  These go right through all types of hair.  Thin, or course dark hair!  They were a great investment!</li>
            <li> It runs great and comes with several rake height attachments, so I returned the other item I ordered with similar attachments.</li>
            <li> These clippers are effective for different thickness of hair and length. I use these to cut my husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s hair and they look like a professional cut their hair. These are a definite buy!!!</li>
            <li> Very Good ! I would recommend this to anyone. Very quiet and easy to use. Very little maintenance required so far.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair for years now and have always bought the clippers you find at your local big box store. I have tried several brands over the years some last longer and cut better than others. My last pair were Remington, they didn&#x27;t last long at all. These clippers did  a very nice job of cutting. They didn&#x27;t get hot either. I liked they way the guards fit on these, they don&#x27;t pop off as easily as other brands I used. I  have only used once so in 6 months I will update.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work well, we have only used them once and hope that they last for years, only time will tell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trimming my hair and beard to 1/8 inch for almost 20 years and a pair of clippers typically lasts ~ 2years. These cut as cleanly as any others I&#x27;ve owned. I like the fact that these clippers have a very heavy duty cord. The cutters are more comfortable on my noggin than other brands. I&#x27;d buy &#x27;em again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I posted my 1st review with 4 stars as I assumed, by past experience, that the cutters would be like all my others and would be uncomfortable when used on edge. My bad. Fact is, these are the best clippers I&#x27;ve used.  My edited post above reflects my revised rating.</li>
            <li> I have been using this model for about four years because I became tired of the wally world type clippers for $20 that would break down in a short period of time. This product is used to cut hair on several boys and an adult, so it does get quite a bit of use. I have found that when used in back to back hair cuts the blades can get very hot and I have heard the boys complain of this, so give it a minute to cool down.  Between cuts and for storage I oil the blades without fail, I also oil between guide changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I considered the bigger 76 classic but opted for the fast feed because I knew I would be giving consecutive hair cuts and didn&#x27;t want to get tired of holding the MUCH heavier Oster classic 76.  A very good buy overall, and aside from have to replace a blade because I dropped it, I have only had to replace the blade level due to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have attached two images that show replacement part numbers if needed.</li>
            <li> Working great for 2 years now</li>
            <li> these are exactly what i wanted, professional clippers,  they do a great job, wish there were a few more guides but i guess they want you to purchase separately.  Overall a great machine that i am sure will last forever.</li>
            <li> For the past several years I had been using a cheap Wahl brand hair trimmer. It got the job done, but the guards and the blades began to wear out. I decided to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to a nicer model, so I purchased the \\&quot;Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper with Adjustable Blade\\&quot;. I trimmed my hair and beard twice with it. A few days ago, I went to trim my hair for only the third time and it would not turn on. I initially thought a breaker was blown or that the electrical receptacle was bad, so I tried a known good outlet. Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Including shipping, I paid over $60 (sold by DiscountsJungle)for a product that worked less than a few weeks and cut my hair twice. Very upset and disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Puerto-Rican and have insanely thick hair. I just used these for the first time yesterday, I they cut through my hair more easily than every other clipper I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my boyfriend for his birthday. They are great he really likes them. Very quality. They are a but heavy but he uses them to cut his own hair with no problem.</li>
            <li> I cut my 2 sons hair with clipper never had a issue, specially For the price I thought it was a good choice.</li>
            <li> I have owned this clipper for two plus years and still works like new. This is the best clipper I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> These are my second pair. Oster by far makes the best clippers on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth no overheating and never silent when in use.</li>
            <li> No issues yet, quiet motor &amp; trims hair without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;I know the clipper is meant for haircuts but i&#x27;ve used it to trim my beard. It will take a couple passes to trim a thick beard. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating. Otherwise it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> These clippers are great!  I used to by the Wahl brand and they required a lot of work going over the same spot over and over again to get all the hair cut.  Then after about a year, the blade would start to rust and would not be even, then it would start cutting my neck.  These Oster clippers a perfect, why did I not buy these to begin with.  I buzz cut my hair and some friends and these clippers have been perfect for over a year now.  I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> I love this clipper! I used to go to a barber every 6 weeks or so and pay $20 with tip. I keep my hair very short so it&#x27;s not a lot of work to cut my hair. With this clipper and a few attachments I now cut my hair about every 2 or 3 weeks. It has paid for itself many times over. I lubricate the blades after every couple of hair cuts and take the blade off and clean it every couple of months. It only takes about 15 minutes. With proper care I have never had pulling or problems cutting. My hair is thick and this trimmer goes through it effortlessly. I highly recommend this cutter to anyone who wants a clean comfortable cut.</li>
            <li> After using these clippers, I will never go back to the traditional pair of clippers you buy for haircuts. This is as close to professional clippers at a great price that you will ever get. I have saved so much time with these clippers compared to my old clippers.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son, my husband uses now. They are quiet and easy to handle, even in the delicate face areas.</li>
            <li> Purchased to replace Wahl Seniors. Have been cutting hair at home for 20 yrs. This clippers are great. Only knock is that I don&#x27;t really find them great for fading. Have a hard time zeroing the blade. couldn&#x27;t get a close fade. It may just be me...but other than that, clippers are quiet, quick and even cut. Much better than any Wahls I ever owned.</li>
            <li> I chose 4 stars because I have in the past used Oster products this model is VERY good for the price . My father who is a barber for 30 years also loves this model .Oster did a wonderful job fitting everything in a lightweight package. I recommend this to all, Beginners to expert.. keep up the good work Oster.&lt;br /&gt;Matt K</li>
            <li> This is my first set of clippers. So far I have had no problems. It runs cool and it&#x27;s easy to hold. I like the fact that you can hear the clipper cutting those little hairs when you are smoothing the hair cut out. I would recomend getting the Andis magnetic gaurds with these clippers since the guards that come with it are cheap and have a tendancy to fall off</li>
            <li> Tried a few until I bought this one... shoulda got this one from the start!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quiet, cuts well in one pass and shaves closer than others (000) out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;Lowest price I found for a pro/shop cut.</li>
            <li> I use this to buzz my head. It replaced a ~20 year old Wal-Mart clipper that finally crapped out on me. It is fast, clean, and does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few months now at home and it&#x27;s been working great with no issues.  Has a nice and solid feel to it and is actually really quiet while being used.  It&#x27;s already paid for itself saving me about 20 bucks a pop for a haircut each time.</li>
            <li> Greatest clipper ever used really quiet I cut hair all day and never gets to hot to hold ,great with the andis magnetic gaurds nd cut all clients hair with it well recommend clipper only con is you have to adjust to get a skin tight fade but other than that cuts all types of haircuts great.</li>
            <li> I have used numerous pairs of other clippers and none of the cheap brands seem to work well.  After 3 or 4 pairs of different Wahl clippers I decided to try these.  They are worth every penny for the quietness alone; it’s comparable to a soft humming versus the Wahl brand which would leave my ears ringing.  These cut through my hair so well with no snagging or pulling at all and very few passes are needed.  This product is perfect for what I wanted.  It does seem to be true, you get what you pay for.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fairly new user, but at this point I can say that this performs far better than any other razor I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  It&#x27;s fast, relatively quiet, and powers through everything I&#x27;ve thrown at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;ve not given it a full 5 is that, even when set to its lowest distance, I can&#x27;t get quite as close of a shave as I&#x27;d like for the areas I want to keep clean shaven.  Also, the guides are somewhat long and can make it a bit difficult to do any beard/mustache trimming near your nose.</li>
            <li> This Oster Clipper is fantastic product and it has been working 2 years now. Light family use on thick hair. Bought it after the Wahl Peanut Clipper died rather quickly. The Oster feels way more durable.</li>
            <li> I ordered the razor to do my own burr haircuts.  It arrived in record time and at an exceedingly good price.  I have given myself several haircuts using the razor guard which was fixed on the Oster razor when it arrived.  It has worked very well.  It is red in color and rather heavy to the touch so you know that it is made of substantial materials. So far it works well and I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> well I read the reviews and I don&#x27;t see it. its not as powerful as ive read. I use it to trim my cats and its just ok. I have a wahl trimmer that works the same as this thing. it could cut fast and easier to me!</li>
            <li> One of the best pair of clippers that you can own.  As a barber, I highly recommend these. I&#x27;ve used other clippers in this range, and they don&#x27;t compare at all. Any barbershop you go into, you&#x27;re guaranteed to see these.</li>
            <li> This clipper elicits a definite &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; when you first use it. Quiet, no hair pulling, smooth cutting with no &amp;#34;flyers&amp;#34;, and just an excellent overall performer. I keep my hair short so I don&#x27;t present a real challenge to this clipper but I have no doubt that it would do the job for a family with varying hair styles and lengths. I&#x27;m sure the 76 is worth every penny to those with the need, but the Fast Feed seems ideal for home use. The difference between a discount store package clipper and the Fast Feed is huge . . . and for very little more money.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a few years now. Cut my own hair with additional combs I ordered. It paid for itself a long time ago. Highly&lt;br /&gt;recommended.</li>
            <li> Expected more but it will do</li>
            <li> Best clippers we have ever had. Cuts quietly, no vibration. Worth the extra money to get quality.</li>
            <li> Great buy; cuts well and seems to be very durable.  It is a little loud when using it though. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy trimmer with lots of vibration. It trims only moderately well. The long cord is stiff, cumbersome and unnecessary for most in-home users. Trim-length setting and slide-on adjusters are primitive compared to competitor&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;The need to frequently oil blades is old-fashioned.&lt;br /&gt;We have used other Oster trimmers for years to trim our horses&#x27; manes and faces. The horse-oriented Oster trimmers are more expensive, but do the job for which they are intended. This version is going to the barn as a backup. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> This is my third clipper purchase.  The first was good, cut well, and lasted 5 or 6 years, till I lost them.  The second was terrible, I got them at a wherehouse store for $25.  I was happy when I lost them.  I only used my Oster for the first time today, but it is a night and day difference from my last clipper.  It gets a tiny bit warm in the hand if you use it longer than ten minutes.  Over all I&#x27;m very happy.   Cody</li>
            <li> These are far superior to any of the cheaper brands. I also know that these are not $200 dollar clippers, however they don&#x27;t give as smooth of a cut that I was hoping they would. They get the job done, but not as well as I had hoped. Would recommend for very simple haircuts though.</li>
            <li> Works fine cutting my son&#x27;s and husband&#x27;s thick wiry hair.  But shortly after the warranty expired it would not turn on.  We took it apart and tested all the connections and the switch and could not find any thing wrong.  Put it back together and it worked.....till the next time we needed it.  It is now apart again and my husband is re-soldering all the connections.  At this price it should work.  It is frustrating and I will never go with this brand again.</li>
            <li> I replaced the one we had bought about 10 years ago.  Amazon&#x27;s price was much better, and this one is the same quality as our original.</li>
            <li> A very good clipper. Had been looking at it a looooong time and finally pulled the trigger. Heavy and quiet and solid grip as well as serious cutting power...though I use it without guides as I want buzz cut...should come with more attachments for the price but overall...a great hair clipper in make and performance.</li>
            <li> i also own an andis fade master but these are soo quiet and never get hot like the andis. definate tool for any barber</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair for more than 25 years - a very flat flat-top - and this clipper is my favorite by far!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is VERY thick and consistently jammed &amp;#34;over-the-counter&amp;#34; clippers commonly found at most stores.  There are a lot of professional clippers that I&#x27;m sure are wonderful but I didn&#x27;t have much money and needed a reliable clipper for personal use.  I couldn&#x27;t say enough great things about the OSTER Fast Feed!  It is well balanced and I find the weight beneficial to steadying my hand on free-hand cuts - especially across the top of the flat-top.  The clipper and guides are easy to use and are made to last.  The guides make it easy to do much more than a &amp;#34;lice cut&amp;#34; and, with the use of the blending guides, it won&#x27;t be long before you&#x27;re turning out some pretty snappy haircuts and my boys keep coming back to Dad&#x27;s Whirling Blades of Style!  (Need help with your Flat-top, perhaps the addition of a hand-help &amp;#34;Flattopper Comb&amp;#34; is worth the extra cost. http://j.mp/1fQtxZA )</li>
            <li> Clipper kept shutting off during use.  I would start it back up and it would go down again, would have to continue to turn it off and then back on again just to finish the cut.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality clipper with just long enough cord.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cut thick hair.</li>
            <li> Came on time and works great!</li>
            <li> Awesome machine. Cuts the hair in a moment.</li>
            <li> Had some $20 Wahl clippers for many years and did the job just fine but these are more precise and offer a better cut all around.  I believe these are near professional grade but I prefer these because of the ability to adjust without guards on for close fading. Truly professional clippers do not. Perfect for home cuts every couple weeks.  In retrospect I would have ordered the set with more guards but that is a minor factor....</li>
            <li> Excellent product and good value, used twice per week for over a year with no problems.</li>
            <li> Great set of clippers with the classy color.</li>
            <li> These are some of the best clippers out there. They aren&#x27;t called fast feeds for nothing. You can cut your hair very fast and still have a great looking haircut. I definitely recommend these if you are looking to cut your own hair. These come highly recommended by barbers across the states. These are a must have!!</li>
            <li> I was used to spending near and around 15 bucks per haircut at the barber, which is a ton when it adds up.So, I decided to cut my own hair. Right out of the box, with its own (included) guards, the blades cut through my hair effortlessly.It had no nags(used it twice now),clean clipping, and did not heat up.MAJOR TIP; - Keep blades oiled.After your done with the clippers, unplug them, run drops across the TOP were the blades are(dont overdo) and turn them back on for 10 secs.Let them drip for another 5 min, clean the excess and then your done.This is a very IMPORTANT step because it prevents rust , which will reduce your edge which in turn starts nagging hair.The oiling step is very commonly over-looked.This two items are needed to complete the clipper.Magnetic 1-4 attachments[[ASIN:B003GXNOF6 Andis Magnetic Guide Comb Set]]  ,And the extra oil, which will last forever[[ASIN:B00063KI5I Oster Blade Lube 4oz]].</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers because I was tired of paying for a haircut when all I do is cut it short at one length.  My uncle has had the Oster Professional clippers for a few years and wholeheartedly recommends them.  However, I didn&#x27;t need clippers that fancy or expensive, and found these to be an excellent alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers aren&#x27;t very loud, and the cord is a good length.  I&#x27;ve used these a number of times and they give me a great haircut every time.  They clean up very easily, and come with 4 different comb lengths that provide me with many options for hair length.  I recommend these clippers to anyone who needs some clippers and doesn&#x27;t want to spend $100 dollars for a fancier pair.</li>
            <li> Wanted to see what all the hype was about. These just didn&#x27;t do it for me. The clippers felt cheap as compared to my andis masters. If you are into tapering/fading and want a great reliable clipper get the masters. I&#x27;m not hating on Oster because I do have the detachable Turbo 111, which is awesome. The fast feed, was not for me. Spend the extra $ and go with the andis masters.</li>
            <li> My barbering experience has just been upgraded with these clippers! These are by far the smoothest cutting clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned as an &amp;#34;around the house&amp;#34; barber. I cut my boys as well as my own hair, and actually enjoy it now that I have a professional pair of clippers. I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> Using these clippers for a short buzz cut (only).  I&#x27;ve had no problems so far and am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Had a previous Oster clipper for many years before I wore it out.  After reading all the reviews on several clippers I decided on this one.  Since I cut my own hair short, I was not disappointed with my purchase.  It cuts very well and has the same attachments as my older one did.  I believe you cannot go wrong with buying an Oster.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like writting bad reviews but this clipper overheated and the motor went out as I was finishing my haircut. When it arrived I was a bit sketched out because it seemed like the product was from Mexico. I figured it should not be a problem and loe and behold it ends up burning out. It&#x27;s a real shame because the cipper worked really well before the motor went out. The cut was smoothe and there was no pulling. Hopefully they stop sending out their bad products. I&#x27;m thinking of just going for the original 76 but I did not want to spend so much money.</li>
            <li> This was used for sure but i kept it. Cuts clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 years ago and it is still going strong. In the past I bought cheap clippers which only lasted a year before breaking. These are quiet and stay cool longer than any of the others I have owned. I sometimes did 3 haircuts in a row and and the other ones I would have to wait until they cooled in between; but this one while it still gets hot, it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the others. There has been no pulling unlike other ones that I&#x27;ve used. Now my boys are doing their own hair and it is standing up to the abuse of teens. This is expensive but worth it. I do recommend  buying additional sized combs and a carrying case for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my own hair since the 7th grade and I&#x27;m about to turn 33. I would say I&#x27;m qualified at this point to review a hair clipper. This is about the 10th clipper I&#x27;ve owned over the years and the first semi-nice pair of clippers I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Nicely made. Good weight, nice feel in your hands. Not too heavy, not light.&lt;br /&gt;+ For the 2 past two years it&#x27;s been very dependable. It just runs and cuts my hair perfectly every time.&lt;br /&gt;+ It comes with 4 combs. 1/2&amp;#34;, 1/4&amp;#34;, 3/8&amp;#34;, and Blending.&lt;br /&gt;+ The distance between the cutting blades and the metal comb attached to the clipper is adjustable with a lever.&lt;br /&gt;+ By taking the comb off, I&#x27;m able to get a pretty decent shave with the clipper on my face and neck. It&#x27;s decent for leaving stubble, not a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;+ It never pulls my hair, regardless of how fast I cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- My clipper has always been pretty quiet but as soon as I put a comb on it buzzes really loud.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s not the most powerful clipper on the market. I usually have to go over the same spot on my head 2-3 times before I get all of the loose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I oil the blade every time I use my clippers and so far they&#x27;ve been extremely dependable and still cut very well. I can&#x27;t tell any difference today from when I purchased them two years ago. I expect that these clippers will last for years and I will continue to enjoy them. One day I may upgrade to a more expensive pair, but for now these are the perfect price/performance balance for me. I would give 4.5 stars if that were an option. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> For just about $20 more than the Wahl clippers I got at Wal-Mart a few years ago, I now have a real set clippers.  The Wahls had gotten to where they were not cutting well at all.  These Oster clippers not only cut far better, but also are much quieter while doing it!  Everything about these feels quality-made.  I love them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always spent like $30 on clippers, and usually get 12-24 months out of set. But a friend bought these and recommended, and my wife and I are glad he did. Better than &#x27;consumer grade&#x27; quality at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> Great product. Cuts my hair with ease. It has paid for itself the third time I used it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Purrs like a kitten, cuts beautifully, looks and feels like quality merchandise.  Just don&#x27;t try to use with &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; Oster guards--they don&#x27;t work!  I had to purchase &amp;#34;fast feed&amp;#34; guards on Ebay, since the guards that come with this product are only for very short buzz-cuts.</li>
            <li> 2nd one cos I dropped and damaged the 1st one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;outstanding and been using it every other night to shave my head. quiet and cut close</li>
            <li> A lot quieter and a quick crisp cut. No need to go back on the same spot multiple times because the first time gets it done. We have only used it a few times, so I cannot speak to longevity, but so far it cuts better than the &amp;#34;ConAir&amp;#34; brand my husband usually gets for cheap. Down-side is that it has less attachments if you want a longer length than 1/2&amp;#34; cut.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a couple years now and no complaints. I cut my own hair and the cheap stuff from drugs stores wasn&#x27;t getting it done anymore. This decreased cut time by half. It&#x27;s as quiet as can be expected and even if it broke today I&#x27;d still get another one. I&#x27;d give it 4.5 stars if I could but this is a professional clipper and I&#x27;ve only used it on myself twice a month.</li>
            <li> Along with my masters this clipper is a workhorse and might actually run a little cooler than the master clippers actually! Casing is not as durable as the Andis Master though</li>
            <li> Zips right through my hair. Makes shaving your head every other day less of a chore when you have really good clippers. Nice quiet motor and just oil it every now and again after cleaning it out. Very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> This clipper works great, and I can cut my hair whenever I want to.  If you just want to cut it all short, it is very easy to do so.</li>
            <li> lever strips out too easy</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my boys hair since they were one and it seemed I was always buying clippers.  I decided to go with these clippers after reading the reviews and I am not sorry I did.  I use them about every three weeks.  (yes my boys hair grows that fast)  My kids no longer fight me to cut their hair.  These clippers are quiet and don&#x27;t pull their hair.  Hair cutting was such a chore until I purchased these.  If it doubt---pay a little more for these clippers and get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li> Love professional haircut. I would recommend that if you don&#x27;t have these in your toolbox you need to get them.</li>
            <li> Three or four years now and working well without any issues.  A good buy.</li>
            <li> Love love love these clippers. Have had several over the years. Very easy to handle and do not get hot.</li>
            <li> I buzz cut my head about once a week.  I used to buy cheap clippers at WalMart, they&#x27;d do a mediocre job from the start and go downhill from there.  These clippers are much more powerful and they cut quickly and evenly.  I&#x27;ve had them for a couple of months, but they feel like they&#x27;re going to last.</li>
            <li> This is a recent purchase to replace a 20 years Oster home-grade clipper.  It is much quieter than the old one even when that one was new.  3 family members have used it and were very satisfied with its performance.  I look forward to many years of service and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these in past and have worn it out.  Works great but would like to have&lt;br /&gt;better access to replacement blades.  RM</li>
            <li> These are of excellent quality and heavy duty. I have used them on different textures of hair and the still stand the test.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected when I purchased item titled new. Instead I had to return because of hair being in side the clipper blades. The handle was greasy with finger prints too. Pictures don&#x27;t do justice for what&#x27;s in between the actual blade.</li>
            <li> If you use it without an attachment, you will get cut. Badly. I.e., not for those trying to shave their head or face nearly (but not quite) bald.</li>
            <li> Clipper is easy to use and take care of I only wish it had a few more attachments as I like to wear my hair a little longer in the colder weather</li>
            <li> Reliable and does the job.  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of years now, and have had no problems.  I use it for my hair (not much up there any more) and for my face if i&#x27;ve let my beard go for too long to use my Norelco electric razor.  It&#x27;s much better at getting hair off my face than the Norelco, although it doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as close -- a plus if you are going for the five-o&#x27;clock shadow look.</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper – quiet, smooth, sharp (no pulling hair). These clippers are orders of magnitude better that any of the $15 to $20 clippers we&#x27;ve owned. Wish I’d have purchased these first instead of messing around with 4 or 5 cheaper ones, Can not go wrong here</li>
            <li> I use this clipper in the salon and it runs smoothly without getting too hot. Works well with the universal guard set.  Edit: I have been using this clipper daily in a professional setting for over a year now and it still works great. It easily cuts through a variety of hair textures, fine to coarse, without snagging or pulling the hair. The adjustable blades help give a seamless transition between lengths for smooth fades. Compared to the clippers some of my co-workers use, my Osters are quiet. I have purchased a second set for use at home.</li>
            <li> Buying a hair clipper is the most rewarding home economy tip. You don&#x27;t need to be a stylist as long as your partner is not very picky and you can save a lot by using it. This is one of the more expensive ones in the market but still you only need to use it twice for it to pay off and all the rest wilI be profit. I have been trimming my husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s hair for over five years now. I have used this machine for 2 years so far and here is a list of positive and negative features I have observed so far&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1- Good quality material: Compared to my old one which was a battery operated simple phillips device, this is a much sturdy item and does the job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-Powerful: Being corded gives this machine a huge power advantage over the battery operated ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3-Long lasting: As long as you do the maintenance like cleaning properly and applying oil to the blades, you can assume it will last a lot. I have no sign of wear and tear after two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- No storage bag included: These things need to be stored properly with all accompanying equipment and even much cheaper models often offer a storage bag for that purpose. This item is $53 and comes with nothing so you have to find one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-Gets very hot after only 10 minutes of use. The metal part gets extremely hot in very short time. My husband likes trimming the beard after I am finished with the hair but it is impossible due to the unbearable heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3- Corded operation limits motion (not very big deal if you have an outlet nearby)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4- Comes only with 3 combs: This is a very limited selection. You can not do much without purchasing the additional comb set which costs another $20-22 so the total cost climbs up to $73-75 and the additional combs you buy do not slide in like the original ones. They have to be hooked to the back of the metal plate by some force which makes frequent comb changing a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I can never complain something that has already saved me over $200 in the last two years but I think for its price tag this item is expected to be better or offer more. But still a good buy in the end. Recommended for all amateurs.in something that has already saved me over $200 in the last two years but I think for its price tag this item is expected to be better or offer more. But still a good buy in the end. Recommended for all amateurs.</li>
            <li> These clippers were gifted to me to replace the 15 year old Remington clippers I&#x27;d used for years. The first thing I noticed was hown much faster the blades moved, providing a much nicer cut. I&#x27;ve now had them for several years and they perform as well as they did when new.</li>
            <li> I have reviewed many a clipper, and took back a few after trying, this clipper is very solid, alittle heavy but it works great, I have thin hair and was having trouble with other clippers, this one worked the best, I did have to go over a few times but not a big thing, if you want you can buy a thin hair blade as a extra, oster is a brand to stick with for me</li>
            <li> The Oster Fast Feed clipper is worth every penny.  It does a fantastic job everytime.  I tried bying the 10 piece attachment to go with the clipper however those attachments do not connect with the Oster Fast Feed.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY OSTER PRODUCTS. THEY ALWAYS BREAK DOWN ONCE THE WARRANTY ENDS!!!!    Disappointment after disappointment after disappointment. I have tried many of their products and soon after the warranty ended, they all end up in the same place....in the garbage can!</li>
            <li> This is the best clipper I could afford. I&#x27;m not a professional. I bought this over a Wahl, only because it was the brand of my dad&#x27;s clipper that I remember from my teen years. Shaved my head twice with that one. At this point in my life, my goal is to buy some things only once; things that might last &#x27;a lifetime&#x27;. I hope this is one of those. To an amateur, it&#x27;s gonna feel heavy/ run cool and quiet/ shave very smoothly. A very solid clipper.</li>
            <li> I used 2 different clippers through the years both of them were wahl. I have a short fading hair therefore I skin fade all the time. so I thought Oster will be faster and better to do fading but I didn&#x27;t see any difference than other wahl clippers, even my old wahl may be  a little better doing fading.     Pro  1- May be not sure this will last longer than cheaper wahl clippers, I only had it for a week and used it twice I still need to use trimmers to finish the work    2- it does not heat as much as wahl clippers    3- smaller size than wahl clippers    Cons    1- PRICE, PRICE, PRICE, come on, for the same job it does the same as cheaper clippers and it comes without any traveling bag    2- it does a bad job shaving your face, I used wahl clippers to shave my face as quick shave, but it seems oster is very bad with short hair clipping.     I gave it 4 start because it does all the jobs that cheaper clipper does for ME</li>
            <li> Like alot of others, I had a Wahl before and wanted to &#x27;upgrade&#x27; to something, I hoped, would be more powerful, durable, and, especially, quieter. But I found this to be actually worse. I think it&#x27;s alot louder--especially with the guards on--to the point that it&#x27;s annoying to use...it is NOT \\&quot;Whisper Quiet\\&quot; at all; it&#x27;s not really any more powerful, that I can tell anyway; and if you&#x27;re looking to have the option of the 0 close trim with no guard this will not do it--at least the Wahl did that.  The only better thing I can tell so far is the guards clip on tighter and stay on, which I&#x27;ve always had trouble with the Wahl&#x27;s.   To me, this is not worth the more than double price, and I&#x27;ve been clipping for 20 years.  This will probably be the first thing I&#x27;ll take the trouble to return through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Best clipper I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair now for about 30 years; the Oster is very quiet, keen, and finely tuned. I will probably be able to use it for the next 30-40 years, God willing. It was also considerable cheaper online than in retail outlets.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Quiet and well made. It is the same model used by my barber.</li>
            <li> works well. cuts good</li>
            <li> best machine i ever had</li>
            <li> I have a lack of hair on my head which is made up for by excess hair everywhere else. This works on all of it. It works quickly and has never locked or pulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve dropped it a couple of times and it isn&#x27;t worse for wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can probably use it on your pets too (provided those pets have hair/fur - IE not recommended for birds, reptiles or fish.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more could you want?</li>
            <li> I use it mainly for trimming my goatee. It works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Very good, quiet my first haircut was so easy, I did it myself nice and even</li>
            <li> The clipper didn&#x27;t work properly from the moment I turned it on. Kept on stopping while I was cutting the little hair that I have. Had very little power. Returned them for the Wahl Senior Clippers. They blow the Oster&#x27;s out of the water. Really happy with my new Wahl&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I am not a barber, but that doesn&#x27;t stop me from cutting my son&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased cheap clippers before and they don&#x27;t last.  I&#x27;ve had these now for 6 months and they show no signs of slowing down.  The motor is strong, and works its way through my son&#x27;s thick hair and easily handles my thinning hair.  It comes a nice assortment of guards to cut at different lengths, and the adjustable blade can fine tune the length by extending out another 1/8 inch.  Solid construction and all metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple of negatives.  With the blade all the way down for the closest cut it doesn&#x27;t quite get close enough to the skin.  That&#x27;s good if you&#x27;re worried about nicking a little ones skin, but not so good when cleaning up the neck and around the ears.  Also, the lever that adjusts the blade tend to come loose.  It does have a screw that can be tightened so it&#x27;s not a problem, more of an irritant.</li>
            <li> Great deal, has paid itself over many times. Cut your own hair and save the hassle and money. easy to use, easy to clean! Love it.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that&#x27;s been available for years so I was surprised it was generally unavailable for a few months in late 2013.</li>
            <li> Crazy good quality and very efficient for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. He loves it. He is very particular, and we went through about 3 chippers before we found this one that he likes.</li>
            <li> So far I love these clippers.  They are quiet and powerful and the attachments that come with the clippers are really easy to take on and get off.  The best clippers I have owned</li>
            <li> I got these clippers in the hope to save some money on cutting my own hair instead of paying someone else to do it. I have been using these for 7 months now and really like these clippers, they replaced old worn out clippers from the 1960&#x27;s (from my parents). I had previously tried clippers in the $20 range and they were too cheap and dull, didn&#x27;t last very long so I figured I should try a more professional grade. So far these have fit the bill perfectly for my needs. I wouldn&#x27;t use them for animal clipping (I believe they require more power and better blades) and not sure if I would use these if I cut hair as a professional. These seem like they will hold up over time as long as I am careful. The adjustable blade feature is OK, but I tend to set and leave it at the most forward position and use the plastic guides from this set (as well as previous sets that fit well) for adjusting the cut.</li>
            <li> I love love love my clippers. These were recommended to me from a barber that I admire. I love that they are super durable. I can  cut through any hair types with ease. Its easy to hold which makes for easy fading and styling. I love that you can use basic plastic clipper guards I recommend the Andis Nano silver magnet clipper guards. I use my clippers every day and would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a professional styling and easy to hold machine. Its pretty quiet as well. The only draw back I have seen after having them for about a year now is that the metal is starting to move in the direction in which Im cleaning it most but that can be adjusted over time. Really easy to clean and maintain. Hope you enjoy yours as much as I do mine.</li>
            <li> Best clipper I have purchased.</li>
            <li> ** Please see two edits at the bottom. **    I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for many years. More than I care to admit. I&#x27;ve always used an electric (similar to this Oster) model, using a 3/8 inch comb. I&#x27;ve probably bought and thrown away ten machines over the years.    I have to go over and over my noggin probably fifteen times to get a decent, but still too long, haircut with the Oster. I expected much better from this fairly expensive machine.    This clipper is severely underpowered. The machine seems to be well constructed and would probably last me forever and a day if kept clean and oiled. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to keep it, however.    So, for what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m sure most people will love the Oster, at least based on the other mostly glowing reviews. However, some people (like me) with difficult hair, will not like it.    EDIT, 2/28/15:  I Just tried cutting my hair with this Oster clipper again, and for the last time. This review is way down the list chronologically so I don&#x27;t think many people will get to it. Nevertheless, I had hoped to keep the review updated with my new impressions, but this will be my first and last edit.    This hair cutting effort was the worst experience I&#x27;ve had with this clipper yet. I made sure my hair was clean and dry before using the machine, and cleaned and oiled the teeth and cleaned the comb before using the clipper. I also tried adjusting the machine with the lever, all to no avail. I&#x27;ve always used all of my hair clippers (and I&#x27;ve had quite a few) with their original 3/8 inch comb. With the original equipment 3/8 inch comb this clipper just won&#x27;t cut now, or at best barely cuts perhaps a half inch off my hair, leaving my hair much longer than the desired 3/8 inch. Once again, my hair was clean and dry, and the machine clean and oiled, and adjusted with the lever.    I found an old, very inexpensive clipper I haven&#x27;t used for years and decided to finish cutting my hair with it, using its original 3.8 inch comb. With it I managed to give myself a more or less proper haircut, down to my desired 3/8 inch length. This old clipper, while not very good, cut my hair far better than the expensive Oster being reviewed here.    I&#x27;ve completely given up on this Oster and have changed my rating to two stars. Perhaps mine is defective...I don&#x27;t know. I would like to return it, but realize it&#x27;s far too late to do that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far and it works fine. It cut smoothly and the motor is relatively quiet. I&#x27;ve only had it for a week or so now so I&#x27;m not sure how durable it is but it seems fine.</li>
            <li> My wife says it is not the best. I think it does a good job, but think she was looking for one that was a bit more powerful.</li>
            <li> we have been using these clippers for awhile now.  nothing wrong with them,  they work great.  I can see them lasting for years</li>
            <li> I have had many different clippers over the years.  Most around $20.  They usually don&#x27;t last that long or struggle to cut thick hair.  I wanted to buy a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; set this time around.  I was extremely disappointed. These immediately bogged down and stalled.  I was able with lots of nursing to cut my hair but it was slow and they grabbed hair the whole time making it painful.  I&#x27;ve actually been meaning to call Oster to see if I ended up with a defective set.</li>
            <li> I had an old Wahl made in China (purchased from Wally World) set that I have used for 15 years.  Its funny, you dont know how awful they are until you get something better.  I know this is a mid range model (the professional models may be much nicer, but also pricier) but this is perfect.  I only cut my own hair, and sometimes my boys, but these are so much quieter, sturdier, better cutting that I even bought one for my Dad for Father&#x27;s day.</li>
            <li> Hubby has researched this clipper for months and he&#x27;s used it alot so far cutting the boys&#x27; hair when needed.</li>
            <li> I give these only four stars because I had trouble finding the right guards to go on them.  I ended up buying the generic guards that fit most Oster Clippers.  They don&#x27;t fit perfect, but they get me by.      Clippers are quiet, and cut great through thick hair.</li>
            <li> I can set this clipper at the length I like without attachments and buzz my own head with the help of a hand held mirror. Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> These clippers are as great as everyone reported.  Very nice quality and the accessories are fine, too.  It&#x27;s great that it comes with everything, rather than some products sold these days where you have to purchase every attachment or accessory separately.</li>
            <li> Started cutting my own hair and bought this based on other good Amazon reviews.  I just shave my head to a 1 so it&#x27;s fairly simple.  The clippers run cool and don&#x27;t get hot.  They make light work of my thick hair.  Attachments that come with it are nice but would be better if they came with something to hold it all.  I just used my old clipper case to store it.  My problem was that I had only used it 5 or 6 times before it broke.  I adjusted the blade height lever (attempting to oil it)and before it reached the top position it became very loose.  When I tightened the screw back up I realized the lever was broken.  The up / down  blade height lever pivots on a very cheap piece of plastic that sheared off when adjusted.  Now there is nothing to hold the blade in position and the clippers are useless.  I can say they functioned well when they were in use though.  IF I were to buy it again I would not adjust the blade height in fear of the same thing happening again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need a ton of attachments so I decided to spend a little more on the cutter itself. It cuts well and it&#x27;s nice to have a small height adjustment built into the blade. The one point (and it&#x27;s a big one) is that I can&#x27;t yet comment on is how long the blades will keep their edge. It does come with  a tube of mineral oil to use on the blades to keep them from rusting.</li>
            <li> Just had my first cut with the Oster and it&#x27;s head and shoulders above the $40-$50 Wahl I previously owned which would always miss hairs and took forever having to go over my head 3 times.      The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this 5 stars is, one they don&#x27;t have a 4 1/2 star rating and lastly because of the poor quality of the plastic guide combs which don&#x27;t seat very secure over the cutter.  I would recommend getting the separate Oster accessory kit that I saw for around $25, which I plan to purchase next.</li>
            <li> I read a review of a soldier who took his overseas.  I&#x27;m working in Africa, so like a fool, i just plugged it in and it worked GREAT for 2 minutes, after which it stopped, and I smelled burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this was my fault for not reading the directions, I was in a hurry!  You could use a voltage step down adapter I guess if you&#x27;re where the electrical system is 220 volt.</li>
            <li> A good quality clipper, much better than those available in most drugstores and well worth its price.  But the Universal Comb Set, advertised with it, doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> As i said in the headline this is a great clipper, it is a solid piece of equipment that gets the job done. Like anything if you treat it nice, it will treat you nice. With that said i  was using these clippers to shave my head weekly and my biggest gripe about them is that they just dont get close enough. I used the Andis T-Edjer and was much much much happier. The only problem with the Andis is that there are no extensions. One size only - BALD! Lol.. So if you are looking for a solid set of clippers, look no further the Fast Feed is awesome and you will not regret it. However if you are going to be shaving your head constantly, pick up the Andis clippers instead. I can be lazy with the Andi&#x27;s and use it every 2 weeks where the Fast Feed forces me to trim weekly, and i&#x27;m lazy!! Either way i&#x27;m glad i have both. And YES I Zero Gapped my fast feed, which helped, but still has nothing on the Andis. Hope this review helped.  4/5 because a clipper with no extensions should as a rule, leave a head butt naked!! I&#x27;ve had my clippers for 4 years and i like them, but after using the Andis, i&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> Amazing clipper althought i had to adjust the blade because it was off. But now they cut like butter! I love my fast feeds</li>
            <li> it cut through my hair like knife through butter and i have Afro hair ....i know when clipper is bad when it keeps getting stuck on my hair but this one exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great tool, use it all the time. Good price too I really hope it would that good for more than two yrears</li>
            <li> Very light and quite clipper that cuts very precise!! Use the andis magnetic guards for this clipper... They fit perfect. Great price for this clipper here on amazon!! Very nice complement to your oster classic 76 if you don&#x27;t already have them.</li>
            <li> Excellent clippers, highly recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this product to remove some matted fur from my dog. The clippers work very well and cut nicely, even through thick matted fur. However, the blade becomes too hot after about 5 minutes of use, meaning bigger jobs have to be completed in multiple sittings.</li>
            <li> Works amazing. Quickly became adjusted to it after returning the andis masters because those had all metal casing which got hot really fast. I did however buy a ceramic blade so that I can zero gap them perfectly because it cannot be zero gaped with the stock cutting blade. Other than that the clippers are great with the purple magnetic guards from andis and I would recomend it to anyone!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this to learn how to cut hair, and this thing is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It gets all the hairs on the first pass. I just wish it was easier to find good combs for it</li>
            <li> Great clipper probably the smoothest cutting clipper around also a great beginner clipper doesn&#x27;t get hot at all and if you buy one of these three clippers use the Andis magnetic guards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oster fast feed-red with chrome blade&lt;br /&gt;Oster speedline- black with gold blade&lt;br /&gt;Oster topaz- black with black blade</li>
            <li> Get the Topaz it&#x27;s color black!</li>
            <li> I read tons and tons of reviews before deciding to take the plunge and just purchase these clippers.  I have to say from when I opened them to the first use I was blown away by the build quality, the quietness, the low temperature, and the power this trimmer possesses.  I purchased this almost exclusively to keep my beard trimmed short and styled or \\&quot;lined up\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that for my uses the Oster Fast feed is not an excellent product.  No matter how hard you try to zero gap these clippers you cannot get a bald closeness cut, like if you are trying to clean up and outline a beard.  The closest it will go is leaving a very very light shadow.  I spoke to a couple barbers and they agreed that it&#x27;s not the ideal tool for beard trimming and styling.  Even though it gets hotter they suggested the Andis T-outliners or the Oster t-outliners.  If I can offload my fast feeds for a fair price I might have to try to go with a pair of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So despite how much I love these clippers, they just do not fit the purpose I expected to use them for.</li>
            <li> If there were zero stars this would get them, just tried them and the motor ran once and that was it, what a POS.</li>
            <li> Like other buyers have noted, this is a real machine that cuts your hair or beard evenly.  It cuts vs. pulls, unlike the cheap drugstore brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only criticism is that the plastic attachments are very cheap and the teeth do fall off over time.  And if you tend to move quickly while cutting you need to be careful that the plastic length attachment (or whatever it is called) does not slip off leaving a hairless racing stripe over your well quaffed pate...</li>
            <li> I was tired of wasting time and money going back n forth to the barber so I invested in these bad boys. Can&#x27;t do no wrong. Best clippers on the market too me. Couple these with Andis T Outliner and your good to go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice.  Could come with a more comprehensive comb set.</li>
            <li> after first week the blades screws got loose I have to tight them everyday .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional.  I&#x27;m a guy with a beard and a low-tolerance for shoddy tools.  I got fed up with clippers from the drugstore than were loud, vibrated like a particularly vigorous sex toy, did a lousy cutting job, and broke after a year or two.  The Oster is AWESOME.  Very quiet, the vibration is quite modest, it gives a superb even cut, and seems to be holding up very well indeed.  Besides doing my twice-weekly beard trim, I&#x27;ve cut a cheapskate friend&#x27;s extremely dense hair with it twice.  The results of those hair-cutting adventures were certainly FAR better than the results when he had me do his hair before with the crappy clippers and scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic guards, which I at first thought might prove to be cheap junk, turn out to be good-quality plastic and are serving me extremely well.  No tips breaking off, which usually happens in the first WEEK with the crappy drugstore trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I think it is great that these are made in the USA.  I&#x27;m all in favor of spending my money on American-made products when those products are actually worth the money involved, and these clippers assuredly ARE.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use this clippers yet but I can already tell it&#x27;s much sturdier than the other brands I&#x27;ve been using to cut my son&#x27;s thick hair.</li>
            <li> Very good Clippers. I have been barbering for many years and these clippers just make my job easier.</li>
            <li> I bought cause I thought they&#x27;d be good on a dog hair ? I was Wrong !!!! I have Oster classic 76 that I use my hair and I&#x27;m not using them on my dog ... I  should buy some sheep sheers ?  These work great on my breed and human hair</li>
            <li> I initially got this after looking to replace a cheap $15 oyster trimmer. The trimmer was a real P.O.S. and was very poorly made. When it broke down to the point of being unusable, I knew I wanted something heavy duty. This is it. It is not made to be a trimmer (I don&#x27;t know how I got it in my head that it was), but it does a great job as one. I have a short to medium length beard most of the time and one of the smaller attachments does a great job of keeping it in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power cord is very sturdy and does away with having to worry about batteries. The clippers are very quiet and only let off a quiet mechanical hum. The blade will get hot after extended use, so if you need to use them with the guard off at some point, I would advise doing so before a lengthy cutting session if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, a high quality well made product that seems to be a rarity in today&#x27;s disposable culture of planned obsolescence. This sturdiness means it weighs a little bit more and must be plugged into the wall, but for me it is well worth it. A great product.</li>
            <li> Great clippers they fade really well I cut my own hair I have only owned wahl clippers this is the first time not buying a pair of wahl clippers to cut my hair. I use these clippers twice a week they are quiet but they do get really hot after about 15-20min. Shipping took longer than I thought and the combs that come the clippers are trash I bought a set of andis purple magnetic combs and work great with these fast feeds no more flimsy combs that fall off. I think it&#x27;s a step up from my wahls they seem well build also made in the USA so even better. I would recommend these to a friend or family member.</li>
            <li> Great clippers. Clean non stoppable clipping and hair grooming. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Heavier and louder than my Remington clippers. Returned them before I had a chance to use them.</li>
            <li> We had a  Conair clipper a few years ago.  My son hated it. It pulled hair.  Even my husband was not a fan.  Back to the salon!  Then we really needed to cutback.  I researched clippers.  These were a bit more but had great reviews.  My son wanted to try it himself.  No pain! A super clean cut!  My husband equally loved it.&lt;br /&gt;We spent more and got the set of combs with it.  That way we had all the numbers we needed.  It is so worth buying the clippers.  Although I was the cutter not the cutter, even cleanup was so much better.  I was never able to get hair out of our last clippers.  Definitely good buy!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, smoothly operating clipper that does not pull or snag hair, and is easy to hold and use. For about twice the price of the cheap one, this is easily ten times the clipper, and a very good value.</li>
            <li> still working ok but lost its cutting edge to soon for me</li>
            <li> Really good product. Obviously it is not the highest grade with Oster having more expensive options out there. For this price range though this is the best product that you can buy. Works much better than the cheaper set I have had for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> Still have for many years, works great. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent clipper, lives up to its Oster name</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. My boys have very thick hair and it just buzzes through. It takes 5 mins to cut their hair now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried the product once so far, but I it cut very easily.  Also, the cut was very even.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. I cut my hair once every week and it does the job nicely. The clipper strength is on point and does not snag my hair. With a more powerful motor than most commercial hair clippers, it shaves my entire head in no time. Only con is that I wish it came with a carry case.</li>
            <li> Very solidly built. With other clippers I always was annoyed how I would have stray long hairs after buzzing. With this one everything is uniform in length. I&#x27;ve got thick hair and this cut like a gem. I would recommend buying the add on attachments if you want more variety in lengths.</li>
            <li> I thought these hair clippers were a good value, to have been fairly inexpensive, and serve our purpose well.  I don&#x27;t think they would hold up for heavy duty use, without having to clean them frequently,  but we are happy with them.</li>
            <li> I tried this version of the hair clipper when it went on sale for $50, and realized I was getting what I paid for. The adjustable lever that moves the clipper blade along is easy to overextend, and the blades are not interchangeable. Also, this is pretty hard to move on a scalp without gouging chunks of skin. If you want something that just does the basic job for pretty cheap, go for it, but don&#x27;t expect much out of this one. I wound up getting rid of this one and picking up an Oster Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper and the associated blades that allow me to select a good length of hair trim. I&#x27;m sure this could be fine for use on a casual basis, but it definitely isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;d call a workhorse clipper by any stretch of the imagination.</li>
            <li> These clippers are really nice. They cut good and don&#x27;t get hot as fast. I can cut my hair and the clippers are barely getting warm. If I had pick something bad about the clippers, it would be that the on/off switch feels cheap. Overall they have been good clippers for my personal use.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Worth the price.  If you think this might be what you&#x27;re looking for today, give it a try.</li>
            <li> I really like my oster clipper. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months. My wife cuts my hair and she likes it too. Cuts smoothly and fast. Strong motor and very good quality. Very good price too:)</li>
            <li> Oster clipper quality is top notch. I had a Oster clipper before and used it for more than 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional barber and wanted to add this clipper to my arsenal, but I think I&#x27;m going to have to stick to my Wahl Senior, Andis Master and Andis BGRC. This clipper cuts very slow. It may be a good tool to have to blend lines, but for overall heavy duty cutting, this clipper is not going to cut it. For about the same price, I would suggest a Wahl Senior.</li>
            <li> Overheated and fuse blew on first use! Sent for a refund, hopefully it goes through. Would not recommend oster hairclips</li>
            <li> AWESOME . this is my 7th hair clipper and the best so far. I have thick hair and the blares of the others keep getting stuck</li>
            <li> I wanted some hair clippers that was more profession and did a better job than the average store brand. After research and reading all the reviews I decided to go with these clippers. They work exactly as expected maybe even better. I recommend buying these clippers.</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer after my old one died after 15 years of use.  This trimmer works great for keeping facial hair neat and trimmed.  The included guide combs are really short but they are exactly what I wanted.  As most reviewers don&#x27;t mention facial hair cutting ability you will not be unhappy with this purchase.  Guides that come with the razor are #4 1/2&amp;#34;, #3 3/8&amp;#34;, #2 1/4, and a blending comb.  Look no further.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good.  I think I would prefer the (several hundred) dollar models better but I think for the price it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with how quickly the motor blew, and the cut is nowhere near professional quality.  The repair was about forty bucks.  I&#x27;m unlikely to buy again.</li>
            <li> A silent hair cutting monster.  Love this thing so far.</li>
            <li> Pays for itself in a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;Great for maintaining a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for cutting hair with the guides, it works&lt;br /&gt;but doesn&#x27;t layer or add the fine touches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike most, it is heavy duty and works on wet or dry&lt;br /&gt;hair.  Best used after cleaning hair and combing it straight.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have thin hair so I have to use one of these guys to clip my hair every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I&#x27;ve had many clippers before this one and this one is definitely the best. It is strong, the grip is good, it clips fast and I don&#x27;t have to repeat as many times on the same spot as I had to with the previous ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean and I wish it was wireless though...</li>
            <li> Great clippers! Husband uses them all of the time after deciding hair was over rated. We haven&#x27;t had any issues with overheating and they are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> quite... ez clean up... the two things i need</li>
            <li> Great clipper!  Super quiet if you have a noise or vibration sensitive kid.  Still working great after 30+ haircuts.</li>
            <li> Will up date review when replacement comes.&lt;br /&gt;Feels solid and well built. Nice long cord that seems durable. My first pair was defective. Waiting on replacement from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.com is so great about that kinda stuff. If amazon is not the cheapest i still order from them. The peace of mind is wortg it.&lt;br /&gt;As always A+ on customer service</li>
            <li> Very happy with these clippers. Great upgrade over the $30 ones I would buy at Walmart.  Definitely worth the money. Keep them clean and oiled and they should last a long time. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Is a really good clipper, after using an Conair clipper for cutting my own hair for a year, changing to this one is a really good upgrade, is not heavy but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, is really fast and doesn&#x27;t make any sound, the only problem is the guides, I have to buy the Biggers ones which is OK, but I couldn&#x27;t find with the same amazing quality of the original one, which fits as ring to the finger to the clipper!</li>
            <li> This is a great machine, it runs with a quiet power my only Whal just does not have.  My Girlfriend snuck onto my Amazon Wishlist, and got this for me.  I figured out buzzing my own hair a few years ago.  I had been using a cheaper Whal hair cutting system.  It would bind up if I cut too fast, and it was loud...  I was waiting for it to die before upgrading to one of these USA made Osters.  I had been looking at the 76.  But...  I saw another review where the guy said if you arent cutting hair for the marines, you don&#x27;t need the 76, which made some sense to me.  For the price of the 76, you could get 2-3 of these.  The only thing I had concerns about were the combs.  This only comes with a few small combs...  I wanted more.  We got the large assortment of Oster spring loaded clamp on ones that Amazon suggests to bundle.  The assortment combs are a different style, so I wasn&#x27;t sure they would work.  They work with this clipper just fine.</li>
            <li> Great just what I expected</li>
            <li> Love the Clippers very precise</li>
            <li> Worked fine for about 11 months then the motor experienced a sudden loss of power and it wont even clip hair without ripping it out. I would not buy this model again.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this for a while and it is consistently cutting hair well.  I use this on my 3 boys and there is never a complain about snagging hair.</li>
            <li> quiet, well-made, and works beautifully. i wish i had bought this years ago.&lt;br /&gt;far better than the wahl trimmer i have just thrown in the trash. i have a serious beard,&lt;br /&gt;and this measures up.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy the the Oster Fast Feed, they cut Great, smooth, fast and much less vibration than any other I have ever used and they are just the right size for a comfortable hand grip and to maneuver.  I have cut my own hair two times with them and a pleasure to use. I have tried at least six or more other clippers including cordless types and I can Honestly say these are best in ever way , very glad I spent a little extra and got these, my search is now over.</li>
            <li> good exactly what we wanted....we had others and this is what we wanted..heavy duty. good cord, quite&lt;br /&gt;and thats about it</li>
            <li> Read the other reviews and delighted I bought these clippers. I will concur with the other reviews I read....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to add my own take after reading the reviews -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I expected the clippers to be heavy, it was lighter than I expected but I am a big guy, so best if you expect heavy clippers.... unless you are a big, strong guy, and then they may not seem so heavy to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My clippers did get quite warm... it is winter here in the North East, so that was a plus, have no problems with the heat being generated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, this a is a good, strong, reliable pair of clippers unlike the rechargeable variety one finds in the drug stores... those were really a waste of money. If you don&#x27;t keep charging them all the time, the battery gets very weak and they do not work well, Who wants to keep charging clippers that you might only use once a month? I strongly advise getting this instead of the rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only advantage the rechargeable clippers had was that they come with blade extenders to make the hair longer or shorter (you must buy each length you want with this unit)... it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use this without any extenders, but it does not give a super close trim.... if you want to go truly bald... this is not the best clippers for doing that. you will need to shave after clipping your hair.</li>
            <li> This clipper is not for beard and mustache - for haircut only. The blades can be moved using a clip for closer finish. It comes with  4 different size clips - 1,2,3, &amp; 4. I have been using it for a year now, and it still work well. It doesn&#x27;t get stuck during cutting. This clipper is worth the price, and i will highly recommend for home cutting.</li>
            <li> these clippers are a fantastic finishing tool for fades, when in the right hands, they produce a sharp cutting finish.  Excellent for a skilled professional.</li>
            <li> This clippers are awesome, well made,and  they don&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I clip my dogs hair and these work really well. I am happy with them and the first time I used them it paid for itself. I am glad I got it.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT SHAVER. LIGHT AND CUTS WELL</li>
            <li> Only clippers I use to cut my hair/360 waves</li>
            <li> I really like this product and its really  worth the price. Well built and cut your hair like a pro.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to replace my set of Andis clippers and so far they work much better. They are quieter and cooler than their Andis counterpart with only one small issue keeping them from being a 5 star product. The cutting blade in the blade assembly is too coarse and does not cut as close as its predecessor but does have plenty of power for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these Osters because the pair of Wahl clippers that I had were dropped and the blade guard had chipped off a piece, causing direct exposure to the blades, as well as because the combs that came with the Wahls were loose and became VERY noisy when the clippers were turned on.     I&#x27;ve got to say, these things are a VAST improvement.    The blade guard is slightly rounded, causing no discomfort or irritation when doing the finishing touches (sideburns, nape of neck, etc) compared to the Wahls squared, harsh, almost sharp guard which frequently caused irritation and sometimes cuts. Perhaps the cuts were because the blades weren&#x27;t perfectly aligned, but either way still not as good as the Osters.  The motor is FAR superior. It cuts my extra thick hair with such ease and silence it&#x27;s astonishing.    The Wahls I had had a chrome exterior and got quite hot with lengthy use. The high quality plastic only gets slightly warmer.    These things are just awesome. Plus, professionals use em&#x27; so that&#x27;s cool too.</li>
            <li> These clippers are a significant improvement over anything available at local big box stores.&lt;br /&gt;They cut closely and effortlessly and are easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re also a lot quieter than cheaper magnetic motor clippers I have used previously.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Most people don&#x27;t realize the importance of a clipper&#x27;s internal workings. This Oster Fast Feed features a pivot motor, which is the high quality motor not usually found on a typical cheap set of clippers. This Oster&#x27;s lifespan is measured in years, not weeks or months. The durability alone would make the price point worthwhile. Over the years I&#x27;ve repeatedly bought sets of cheap clippers that have failed. But this Oster has held up for me very well, and I&#x27;m extremely happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oster Fast Feed is a level above anything I&#x27;ve seen available at the big box stores under $30.  These are the clippers to buy if you are tired of your cheap clippers failing, and want the next level up.  It&#x27;s not the highest (professional) type, but there&#x27;s no reason why these clippers shouldn&#x27;t last at least 5 years of home use. It just needs periodic oiling, which is also included with the kit. I recommend this set to friends and family.The body is heavy, solid, and stable. I enjoy the solid feel of the on/off switch. Best of all, the Oster Fast Feed is enormously quieter than anything with a cheap magnetic motor--which makes haircutting much more relaxing.</li>
            <li> Great item to my collection</li>
            <li> For the past 3 years I have been cutting my own hair.  I used to always buy the $20-$30 Wahl clippers from walmart and they&#x27;d last me 6 or 7 months (sometimes less) and then wouldn&#x27;t cut worth a darn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These oster fast feed clippers feel amazing compared to those cheap wahls, and they really aren&#x27;t that much more!  I have fairly thick hair and they cut it great.  I don&#x27;t notice long hairs sticking out like I did with the Wahl&#x27;s, unless I went over every spot 3 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the magnetic Andi guards along with these clippers and I&#x27;m very happy, they hold firm and feel great.</li>
            <li> the reviews were right! My husband has had so many issues with other cheap clippers, so I got him this one due to the popular reviews. High quality parts and it doesn&#x27;t feel like cheap plastic. Cuts great so far!</li>
            <li> I used the old clickety clackity ones for a long time. These are way better. Cut even and fast. Plus they are quieter as well.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Premium Clippers!  Solid construction and of highest quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-  Although it is not directly mentioned, these clippers are limited to the closeness it can cut - &amp;#34;000&amp;#34; 1/50 and after speaking to Oster the blade type (adjustable) can be replaced but can&#x27;t  be changed (0000 1/100 or 00000 1/125). So, if you want to get closer cut/shave reach out to previous customers and my comments so you don&#x27;t make the same mistake I have made &amp; be disappointed. If you are looking for a very close cut ( almost shaved) ---the is Slime Line 2 Trimmer is the way. Plus it has dual ( cord and cordless) power and can be used in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, thanks to several of the previous buyers for their valuable input!</li>
            <li> They do a great job and they are well built....well worth the money!  would recommend this model and brand to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Everything you can ask for in a clipper. The motor run very quiet and smooth. This is perfect for home or salon use. The blade cuts right through so you don&#x27;t have run the same line over and over. I wanted a good quality set of clippers  between 50-100$ and I found one. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> All the bad reviews for this product is probably because they didn&#x27;t take care of them on a CONSISTENT basis. But anyways, THIS CLIPPER IS AWESOME! I saw from opening the clipper box that the blade teeth were the same as the steel blades from Andis BCRV Detachable Clipper. From there, I knew it was going to cut. It&#x27;s light as ever unlike the Andis Master. The motor is much more powerful than my Andis Master and can cut more evenly than my Andis Master. This clipper has the same leverage as the Andis Master but it doesn&#x27;t have those side marks when you&#x27;re adjusting through the blade lengths. The Andis Master would get really hot in the little amount of time. I cut my hair and my boy&#x27;s hair with this clipper and there was only a little bit of heat comparing to the scorching touch of the Andis Master. I love the blending comb attachment. It made my taper and my boy&#x27;s taper much cleaner and an accurate blend. I use my Andis Nano Magnet guards and they do fit this clipper. If I could give this 10 stars, I would. If you consistently clean the clipper with the bade oil and blade wash, then there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem with the clipper at all!!! HIGHLY AND ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND IT!!!</li>
            <li> These clippers have held up well. I use them weekly to cut my hair, they do great.</li>
            <li> top quality, will last a lifetime</li>
            <li> My husband was just hired as an airport security guard and he is required to maintain a buzz cut, so I did the research and read pages of reviews before deciding on these Oster Fast Feed clippers. My husband has extremely fine hair, so I was a bit concerned that the clippers wouldn&#x27;t be effective and in fact, on the first pass we both thought they didn&#x27;t work because we couldn&#x27;t hear any hair making contact, but sure enough the clippers made a perfect track right up the backside of his head! They were very effective, quiet and smooth, with very little vibration and no excessive heat. We used the 1/2 inch guard to achieve a very uniform cut. I removed the guard to clean up the neckline and then used my scissors to trim behind the ears. I have never used clippers before, but the haircut looks like a professional job. We are delighted! My daughter ordered the Wahl Pro Chrome set to maintain her husband&#x27;s usmc regulation cut. When it arrived, I compared it to my Oster set when she wasn&#x27;t looking (didn&#x27;t want her to be jealous!) and I&#x27;m happy to report that the Oster Fast Feed set is worth the extra money. The Wahl clippers were heavier and uncomfortable in my hand, the cord was thin and much shorter in length, the guards were flimsy and though Wahl included a case, it was difficult to stuff everything inside. The case is definitely not a deal breaker. I&#x27;m keeping our set in a plastic shoe box, which can be found at your local Walmart et al for about three dollars. I did not turn on the Wahl clippers, so I cannot report a comparison in noise or vibration, but I am very glad that I chose the Oster clippers, given the other noted differences. And so far, so good!</li>
            <li> quality of razor is good but device sent to me(address in uk) is on voltage 110 v.I spent another £12 to buy transformer!</li>
            <li> Nice, quiet, quick cut, good comb attachments, seems like a quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> After reading that Mr Money Mustache cut his own hair and others&#x27; experience I finally decided to give it a shot.  (http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/05/30/get-rich-with-the-universal-mens-grooming-device/)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to start cutting my own hair after having had yet another disappointing haircut by a barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised after wanting a few videos how easy it was to do a buzz cut hairstyle.  The clippers work flawlessly and far better than the cheapo ones I purchased 10 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added the  Oster Professional 10 Universal Comb Set so I had combs to cut varying lengths.  In general, I stick with a #1 on the sides and a #2 on top for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve probably done my own hair every 2-3 weeks since and the clipper paid for itself within a few cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus I  don&#x27;t need to go to the barber who never remembers me and if I need a quick touch up, it takes just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers state, it does NOT cut &amp;quot;very close&amp;quot; as the product description says. I have a pair of $40 Andis clippers (they broke TWICE which is why I bought these) that cut very close - the closest you can get whilst the stubble of the hair remains outside the skin. This Fast Feed&#x27;s closest cut is about 3 days&#x27; growth after shaving with the Andis. Terrible. If you&#x27;re looking for a near-razor shave, look elsehwhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I noticed that the cut was VERY rough compared to the Andis. Passing through my scalp was rough.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my Oster Fast Feed Clippers.  They are easy to handle and cut very precisely. I think if you buy these clippers you will be glad you did.  I have already made my money back by cutting my own hair instead of paying $20 each time I go to the Great Clips. Definitely a great deal.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use on my kids who are nervous about loud clippers.  They think it&#x27;s great, it is very quiet and still cuts better than my old clippers.  FYI, this exact same clipper is advertised for 12 dollars more as &amp;#34;Quiet trimmers&amp;#34; as though it&#x27;s a special edition or something.  Check the model numbers and save the $$.  This came with 5 plastic guards, oil, and a little brush to clean the blades.  High quality.</li>
            <li> The very best clippers on the market. And the best price!!</li>
            <li> These are great clippers do not get hotat all if cutting one persons hair still extremely cool if cutting multiple people compared to whal and andis. I used walmart brand whal clippers, and two proffesional clippers for at least 7+ years. Hands down Oster clippers work better, cooler. I bought these with intent to get the pro Oster classic 76s. Will definantly buy the 76s for interchagable blade system less guards to use. I also got the guards that slide on they are a way better design than the Oster guards with clip on. keep these clean and oiled and you will have a great clipper for years. Extremely good buy.</li>
            <li> They are doing great.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oster hoping to replace an older Wahl model.  This Oster claimed to be whisper quiet and powerful.  Only half of that is true.  It&#x27;s no quieter than my old Wahl.  It cuts the same and weighs the same.  I ended up replacing the blades on my old Wahl and am now using that instead.  The Oster is now a standby for me...</li>
            <li> I wish it came with more comb attachments like our previous one. The longest attachment is only 1/2&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s a bit shorter than what I prefer for my young son. It is fairly quiet, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I had a cheaper brand and it worked ok. But now with this oster I have build my confidence and started doing my own fade haircut.&lt;br /&gt;This machine cuts hair accurately.</li>
            <li> This really is professional quality.  It is solid, quiet, and cuts efficiently.  It comes with a variety of guards for differing lengths and is exceptional for hair and beards.</li>
            <li> By far the best clippers I have ever purchased</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers about 2 years ago and they broke after about 6 months. I was surprised since they are high end industrial clippers and expensive so. They are completely unusable since the main screw stripped out that holds the blades in place it cost more to fix them than what they are worth and I don&#x27;t think I would spend the money since they broke after using them about 6 times. I had to buy another pair since they are unreturnable and have been sitting in the closet ever since they broke.</li>
            <li> Solid, reliable, affordable clippers. They rock.</li>
            <li> Best clippers I have ever owned</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband who refuses to be clean-shaven due to skin sensitivity. He has used Braun, Philips, and other well known shavers but since those are shavers not trimmers, the trimmer blade gets dull fast and starts to pull hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He uses this weekly to trim his beard, and the has nothing but praises for the product. It doesn&#x27;t catch or pull hair. Just cuts it smoothly - no fuss, no skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside however. This is quite heavy and not ergonomically designed for the face. It does take a bit of skin stretching and hand/arm contortion to reach tricky corners like the neck-head join and chin edge.</li>
            <li> Hair clippers were relatively quiet and cut the way I expected with all the essential accessories&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Very powerful clipper, without being really heavy like so many of the other powerful clippers. The size is slim, so it&#x27;s very easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Over all great clipper. Easy to use stays cool for multiple cuts and cuts clean. Must have for any barber.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t know how crappy my original clippers were until i splurged to buy a better brand and heavier duty clippers. These are amazing, it&#x27;s definitely a bifl item if you take care of it, the quiet is an added benefit as i didn&#x27;t mind much the loud noise on my old ones as i was just being cheap by cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I used these clippers they stopped working after about 20min.  I don&#x27;t know if they overheated, or hair got caught in the motor/blade, but the blade just stopped running.  I&#x27;ve used drug-store Wahl clippers in the past, and they&#x27;ve worked well... until they don&#x27;t, which is after a couple of years.  So, I figured I&#x27;d pay up for a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; model.  Well, I&#x27;m going back to Wahl, but will try their \\&quot;Designer Professional\\&quot; model: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDNCJO/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_act_title_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;m&#x3D;ADTIEFXMUOV0B</li>
            <li> I like the way it cuts and blends. my only complain is that it seems to heat up faster than my masters and seniors. but they are good clippers</li>
            <li> love it i feel like a real barber now</li>
            <li> Love these clippers! I have been cutting my husband&#x27;s course, thick hair. These glide through like a hot knife in butter! Love these clippers!</li>
            <li> I bought two of these.  One for myself and one for my in-laws.  good weight, cuts great and very sharp.  Maybe because it&#x27;s new, but works great.  highly recommended. I bough the extra attachments.  I dont know if you will use all of it, the one that comes with the product already have some good attachments.</li>
            <li> this clipper no t value for Professional name on it ,&lt;br /&gt;it is good enough to use at home for your family&#x27;s members</li>
            <li> great product. very quite and works smooth.</li>
            <li> works as published&lt;br /&gt;It consumes only 0.2 Amps...not 12 Amps as published</li>
            <li> Works fairly well, but if I had to purchase one all over again, I&#x27;d get a more powerful one...one that cuts through hair better and isn&#x27;t so difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and I have been using the cheap clippers which pull your hair out. these are very quiet and are very sharp and they seriously work great. will cut right through your hair for a even cut also use them for my beard which work great. the guards that come with it are just fine and work great and I don&#x27;t see a reason to order any other ones like some people are saying. I had no over heating when I cut my hair. I took it out of the box oiled up the cutting surfaces and went to town with no complaints. these are the best clippers I have ever owned and for the price are perfect. 5 star *****</li>
            <li> Had this unit for almost a year. Battery kept got noticeably weaker with every charge, now completely dead and cannot be revived. A waste of money. Good reviewers have not had unit long enough to experience battery failure. Beware!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually one to never complain about something I bought, but this clipper is not good for normal hair. Yea it&#x27;s sturdy and a solid clipper, but if you want a smooth, crisp, and a to-detail haircut, this is not for you. I thought this is what the average barber uses - they use andis i guess.</li>
            <li> These clippers are listed under pet-dog clippers and they are not !!!!!! So misleading me into buying them and now I have to not only eat the cost in shipping them I have to eat the cost in returning them !!!!! Not good and Not happy !!!!!!</li>
            <li> The clippers are good but you should order the smaller seperate blades to cut shorter fades. U can do regular cuts but for the shop look u should get the sharper blades</li>
            <li> My second pair of clippers. I upgraded from cheap 15 dollar machine to this and it works perfect.</li>
            <li> I learned the expensive way. I bought a bargain clipper at Target only to discover it did not work well. (What a surprise!) Bought this Oster Professional through Amazon, and it cuts just like the opening hair cutting scene in Full Metal Jacket: zip zip zip! When my hair grows in to the point where it&#x27;s unruly, I zip it and save 20$ at the barber. This is the best haircutting regiman I have ever had and see no reason that I will change in the future. Anything that simplifies my life at this point is good thing and the Oster Professional is clearly one of those things.</li>
            <li> These clippers are a great bargain.  I&#x27;ve had more expensive clippers in the past, but these are just fine.  They get the job done and run smoothly.</li>
            <li> These clippers are a little weak. The motor is ok.. .. i would say it is ok,, nothing great</li>
            <li> I have been barbering for a little over six years now and I have gone through several pairs of adjustable clippers. I&#x27;ve never found a pair that compares to changeable blade clippers like Oster 76&#x27;s so I stopped lookings for that. I don&#x27;t use adjustables for close cuts or fades, I generally only use them for normal clipper-over-comb style cuts and rarely open them all the way up. The Oster Fast feed is probably one of the best adjustable clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. They are quiet, light weight and keep relatively cool. As I said I don&#x27;t use them for high or bald fades and wouldn&#x27;t really recommend them for that style of cut (I would instead recommend the Andi&#x27;s speed masters or Whal Sterlings). But for regular business or gentlemen&#x27;s haircuts along with do-it-yourself haircuts at home, I would highly recommend these clippers. For the quality and price you can&#x27;t do much better.</li>
            <li> The Oster fast feed is a classic among barbers and professional hairstylist.  The fast feed has a pivot motor in it which is very powerful and smooth cutting compared to clippers you will find at Walmart or other chain stores.  Compared to my previous $30 Wahl clipper the Oster cuts a lot smoother and easier.  I don&#x27;t find myself going over the same spots repeatedly as I had to do with my Wahl.  Because of this it really does make giving myself a haircut very easy and enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box contains the clipper a blade guard, four different guard lengths, cleaning brush and some blade oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside of this clipper is that the plastic that it&#x27;s made out of feels as though if you were to drop it would crack. Also, the on off switch feels flimsy and loose and that in time it could be an issue, I have only owned mine for three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all for the price this is a very high-quality clipper that has a lot of professional users that give it great reviews. For home use this should last a number of years and provide a high-quality haircut if the blade is kept clean and oiled prior to use.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s made to do, and does it well. Pretty much delivers on the advertising. Time will tell if it lasts, but for the moment, I&#x27;d say this is the best buy for the money out there.</li>
            <li> For years I used a Wahl clipper for home use.  I usually bought a mid-priced model ($40 to $60) and was generally happy.  However, the last Wahl clipper I bought did not hold up well and became useless within a year.  After reading many reviews, I decided to try the Oster (paid $55 for it).  So far I like it.  I have used it for about 2 months, cutting 3 heads of hair every 2 to 3 weeks.  It cuts very smooth and, contrary to some of the reviews, does not vibrate much at all, and is fairly quiet.  I use it on thick hair and it plows right through.  It seems to me that it has more power than the last Wahl I had.  On the down side, this clipper gets hot to hold after about 10 minutes.  I am not a professional so I take my time on a cut, running the clipper about 15 minutes.  Many reviews said the clipper stays cool, but I am not finding that true with mine.  This worries me for the long-term use for this clipper - only time will tell.</li>
            <li> As I did my research was impressed with the ratings of this product. Outstanding reviews made the choice easy.  Many thanks, Amazoners. Took the plunge and hoped for the best.  Now, following considerable use, I can  emphatically state that this is a excellent hair clipper.  Its quality and performance exceeded my expectations.  Hair is not pulled and noise level is fine.  Noise level appears to be a problem with some clippers. If that is your issue then I suggest you use ear plugs or cotton balls.  The kit includes oil, various guides and a small brush.  I have no problem storing it in its box.  Yes, I pamper this clipper--- use a toothbrush to thoroughly clean it and apply drops of oil, before and after use.  It has already paid for itself a few times over and am confident with care, will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful machine, as other reviewers have also noted.  My only disappointment is with the guides that allow you to set the length at which you cut your hair.  There is a #1 guide (called \\&quot;blending\\&quot; by the manufacturer) and a #2, but no #1.5.  I contacted Oster and it turns out that the company does not make one for this machine.  It&#x27;s no inconvenience if you like your hair longer or shorter, but I miss the #1.5 guide.  Wahl features one for its line of home clippers, and (of course) it&#x27;s available to barbers who use the professional models made by Oster.</li>
            <li> So far I em very satisfied with the seller and product. Arrived 4 days earlier then suppose to, that was great. Cuts well and doesn&#x27;t get hot, just warm.(30 minutes cutting)&lt;br /&gt;its not super powerful but does the job well. Its sharp and does not pull hair. They can be adjusted to cut very close. I posted a close up picture of my adjustment on the blades closed position.(4th picture down)</li>
            <li> I previously had the oster mini and it shaved heads much closer and with less repetition.  Still compared to some other clippers i have had it is pretty good.  For the price I would buy it again depending on how long it ends up lasting.</li>
            <li> I regularly cut both my sons&#x27; hair as well as my fathers.  I have gone through a few sets of cheap Whal clippers.  While they were adequate, they would often pull my sons&#x27; hair and it was painful for them.  My oldest son has thick coarse hair and this was a big problem for his hair particularly. He hated getting his hair cut.  I decided to invest in a better pair of clippers.  I read a ton of reviews and these are great clippers.  They are much quieter running than my previous clippers and they have not pulled my sons hair.  Hope to have these for many years to come!</li>
            <li> Great product...not the best for a close shaved head.</li>
            <li> ive been using it for about 4 months, and its extremely high quality.</li>
            <li> Husband uses it 2x week and after 2 years says that it&#x27;s still troopin on. Not the greatest one he&#x27;s ever used, but of decent quality and fairly quiet.</li>
            <li> IVE BEEN USING THIS MACHINE FOR OVER A YEAR&lt;br /&gt;IT HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR ME, I AM A BARBER IN CALI AND SWITCHED FOR WAHL TO OSTER LAST YEAR&lt;br /&gt;THIS DOES IN MY OPINION BETTER JOB THAN THE WAHL SENIOR&lt;br /&gt;I USE THIS MACHINE ON THE DAILY, IT CUTS GREAT ( MOWHAWKS FOHAWKS FROS TAPERS FADES ETC..)&lt;br /&gt;NO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRICE FOR ITS SERVICES&lt;br /&gt;I COMBINED IT WITH THE ANDIS PURPLE MAGNETIC CLIPS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL A GREAT MACHINE&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE USED THE ANDIS MASTERS AND I WILL ALWAYS HAVE THE FASTFEED AS MY #1 FAV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF INFO WAS GOOD GIVE YES, THANK YOU&lt;br /&gt;LOOK AROUND, READ REVIEWS, COMPARE PRODUCTS BEFORE BUYING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HONEST BUYER</li>
            <li> Wish they made one half the size as this as it is a little clunky on beards. Does not seem to cut down to the skin as well as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> When our last Oster died, after almost 15 years, I did a bunch of research to find a quality replacement, and felt really good about the recommendations this clipper got from folks.  I am adding my enthusiastic approval to the pile.  You can buy less expensive clippers, but as I learned, you will not be happy with them.  About 5 years ago we tried to replace our previous Oster with some other $20 brand (not going to name any names) because it would periodically stop working if you tipped it the wrong way.  BIG MISTAKE!  The cheap clippers pulled our hair, ran hot, and gave uneven results.  We ended up taking the cover off the Osters and finding out that one of the wires had wore through (after 10 years of giving three boys and one husband hundreds of haircuts), so we clipped the wires, stripped them back, soldered them together, and put shrink over the wires to protect them, and got five more years out of them.  When I was researching clippers, I figured out what I was doing wrong in maintaining the previous clippers, and so I am even more amazed that a low-end pair of clippers, that were abused, held up for so long.  I am looking forward to many more years of faithful Oster service from my well-maintained clippers.  Spend the money!  For under a hundred clams it is worth the investment!</li>
            <li> Good quality clippers. I use them once a week to shave my head, and keep by bear neat. I&#x27;ve had them for about a year now, and they work great. No vibration, no shaking. The blade is not 100% lined up with the grid, but it doesn&#x27;t really impact the quality of the shave. The case could be a bit nicer. Overall a solid performer. (I tried other brands before, and this is clearly the best I experienced)</li>
            <li> These clippers were exactly what we wanted.  They run more quietly than the clippers&lt;br /&gt;being replaced.  Cutting quality is also good.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper based on a military mans review. I couldn&#x27;t resist opening it before my wife got home from work. I gave myself a haircut to try it out. Pulled out the quarter inch attachment and away I went. When I got done I couldn&#x27;t believe how even everything looked. Fast clippers that mow evenly through hair. I had a cheap pair prior to these. I got a few yrs. out of them but had I known about these I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted money or uneven hair cuts. Buy them. They are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Powerful&lt;br /&gt;Attachments fit well&lt;br /&gt;Cleanly cuts after only 2 passes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Power button and length lever both are made of plastic and feel very, very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;A good product, that has a couple of cheap features on it.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this for his line ups. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Iffy.  Requires cleaning, and little combs break easily.</li>
            <li> It works very well. Much better than any of my previous clippers.</li>
            <li> I had a pair of these clippers and dropped them and broke the blade. the damn thing worked so damn good, I went out and bought a second pair. I love these things.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my dog. He has very thick fur with a soft undercoat that stymied all the clippers I&#x27;ve had in the past.  This one cruises right through it and does a great job and as we live in south Florida, its something that I have to do for him.  Paid for itself on what would be the second trip to the groomers.  Great item and nice color to boot.</li>
            <li> heads up folks: as has been mentioned, this is pretty useless without a good set of guide combs. ours is sitting unused as we continue to use the old, worn out wahl - which did come with a nice set of guide combs - and all for less than 20 dollars. i&#x27;m finally getting around to ordering a separate set of them now so we can put the old wahl to the rest it deserves. in our consumer society, people choose the cheapest thing available and companies pander to our desires by cutting costs. in this case, i&#x27;d say oster is doing the wrong thing. so until they get a clue, pony up the extra to make your BMW road worthy or buy 3 wahls and get used to slow haircuts.</li>
            <li> My first expensive set of hair clippers and by far the best, never again will I buy cheap cutters. It was a pleasure using it, no fighting and pulling.</li>
            <li> I bought this Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper for my oldest son a few years back, and after he moved out, I bought another for my younger son.  This unit slices through thick and damp hair very quickly with no pulling and no pain.  We&#x27;ve used these while still sweating from workouts on hot days and this unit provides a clean, even and fast haircut every time.  It is relatively quiet compared to my old Remington, and is easy to use and maintain.  It feels solid and comfortable in the hand, and appears to be well constructed with high quality materials.</li>
            <li> Good clipper, definitely a step-up in quality from the cheap $20 clippers at Walmart. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The first box that I received was missing all of the included accessories, but had 2 user manuals.  Preferring accessories to user manuals, I had a second unit sent over and it included everything.  I was using a $60 Wahl clipper before this, and the Oster definitely makes a more uniform cut.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but dang near.  I don&#x27;t need anything other than a 1/4&amp;#34; attachment, so I wasn&#x27;t missing anything with the limited accessories.  I would recommend this to anyone that wants to buzz their noggin.  I might write an update in a year if I remember and see how it has held up.</li>
            <li> I thought a machine of this price and advertised as &amp;#34;Professional...blah&amp;#34; would  indeed provide a decent service.  The reality is that this machine is too slow for cutting hair and therefore the user would have to pass it through the same area more than once.  It isn&#x27;t design for thick hair at all, perhaps for kids&#x27; hair it might do an OK job... I&#x27;ve gotten better machines more a lot less money.  The only thing it has as a plus, is that it is quiet... then again, probably because it is slow... :-) I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wanted to wait a few cuts before my review. All I can say is AWESOME! I use it solely on my 9 year old and he no longer complains of pulls. It is so much better than store bought clippers. Cuts hair like butter!</li>
            <li> The clipper does not cut adequately, not sure if it is a design or power issue, but it is frequently snagging, so I have to take much longer to cut.</li>
            <li> Very solid in the hand -- not light-weight (cheap).  Does a GREAT job on my fine hair.  It&#x27;s just nice to have quality rather than the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> No comparison to the $14 no-name set previously used.  Bit of a premium $, but no doubt these will provide high quality service for many years.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The attachments have an odd angle compared to my replaced clippers.  I have trouble raising my arms, so it would be fine for a person who can use their arms normally.  It is much quieter than my old clippers.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was tired of the poor quality of the Wahl motors, with them burning out after once a week use for six months. I wanted a more robust, professional unit. The Oster Fast Feed is definitely that. The blades look more robust, the on/off switch is definitely more solid, and the motor sounds stronger but only a touch louder than the Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first use, I can tell that this product cuts differently than the Wahl. I use the clippers in the closest setting, which in the Oster is termed \\&quot;000\\&quot;. I basically keep the hair I have at a very tight crop, practically bald but not quite. I cut it once a week, so the clippers get about 10 minutes of work once a week. When I used to cut my hair with the Wahl in the same setting, I was practially bald with just a touch of stubble. With the Oster, my hair is not quite as short. There is a noticable length to the hair, not just stubble. For me, that&#x27;s perfectly fine because I felt the Wahl cut too close for what I wanted. I prefer the Oster. However, if you want to stay as tight as possible with almost no noticeable hair, then this may not be the product for you.</li>
            <li> This blade works as intended, cuts well and is definitely a notch above the $20 blades you buy at WalMart.  I did run into problems when I wanted to start using a shorter height blade (0000 and 00000).  The minimum length with the Fast Feed is 000 and it does not accept replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So....  I decided to upgrade to the [[ASIN:B00070E8LA Oster 76076-010 Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper]] and I would recommend this to anyone who shaves their head frequently.  It uses a completely different and much more powerful motor than all the other clippers out there.  The blades on the Oster 76 are detachable so you need to buy the 0000 and 00000 blades separately for about $20 each.  It is a lot more expensive, but worth it, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have real thick hair.  Cheap $25-30 models will not cut it.  These will cut it, but I have to take my time or they will jam up.</li>
            <li> We had the 1990 version of this clipper for over 20 years before it finally quit and used it thousands of times (on pets too). I was pleased  to see this one hasn&#x27;t changed a bit from the older version.</li>
            <li> Great clippers. Never fail me.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;Good construction and materials.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and easy operation.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great clippers. Exactly why I was looking for after years of using the best walmart brand I could buy, these are absolutely ideal for the home enthusiast cutting his families hair. Powerful, smooth clippers. I cut mine and my boys hair and they are a joy to cut with. My dad has a pair for cutting his 3 dogs hair as well and enjoys them. Out of the package the shortest guard had a defect with a tooth that sticks up further than the rest. Not a deal breaker and I&#x27;m sure if I called the company they would have replaced the guard, however it works fine and I&#x27;m not going to go thru the hassle to replace the guard. Beat wishes and enjoy.</li>
            <li> Fast feeds. Cut clean with less passes, don&#x27;t heat up like masters, and quality manufacturing. The only negative i&#x27;d say is the lever that opens and closes the blade seems flimsy... However I havnt ever broken one. (Own two sets that both work perfect) highly recommend these clippers for professional use. I still use the Oster Model 10 clippers for the meat of my cuts, and the fast feeds for touch up and fades.  The chrome limited editions were definitely worth the ten extra bucks too...I&#x27;m the Only kid on the block with my fast feeds and T-finisher chromed out.</li>
            <li> Great clippers. Very low maintenance. Powerful.</li>
            <li> It cuts better than any wahl i&#x27;ve ever had but the whisper-quiet motor is a bunch of B***S***. It was quiet for the first couple minutes, maybe 5. Then it gets noisy and has an annoying buzzing sound.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t do a very close cut at the shortest setting with only the metal clip, otherwise they work great</li>
            <li> The clippers don&#x27;t cut very well . I have to keep going over the same spot . They are dull. I won&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> Have recovered the $$$$ spent on clippers already from the haircuts of two men.  Easy to use and results are good.</li>
            <li> I replaced a 10+ year old $40 set of Wahl clippers I got at Target. I never had a major issue with the Wahl clippers until recently, when some of the guards started to fall off mid-cut. They are still chugging along to this day, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping for the same longevity out of these Oster clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had the chance to cut my hair twice with this new set so far. The first time was a bit tough...I had a routine down with my old set and am still trying to figure out a new routine with the Oster&#x27;s. Blade length, which guard to use, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are certainly way more quiet and a touch cooler than the Wahl&#x27;s. I feel like I find myself going over my hair multiple times less often with these new clippers, feeling like they don&#x27;t need as many passes over my scalp to get all the hair cut evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my second cut last night, I feel I&#x27;m getting into a bit of a groove. Certainly happy with my purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend picking up the [[ASIN:B001T0HHB0 Oster Professional 10 Universal Comb Set Specially Designed to Fit Oster Clippers]]. These guards are better than the guards that come with the clippers. They have a spring mechanism to keep the guard more securely fastened to the clippers.</li>
            <li> Another quality product from oster.</li>
            <li> Great product, strong like the one other Oster I&#x27;ve had in the past.  It could come with more clipping guards though.</li>
            <li> I have owned many pairs of clippers and these are the best.</li>
            <li> Great clipper for the price.  If you don&#x27;t need a &#x27;pro&#x27; clipper then this is the one.  Be careful if you live where its humid as the blade will rust.  Oster sent me a new one and I have since just kept it in a sealed bag with no issues.</li>
            <li> What I didnt like was that when i saw them on Amazon it said they would come with a change out blade when i received them there was none.  great clippers tho real, quiet for the most part, dont pull on your hair, great overall</li>
            <li> That said, it&#x27;s solid and reasonably priced for professional clippers. I may update my review depending on future performance. For now, it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> I replaced the chain mega store clipper with this more expensive, but far superior Oster clipper.  It cuts easily and cleanly and I should have bought it years ago!  A great value for a superior product.</li>
            <li> Noticeably lighter than the Andis Masters. Super easy to zero gap. I personally prefer Andis products but again, it&#x27;s just a preference... Good product, fair price.</li>
            <li> Iv been cutting hair for yrs and these clippers are perfect to add to the collection... i rate it it at its quality and heavy duty hair clippers....cuts so smooth ul feel like \\&quot; is it even cutting \\&quot; then ul look at the hair falling lol....  would recommend these any day ....</li>
            <li> Now if I could just get my 15yr old to let me try it on his mop! When he&#x27;s ready, we now have the tool.</li>
            <li> I had Wahl clippers previous to this for home haircuts and they usually got dull after several months. This clipper is fairly light in the hand and much more quiet and provides a more even cut. The body of the clipper seems to heat up quite a bit. I suspect if you gave multiple, back to back cuts it would get really hot. It comes with clipper guards that are equivalent to a #1, #2, #3, #4. Overall, this is a really nice product so far. Hopefully it will hold up longer than the Wahl clippers I&#x27;ve used in the past. It certainly seems to be a higher quality construction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick that hair that grows in a lot of different directions. The Oster Pro had no problem cutting through the hair and didn&#x27;t leave any gaps; a problem that has plagued the lower end consumer models that I&#x27;ve used in the past. The action on the adjustable blade is solid, and the comb attachments feel secure and I never worry about them popping off. The weight might be unwieldy for some users but it wasn&#x27;t an issue for me.</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected. It is not powerful enough and cutting requires much over shaving. I would never buy it again</li>
            <li> We had an old set of clippers from Wahl. We thought we needed to upgrade, as my wife gives our teenaged boys haircuts and I cut my own hair. If a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; used these &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; clippers, he or she would soon be looking for a new line of work. Little power, a blade adjustment that didn&#x27;t work properly...why the heck did I buy these things? Maybe Oster to stick to making blenders? Will be looking for the top grade Wahl model, as the old set lasted for years and countless haircuts. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> The guide comb I use the most broke after a handful of uses forcing me to order a new set.  (The side bar that holds it to the clipper broke.)  Other than that I have no complaints to date.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s quiet as hell when used without a guard. When you put the guards on, it turns into a 2-stroke weed wacker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It vibrates the hell out of the guards and is the noisiest shave I have ever owned. Doesn&#x27;t come with many guards either, just the short ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good news is, it cuts nicely, and has a wide range adjuster for the head.</li>
            <li> I chose five stars because of the strength and coolness it holds. I use 4 different type of clippers for my customers and the Oster Fast Feed Clippers are the work horse of the bunch.</li>
            <li> Terrific machine quiet, well made and cuts well!  I think it is better than the Wahl but time will tell.</li>
            <li> I currently own whal and andis clippers ,but have never owned oster clipper but I must say that it was money well spent.They are quiet and cut smoothly and fit comfortably in my hands.</li>
            <li> My wife can cut my hair in record time. Great product will pay for itself in no time. Use it on my beard also.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a while and it is far better quality than cheaper chinese-made trimmer.  Heavy duty cord and relatively quiet operation.</li>
            <li> Really wish I&#x27;d sprung for the top of the line model.  Cutting medium dog hair (border collie).  Clippers bog down a lot.  Requires taking hundreds of little bites at the job, then smoothing the result later.  Plastic guides are useless, they collect hair in the far tooth and bog worse.  Dog doesn&#x27;t mind for the first half-hour, but gets impatient for the next hour.  This clipper literally took 90 minutes over three days to complete most of the dog.  The dog eventually tired of it and so did I.  So, now he&#x27;s 90% complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, these clippers are far better than Wahl.  They don&#x27;t heat up like some said, but I couldn&#x27;t get them to fast-feed, so maybe they would.  They are quiet.  I never returned anything to Amazon, wonder how to do it?</li>
            <li> It broke  after two times using it. Just stopped working!</li>
            <li> Can i use metal blades with this clipper?</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair for a few years now. I basically just buzz it all the way around, facial hair included. After another cheap pair of Wal-Mart special clippers broke down on me, I decided I wanted to spend a little more and get a quality pair of clippers.  I read through many reviews, watched quite a few videos, and ultimately decided that this would probably be the best fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I can definitely say I made a great choice! This thing cuts my hair like a hot knife through butter. One pass is all that is needed, which is quite a contrast to the clippers I had used before. When I first turned them on, I was also impressed by how quiet they are! This was one of the deciding factors for me, since other comparable clippers I looked at videos for sounded like they were quite noisy by comparison. They have a solid feel and construction to them, but they are also easy to service and take apart using only a screwdriver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with these. The time they will save me is worth the price alone, but the other positive features just add to the value. I can&#x27;t comment on the quality of the attachments, since I have only used the clippers without them.</li>
            <li> Replaced an old set of cheap clippers with this one.  Runs much quieter than the old one and cuts cleaner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quieter than my older model from 1995 so we will see how long it lasts and how well it cuts as time goes on.  Not sure I can recommend buying it until I&#x27;ve had it for a while so best of luck if you choose to get it too.</li>
            <li> Item works and was delivered as described.  I&#x27;ll echo everyone else&#x27;s comments that this is a very solid clippers.  No complaints, it beats my old Wahl Color Pro by leaps and bounds.  I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for about 5 years now, and this is by far the quickest clippers I&#x27;ve used.  It takes much fewer passes than the other ones I&#x27;ve used.  It would be nice if it came with more attachments, but no deduction since that&#x27;s how it was described in the listing.</li>
            <li> Went through a whole collection of various clippers on our Giant Schnauzer. At one point I decided that the clippers are only lasting 3 - 5 uses, which would still be cheaper than the professional shop visits. This little red devil clipper taught me different though! The heat of the head is not uncomfortable, the noise and vibration very minimal. A bit heavy but that&#x27;s probably because of the higher quality of materials used. It keeps on humming and clipping and humming and clipping...</li>
            <li> Tried this guy the day it was shipped to me. Cut very smooth, never felt any catching or pulling of hairs. Everything feels pretty sturdy and as a guy I very much enjoy the way it looks and feels. Only cons are no case to put it in, and could use a few more attachment size varieties. If you are doing your own hair at home and looking to upgrade what you are currently using because you are getting snagged a lot, stop looking and get these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buzzing my own hair for about 12 years now. I always bought consumer grade Wahl, Norelco, etc clippers. I have super thick hair and every set of clippers I had tried always got hung up after about a two inch swipe through my hair. This set of Oster clippers feels like it&#x27;s slicing through thin air; I now cut my hair in about half the time it normally would take me. It&#x27;s surprisingly quiet too. Get it!</li>
            <li> Bought these to replace the cheap Wahl clippers I usually end up buying at Walmart, and i&#x27;m glad I did - these clippers work well, cut smoothe, are light and and fit nicely in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do end up buying these, I highly recommend the magnetic guards by Andis, they fit these clippers perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor gripe I do have with these is that the adjustable lever tends to lower itself while cutting, so it needs to be pushed back up constantly. I&#x27;m going to try screwing it in tighter and hopefully that will resolve the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with these, bought them in December of 2012 and they&#x27;re still running great.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers! These things could shave a wet yeti. I know you’re going to be tempted to buy the cheaper Oster clippers because that’s what I did and it was a huge mistake! The cheaper ones are JUNK!!! These clippers are AWESOME. You can feel the difference in them as soon as you pick them up. The blade screams quality! Every part simply “looks” and “feels” very well made and thought out. Also, they’re very quiet.</li>
            <li> dropped my last clippers (also oster) and shattered them on the tile.  i like the slow and more quiet motor on these.  nice solid feel to them.  hope they last like my other ones.  don&#x27;t know what to make of the adjustable blade, though.  i just use the plastic &#x27;blending comb&#x27; for a short trim. blades seem nice and sharp from the factory.  i&#x27;m not a professional, so this is from the for what it&#x27;s worth dept.</li>
            <li> Awesome clippers! I use these for my son&#x27;s haircuts regularly</li>
            <li> These are by far the best and quietest clippers I have ever owned. I do my own hair once a week and these do a great job. I paired them up with the Wahl Hero 5 Star trimmer and they compliment each other well. If you are doing your own hair and want to step up from the department store set than you can&#x27;t go wrong with these. Very heavy duty cord and did I say quiet. Yes.</li>
            <li> very good likes the price</li>
            <li> awesome clippers!! I cut my hair, as well as my two boys, on a regular basis. It works great!</li>
            <li> This clipper is heavy duty and cuts with confidence.  I was little concerned about the combs as I didn&#x27;t see a 1/8&amp;#34; comb listed.  All you need to do is use the blending comb to get a 1/8&amp;#34; cut.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have this clipper for years to come.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loved it. Good manufacture</li>
            <li> I love these clippers I&#x27;ve  used them for at least 15 years.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re hesitating, on the fence about investing in a better quality clipper, I suggest you go for it.  Compared to a Conair, this thing is not only a joy to use, but gives superior buzzes, too.  Quiet, low vibration, and the thing CUTS.  Fast, even, smooth buzzes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(It also looks great; the red in the photo is actually a nice retro burgundy.)</li>
            <li> LOVE this clipper. I&#x27;ve read many reviews complaining about how the trimmer heads are too tight or too loose, but I haven&#x27;t had any trouble. Keep in mind that this clipper only comes with three different sized attachments (I know it says 4, but two of them are the same size - 1/2 inch) so you will probably need to also buy additional attachments for longer trims.</li>
            <li> Wonderful clippers! Bought them as a gift for my husband and he said they are the best clippers he&#x27;s ever used! If barbers use it, who wouldn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> This thing is built in the USA, heavy, old school in every way. Feels like it&#x27;ll last forever, cuts through hair with ease. Does take a few passes to get all the scragglers, and only comes with 3 guards (you can buy more, but it&#x27;d be nice if they were just there). Some cleaning and oiling is needed, it&#x27;s not like your Braun face shaver that is set and forget, but this machine is truly commercial grade, and could very well out live you.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband to do his own buzzcuts.  He loves it.  Really easy to use and smooth; doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li> Been using it for proper manscaping for years, does the trick haha</li>
            <li> Best Clipper I have ever own.  I have owned it for a year now and they are joy to use.</li>
            <li> plain and simply, it doesn&#x27;t cut well.  don&#x27;t waste your money.  go for a cheaper one that will work just as well (or better), or go for a better product that would be worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my son&#x27;s hair is SO thick, our other clipper could not cut it cleanly.  This clipper did the job, made nice smooth cuts.  It&#x27;s not too heavy and not overly loud.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the finest cutters I have ever put my hands on. I will never by bargain cutters again.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m part of a very hairy family...my husband and I always worried we&#x27;d spawn the missing link!  So clippers are an important tool in our house!  I&#x27;ve only used this clipper a few times, but it&#x27;s so much better than my previous model--a brand professionals use, purchased at Sally&#x27;s.  I love the adjustable blade feature for trimming the neck and back of my husband&#x27;s hair between trips to the barber.  I can easily use it, held in either hand, to trim the insanely long (but blessedly blond) hair on my arms.  It feels good in the hand, it works smoothly...even sounds smooth--and it&#x27;s RED.  It comes with several guide combs to adjust length of haircut.  As another reviewer mentioned, it does not come with a storage case.  Since there are a number of little parts, you&#x27;ll want to designate a box or bag to contain all the goodies.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The Oster Professional Clipper is a highly upgraded modern version of the 12 year old Oster clippers I have been using. The Pro Clippers are exactly as advertised and more; Perfect for home personal, shop, or military applications.  They are too good to be tried on the poodle. It doesn&#x27;t get any better than the Pro except new model year introductions.</li>
            <li> I cut my husbands hair and he was a Barber at one time and this the brand of one of his old clippers, and they are fifty years old. Time for new one.  This is quiet, fit my hand nice and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I looked for a long time and read a lot of reviews before settling on this clipper and I&#x27;m really happy with it. It&#x27;s lightweight, quiet, and cuts through hair easily.</li>
            <li> A+...A+...A+, these clippers are definetly  the truth.Thanks to youtube, i was looking at some videos to upgrade my arsenal and then these clippers were introduced to me. Blending (tapering/fading ) are a little bit easier with a slight touch than the masters. Lighter in weight than the masters. Great investment to add to your arsenal.</li>
            <li> the clippers were good but didn&#x27;t work well with attachments.</li>
            <li> These clippers are great! They are smooth and give a fantastic cut! My husband trims my hair and I do his! Great purchase. Would definitely buy again. We looked at many.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really good clippers.  Better than a few other pairs I&#x27;ve owned that were not designed for cutting.  However, it&#x27;s sometimes difficult to get an even cut.  The plastic arm and guards are fragile.  The unit itself is heavy and sturdy.  Overall very pleased.</li>
            <li> My husband cuts our son&#x27;s hair and was wanting a quiet hair razor that worked well. He is an engineer by nature and career and is picky about his tools.&lt;br /&gt;  It also doesn&#x27;t scare my son which is also a plus.:)&lt;br /&gt;  I chose this one after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;  Our first shaver was from the early 2000s and a WAHL. Oh. My. Loudness and shakiness!&lt;br /&gt;  We bought a kids size head shaver a few years back (I think also a WAHL). Quieter but it broke on us before our son turned 3! And we only use it every 1.5 months or so.&lt;br /&gt;  We are impressed so far.</li>
            <li> I really really like these.  The only negative is that they don&#x27;t come with a Number 1 guard.  Mine came with two No. 2 guards but no number one and my husband likes his hair cut with the No. 1.  I&#x27;m now trying to find a 1/8&amp;#34; guard to fit these clippers.  Other than that, they cut fantastic.  They&#x27;re quiet and smooth and don&#x27;t pull the hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers bc I wanted to use the andis purple magnetic guards.  It was such a good choice.  The clippers are very quiet and powerful.  Also the guards fit them well.  I definitely recommend these clippers.</li>
            <li> Feels like a quality tool. Cuts really well. Not as quiet as other trimmers I have used. Be sure and pick up some oil for it as well from Oster.</li>
            <li> Finally!  Professional quality!!  I cut my own hair almost year round.  These clippers seem to do the best job out of all brands that I have found---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware though---they do not come with clips.  You need to order them separately and they can be hard to find on Amazon sometimes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not coming with clips and some sort of case to hold everything together is the only drawback, thus lacking a star.</li>
            <li> It had an electric fault on arrival and shorted immediately on use. I was extremely dissapointed and Amazon has refunded the amount but not replied with regard to shipping costs to be refunded.</li>
            <li> Fantastic tranaction fast shipingtrims up nice love the built in  size chanagable  clipperes it serves my purpose just fine Very highly recomended</li>
            <li> We bought this to replace an old Costco special.  This clipper came with a few cutting guides, some lube, and a cleaning brush.  The cord is nice and long.  The clipper itself is very quiet and powerful.  I have thick hair and it glides right through without a hiccup.  One piece of advice though, the guides slide onto the clipper...it took us a few minutes to figure that out.</li>
            <li> this is definitely an upgrade over your standard set of wahl clippers that you would find at the local drugstore.  If you are looking for a well built set of clippers at a reasonable price point, then I would highly recommend this particular model.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day---Yeah, I&#x27;m pretty anal about my hair. Works flawless and can tell it&#x27;s quality by the build just make sure you get a good sanitizing and cleaning spray for after use to keep the blades lubricated and running free of clogs.</li>
            <li> This clippers are built well and made for use. I have owned other brands in the past and the quality of these Oster clippers is great. Well built ands at a great price. AAA</li>
            <li> This clipper gets the job done, but it takes several passes to do it. I was hoping for this kind of money to get a clipper that would take it all off on the first go around, but it requires 2-3 passes to really get it done close. I&#x27;m disappointed...</li>
            <li> Had a Wahl for over 20 years and it finally bit the dust. Bought the Oster several months ago based on the reviews and have not been disappointed. This is one powerful clipper! Quieter than the Wahl as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the best clipper I have ever owned.  SMOOOTTHHHHHH!!!! I have thick hair that I shave ever other week, and this clipper goes through like butter. I am going to have to say this is money well spent. Highly recommend this clipper.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that these things don&#x27;t just cut your hair off in one pass. You gotta go over it a couple times from multiple angles when using the attachments to get an even cut. That&#x27;s fine, I can do it now like a pro, but initially I was thrown for a loop, so just a heads up to you folks who&#x27;ve never used one yourselves before.  The advantage of needing multiple passes is that you can blend between length sections more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included attachments are fine, by the way. You can buy ones for even longer hair lengths but I found that beyond a certain length (like beyond 1 inch) you&#x27;re better off using scissors since hair bends and scrunches up before it hits the cutting teeth and thus doesn&#x27;t extend to full length enough to be cut off at the desired 1&amp;#34;. So I use scissors on top, electric shears everywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shears are essential if you want to maintain short hair. I can&#x27;t imagine having to spend $13 per haircut every two weeks to maintain one. But with shears it&#x27;s as easy as mowing the lawn. I use a $1 shower curtain from a dollar store to drape over the sink for easy clean up.</li>
            <li> Simple, effective, powerful, and easy to use. Exceeded my expectations. Paid for itself with a few uses.</li>
            <li> Purchased these after our Conair clippers started to die. I researched and these were listed as the best clippers for the best price and that is correct! These are awesome! I can cut my husband&#x27;s hair vey quick and it looks great!</li>
            <li> these clippers are awesome very powerful and extremely quiet.i also like that the cord is long and gives plenty of flexibility to cut hair</li>
            <li> got this years ago to avoid going to the barber and never had any issues with it and it cuts great.  beats the cheap ones by 1000 and doesn&#x27;t pull your hair when it cuts</li>
            <li> This is a great hair clipper.  It comes with a 1, 2, 3, and 4 trimming blade in the box.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression it would be built like a tank---while good, the on/off slide seems a little chinsy.  It also only operates at 120V /60Hz, so if you are thinking of using it abroad, you will need an extra (heavy) inverter. The color is a darker red than the photo, and feels a little small in the hand (I have big hands). Nonetheless, it looks like it will do the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my family&#x27;s hair for nearly 20 years, using $20 Conair and Wahl clippers from Walmart.  They did a decent job, but they usually only lasted a couple of years before burning out.  And it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get new blades for those inexpensive clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I decided to try a set of professional clipper, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  These are so much sharper and more accurate than my cheapie clippers - I don&#x27;t have to go over the same spot multiple times to get all the hairs cut.  I love the long cord and the way it fits in my hand - hair cuts are a pleasure with this Oster clipper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to point out that my set came with four guide combs (1/8\\&quot;, 1/4\\&quot;, 1/2\\&quot; and 5/8\\&quot;), which I didn&#x27;t see mentioned in the description here on Amazon.  I ordered the Oster Universal 10-pc guide comb set, which didn&#x27;t fit the clippers and will be returned.  And since I only use the four sizes mentioned above, I don&#x27;t need to order extra ones anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that would have made this set better was if it came with a hard plastic storage box.  The paper box it came with won&#x27;t hold up to years of use, so I am storing all the parts in the old Conair box.</li>
            <li> The Fast Feeds are BEAST! I was looking for a great pair of clippers that would blind and fade nice and the Fast Feeds are what I was looking for! They run smooth, not loud, light, and do not over heat! Great pricing and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Bought the Wahl Professional Mambo Combo before buying these, thinking I was buying a &amp;#34;Professional&amp;#34; set of clippers instead of the usual Walmart variety. I was wrong! These are what I was looking for. Everything about these is great, except that the blades came crooked and and had to align them before I could even use the first time. That is why I am taking off a star. Other than that, these are the best clippers I&#x27;ve owned and I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for nearly 15 years.</li>
            <li> Quiet, powerful, reliable. These clippers feel like they could last forever if you take care of them.</li>
            <li> Works well enough, but it can be noisy if the setting on the cutter is on the low side.  I buy these every couple of years, and after about 1 year, I have not noticed too much a decrease in function, but I will likely try a different brand or higher quality product the next time I buy one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been cutting my hair with a 1 guard for almost 20 years.  I&#x27;ve gone through countless Wahls, and one or two Osters....this is the most I&#x27;ve spent on a unit, and it doesn&#x27;t really feel all that premium.  I&#x27;m happy with it, but the noise when the blade is close is slightly concerning.</li>
            <li> works great on black hair</li>
            <li> Much better than our previous clippers.  Cuts rather than pulls my hair and has a better build quality.</li>
            <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve bought in a long time. Great for shorter cuts and fades. Relatively quiet and smooth. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Best hair clipper I have owned.  Clipper is quiet while cutting hair.  I already have used clipper 3 times and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update July 2015:&lt;br /&gt;Clippers still work 2 years later and I used clipper twice a month.</li>
            <li> I just wanted a solid pair for cutting my own hair. I have tried about 3 different kinds, and they either break after a short period, or never cut to begin with. This clipper is high quality for a good price. They are quiet and smooth. They don&#x27;t get all backed up with hair in the guards like cheap clippers do. I would 100% recommend these</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for over 15 years and this is by far the most durable and well-constructed set of clippers I&#x27;ve purchased.  The clippers are heavy duty, which is a plus, but the weight is noticeable.  It&#x27;s definitely worth it though.  The adjustability is great for precision tapering and fades.  The only negative, and it&#x27;s a small one, the blades don&#x27;t quite get close enough compared to some other clippers, but that&#x27;s why I also use a precision trimmer for my neck and sideburns.  Otherwise, fantastic product.</li>
            <li> This clipper is lighter and quieter than many other quality clippers, and it has a long cord that does not  easily tangle.</li>
            <li> Okay we are being serious about these clippers.  Sometimes we get overzealous when we find a good product, but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re exagerating when we make the claim that these are super clippers.  We bought a set of $15 clippers from a big box store and we got our money&#x27;s worth.  We learned how to cut our own hair and used them for about a year.  When they died we got these based on other reviews on Amazon.  We are totally pleased.  They run like s*** and are as smooth as momma&#x27;s a**.  It&#x27;s the best set we found so far.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time. I don&#x27;t remember the last time I saw a Barber.</li>
            <li> This product shipped really fast. It was a product that I was looking for and have used for years. You can&#x27;t beat the price especially new.</li>
            <li> The clippers did well but I could not use the combs.  They kept jamming with hair.  I ended up taking the combs off and tried cutting without them.  All I can say is \\&quot;its a good thing she cannot see herself in the mirror\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have had this for 9 months now and is great. It is a good product for the price. I recommend to a friends.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it&#x27;s great! Perfect for any one looking for a weekly trim. He doesn&#x27;t use it everyday, so if you are that kind of guy I wouldn&#x27;t get it. Overall, great clippers for the price!</li>
            <li> Our family uses the larger Oster Classic clipper.  I purchased this Oster Prof 76023 for my college aged son after he complained that his roommate&#x27;s cordless clipper had no power and took \\&quot;forever\\&quot;.  He and his roommates are very happy with this Oster Prof Fast Feed Clipper.  Its smaller &amp; lighter &amp; costs less but just as easy to use.</li>
            <li> good price,weight but not so powerful...</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace some inexpensive clippers which broke after years of use. These are quieter and cut nicely. I cut my hair without a plastic guard and have had no problems with cuts from the blades that a few reviewers report.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t close to the Oster professional I used to have but not far from it. So far so good!!</li>
            <li> They are quiet and strong too. Came with 4 gaurds so that;s good. No case but i threw my old clippers out and put the new ones in my old case. Nice price</li>
            <li> Really wanted a Classic 76 but couldn&#x27;t justify the $150 price tag. I am very glad I went with these. Super powerful, commercial grade clippers. One more haircut and they will have paid for themselves. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d bought a Costco clipper set for $40 or so in order to cut my husband&#x27;s fine hair and it never really worked well in addition to taking a long time.  Couldn&#x27;t stand it any longer, and bought this product which is similar to what my hairdresser used on my husband.  (She used hers all the time.)  The difference was night and day.  Took no time at all, and it cut the sides of his hair and the nape of his neck extremely well (4.5 stars).  The area where it doesn&#x27;t do a great job is at the crown of his head (2.5 stars).  He&#x27;s bald on top, so where his hair starts for some reason gets longer, or maybe just stays flatter, and I have a harder time cutting those hairs to the same length as the rest of his hair.  Luckily he has a Wahl beard trimmer, which does a great job. So all in all, I&#x27;ve cut my hair cutting job from 20 minutes to about 5.  That, and it looks a lot better.</li>
            <li> Have previously owned Oster clippers and received very good service.  The new Oster clippers I purchased run smoothly and  are relatively quiet. They are able to run several minutes without overheating, however, do not cut as close as I would like.</li>
            <li> works great.  gives me a nice even cut.  its a well made product.  expect it will give me years of service.  would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> great clippers. never given me any problems and I&#x27;ve been using them every week for over a year. cut great. u don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same area</li>
            <li> it work good and cut down the noise.</li>
            <li> Have only used it twice but it cuts much better than our 20+ year old clippers - definitely was time for a replacement!  They seem very well built and much much better that the cordless clipper wimp we tried before as a replacement.</li>
            <li> I was looking for clippers that would operate just as quickly and efficiently as the ones at the salon, and I feel like these do the trick. My facial hair is always the same length, and I don&#x27;t have to keep going back over the same areas. Cuts it the first time, and I&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a year now, I believe that I can write an informed review.&lt;br /&gt;For the past 12 months I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair and that of 4 boys on a regular basis, it has performed very well so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has very little tolerance for any residue on the blades, so even though I clean it regularily every now and again it will pull hair.&lt;br /&gt;When that happens I just spend extra time cleaning it well, and it performs like new again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite disappointed with this clipper:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not cut \\&quot;very close\\&quot; as the description states and the motor is rather weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair by myself every week for almost 20 years now and this is quite inferior to my two previous Wahl (firt broke after a very hard fall and the second one is at my mother&#x27;s house for when I go visit during the holidays).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just cut my hair with the Wahl 5-star clipper 8451 (which I bought after Amazon accepted my return for this one) and it&#x27;s hands down a much better clipper than this Oster. The motor is much powerful and the blads can cut much closer. There is really no comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully I could send it back to Amazon. My first and last Oster.</li>
            <li> These clippers are professional grade. I&#x27;ve used them for many haircuts and they are still like brand new. I only wish that the guards were labeled (had to label them myself for when my clients ask for a &#x27;number 3&#x27; cut, etc.). Very good quality, but not too heavy to hold.</li>
            <li> I owned an old pair of Remington clippers and was pretty happy with them.. until I got a pair of these. WOW cuts smooth barely any vibrations feels solid in the hands and i cut my hair in 15 min. I use this every time before i shower because i like maintaining the fresh cut look. On one believes i cut my own hair the gradient is amazing and it never cuts my skin. I&#x27;m super picky with the things i own and this was a buy well worth it! As for the headers that come with it i find them enough to do the stuff i want because you can adjust the machines cutting length as well. :)</li>
            <li> This trimmer is far superior than all those consumer cordless trimmers that I&#x27;ve been through.  Extremely sharp and strong.  The cord is thick and long, so you probably will pack it in a drawer every time if you like to keep your counters neat.</li>
            <li> Works great and i love the fact that it is electric and don&#x27;t have to charge it beforehand. Good buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my dead Oster clippers that I suppose my family purchased years ago. They cut fine and are nice and quiet. However, I can&#x27;t get the super close cut to which I was accustomed with my previous clippers. A bit of a bummer in that regard.</li>
            <li> My son cuts his own hair and this clipper iss a durable appliance that will be used for many years.</li>
            <li> I had an old &amp;#34;Fast Feed&amp;#34; Oster clippers that I used and wanted to replace it. I purchased this set and it works great. When I&#x27;m ready to replace, I will look for this item again.</li>
            <li> The Oster Professional fast feed works great.  I like a high and tight cut...  This product fills that requirement very well.</li>
            <li> I got these clippers to buzz my head with, thinking they would give me a better, more even cut than the slightly cheaper clippers I already have. Unfortunately, I could not get a good cut with these. On the other hand, they do an excellent job at trimming my facial hair for a stubble look. In fact the best I&#x27;ve used for that purpose (and I tried alot). Now I use my old clippers for my head, and the Oster Fast Feed for facial hair.</li>
            <li> The dual magnet fast speed Oster clippers give a comfortable fast haircut.  Now head vibrating loud clipper anymore.  This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only suggestion would be to add a few more guards and a pouch/case for storage</li>
            <li> The Oster Professional Fast Feed Clipper with attachments did a good job cutting hair. At a reasonable price, it provides excellent value</li>
            <li> I bought this razor to replace a cheap Whal hat I bought from Costco about 5 years ago.  At first I was excited about it and after first use I was disappointed as it didn&#x27;t cut my hair as close as I like or even as close as the Whal.  Both razors I used no guard. Now I have had it for about 4 months I am now on the hunt for a replacement.  Don&#x27;t buy this razor if you want a close and effortless buzz cut.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for anyone trying to save money and cut their own hair or their children&#x27;s hair like I&#x27;m doing now. Very easy to use. It&#x27;s heavy but I like that, I feel it steadies my hand and helps me guide easier. Very professional.</li>
            <li> These are my third or fourth set of clippers in the past few years. I&#x27;ve been reluctant to spend a lot of money on a clipper set, but I&#x27;ve gotten really tired of the flimsy little cord that comes with most. This baby is solid and the cord doesn&#x27;t get all tangled like the cheaper sets. It is solid and well built. I expect this is the set I keep for a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was tired of single-purpose beard trimmers that pinch and nick.  I&#x27;m more than satisfied. This unit has a real heavy duty feel to it; it&#x27;s quieter than the other trimmers I&#x27;ve used; despite a lack of accessories, it makes beard trimming easy and comfortable.  The heavy cord is sort of a nuisance - I&#x27;m used to cordless rechargeable units - but that is more than offset by the comfort of the trim and the obvious quality of construction.</li>
            <li> This clipper cuts very well and am hoping that it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Great buzzer! It doesn&#x27;t catch hair like my cheap one from conair.. my kids don&#x27;t kick and cry anymore. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> worth the money after using $25 clippers we found at the grocery store. You really get what you pay for when it comes to this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;Nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll change or delete my review if my experience mirrors what others did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My set has dark spots on the red casing, scratch marks on the black \\&quot;Fast Feed\\&quot; sign in the front, and specks in the blades.  Is that how yours came?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the 10 universal combs set and the 4oz container of lubricant.  I could have skipped them and been fine with just the clippers.  While I can use the lube for other things, I would really only ever use the 1/16 and 1/8\\&quot; combs since the clippers come with 1/4, 3/8, and 1/2\\&quot; combs (plus the blending comb).  That leaves 8 combs I wouldn&#x27;t use from the 10 comb set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, again, I will change or delete my review if my experience is common.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Busy hair stylist.  Though this would be good for tight zero fades.  Didn&#x27;t do it but like the light weight</li>
            <li> A had a cheaper version of the Oster clipper and used it for years before the switch went out. This model appears to have a better switch and an added plus is the support of the cord at the clipper. It probably will last me a lifetime.</li>
            <li> better than advertised.</li>
            <li> Smooth and cuts clean!</li>
            <li> Nice weight to it. Smooth blades and quiet while on. Easy for personal use due to its size and weight, easy to maneuver around your head. Only comes with a few clipper sizes but if you have other lengths from a previous pair of osters or perhaps even other clippers they may work to clip onto these. I had a set of oster clipper lengths that clicked onto this without problems!</li>
            <li> Mores blades to choose from. The others have a variety. The product  and the company seem to be on target with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great product it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. I would usually get the cheap Walmart clippers but I&#x27;m glad I chose these they are extremely reliable and cut my hair much faster. Only not so great thing is that it doesn&#x27;t bring different Adonis for cutting hair at different sizes. It only offers a few lengths.</li>
            <li> I gave this a product a one star simply because of its ONE time use, it literally lasted for 5minutes tops... Now here I am early Thursday morning with a quarter of the hair on my head shaved before I head to work. It wouldn&#x27;t have been so bad had it gave me one full use. Feeling very disappointed and ripped off.</li>
            <li> Good clippers at a good price.  I had worn out several of the cheaper vibrating head clippers that I purchased from Walmart, so I figured I&#x27;d step up in quality.  So far, I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> I bought this for home use about 15 months ago and its still working perfectly fine today. I cut my hair at least once a week and with minor upkeep (brushing the hairs off and oiling every other use or so) it shows no sign of slowing down. The 0 blade can be adjusted up to 000 I believe, which is just a slightly longer, rougher looking 0. The plastic sizer attachments (which go up to #8 I think) work good, not as good as using metal blade attachments like professional clippers but well enough to get an even cut. My hair is pretty thick and has wrecked multiple cheaper brands of hair clippers in the past and this is the first pair of clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned that lasted longer than half a year. Definitely worth the investment considering how much I&#x27;ve saved over the years on trips to the barbershop.</li>
            <li> I have been buzzing my hair about once a week for the last fifteen years and finally decided to purchase the Oster brand...WOW I cannot believe I waited so long to get such a quality pair of clippers.  The clippers do not clog or pull as long as you keep them oiled.  Awesome clippers and look forward to have them for years to come.</li>
            <li> For a profesional this is not the kinda a machine you want.&lt;br /&gt;just went back to my whal senior 5star</li>
            <li> best clippers for do it at home haircuts and i am sure professionally as well.  I have had these for over 2 years and cut my hair every two weeks, they are still super sharp and easy to clean.  A few drops of oil on the blades before i use them and brush them off when done.  you can do a good job trimming your neck with them but if you want those super clean lines or designs get a dedicated set of finish clippers.</li>
            <li> I had an Oster clipper before.  I got excellent service out of it and it last many years!</li>
            <li> They have been awesome clippers.  I am not a professional but have been cutting my husbands hair for about 10 years now.  These do a great job and don&#x27;t pull on his hair.  My only complaint is that they are heavy!</li>
            <li> Very good clipper for haircuts and beards. I originally purchased this in hopes that it would have the power to trim my dogs hair well. Unfortunately it gets hot and lacks the power to efficiently cut my dogs thicker hair. She is a Labrador retriever and sheds a small chihuahua&#x27;s sized clump of hair every week, so I had hoped that this would be able to keep her hair trimmed during the summer. Unfortunately it just isn&#x27;t heavy duty enough. We used it on a collies&#x27; longer hair and it managed just okay.  I would suggest if you will be trimming any kind of thicker hair than a human&#x27;s, or want a good experience with an animal clipper to purchase a more powerful unit. For human hair, even beards, it works absolutely excellent and cuts evenly and without trouble.</li>
            <li> Quality set of clippers.  They are an improvement over the target bought Wahl clippers I previously owned.  They are very sturdy and cut more consistently than anything I have previously used.  Good price for the quality.  They seem like they are built to last.</li>
            <li> Does as advertised. Easy to get hair stuck in a few nooks and crannies. Especially just after oiling it. Cuts hair well.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair for about 10 years now, and have went from multiple sets of Wahl, Conair, and Philips. They all worked fairly well in the beginning, but all have eventually failed on me. The Wahl, Conair, and Philips sets always had trouble cutting the hair behind my ears, and I always worry about them giving out on me while I&#x27;m cutting my hair. The Wahl and Philips blade guards broke on me, the Conair stopped cutting well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided it was time to get real professional clippers and went with these Oster due to the rave reviews. Man, these sets are the real thing and do not feel flimsy like the other plastic sets. The Oster clippers have some heft to it (a little heavy), but it&#x27;s because of the higher quality material. I have even dropped it about 4 feet and it sustained no damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oster does not come with as many accessories like the other cheaper clipper brands. The blade guards that came with the Oster are high quality plastic. The blades are powerful, and I have no problem cutting the hair behind my ears like the other cheaper clippers. These clippers made it easy for me to cut my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Oster clippers are built to last and I am looking forward to years of good haircuts!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;I dropped it about 5 feet onto the ground and the housing shattered. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the clipper gave amazing cuts but Oster quoted me $40 to refurbish the housing. It seems a tad expensive.</li>
            <li> I finally got tired of being let down by barbers in my area running behind and butchering my hair so I purchased my own set of clippers. My fiance learned how to taper my hair fairly quickly with these clippers paired with the comb set.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and has been working very well so far.  I purchased this unit to replace an older one by the same manufacturer which I have used for over 20 years.</li>
            <li> I bought to upgrade from the cheapos I had bought before at Target. I notice the difference in how even it cuts compared to the ones I had before.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like to shave regularly so he just clips his beard down once or twice a month and the standard beard trimmers we had been using weren&#x27;t up to the task and pulled his hair. He insisted he wanted a professional grade hair trimmer instead and I looked at several before deciding to give this one a try. It is clearly not the typical battery powered discount store variety. It is much heavier duty and has a much more powerful motor and sharper blades. He used it to shave down his bear with one of the shorter combs and then I used one of the longer combs to cut his hair. We were even able to take the comb off and trim his mustache. It is quite a bit larger than the beard trimmer we were used to and quite a bit heavier so we had to be careful with the detail work but it still got the job done. He was very pleased with the way it works on his face, no pulling and very sharp blades and a smooth and quiet running motor. I was very pleased with the way it worked on his hair too. I could have sheared all his long curly hair off easily with this clipper. We hope to get a lot of use out of this nice trimmer. It would be nice if it came with some kind of case but it does come with a variety of combs and a cleaning brush and oil for the blades.</li>
            <li> Great speed, super eBay seller!! thanks</li>
            <li> Product blew out on first use and have yet to hear back about replacing it</li>
            <li> Best trimmer ever owned!</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews for a product but i had to after using these clippers. After 3 weeks of using the fast feed clippers, the clippers stopped working. I was honestly expecting something a lot better and regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my husband as we cut his hair here at home and his previous clippers (Remington and Wahl) NEVER last.  My goal was to find quality clippers that do a great job and will last for more than a few months.  We have used these clippers a handful of times since receiving them and I am mostly satisfied.  The clippers seem very stout and do not feel or look cheaply made.  The blade guards that come with the clippers are more than enough for us as my husband never uses anything beyond the 1/4&amp;#34;.  The clippers are also very quiet.  My one complaint, and it&#x27;s significant, is that when cutting my husband&#x27;s hair I had to go over areas twice before everything was the same length.  On the first pass, about 85% of his hair would be cut.  After cutting his hair the first time, I had to go back over the same areas and trim again so that all of his hair was even.  Keep in mind, this is using the clippers with only the blade, no guide combs, and only a week&#x27;s growth of hair.  Despite this downfall, I am still mostly happy with this purchase.  As long as these clippers last more than a year, I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but its not as sharp as ones I have used before.  Took longer to cut hair.</li>
            <li> Great clippers the size and weight are outstanding. I like how quite and smooth cutting they are. I would recommend them to anybody.</li>
            <li> This was one of the best products I&#x27;ve bought online recently. I like to keep my hair short with a buzz cut and I will always go get it cut at the store. With my haircut being so easy, it would only take them 10 minutes or less to cut it. I thought I might as well invest in my own clipper and save money by doing it myself. 3 haircuts at the store pays for this purchase, I recommend this to anyone who gets buzz cuts or doesn&#x27;t want to pay the money and tip for haircuts however often you get them at the salon</li>
            <li> Works great had mine over 2 years now and still works like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to maintain it if you want full use.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend buying a cleaner spray that can clean, lube, and disinfect your clippers.</li>
            <li> I cut my husbands hair and this product saves me money every month.  It does not pull or cut and we both appreciate that.</li>
            <li> Quiet, sharp, powerful.  Quite honestly the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  An excellent deal for the low price.</li>
            <li> Our ancient Oster clippers (Model 11) finally died due to a short in the coil winding, so after research I settled on replacing them with the Oster Fast Feed.  I like it a great deal.  I expect it will provide good service for years to come, since we only use it occasionally for family hair cuts.  The Oster Classic 76 is probably the most heavy duty clipper out there.  But the Fast Feed is half the cost, also heavy duty, lighter in weight, and doesn&#x27;t get hot while using it.  I like it a lot.  I also purchased some Oster Professional 76926-800 Guide Combs to go with it, as our old guide combs don&#x27;t fit the Fast Feed.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, powerful and easy to use. It is a good idea to buy additional comb attachments to have more choices, as other reviewers have suggested. This device pays for itself in a short time - an excellent investment.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product to use for balding buzzes. It did absolutely nothing for my husband. Big Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using clippers for approximately 25 years. Oster, Wahl, Andis - really no complaints on any of these brands. Truth is, if you take care of your clippers, they should last a long time. But each brand (as well as model) has a tendency to mimic a specific personality. And as a result, it&#x27;s effectiveness may largely depend on which personality best meshes with your process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Oster Professional motor is quiet, and the pull through any type of hair is smooth. It&#x27;s sharp, accurate, and the range on the adjustable blade is ideal. There&#x27;s a bit a heft but it&#x27;s not burdensome or obtrusive, making self-cutting an easier task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if the loud, biting Wahl 305G MC is akin to (let&#x27;s say) Chris Rock circa 1998, then the Oster Professional 76023 would be more like that cool cat you depend on to help you destroy the Empire...you know, a Billy Dee Williams-type.</li>
            <li> Have only used a few times, but  I am completely satisfied. Would buy again. Price was within my budget, others have liked also.</li>
            <li> Turned an hour job with a cheap cutter into a 5 minute one.  My son couldn&#x27;t be happier to be tortured for such a short time..</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this clipper it performs very well.Gives a very smooth haircut and I love the way it works</li>
            <li> Relevant background: I have been cutting my own hair for the last 14 years.  During that time I more or less settled on Wahl brand clippers.  The problem is that the Walh clippers dulled relatively quickly, got clogged with hair easily and took many passes to get it right because of the inferior attachments and the attachments popping off.  But for the price of 20-30 some bucks to replace every year or so, it was ok.  However I&#x27;ve found the newer models of wahl clippers have used cheaper and flimsier attachments.  The attachments got so cheap that if you pushed too hard on your head, the attachment would distort.  Well that&#x27;s exactly what happened.  I mean can you at least not scrimp so bad that it defeats the purpose of the product?  None the less, I tracked down a set of older and better made attachments and went to business as usual.  To do a perfect job took me about 30 minutes to cut my hair because you have to make many passes from where the attachments push the hair down and where in general the clippers don&#x27;t get unless you brush the clogged hair out for every 6 or so inches of hair cutting.  If you&#x27;ve done this as much as I have, you know what I mean.  I had enough, I flushed enough money down the toilet on Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I got pissed and decided to invest a few extra bucks in my next set.  I researched the models out there and this one came very highly recommended in the intermediate price range.  I purchased it and have used it three times since I got it.  It works great, it flys through the hair no problem and it does not clog with the cut hair.  I can cut my hair in about 5 minutes instead of 30.  The attachments are thin without being flimsy, so you don&#x27;t have to go over the same place over and over.  The attachments also slide on from the top/front end of the blade and lock into place so, no matter how hard you push on your head, the attachments will never pop off.  I wish I got one of these years ago.  The construction is way more solid that the walh brand.  It is heavier and obviously has a better motor.  The blades go through everything without a problem.  This is a great clipper for someone like me who only uses it about once a month.  People seemed to complaint about the noise- if you are that sensitive to sound then you have issues.  You are literally pressing a buzzing motor against your head...you want it to not be loud?  It does get hot like people say, so I would not recommend using it without attachments for more than 15 minutes without a break.  I would not use it cut my dogs hair without letting it cool completely which may take awhile.  My advice....get it</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband last year as a Christmas gift and we&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times during the year, no more than 5 times I would say. Based on the reviews I expected it to be the closest thing to a professional hair clipper but that&#x27;s not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, our old and almost broken clipper cuts his hair much shorter than this one does. I thought it was going to cut really short but it doesn&#x27;t. It does however, cut more effectively, I don&#x27;t need to go over it as much. He also says that it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;pull\\&quot; as much or at all compared to the Wahl that he has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, there are other options out there that are lower priced and work just as well if not better. Also, this seller sent me a used one, I could tell because he sent me two of the same sized attachments and the clipper \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; we&#x27;re extremely oiled and there was little black dots all inside the box and on the clippers which I figured was hair, my husband agreed.</li>
            <li> This product appears to be well made of good materials. It is of sturdy construction and operates with a nice low hum. I think Oster makes a good professional \\&quot;Fast Feed Clipper.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I can do my hair cut in few minutes. This is good stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Wahl clipper for years now, as I cut my own hair. It jammed all of the time, it did not have that much power, and it was very loud and did not ensure an even cut. After having switched to this Oster clipper, I have had ZERO trouble in getting a perfectly even cut, it has more than enough power, and cuts down hair with EASE. If you&#x27;re looking to get a nice pair of clippers for a reasonable price, look no further than this.</li>
            <li> This set is great for home use.  Haircuts are expensive, particularly for those of us not interested in getting styled.  Picked these up and they&#x27;ve already paid for themselves several times over!  So far the durability has been very good and I&#x27;ve saved myself a bunch of trips to the barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate the overall power as medium.  Definitely better than a cheapo set.  It has always worked fine on the humans, but we did try them on the dog once and the clippers got overwhelmed.  (I&#x27;m sure the dog was happy to get out of it anyway.)</li>
            <li> You can definitely feel the quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with this clipper for about a year, and finally gave up and bought a cheap Wahl. This one will NOT cut wet hair, and it barely cuts dry hair. What should take 10 minutes usually takes 30-40 because I have to go over and over my head to catch all the hairs this clipper misses.</li>
            <li> Very quiet compared to other models. does get kind of warm, but not scolding hot. The adjustment of the blade doesn&#x27;t go to zero spacing which is my only gripe. Very good quality otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, the attachments aren&#x27;t the traditional numbered sizes. so picking up a better, and more quality set of attachments would be useful</li>
            <li> We purchased this trimmer for two adults who maintain their hair at buzz cuts. Neither of us have super thick hair. Upon arrival, we both noticed it was a little slow (you have to move it through the hair very slowly or it pulls), and unwieldy, but acceptable. After 4 uses, it shut down and could not be revived. We tried several outlets etc. and there was no sign of life. Oster will not replace automatically, but you can pay to have it insured and shipped to them and then they may repair or replace. Luckily, we were still able to return through Amazon. We are going back to Wahl.</li>
            <li> Reading the reviews here, I&#x27;m stumped as to where all the praise is coming from. When I received these clippers, I expected to be in clipping heaven when I powered them up for the first time. When I actually did, I got a weak hum - weaker than my $25 clippers I bought at the local store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why it&#x27;s called &#x27;Fast feed&#x27;, as it isn&#x27;t fast, and it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;feed&#x27; on anything. It was painfully slow in cutting my hair, requiring over 30 passes over each individual segment. It took me about an hour and a half to cut my hair with this thing. I was using the official Oster combs with it which were an absolute nightmare to fit on the device but I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are terrible. I&#x27;m going to throw them in the bin tomorrow, back to the cheapo clippers I suppose.</li>
            <li> Just bought my first Oster to trim my beard and neck, Huge improvement over the Wahl lithium and groomsman models I keep buying, everything about it seems well built. Even the motor, sounds powerful yet quiet. It came with 4 plastic combs which the Andis I looked at did not. It also came with a larger bottle of oil.&lt;br /&gt;The blade adjustment is a convenient lever on the side that adjusts or adds to the cut height from 0 to 1.&lt;br /&gt;I trim my entire face to a one and a zero for my neck so I may not ever need the combs.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a really nice precision cut too, no pulled hairs and was fast. I have this thing about quality and doing things right, reliability is my top buying criteria, This one I like!&lt;br /&gt;And its made in the US!</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth, nice low hum, 00 cut, and it cuts like a Pro, naturally. all that&#x27;s needed now is the extra Guide Attachments. And BOOM BABY!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with clippers</li>
            <li> My husband was pleased that these didn&#x27;t pull his hair like our last pair of clippers.  They cut evenly.  My only complaint was that the on/off switch was really stiff.</li>
            <li> I keep a very simple &amp;#34;buzz style&amp;#34; short hair cut, and bought this unit hoping for a better quality cut than the $20-$25 units - but I am very disappointed.  It leaves just as many &amp;#34;straggler hairs&amp;#34; as the cheaper clippers (having to re-cut the same area MULTIPLE times, and then I still have to go back then with a scissors to get the many hairs it still missed).  Also this clipper does not offer a near zero depth cut.  (I must have missed that in the description - my bad I guess.)  The shortest it can cut is about 1/16&amp;#34;.  Some of the cheaper units can be adjusted to a near shaved result for any unwanted hair areas.  Not this one.  The motor is quieter, and unit is light and easy to work with, but the result is very disappointing.  I guess the options are to spend hundreds and get a truly professional grade clippers, or save a few buck and keep getting the cheap clippers.  But I won&#x27;t be buying or recommending this one to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great, and made in the USA!</li>
            <li> Sharp blades and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> Well... it cut my hair, so i guess it gets 5 stars.  Had a Wahl hair clipper before that wouldn&#x27;t cut near as well as this</li>
            <li> Easy to use, makes an even cut.</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper. It truly feels like a professional tool. I have been getting hair cuts for months now with this Oster clipper, it is doing a great job and never felt overwhelmed. I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t buy it earlier.</li>
            <li> This thing is fast and quiet! I would buy another one in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> This model clipper is good to begin hair cutting with. My only grip is I love a skin fade and this can not accomplish it, even though it says it does a 000 cut. It does not feel  like a 000 cut I normally get at the barber saloon. This is a great product to cut down on the cost of going to the barber shop every few weeks. So overall I am happy. It could of came with a hard box to store this product.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see, but I&#x27;m not impressed with how it cuts thick hair. It seems like it is having a lot of trouble cutting super thick hair (he has a ton of fine/not coarse hair)  I was hoping for an easier cutting experience.</li>
            <li> The Oster fast feed is one of the best clippers you can get period. Only flaw I find on it is it only comes with combs #1-4. But you probably won&#x27;t be using those anyways if you buy the andis magnetic guards.</li>
            <li> Had one that lasted 10 years perfect. This Model although quieter does not do a close shave. Ended up switching blade from my old onto the new motor it&#x27;s not that sharp but does a better job.</li>
            <li> I have had Whal for years but the magnets seem to weaken over time. (Or I don&#x27;t do proper maintenance cleaning. Oh well.) These are great and sharp. It does come with 4 combs ( short to 1/2&amp;#34;), oil and a brush for cleaning. It would be nice if it came with a bag or container too. The switch is a little tight, but it won&#x27;t accidentally turn off. I need a 3/4&amp;#34; comb so did a slight modification with my Dremel to a comb I had for my old clipper and it works great. Don&#x27;t hesitate. Great!</li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair(not much of it) and with the past clippers she had to make several passes. With this unit, one pass and it gets the job done. It now takes less than half the time with no pulls-smooth cut.  Art Dunford</li>
            <li> Broke after first use. Two weeks after receiving it the adjustable handle broke which made the whole clipper loose and useless.&lt;br /&gt;The nightmare continues with the return and all the run around which in the end leaves me feeling very unhappy!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before I bought this clipper. My husband needed one and I wanted to be able to cut my sons hair (scary, I know). I think this particular Clipper is worth the little extra money compared to the cheaper alternatives because it is superb quality. You can tell just by holding it that this will last a very long time. We are happy with this purchase and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a Clipper to last them a long time. The cord is also very long, which is a huge plus. Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> These are a great set of clippers. I wish they had metal replacement blades of different sizes like the Classic 76 model as the plastic guards are a bit fragile. I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for years and these blow any of the cheap sets you can buy at Walmart (Wahl) away.</li>
            <li> Clipper worked well, smooth cut.  Feel heavier than last pair I&#x27;m hoping they continue to be effective and give a precise cute.</li>
            <li> My brother scooped these out when he took his son to the barber.  I was actually looking at a different brand when he said not so fast.  I&#x27;ve used them a few times and love them.  I haven&#x27;t been to a barber in 12+ years with the exception of a few weddings, so a good solid clipper is what I need for regular weekly use.  We will see how long they last.  I typically replace after about a year, ordering new blades never seems to work for me.  I will try that for these first, then will probably buy the same model if that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Its ok,not like the way it was written in the review i read about it being the 3rd best hair clipper</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like these clipper they cut very slow and they&#x27;re very weak , I like the wahl senior because they cut very fast and they&#x27;re stronger.</li>
            <li> These clippers trim my head as though it were made of buttery cement, butter suggesting hair and cement scalp. They make a dull \\&quot;buzzing\\&quot; sound when invoked.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product, as described, now i just hope it holds up to its reviews.</li>
            <li> these are great clippers. Use them once every couple months to cut my hair, and they make the job so easy.</li>
            <li> Received my Oster fast feed hair clippers today and I cut my sons hair in half the time! they worked excellent felt great in my hand not heavy at all great product Oster! Also I always shop at Amazon but they really came through for me. I was not expecting it but the first pair of hair clippers that was sent out was stolen off my front porch Amazon reshipped the hair clippers overnight free of charge thank you so much Amazon also the representative from customer service was very friendly thanks Aric M.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper to replace a Wahl Professional clipper that was worn out. Either I have some really thick hair or these clippers don&#x27;t feed as fast as Oster thinks they do. If I don&#x27;t go slow, these clippers will either bog or miss some hair. I&#x27;ve been clippering my own head for 20 years and never had clippers act like this. I will definitely be going back to Wahl for my next clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, this clipper is quieter than any other that I&#x27;ve used. This isn&#x27;t a big deal if you&#x27;re used to the noise, but it did help settle my young boys down some to have a quieter clipper.</li>
            <li> This will go through your hair like a hot knife through butter.  It&#x27;s very quiet, yet powerful. Blades are sharp, but not so close/sharp that you need worry about cutting yourself.  It comes with a few attachments if you prefer a less than military appearance.  The clippers have an adjustable gate on the blades for a slightly less than shaved look.  Long cord is nice, also.  Comes with oil and cleaning brush.  Easy to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated: I have also started using this to shave my face when I don&#x27;t shave for a few weeks.  It works so much better than my Norelco trimmer on longer facial hair.  I still need to use the Norelco to get it down to stubble, but it only takes about 60 seconds to do so.  If you&#x27;re a bit of hairy guy (guilty), it can clear your chest hair off in a minute, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the negative comments on here are atypical, I believe.  I will say, this product won&#x27;t take your hair to the scalp.  I can&#x27;t tell you how close it cuts, but I would imagine it&#x27;s in the 1/16th to 1/32nd range.  If you have a beard trimmer you can finish with that or even a razor would have no trouble at all after the Oster was finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if one clipper can be all things to all people, but this is a great all purpose clipper. It won&#x27;t make you bald, but it will indiscernibly close.  It&#x27;s quiet...for a clipper.  It makes less noise than my Norelco trimmer.  If you are shaving your head multiple times a week, you don&#x27;t need these clippers.  Any trimmer will do for that frequency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had the Oster for six or so months and it has already paid for itself.  Read the comments before your decide which clipper is right for your needs.  This product gets 4-5 stars about 88% of the time.  The negative reviews are typically from people that didn&#x27;t do proper research on the inherent limitations of the product or just happened to have received a faulty item (it happens to every type of product and Amazon will take care of you ifit does).</li>
            <li> The description and the image don&#x27;t show that the clipper comes with 4 combs and a bottle of clipper oil.  I ordered the Oster 10 comb set to go with the clipper; but I didn&#x27;t need to.  The clipper comes with combs.  Amazon charged me $5.75 to return the combs, which I would not have ordered if the description had been more clear.  But I like the clipper just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my share of $20 clippers from Walmart and TJ Maxx.  This one works much better.  But I&#x27;m a little disappointed on how fragile the guards are.</li>
            <li> The first ones we got were broken and were not whisper quiet. The next ones were quiet and efficient. Overall good quality</li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t cut--they just pulled hair out. Not much power..very disappointing.waste of money...I felt they were misrepresented in every way!!!</li>
            <li> The noise is a minor inconvenence, it performs much better than my previous clippers. I have used it only a few times, I hope it lasts</li>
            <li> I can only say that i am disgusted, bought also an accumulator to change power from 2.2 to 1.1 and still burned the clipper, was happy only for 5 minutes:(</li>
            <li> This is such better quality than the cheaper Oster I last owned. Some reviews said it could be used on wet hair. I didn&#x27;t find that to be true, but they&#x27;re great nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Had it for awhile now, I use it about two times a month and still cuts like it&#x27;s brand new!</li>
            <li> Was able to give myself and my son a pro haircut very quickly. I shaved off about 4&amp;#34; of thick hair like it was nothing, while still keeping sharp control over tapers and fading. Excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vibration caused one of the screws to come loose and fall out, but I&#x27;m not sure what besides locktite would actually keep it in and still be able to remove the screws at a later time if I needed to. 4 stars for that.</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful and durable clipper. I had another Oster model that I bought about 1976 for about $25 at Sears and it worked great for almost 40 years until I dropped it on the floor and smashed it into pieces a month ago. It needed so little maintenance and just a couple of drops of oil each year or so. With this model, they even give you a tube of oil and a little brush to clean the blade heads. I was surprised by that when I open the package. This clipper can last you years and years, or even a lifetime, if you don&#x27;t smash the little thing on the floor. These clippers are as solid as a Kirby vacuum cleaner.</li>
            <li> These are very quiet and cut very well.  Less than half the noise level as the last clippers we had, and build quality is superb.  Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> This is the best clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.  I used to buy the $20 clippers at the store, and they were never able to cut my hair.  On top of that, just using them to shave my face I&#x27;d be lucky if one lasted 3 months.  I decided to buy this one, and it&#x27;s in another league compared to the garbage you find at the store.  My hair is very thick, and this thing cuts it effortlessly.  I cut my own hair, and i&#x27;ve probably saved a few thousand dollars in hair cuts since I&#x27;ve bought it.  I&#x27;ve had it for about 7 years now, and it still works perfectly.  I don&#x27;t know what else to say.  Stop messing with the garbage $20 clippers that last 2 months, and just buy this one.  It will be the last hair clipper you ever buy.</li>
            <li> It has a powerful but quiet motor that can cut through hair at a fast speed and the adjustable clippers make it a breeze to quickly add or subtract millimeters of length quickly while cutting. Excellent product for the price, no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> This product is very quiet and cuts very well. I only had to go over each area once. It would be nice to have more guards instead of just the four it comes with.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend recently graduated beauty school - but has been doing hair since 2008.  She used her bosses pair of clippers (she has had them for several years) and immediately fell in love.  My girlfriend said she will upgrade at some point - but these clippers are great for beginners and intermediates.  Durable , light , and they get the job done nicely.  Very good quality for the price. A+</li>
            <li> I actually purchased these clippers to trim my beard. I have very thick beard hair which is difficult to cut and my cheap trimmers just weren&#x27;t doing the job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oster Clippers:&lt;br /&gt;Cut quickly and cleanly&lt;br /&gt;Single pass cutting&lt;br /&gt;No stray/missed hairs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap Clippers:&lt;br /&gt;Cut slowly&lt;br /&gt;Required multiple passes on the same area&lt;br /&gt;Often missed hairs requiring me to keep going back over the same areas for a clean cut&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what else to say other than they worked well, very smooth and easy, and cut everything in the first pass. It feels very solid and well built (no rattling or anything like seen in some of the other clippers). I would have no problems recommending these clippers to someone based on my experience with them. The only additional item I would like from these clippers would be a slightly closer cut. It leaves the stubble just a tad longer than I would like, but it is a totally normal length for most clippers, so not really a negative, just something to wish for.</li>
            <li> Never used Oster&#x27;s before so I was skeptical before buying. After reading some of the reviews I had to give them a try. I wish they came with more guide combs but they don&#x27;t. No 0/1&#x27;s just blending, 2/3/4. You can buy guide combs elsewhere for them but none made specifically with these in mind. Great clippers but could be a little more versatile with the guide combs.</li>
            <li> I would think the Oster fast feed costing more than the Oster Salon pro would be a better hair clipper since it cost more but its not. It kept on biting and pulling my hair, as I never had a problem with the Salon pro.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really fast what I expected.</li>
            <li> relatively quiet; no problems</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time, so I can&#x27;t comment on anything but my first reaction.  I previously used two rechargeable models: the first, a Remington, \\&quot;Short Cut\\&quot; was awful; but I thought the second one, a Norelco QC5550, was great until it came apart in my hands.  Bottom line: I got this and it&#x27;s soo much better and easier it&#x27;s a joke.  I don&#x27;t know why I was hesitant to use something with a cord, but I attached this cord to a good extension cord and there was no problem at all doing it where I wanted.  They say some get hot in your hand, but I took a long time using it for the first time and it didn&#x27;t get hot at all.  This is a tool for grown-ups.  Those cordless ones were toys in comparison (and the Norelco one is almost the same price as this).</li>
            <li> the one thing I hate about amazon is there after a month no return policy. bought this hair clipper for my nephews birthday 2 months prior to his BD. when he got the present it didnt work but not before the thing started smoking obviously a burnt motor?  anyway told him I would replace it but by that time the return time frame that is amazons policy had expired. Next time I will buy from a box store they would have taken it back, no problem.  I love costco return policy &amp;#34; bring it back when ever, even if its out of date, years from now. 100% return!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!  High quality product!</li>
            <li> these clippers clog very easily and can be scratchy on the skin.</li>
            <li> excelent quality for the price point very quiet and smooth operation&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend</li>
            <li> Just cut my hair. I have thick hair. Ive cut my hair for close to 15 years. Ive never had clippers that wouldnt pull hair if i went to fast. These things ate awesome.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, good smooth clipping!  Love it</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, came in exactly as promised!  Thank You!</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase.  A big upgrade from my cheap Wahl clippers.  If you want the next level of haircutting, buy these.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by these now, and she wouldn&#x27;t dream of going back to cutting our boys&#x27; hair with scissors.  It pays for itself in five or six haircuts, the results look fantastic, and it takes 1/3 the time to cut their hair.  We went with Oster because I recognized the brand from my barber.  There&#x27;s a reason the pros use it.</li>
            <li> Great handling with lightweigt professional clippers.  Package comes complete with adjustable blade and all the options. Lightweight to use and very efficient!</li>
            <li> This clipper is very sturdy and seems to be well built. I plan on using it a lot in the future</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband for Christmas. It is far superior than any we have purchased from Walmart or other box stores. He says cutting his hair is a breeze now. It was definitely worth the $ to get one that is high quality, will last, and doesn&#x27;t pull his hair out.</li>
            <li> These work very well.  I bought them primarily for shaving my head.  The blade is sharp, quiet and doesn&#x27;t pull hairs out of my head like some other shaver&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used.  My only compliant is that that the blade width is just a little too wide which makes certain areas on my head (like behind my ears) harder to get at, but not impossible.  I don&#x27;t think they make shavers this powerful with a smaller blade anyway, but that being said it&#x27;s a nitpick.  I would recommend these clippers.</li>
            <li> These clippers work really well without having to oil them all of the time. They also have the adjustable handle on the side so you can really blend different sizes together. Doesn&#x27;t heat up too fast either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a few months now and it is nice !!! I was used to cheap trimmers that got clogged up if you were cutting more than 5 individual hair, and that overheated when used for more than 2 min. This machine really rocks ! It just plows forward and doesn&#x27;t get hot (just a tiny bit warm). It feels nice and heavy duty (doesn&#x27;t have the empty plastic bottle sound when you tap it, the wire is heavy gauge too). It is slightly noisier than the cheapo things but you&#x27;ll be done in a couple of minutes so you noise exposure will be limited.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m taking good care of it and hoping it&#x27;ll last a long time !</li>
            <li> My Son has been using his Oster clippers regularly for more than 10 years - trouble free!&lt;br /&gt;I tried them,. really liked them, and ordered this current but advanced version of this tried and true clipper.  I&#x27;m not a barber, but the adjustable blade feature on this makes it unnecessary to clip on a guide for a buzz-cut about 1/8 inch long. The weight, warmth during operation, overall comfort and balance make this a truly professional clipper that should last for many years. Other Oster products I own like my blender and food processor have given me many years of dependable, reliable service  - and this clipper appears to follow in quality and reliability. Great job, Oster!</li>
            <li> This is quiet and does a good job.  Not as good a job as the reviews lead me to believe but still ok.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, not too difficult to clean (and oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great quality. Definitely a good long term investment.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Clippers work great.  The attachments are a bit flimsy, and one of them broke.  I ended up having to buy a separate set of attachments, and have since not had any issues.</li>
            <li> Got this to replace my Wahl that I had for 5 years. What a difference! Much smoother and faster! Perfectly even cut and no pullng. The Akro Mills 12&amp;#34; craft box sold on Amazon will hold these, Lube and Blade wash plus guards perfectly!</li>
            <li> I love these Oster clippers they are sharp,quality built,lighter,quieter than my old clippers. I was use to those $20-30 Wahl/store brand clippers you find at you look grocery stores. They would do there job but I felt they would struggle to keep up especially when I would go 4 weeks w/out a hair cut. Not these I also went 4 weeks w/out a hair cut just to really try them out &amp; these clipper went through my hair like butter. I was surprised at 1st when they did not make as much noise cutting my hair but with each pass big hair balls would fall to the floor. Instruction do recommended other Oster cleaners/lube/disinfectant but I think I will try vinegar &amp; hydrogen peroxide to clean &amp; disinfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this thing for about 2 years now. It does a fantastic job, cuts through my hair very easily, does an even job, never chokes up. It paid for itself in the first couple of months. The noise isn&#x27;t bad at all - it&#x27;s noisier using the plastic combs, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to purchase some sort of blade wash with this - blade wash keeps it clean and sanitized. The less crud in moving parts, the longer it&#x27;ll last. Lubricate it, too. You don&#x27;t need much oil for it.</li>
            <li> Quiet running and does a great job cutting close.</li>
            <li> So nice to use a product that feels heavy weight/durable - not cheap plastic junk. They are so quiet, and yet do the job perfect. Would be nice if it came in a little carrying case, but I just found an old travel case that I store it in. I have only had these for about a month or so, but they seem great so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for years now. Not heavy use--just cutting my own hair. It&#x27;s still working well without any issues, maintenance (other than oiling the blades) or sharpenings. Worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> It cuts quite well and is extremely quiet compared to the 30 year old Oster clippers it replaced. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> No more trips to the groomer. Pays for itself in just a few uses, depending on your dog and groomer fees. Easy to operate as long as you&#x27;re going short. I have a golden and am having difficulty getting the knack of blending, but for trimming fur on the belly and between the pads of her paws, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> These really mow through the hair and give a nice finished product.  I have thin hair and it doesn&#x27;t miss anything.  You can&#x27;t really use them for edging like my old Wahl&#x27;s as they just don&#x27;t get close enough when adjusted down.  The actual trim is far superior so it&#x27;s a good pay-off.  The combs it comes with are a #2,3,4 and some type of blending guide, probably comparable to a #1.  Works perfect for me as I never go longer than a #4 on top.  I&#x27;ll give them a 4 as some type of case would have been nice.</li>
            <li> Works great. Much much better quality than the andis and whal trimmer I tried out at the same price point. Gets slightly warm, but my wife is only cutting the family&#x27;s hair with it. Best trimmer she&#x27;s ever used. Nothing at Walmart comes even close. Cuts as good as the one my lady uses at sport clips. Saved $80 in cuts in the last 3 months alone...if you include the kids, we&#x27;ve saved hundreds. Best investment I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> Everything shipped fine as expected. I also bought some extra attachments since not all sizes were included. I&#x27;ve now used it for about 10 hair cuts and could not be happier. I hope it continues to hold up well. It cuts very well right out of the box. My son and I love the quietness of it too. Huge difference there from my old Wahl that was really loud from plastic that was cracked. Great trimmer for the money.</li>
            <li> the best feature about this item is it doesn&#x27;t give you razor bumps. my skin is highly sensitive. n g</li>
            <li> I love this clipper!  It&#x27;s powerful and feels like barber shop quality clippers!  I&#x27;ve gotten quite good at giving myself a haircut.  I did buy universal guides to accompany this and I would recommend this to others as well.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cuts extremely well, clean, and fast&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Lacks variety with guides that come with it would be better if it had more commonly used sizes. I highly recommend getting the 10 set of universal guides because the guides that come with the clippers are insufficient.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It has paid for itself many times over.  No more $13 trips to the barber shop and waiting to get a chair.  My wife does my hair in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Very quiet, very smooth. I use the 000 setting, and it was very smooth going over the skin. The motor frequency is very low pitched, so its very nice to use. It cuts really well, and its easy to grip. I have large hands, and it was comfortable. I think smaller hands should have no problem. I found this to be a better model than the basic, but not quite as expensive as the top of the line. I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Works well no battery fuss.Just plug it in an away go the whiskers.Buy this over other clippers you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Very powerful. Very quiet. Very sharp. Included combs are the right length for beards and eyebrows. Great buy. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I finally got tired of paying other people to cut my hair. I decided to invest in one of these machines and let my wife cut my hair from now on. I had a cheap Norelco beard trimmer with a built in vacuum, and we first tried using that to cut my hair. BAD IDEA. They didn&#x27;t cut very smoothly, and my wife had to go over the same spot several times to get any consistency. By contrast, these things cut almost perfectly the FIRST TIME! Fantastic purchase, and I&#x27;m looking forward to never paying for a haircut again :-)</li>
            <li> shaves off my curly winter mop without a hiccup.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews prior to buying my first clipper. It was easy to use and seemed to cut the hair well. Seems well built. It should pay for itself in a few months.</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper, very similar to the andis master in performance. Lighter but maybe not quite as durable. I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of months but it is a great addition to my set!</li>
            <li> Works for me - durable and efficient.</li>
            <li> Really excellent clipper -- goes right through the thickest hair without stalling in the least.  A very professional product -- worth every penny.  The only problems are: 1) only four combs are provided.  For the price there should be 6-8 combs.  2) Again, for the price there should be a plastic case included.  But the clipper itself is perfect.</li>
            <li> I read lots of reviews before I bought. Used it about 20 times already. Perfect. Would buy another today if needed.</li>
            <li> I had a Whal from walmart that lasted a while, but then just quit. After looking around I found this. My hair is not super thick or thin, but this thing works efficiently and quietly. It does come with a few different sizes as one other post mentioned.</li>
            <li> These did not cut very fast at all and I had to go over the same areas multiple times to cut everything evenly. After 3-4 uses the blade would not stay tight and just kept coming off so they were returned.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of a clipper.  I researched a lot of other clippers and settled on this set due to previous reviews, perceived quality, and price point.  I have used them twice at home.  The clipper set comes with a detail cleaning brush, tube of lubricating oil, and several plastic guards.  I have not used the guards as I purchased a complete set separately.  The clipper is really quiet.  All you hear is a humming noise.  You can easily carry on a conversation with the person cutting your hair.  The adjustment lever is firm and stays where you put it.  The lever is not graduated; it does not have different positions.  It adjusts from 0 to 1/2 which suits my purpose fine.  The switch seems alright.  I think they could have used a higher quality switch but I can&#x27;t specifically say this one is not suitable.  I have thick, medium course hair and this clipper cuts wet or dry with no problem.  All considered, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.  This clipper should last for years in at-home use, maybe even commercial use.</li>
            <li> Like them. Very light in weight and a prefect compliment to my Andis Fade Masters.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to do a buzz cut on yourself, or are ready to stop going to the barber for a haircut you can do yourself.... than this product will work as advertized for you.  I&#x27;m going bald ad decided to take the plundge.... Use it every week and everytime I&#x27;m getting better and faster at just getting a buzz cut.  Have saved myself over $60.00 to the day on trips to the barber shop, gas and wear and tear... the wife likes it too...lol</li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair, short.  We have been using Costco purchased clipper sets for a few years.  I keep the equipment clean, sharp, and lubed.  I bought the Oster Pro 510 Fast Feed Clipper on a whim (I like good tools).  My wife Jean, who could care less about the quality of a tool, raved about this Clipper in comparison to the Costco bought Conair.  She called it a Rolls Royce, and said that she didn&#x27;t have to keep going over the same area to get the cut she wanted. In 35 years, I&#x27;ve never heard he go on about a tool, it was well worth the few dollars more.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Cuts through hair easily, no pull.  I would recommend this to everyone who needs a nice set of clippers.</li>
            <li> I was afraid at first, but after a couple uses, was very comfortable with it.  Had to order a better assortment of combs, though.  The product works very well,  is easy to use and does a great job.  I would recommend it, strongly.  I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Everything was received and works as expected.  The real question would be how is it working 1, 2, or 3 years from now.  For now, it does a good job.</li>
            <li> Not as good as all the reviews. The one I bought from Costco for $25 - $30 dollars is so much better.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product because it cuts very smoothly. Although it doesn&#x27;t have different size blades, the guards work just fine. Oster is a great manufacture who also makes blenders, waffle machines, and etc. Definitely a purchase worth making!</li>
            <li> Best buzzer I own to date. Now I longer need to go to the barber shop. It pays for itself in the long run!</li>
            <li> My hubby tried to give our son his first haircut with the clippers that he has had for ??? years. Many tears and bald spots later, he found these on Amazon for a great price. Once these clippers arrived he immediately went to work on fixing up the baby&#x27;s hair. These clippers were so smooth and easy to use that I took over just because it looked like fun. The baby liked the smooth vibration and there were no tears this time. I LOVE THESE CLIPPERS!!!</li>
            <li> Nothing great. Ok product when compared to price and quality .</li>
            <li> works well; I cut my own hair with it once a week and touch up a few spots with my electric razor.</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper for the price, very professional and quiet. It does an excellent job</li>
            <li> Easy, quiet, fast - I gave myself a professional looking cut on the very first try</li>
            <li> I use this oster on my family work&#x27;s great realy quite I recomend it</li>
            <li> great product my husband loved it</li>
            <li> Purchased these after using cheap conair brand for years to shave my head. Have used these at least 10 times now, and wow. With the blades at 00 cut, I have not cut or nicked myself, and the blades glide right over my skin, cutting the air to about 1 days growth. These are very quiet compared to the cheaper brands, and cut so much better. I can&#x27;t really say anything bad about these, they are performing so well. For a guy that shaves his head about twice a week, I couldn&#x27;t ask for better trimmers. Keep the blades oiled and these should last years.</li>
            <li> Great clippers. Just as ordered. My son uses them to cut his hair VERY short since he is going bald. Nice an quiet. Better than the ones they replace.</li>
            <li> Wonderful clippers. Make cutting hair so easy.</li>
            <li> Superb quality, delivered on time</li>
            <li> My normal barbershop is closed for several months because the owner has an unknown medical problem. Since my haircut price was only $10.00 (senior discount) plus $2.00 tip I looked around for alternatives.  Many of the alternatives charged $25.00 to $40.00.  Since I have very little hair I recoiled at the idea of paying that much.  What was I to do until my barber returns?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After researching many barber clippers and haircutting kits on the Internet and YouTube videos on how to cut men&#x27;s hair, I decided to purchase the Oster Professional Fast Feed Clipper.  The Oster Classic 76 is better, but more than I need.  The Oster Professional Fast Feed Clipper is adjustable from size 000 to size 1 blade and comes with 4 guide combs.  The clipper has more than enough power.  It is well made and works well.  I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea was for my wife to cut my hair at least until my barber reopens his shop.  My wife was terrified at the idea of cutting my hair. She was sure she would do a terrible job.  After showing her several haircutting tutorials on the Internet, she reluctantly agreed to try cutting my hair (mostly side and back trimming and taper since I am bald on top).  She used the techniques we saw on YouTube that involved using the guide combs and the results were very good.</li>
            <li> This is a 5-star clipper. It runs perfectly and cuts really well. I hardly need to pass the clippers on the same spot more than once, and it gives an even cut. It&#x27;s a breeze to maintain, and the included combs do the job just fine for my hair-type.&lt;br /&gt;One star was deducted for the comb breaking. It seems like this happens with multiple users, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these clippers for 2 years now, and they are very reliable.  I&#x27;ve kept them oiled, and I use about 2x week to clip my head and beard.  They clip pretty close, and while no electric clipper will bring you to blade close, these are great to bring me down to a 00 or perhaps 000 closeness on my head.  The weight is fine for managing one handed with a cord, and they have a good heft, giving me a good sense of a substantial motor.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not fond of the guards, but then I don&#x27;t use them for the length I want.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not found a changeable head for this clipper, but for the moment, I don&#x27;t want to either.&lt;br /&gt;If the cat were to dump these clippers in the sink, I would buy them again.  I think it would take some serious abuse to break these.</li>
            <li> I went from a 4 year old junk CVS clipper to this. Simply UNREAL improvement - night and day. It hums and shreds my thick hair with ease. It is pretty heavy so it can get tiring - but to me that&#x27;s worth it since it feels very solid and well built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is that it only comes with a few guiding combs...but it came with the one I use (#2) so I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> If you want to start cutting your hair at home this is a mut have. It powers through the thickest hair....</li>
            <li> Bought this 2 years back, and it is still going strong. I have dense, thick hair and I cut it about once a month. Good investment, and I don&#x27;t need to wait in line at the barber.</li>
            <li> Got it for self-buzz cuts, was not disappointed. It gets a little warm without any attachments but its bearable. Very powerful and quiet. [...] Here&#x27;s a video regarding it&#x27;s quick and easy maintenance.</li>
            <li> Bought clippers as a birthday present for the hubby who is very peculiar about his hair.  He absolutely loved them!</li>
            <li> This unit operates as advertised and it&#x27;s well constructed.  My problems with it involve it&#x27;s tendency to accumulate hair on the top of the clipper comb and that reduces it&#x27;s ability to feed and cut hair.  You can handle this problem by watching the hair build-up and simply remove it as you go.  Another problem for me is that it&#x27;s sometimes difficult to get hair to feed into the comb so it can be cut.  It tends to just &amp;#34;run over&amp;#34; the hair and press it down instead of cutting it.  I have found that changing direction will frequently solve this problem.  I guess most of my problems are &amp;#34;user caused&amp;#34; and I just need to practice more.  I compare my experience to watching a professional hair cutter and how effortless their clippers seem to work.  It&#x27;s probably not a fair thing to do.  For the money, it&#x27;s a good deal and worth the cost...just learn how to use it properly!!</li>
            <li> Hello if ya&#x27;ll don&#x27;t know these Fast Feeds are amazing. They cut at a 000-1A ... I used them 2 weeks ago on myself and wow, they cut evenly and left me so crispy. (a good thing) My fade was legit. I did a bald fade. yup. fresh Amazon was fast and very professional.  When I cut my hair the clippers didn&#x27;t get hot AT ALL. When I cut my cousin&#x27;s hair I noticed a lil more about the heat. These clippers don&#x27;t start heating up until about 25+ minutes or so and even then they only get warm. Not too hot.  Pros: Light in hand, arm doesn&#x27;t get tired as fast. They are quiet and powerful. They can cut through both wet and dry hair. I thought I needed two of them but I cancelled one seeing as to how much of a quality clipper this is. MADE IN THE USA BABY!  The only cons I have about these bad boys They don&#x27;t come with a full set of attachments but you can always get those purple Andis magnetic guards..  Conclusion: I love these clippers. They are of high quality.  ***Update 12/27/2015 - I have been using these on myself and on my friends to develop my skills. Some 400-500 hair cuts later, they still work great. I use these for precision blending, fading out to higher levels of cutting. Great tool. Only needed one after all.  I have been using them for years and they only heat up if you don&#x27;t lube em up right. I use Andis Cool Care spray while they&#x27;re on to let the oil work itself in. I use em for like 30-45 minutes sometimes and then they start to warm up.  If you&#x27;re looking for a clipper to take out the bulk in a salon setting, use a different one. These can do it but I associate them with blending.  I went a little crazy and bought two of these, two of the Limited Edition Chrome ones, and I just bought the Oster Topaz Fast Feeds... Next is going to be the black Oster Speed Line and blue Fast Feeds.</li>
            <li> I only use it to trim body hair to my desired length.  It works well even with my fine arm hair!</li>
            <li> Happy with clipper. Cuts nicely but hard to use because of cheap, stiff cord.&lt;br /&gt;Also, guide combs not very durable.</li>
            <li> Love the old school look and feel. This clipper will last forever if taken care of. Works great. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This top of the line clipper is everything the description implied it to be.  With so many choices we&#x27;re very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> hair today gone tomorrow</li>
            <li> This machine does a great job at blending, so says my boyfriend of a barber. It came in sooner than I expected. And it does its job well!</li>
            <li> Ive been cutting my hair for about 15 years and these are the best clippers I have ever used. 5 stars</li>
            <li> Having grown tired of cheap clippers that sounded like a small lawnmower and pulled my hair like a screaming infant, I decided it was time to step up to a more reliable model. The decision was between these and the Oster 76, and I&#x27;m quite happy I went with these. They have yet to give more than two haircuts in a day, but odds are slim that they&#x27;ll see more than that. For a good, solid pair of family clippers that will last a long time, these are a good investment.</li>
            <li> what a deal. I had been using some &amp;#34;budget&amp;#34; hair clippers for a while. I got myself a gift and I love these clippers. The best deal and best haircut yet. not so loud and they hold up too</li>
            <li> Have only used it a couple of times, so we&#x27;ll have to see. Definitely much quiter than your average drugstore clippers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman who likes short hair &amp; dislikes paying a fortune to keep it that way. I was afraid that I&#x27;d end up looking like an inmate from One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest if I cut my own hair, but ongoing unemployment finally drove me to take the plunge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is SO easy! I buzz the back, sides &amp; half the top, then just trim the front with scissors to leave some bangs and it comes out great - even had a few people ask where I get my hair done, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re new to it, there are a zillion YouTubes that show how to use a clipper. I also got a set of the large Andis magnetic guides that go up to 1&amp;#34; long. the clipper is supremely easy to use, solidly made, fits the hand well. wish the cord was just a bit longer, and it would&#x27;ve been nice if it came with a case of some kind, as others have mentioned. I don&#x27;t understand the complaints I&#x27;ve seen about the power button - there&#x27;s nothing awkward or inconvenient about it. maybe was an adjustment for those already used to some other clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a powerhouse that I fully expect will last me all of my days.</li>
            <li> These clippers are without a doubt a good set to have at home if you are cutting your own hair or your kids hair.&lt;br /&gt;They are quiet and fairly easy to handle.  Stay on top of the maintenance for these clippers and you will&lt;br /&gt;save yourself allot of money.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased these clippers for his shop. He loves them and has used this same brand in the past. He&#x27;s satisfied and we will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> moved up from a Whal, glad i did, this sucker cuts clean and FAST.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and quiet clipper with many size attachments. Easy to clean and blade stays sharp. No barbers needed with one of these babies.</li>
            <li> Very good machine, the only negative is the flimsy adjustment leaver that&#x27;s made of a very cheap plastic. I replaced the leaver from an old clipper I had laying around.</li>
            <li> Before getting these I would buy the Wal-Mart specials (approximately one every six months) and finally got fed up when my cheapos died in Afghanistan... I looked for a replacement locally but couldn&#x27;t find what I was looking for so decided to go through Amazon.  I stumbled on this gem and had them come my way... they work as advertised and cut hair better than the one it replaced plus, I haven&#x27;t had to do anything but clean and oil them between cuttings and they are still running strong.  There are two things to keep in mind though... they will get hot and they do make a lot of noise.  Truthfully I never really noticed it because I&#x27;m a cheap ass and only think about the money saved (approximately $1000 per year).  I noticed when I started cutting my kids hair and he was squirming and complaining of the warmth... I bought some of that can Ice spray and give it a shot every once in awhile to keep it cool.  I knocked off a star for the heat and noise because in my mind a perfect rating has to be earned, not given just for doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> very god machine.terrible repeat terrible electrical cord. Saved you probably 10 cents to put a softer cord on the unit .Klaus.</li>
            <li> Regrettably my old barber, Roy, has passed on and is now trimming the beards of the Angels. I have spent the past 6 months trying to find a new barber but haven&#x27;t found anyone I liked. I don&#x27;t have much hair. All Roy had to do was give me a number three on top and a two on the sides. I decided I could do that myself so I bought these clippers based on the cost and the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a well-built device with some heft and a long, fairly heavy power cord. It comes with four clip-on guides, some oil, and a cleaning brush. It does not come with a storage case, which is a shame. I store it in the original box, but it&#x27;s not convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guides are marked 1/2\\&quot;, 3/8\\&quot; etc instead of the #3, #4 I was expecting. I&#x27;m not sure how these guides relate to the numbers Roy used to cut my hair. I started with the 1/2\\&quot; and my hair is longer that normal after a haircut. I&#x27;ll try the 3/8\\&quot; next time. I&#x27;m sure I will figure it out eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little tricky cutting your own hair, even with a mirror. I had to ask my wife to help at the back. I think she got a kick out of it. So far I&#x27;ve saved $20 :-) These clippers will pay for themselves in six months. They&#x27;re so well made I think they&#x27;ll last 10 years.</li>
