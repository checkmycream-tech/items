    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Great Anti-Aging Cream. It does Exactly what it is suppose to do.  I reduces the fine/deep lines within days. I just love this cream because of the moisture it gives your skin. It gives you a great glow and foundation goes on easily after the cream is applied. This is possibly the best I have ever tried and will continue to use. Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this Moisturizing Cream as you will be happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Very good moisturizer that does not cause me to breakout like others have. Perfect paired with the serum.</li>
            <li> Great natural cream. Love that it is unscented as I tend to get headaches from perfumes. Love using this at night and wake up with much smoother healthier skin. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 70 I don&#x27;t expect too much anti aging.  Like the cream.</li>
            <li> i always used this its making my face so soft, this brand was really good</li>
            <li> I like how refreshing and cool it feels on the skin. It isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t clog the poors. Makes me feel like I&#x27;m taking good care of myself.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. And o don&#x27;t  like the smell of it</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive, sun damaged and not so young skin.  I have no irritation from this product.  I have been using it for two weeks and I see an improvement.  There is not perfume to irritate and no &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feel.  I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for about a week. The CoQ10 ingredient intereated me. Iam a big fan of CoQ10. I take this supplement everyday and really curious how it performs on skin. I like the texture of this cream, non greasy but keep my skin moist most the day. It is easy to be absorbed and doesnt need a lot to cover my fat face.&lt;br /&gt;I TECEIVED THIS PROSUCT FOR FREE OR DISCOUNTED IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST UNBIASED  REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredient list.  It really takes care of all of my skin concerns without having to use a lot of different night creams. I take herbal medicines, and eat organic, why would I use a skin product that is entirely chemical based? It goes on light and is not greasy at all. I am glad that I was given the opportunity to try this cream, and will continue to buy and use , highly recommended.</li>
            <li> this is the only cream has amount of full loads natural ingredients . it has a very nice scent and absorbs quickly into your skin . it silky smooth, firmer ,soft,radiant look. i am using 3 kinds with DERMA-NU; 1st serum, 2nd eye gel, 3rd cream. i love!!! them all .</li>
            <li> I got this cream at a great price, and it is wonderful! Really nice smelling, smooth and makes my skin brighter and definitely more moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a cream and this one has been really good on my skin so far. I don&#x27;t usually use anything on my skin because I am a bit scared of how My skin will react to it but this cream went on smoothly. I like that it isn&#x27;t oily and applies smoothly. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, just a light scent but I can&#x27;t even smell it after a bit. My skin feels smooth. Definitely nice cream. I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks in a couple wks. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my second day using this miracle cream. I apply this in the morning after I use the Derma-nu serum and at night after washing my face. My extremely dry winter skin feels so supple and soft. The cream smells amazing, like cucumber to me. No flaky skin on my face or neck, at all. This is a very high quality product and a little goes a long way! I highly recommend this Heaven in a bottle. Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> for my skin, it was far too greasy...</li>
            <li> High Quality a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I like the feel.  Not tacky but smooth and creamy. Can not tell you overall effectiveness yet.  Too soon!</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product and most likely will reorder.  Thank you! 😊</li>
            <li> I have highly sensitive skin. This product is perfect, lefty skin moisturized and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Derma-nu Youth Regenerating Moisturizing Cream works really well. It leaves my face feeling moisturized instead of feeling tight. I use it in the morning and also right before I go to bed. I am really glad I decided to take the risk in trying this. I will stick with this moisturizing cream from now on.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this product and I will use it for the rest of my life! For the first time in so long, I actually felt confident enough to leave my house without foundation. Men have been flirting with me everywhere I seem to go these days. A man approached me at the grocery store and told me I was a beautiful lady and that my husband is very lucky! I thought that was a fluke until my husband and I went shopping at a bath tile company and the owner told my husband how beautiful I was and then it happened again while my husband and I were were browsing at the mall. I literally had my hair in a ponytail with no make up whatsoever and a guy still went on and on about how beautiful my skin is. I felt so uncomfortable with the attention I was getting in front of my husband but definitely flattered. I swear I am not lying. This all happened within the last two weeks. My pores are barely noticeable and my skin is glowing! I will never stop using this.</li>
            <li> How do you compare the hundreds of skin care products? As a regular tester, I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these are helpful to you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance: Mild sharp herbal scent.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: The heavy white cream spreads smoothly and feels moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption: Moisturized, slight protective film that isn’t unpleasant or heavy.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: Oily skin types might find this too heavy for the face. Excellent for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No.&lt;br /&gt;~ Packaging: 2oz plastic wide-mouth jar with screw top.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* Skin looks brighter and fresher.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* Lots of beneficial ingredients in this including a ton of excellent herbal extracts. If you’re looking for a moisturizer that also packs a healing and anti-aging punch, this would be a good choice. This has more and better active ingredients than many serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this moisturizing cream: the four core ingredients really pack in a lot of powerful skincare compounds. While it takes awhile for the effects of daily topical Vitamin C use to really show you&#x27;ll notice the other ingredients like the MSM (which decreases swelling and inflammation) and the hyaluronic acid (which is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used) immediately. I&#x27;d absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I tried this moisturizer for a few days after I received it, and will not use it again. The consistency is thick, which I usually like except it does not soak into the skin like a moisturizer should and leaves a residue film of lotion all over. The scent was terrible, which I would tolerate if the product actually worked. Will not use this moisturizer again.</li>
            <li> I love this! Makes my skin feel so smooth! And smells kind of like cucumbers!</li>
            <li> This cream, while it does not have a real fragrance, works really well. Not greasy, soaks in nicely. I really like it! Too early to tell about wrinkle results, but so far so good!!</li>
            <li> I just love this product..It makes skin so hydrated and soft...The eye gel and hydrolic acid firming gel are also awsome!!..already bought more and that is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> If you want to feel fresh and brand new, use this! It really gives you a pampered feel. Works great!</li>
            <li> Love it!  My face feels moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this product..it smells so fresh!!</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with product</li>
            <li> Loving it.  Only have used it a few days but it is not sticky and I use it on my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It DOES make the skin tighter, no doubt.  Like the skin is thicker.....and healthier looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Antioxidants in it and the HA is for the wrinkles.  ;-)</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this cream. The ingredients are amazing. I use it twice ad day: in the morning and at night and it moisturizes, nourishes and soothes my naturally dry skin well. It&#x27;s fragrance free and smells like the medley of amazing natural ingredients that it&#x27;s made with.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made in the USA. When I run out of this promotional sample, I shall definitely being buying more of it - a keeper for sure.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this cream as a promotional sample and this is my objective opinion and experience of using it. Great cream indeed!</li>
            <li> My wife has been using the serum two weeks and she see&#x27;s a nice improvement in her skin.  She then purchased&lt;br /&gt;the moisturizer and has been using for a week and is pleased so far with the product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this miracle cream! The ladies in my family have started to use it after my results. I received this to review.</li>
            <li> after application, have little sticky feeling, will slowly smoothen after few pats on face. coco butter smells great</li>
            <li> Received this products in a great perfect condition works like wonder to me, i noticed that my skin is not as dry as it used to be.😍😍</li>
            <li> I currently am using three Derma-nu products - the eye gel, the firming serum, and the moisturizing cream.  I think all three products are wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how little product (moisturizer) is needed  to cover the entire face, neck, and décolletage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let the eye gel and the firming serum completely dry before adding the moisturizer.  I&#x27;m very glad to have found the Derma-nu products.  The suppleness of my skin is the reward for finding the products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for a couple days and have yet to tell a difference, I will continue to use and update my review in a few weeks. Doesn&#x27;t have a horrible smell but it could have a better scent.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely cream.  It absorbs well, and your skin stays nice and soft after application.  I like to put it on after washing my face before going to bed, and I always wake up with smooth, supple skin.  I would say the rich texture is better for mature, dry skin. It&#x27;s an excellent product and I would recommend it to anyone who struggles with a drier complexion.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!!! It is the first time I have found a moisturizer that actually moisturizes my skin...I mean really adds moisture and suppleness...and keeps it feeling good ALL DAY, without any greasy or oily feeling. I have tried sooooo many face creams...expensive, inexpensive...nothing has truly left my skin feeling moisturized, soft, and smooth until I tried this product. I use it on my neck and face, and use it morning and night.  It has a very nice light scent that does not linger.  A little goes a long way, so I feel that it is a very good deal.  This cream is amazing!  So happy I found it on Amazon :)</li>
            <li> This cream has a nice moisturizing  texture and smell.  It is priced reasonably and I hope it is doing some good.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this anti aging cream, my face is so soft after applying this cream, it has vitamin C and B5 and also organic herbs and oils.nothing can be better than that is exactly what I need it to keep my face looking good. I can use it in the morning and at night. This product is worth it and I got it for a good price :)</li>
            <li> Love Love Love these products.  I have been using for about a week now and can tell my face is brighter and more refreshing looking.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for ways to keep my skin moisturized and protected from the sun, when your&#x27;e in your 50&#x27;s you need all the help you can get. Youth Regenerating Moisturizing cream by derma-nu came to my rescue, it is a nice quality product which I was excited to get and try out. I am  concerned with aging as gracefully as possible and looking for a product that delivers what it promises and one that works for you, is no easy task. But this product is a keeper for me and one that I would recommend to anyone looking for a great moisturizing cream for morning and night for your face, neck and even your hands.</li>
            <li> REALLY LIKE this product. Feels like a healthy product and looks good all day. A fraction of the cost of my former designer brand. I plan on reordering!</li>
            <li> Smoothed out mum&#x27;s skin made it seem fuller her face i mean. Non greasy  and soaks in quickly. Like it.</li>
            <li> Works great on my face and neck! Absorbs right in. My skin looks more even and bright since using it.</li>

            <li> I got my cream and a matter of days timely shipping. I tried the cream for a total of five days. The product itself is a nice thick cream that should last a long time not Runny or thin at all.  The cream moisturizer made my skin feels smooth and soft. It took away lines around my eyes for head mouth and evened out my skin tone.  I like the product as my skin is very dry and they gave me a nice smooth feeling.  I&#x27;ve tried many products to help with my skin tone and many of them were off too fast. This one last stays with you and smooth feeling. I very dry skin as my skin isare constantly under water. This product stays on and is observed into skin. I received the  moisturizing cream at a heavily discounted/free from Amazon to give my honest opinion in review.</li>
            <li> I love this cream...I feel like I&#x27;m pampering my face every time I put it on. My only wish is that it had sunscreen in it!</li>
            <li> Delightfully light skin cream that feels so nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> I could see a difference in my skin within 9 days but when people at work starting commenting on it as well, I knew I had hit on a great product!  This one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> I have been used moisturizing cream and Serum for couples week so far so good .I saw my skin had a little brighter but The eye cream doesn&#x27;t work for me .It make my skin burned .i stop used it ..</li>
            <li> you will love this, feels great on not greasy</li>
            <li> So far, I like this product.  It&#x27;s never greasy yet moistrurizing.</li>
            <li> This is the &amp;#34;cats pajamas&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve tried cream after cream to get to those deep wrinkles around my lips. I took a chance and choose to give this a try. I normally do not do these kinds of things as I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;if it&#x27;s not broke don&#x27;t fix it&amp;#34;, however obviously something was wrong. Derma-nu is fantastic. I hope to see them come out with more products. I love this product and would gladly gift this to anyone.  UPDATE: I&#x27;m still in love with Derma-nu Miracle Skin Remedies. It continues to help with all the unsightly wrinkles we get as we age. I still would recommend this to a friend any day. This product continues to give me the results I need. I appreciate that.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough about the collection of products I received from Derma-Nu.  They came highly recommended by a friend so I had to try them and I am very glad I did.  Don&#x27;t let the simple packaging fool you.  These products are packed with wonderful ingredients which my sensitive, dry skin loved and the light natural smell is very pleasing.  You definitely want to buy the complete set.  Your skin will feel firmer, moisturized and pampered, like you just had a spa treatment.  So pleased with all 5 of these products!  - (I will leave the same review for all the products)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Youth Regenerating Moisturizing Skin Cream is just wonderful!  My dry face loves it!  I love it as a night cream - my face still feels hydrated in the morning.  After 1 week I noticed a more evenness in skin tone, moisture and appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid Serum is amazing! My skin felt firm and toned the very 1st time I used it.  After about 2 weeks I can really see a difference in my fina lines and my face has a nice glow from the Vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Youth Activating Eye Gel is so great!  I love that it comes in a gel form because it is so soothing.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes at all.  As soon as I put it on the eye area looks firmer and my little lines seem to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mineral Body Scrub is heavenly!  I feel like I&#x27;ve been to the spa after I use it.  It smells wonderful and is so versatile.  I use it on my face, hands and body.  My skin feels so smooth and pampered after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera Moisturizing Skin Cream is super rich &amp; emollient!  It is a delicious tub of yummy moisture that lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a face moisturizer that accomplishes multiple phases of skin care without doing multiple treatments –it heals, moisturizes, treats aging skin, treats skin infirmities and makes skin radiant. This product has it all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of the expense and clutter of so many products this one  provides the necessary treatment I want for my skin. It moisturizes skin, but doesn’t leave an oily or shiny look. It doesn’t dry out skin easily after an application, but it remains moisturized throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I’ve bought products that made me break out, but Derma-nu is very good - no break outs or harshness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing about this is you can use it under make-up and it comes out beautiful with an even tone. With Derma-nu my skin remains supple and soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I love this face cream it&#x27;s amazing I was in a wow after I used this product the result was amazing I loved the way my face felt after using it I&#x27;m so pleased with this product and my recommendations are go for it, it&#x27;s definitely effective and worth the money!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when choosing this product at first b/c there are so many various age defying/skin products on the market to choose from w/ so many promising aspects &amp; benefits...its hard to weed out what products actually get the job done &amp; at a reasonable price. I can say the 1st day I used this, my skin felt much more hydrated after a couple hours, softer &amp; this is not one of those products that after applying, you feel greasiness or dried up flaky chunks start to fall off...it is NON greasy &amp; feels incredible! About 2 &amp; 1/2  days after using this, I could just feel a tighter...almost bouncy (good) feeling around my cheek area &amp; slightly lighter under my eyes where they have been kinda stressed &amp; dark circles underneath before. Also, one other thing about this I loved was my face had been so dry from the bitter cold weather &amp; it actually relieved that dry feeling all day &amp; gave an over all healthy soft glow. I am going to continue using this &amp; recommend to anyone wanting a good product that targets many skin concerns &amp; this is only a portion of what most skin products cost &amp; it actually works well!!!!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful moisturizing cream. It insight but efficient. Does a great job in softening the lines on my face . As well as keeping my skin feeling hydrated. I have tried lots of different creams that cost twice as much and this by far  is the most effective.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product to help me with my skin issues. I&#x27;m glad I came across this product as it has really worked. I saw great results within a week. I got the product very quickly as well. I would definitely suggest this product.</li>
            <li> I WILL CONTINUE BUYING THIS FACIAL CREAM.  IT IS TERRIFIC!</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It leaves my face so moisturize. I love the ingredients in this cream. I feel like my face is getting everything it needs to have a healthy complextion.</li>
            <li> I like this all natural face cream. Feels great on my skin. I feel like my face is tuely hydrated.</li>
            <li> My mother has been looking for a good regenerative cream, she has sensitive skin and has smoked all of her life. when this item was offer to me to simply give my honest opinion , I snagged it for her. She has been using it for 3  days and can already see i difference in the fine lines in her face, and now cant wait to see how it works on those bigger ones..</li>
            <li> I just received these items yesterday so it is way too early to know how I rate them</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Not as good as I had hoped for. But then I&#x27;m looking for a miracle!&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smooth and feels mildly tingly.&lt;br /&gt;When I mixed a drop of my foundation, it went on well. Blended well.&lt;br /&gt;Smells like cocoa butter at first then the odor disappears.&lt;br /&gt;I alternate retinal A and this cream at night. It Is working well for me.</li>
