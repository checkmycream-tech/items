            <li>It foams great, and only need a bit of the liquid good soap to wash your hands.....or ??.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT...</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Be sure you don&#x27;t fill it to the top.</li>
            <li>If you fill it to the top, it wont have the air to make foam.</li>
            <li>Do leave a bit of room for at the top when filling.</li>
            <li>but it actually works perfectly.</li>
            <li>If either of them breaks or has issues I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review.</li>
            <li>Great soap pump so far!  </li>
            <li>great to have natural soap in the showers that is easy to use and shower friendly.  </li>
            <li>Have used it in our main bathroom for about one month, and it&#x27;s been excellent so far.  </li>
            <li>Soap dispenser and cheap.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time  Works good so far.</li>
            <li>So far I love it.</li>
            <li>The first one I ordered works OK; the pump neck does not spring back up super fast (using for dish soap).  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of these.</li>
            <li>It squeaked for the first week or so, but hasn&#x27;t been since.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: After a couple more weeks with the second pump I bought for hand soap, the pump is sticking each time it is pressed.  </li>
            <li>Very durable and pretty.</li>
            <li>Not a big deal since it was so cheap, but the first one I bought is still working without sticking</li>
            <li>It pops back up in about 30 seconds and still foams fine though.  </li>
            <li>It worked good enough that I ordered two more (using for a clear type of hand soap), but those don&#x27;t work very well at all; pump neck stays down for a while so can&#x27;t be used more than once without physically pulling the pump head back up.  </li>
            <li>If you use too much soap, it will clog.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks at this point, and it has worked very well.</li>
            <li>makes pumping very inconvenient​,</li>
            <li>Works better than expected.</li>
            <li>Handy product, and less messy around the sink to use foamed soap with kids too!</li>

            <li> Just received them and put my Dr. Bronners soap and water in them, and they work perfectly.  I can&#x27;t say if they hold up and last....but I was able to write on the bottle the name of the product in perminate marker so my guests know what it is....great to have natural soap in the showers that is easy to use and shower friendly.  I will put these bottles in the bathroom too, so I can use the good soap and not that nasty just soap.  It foams great, and only need a bit of the liquid good soap to wash your hands.....or ??.  LOVE IT...</li>
            <li> Foams nicelywith liquid soap.  I have heard the pump springs wear out after a while.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> Have used it in our main bathroom for about one month, and it&#x27;s been excellent so far.  If that changes I will update.  We put watered-down liquid castille soap in it, in a ratio of about 1 part soap to 4 or 5 parts water.</li>
            <li> Makes a HORRIBLE, loud squeak noise every time you pump it!</li>
            <li> As described. Nice foaming bottle.</li>
            <li> Works well for inexpensive soap foam dispenser.</li>
            <li> Soap dispenser and cheap. Works well.</li>
            <li> I purchased these bottles to mix up homemade foaming hand soap, and they work great! They work just as they should! Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> great service quick love it</li>
            <li> Love it. Works better than the expensive ones. Be sure you don&#x27;t fill it to the top. 1/2 the bottle with water, 1/4 of the bottle with soap &amp; the last 1/4 is saved for air. If you use too much soap, it will clog. If you fill it to the top, it wont have the air to make foam. I definitely recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> The pump sticks when you push it down.</li>
            <li> These work great. I make my own hand soap and love these.</li>
            <li> Great soap pump so far!  Works perfectly with my Dr. Bronners liquid soap.  I will definitely be buying more of these.</li>
            <li> Bought this to dilute Dr. Bronner&#x27;s to use as hand-soap in order to avoid the random squirts in the eye and elsewhere when other pumps get clogged with the stuff (as mentioned by others - yup, ouch!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks at this point, and it has worked very well. It squeaked for the first week or so, but hasn&#x27;t been since. Do leave a bit of room for at the top when filling. Handy product, and less messy around the sink to use foamed soap with kids too! Plan to order another for the shower. I&#x27;m diluting the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s about 50/50, but here&#x27;s a link to some recommedations:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.lisabronner.com/dilutions-cheat-sheet-for-dr-bronners-castile-soap/</li>
            <li> So far I love it. Works great!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time  Works good so far.</li>
            <li> Perfect size bottle for my foam hand soap.  Very durable and pretty.</li>
            <li> After awhile it seems to get stuck and have to pull up each time.</li>
            <li> Wish these were less expensive as I would love to buy in bulk. However, the quality is great. Pumps work great. I use to stretch my homemade soap products.</li>
            <li> Works well, and its neutral design fits in any bathroom or kitchen.</li>
            <li> These bottles are perfect to make homemade foaming soap that is so much cheaper and better for you than store brands.  Love the size - perfect and they ship fast!</li>
            <li> Foams up and dispenses without a problem. Great way to save on liquid soap.</li>
            <li> durable plastic but loses recoil after a while. makes pumping very inconvenient​,</li>
            <li> Works better than expected. I thought it would be a little iffy since the bottle was less than $4 but it actually works perfectly. I use a face wash that is the consistency of water so in order not to waste it I use this foam pump and fill it 1/3 with the face wash and the rest of the bottle with water. It&#x27;s been a few weeks and I haven&#x27;t had any problems so I decided to order another one! If either of them breaks or has issues I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review. However, if it does I won&#x27;t be too upset since it&#x27;s so inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After a couple more weeks with the second pump I bought for hand soap, the pump is sticking each time it is pressed.  It pops back up in about 30 seconds and still foams fine though.  Not a big deal since it was so cheap, but the first one I bought is still working without sticking so I don&#x27;t know why the newer one would be doing it.</li>
            <li> The first one I ordered works OK; the pump neck does not spring back up super fast (using for dish soap).  It worked good enough that I ordered two more (using for a clear type of hand soap), but those don&#x27;t work very well at all; pump neck stays down for a while so can&#x27;t be used more than once without physically pulling the pump head back up.  Not worth my time to return them.  No issues with ordering/shipping/seller.</li>
