            <li>I still love the case and will continute to use it just not as my primiary make up case.</li>
            <li>I think this product is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and roomy and what a really nice gift!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, I love it very much, it is just what i needed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very cute case and is pretty sturdy.  </li>
            <li>It is so cute, and will be perfect to hold all the little odds and ends I&#x27;ve got.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for a little &amp;#34;Nail kit&amp;#34; for my daughter but it is much smaller than I anticipated but still worked great</li>
            <li>The interior sections move smoothly and the interior is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>This causes the case to tip over to one side when it&#x27;s filled with items.  </li>
            <li>I was originally going to use it for make-up but ended up using it as a jewelry case for when I travel.  </li>
            <li>Metal on the outside is good quality.</li>
            <li>No room for extra, which might be a good thing for the over doer in me.</li>
            <li>This is a great little case.</li>
            <li>It is heavy, well made and looks great.  </li>
            <li>Smaller than I thought but fits all my makeup nicely.</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>It fits right in the dance bag.</li>
            <li>The mirror is also very help full if your going to a friends house</li>
            <li>It is perfect for holding the esentials and a few extra things.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Along with it being fashionable and cute, it is quality made, however, the description says it should have a lock and key, which it does not.</li>
            <li>Plenty of room for my makeup, and easy to open and use.</li>
            <li>It is compact but large enough to fit all the essentials.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty train but barely held my makeup</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this case, the sturdiness,  the print, the hidden shelves and all</li>
            <li>The shelves are not deep so you can only store basically, what you need most.  </li>
            <li>It is very pretty, plus it is solid and well-made.  </li>
            <li>Other than those two things, it is a good little case.</li>
            <li>If you have a younger sibling or older and want to keep them out of your makeup</li>
            <li>The folding compartments are shallow, so again, you are not going to fit a whole product line of different things in this.</li>

            <li> The mirror is small so does not show your whole face.  </li>
            <li> It still tips over, but I don&#x27;t need to keep it open for a long period of time,</li>
            <li> The downside is that it topples over when it&#x27;s fully open if you don&#x27;t have enough weight in the bottom, and it is a bit hard to open.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a well-build case that is not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> but it turned out to be just a little too small for my needs.</li>
            <li> When you have a small space and need a case for makeup, brushes and \\&quot;what not\\&quot; this case does the job.</li>
            <li> I like the small compact size of this case.  </li>
            <li> One note about the description: there is no lock-and-key on this case - not sure why it states that.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there is very little storage in the bottom.  </li>
            <li> I found that extremely annoying when I was using it for make-up.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed about that.</li>

            <li> It is compact but large enough to fit all the essentials.  Sturdy and good quality and great looking!  Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> The size is perfect for carry make up.!!!!</li>
            <li> Case was everything I expected</li>
            <li> This case is all that it describes.  It is heavy, well made and looks great.  It is not a toy.  Unfortunately, there is very little storage in the bottom.  You cannot carry a brush or hair spray.  It is only for makeup.  The shelves are not deep so you can only store basically, what you need most.  It also tips over if you don&#x27;t have it opened just right.  The mirror is small so does not show your whole face.  Despite it&#x27;s drawbacks, this case is perfect for taking what you need anywhere while looking great.  I bought it for my daughter who is a \\&quot;dancer\\&quot; and performer.  She uses it backstage and it carries all her \\&quot;stage\\&quot; makeup.  Her hair accessories have to be carried elsewhere.  When you have a small space and need a case for makeup, brushes and \\&quot;what not\\&quot; this case does the job.</li>
            <li> I like the small compact size of this case.  I was originally going to use it for make-up but ended up using it as a jewelry case for when I travel.  I would have given it 5 stars except for one design flaw.  The interior of the case opens up like an accordion to one side only.  This causes the case to tip over to one side when it&#x27;s filled with items.  I found that extremely annoying when I was using it for make-up.  It would stay up, so I decided to use it for jewelry.  It still tips over, but I don&#x27;t need to keep it open for a long period of time, so it&#x27;s ok.  I ended up buying the larger version of this case for my make-up.  It opens on both sides and is perfect.</li>
            <li> this is a great cosmetic storage case.. it holds everything.. keeps me organized.. hubby calls it my tool box.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, easy storage and transportable. Great for those quick makeup needs.  Need to keep away from my teenager! She&#x27;s a product taker!!  LOL!!!</li>
            <li> I think this product is pretty good. It&#x27;s a well-build case that is not cheaply made. There is not a ton of room on the inside, so if you need tons of space, pick a bigger product. It has a nice feel. The folding compartments are shallow, so again, you are not going to fit a whole product line of different things in this. Metal on the outside is good quality.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I love it very much, it is just what i needed. If you have a younger sibling or older and want to keep them out of your makeup this is the perfect case. The case also has a beautiful design of zebra stripes. The mirror is also very help full if your going to a friends house so you have a mirror, just in case you don&#x27;t access one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very cute case and is pretty sturdy.  The downside is that it topples over when it&#x27;s fully open if you don&#x27;t have enough weight in the bottom, and it is a bit hard to open.  Other than those two things, it is a good little case.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for a little &amp;#34;Nail kit&amp;#34; for my daughter but it is much smaller than I anticipated but still worked great and she loves it!!!</li>
            <li> i love this case. It was a Christmas gift and its the perfect size. The only issue I have is when the compartments are pulled out the case tips over, but it is not that big of an issue for me.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size for all of my daughter&#x27;s dance jewelry and makeup. It fits right in the dance bag. Love that it has a mirror!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters cheerleading makeup and bows and it fits everything that your would need and then some.</li>
            <li> This is a great little case. I bought it as a gift for my daughter who just started wearing make up. It is perfect for holding the esentials and a few extra things. Seems to be well made, and more affordable than what I saw in stores.</li>
            <li> I looked at a lot of cases. Very glad I chose this one. Plenty of room for my makeup, and easy to open and use.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loved it.</li>
            <li> These items were great thank you so much.  Just what I was looking for.  Thank you very much. Have a nice day!</li>
            <li> I love this case. It&#x27;s the perfect size for a Dance Mom. I bought it to use for competition make-up for my 2 dancers. My daughters have very different skin tones and this case is versatile enough to house both sets of makeup and brushes. Yet, it is still small enough to put inside their Dream Duffel. I would recommend this to anyone who travels with makeup</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought but fits all my makeup nicely. No room for extra, which might be a good thing for the over doer in me.</li>
            <li> smaller than I thought it would be</li>
            <li> On time arrival..looks as expected</li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly and is really nice! Very sturdy and roomy and what a really nice gift! My sons girlfriend was thrilled!</li>
            <li> Very pretty train but barely held my makeup</li>
            <li> I received this case as a gift from a friend. It is so cute, and will be perfect to hold all the little odds and ends I&#x27;ve got. I won&#x27;t mind carrying this elsewhere to show it off as well. One note about the description: there is no lock-and-key on this case - not sure why it states that.</li>
            <li> I love the durability of this case. Along with it being fashionable and cute, it is quality made, however, the description says it should have a lock and key, which it does not. That is something that should be clarified in the discription. I am very disappointed about that.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this case, the sturdiness,  the print, the hidden shelves and all but it turned out to be just a little too small for my needs. I&amp;#34;m already looking at buying another one to replace it because I just can&#x27;t get all of my stuff in it. I still gave 5 stars because it was my own judgement that was off regarding the size...I still love the case and will continute to use it just not as my primiary make up case.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the quality.  It is very pretty, plus it is solid and well-made.  The interior sections move smoothly and the interior is easy to clean.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
