    <ol>
            <li>Very happy with this store and will visit again.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because it received the best reviews for this price range</li>
            <li>Been using every day and the results are incredible.</li>
            <li>Great with a massager</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>I have tried many creams &amp; this is the best yet.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena anti-cellulite is a good product buttttttttttt......</li>
            <li>mother of 2 teens, I work out 3 days a week and eat good.  </li>
            <li>It feels great, silky smooth, makes my skin feel great</li>
            <li>Smells so nice...</li>
            <li>However, it still works and it&#x27;s a decent price, and I&#x27;ll use a bottle every 3-4 weeks so that I can rub it in twice a day and make sure I give it the best opportunity to work most efficiently!</li>
            <li>Good Housekeeping recommended this product and claimed for the price it was the best overall.  </li>
            <li>If it convinces you to buy, buy more than one to see the difference because it was completed very quickly!</li>
            <li>too quick!!</li>
            <li>I will be extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>but I have noticed probably a 25% reduction in the appearance of cellulite and the feeling of having more toned  legs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I wont be dissapointed.</li>
            <li>I will buy 1 more bottle of this product.  </li>
            <li>I am sure some of the more pricey products might do a better job</li>
            <li>I love this stuff for bikini season.</li>
            <li>but truthfully I don&#x27;t care about that.  </li>
            <li>My legs lot a lot more tone and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin oily or sticky</li>
            <li>This Neutrogena product has helped the texture and especially important to me, the feel of the back of my legs.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a great cream and it does work.</li>
            <li>My legs feels so smooth after using this product, it takes a while to see a difference</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say for sure the cream alone works, but combined with eating better and healthy and exercising 7-9 hours a week, it definitely helps!</li>
            <li>and it makes you skin smoother and it feels significantly tighter.</li>
            <li>It goes on soo smooth &amp; really helps the cellulite look better.  </li>
            <li>There is something special about this cream, it smoothes skin to the point of tightening pores.</li>
            <li>Was able to get a better price on this product through this store than locally.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin very soft!!!!</li>
            <li>I bought it for first time two weeks ago and went back to buy two more to see more difference.</li>
            <li>this one is worth the $</li>
            <li>I noticed a nice difference shortly after using it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try for the price.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update...</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve aged, had kids, and gotten more cellulite, I realized it will probably take me more than 2 bottles of this stuff to get me through \\</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I have since ordered more and hope to see the same original results.</li>
            <li>The can lasted a long time and the smell was nice.</li>
            <li>And it really works!</li>
            <li>The first product I received was defective and they immediately shipped out another product with no questions asked.</li>
            <li>I used this stuff again after my first kid</li>
            <li>Also, because of the ingredients, im willing to give give it</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product, it works much better than lotion alone</li>
            <li>I was less conscience about the back of my legs and was able to relax more on the beach.</li>
            <li>Dries fast...</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t want to spend too much money on a cellulite cream.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li>and my skin were very well hydrated.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>This cream really works.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not nearly as expensive as all the creams that probably do the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>But most noticeably, was when I quit using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li>I asked my husband, a skeptic who is not afraid to tell me the truth, to help me monitor if this product was truly working, and he agreed that there was definitely a noticeable difference!</li>
            <li>This new one with anti-cellulite treatment has got me waiting for its results.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this as much as directed, but then again I don&#x27;t majorly need it.</li>
            <li>There lotion does smell more \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; than floral or buttery like other lotions, but you only smell it when it comes out, the smell doesn&#x27;t linger at all</li>
            <li>but it won&#x27;t eliminate it completely.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m back on Amazon to order more cellulite cream for a wedding I&#x27;m attending in Vegas over Spring Break, less than 2 months away!</li>
            <li>The two main ingredients that are known to help reduce the appearance of cellulite, retinol and caffeine are present.</li>
            <li>I have only used this product for a few weeks and if it  continues to smooth out my lumps and bumps</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really tell if it helped me as much as I expected because I work out everyday and try to tone up my arms with different types of light weights.  </li>
            <li>I have found this to be true and have used it for the past 2 years.  </li>
            <li>After the first week I did not notice any less dimpling in the leg (thigh) area but did notice that my skin felt tighter as though I had been working out.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s reasonably priced compared to other products.  </li>
            <li>What it does do is it plumps your skin just enough to smooth out the cellulite areas and make it much less noticeable...and the results don&#x27;t go away in just a few hours</li>
    </ol>

            <li> You&#x27;ve got to rub it in twice a day, but it only takes about 15-30 seconds to dry!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to use this product but decided to try it for a video segment I saw using this versus other more expensive methods or products to get rid or help diminish the look of cellulite.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend this product if you want a little help in the cellulite area</li>
            <li> and just have a little left;</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using an old bottle for the past 2 weeks and will let you know if I&#x27;ve achieve pleasing results by Vegas!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products &amp;</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because everything you read these days says that creams and lotions don&#x27;t work to reduce cellulite.  </li>
            <li> but I am not willing to pay $300 or $400 for this.</li>
            <li> I do have minimal to average cellulite on my thighs.  </li>
            <li> I do feel like I could&#x27;ve spent my money on something else!!</li>
            <li> It is a very small difference, but enough to notice and warrant a touch or two.</li>
            <li> and I saw cellulite as it had previously been.  </li>
            <li> Pros: Not too expensive, drys quickly, not sticky, smells ok (doesn&#x27;t smell weird)  </li>
            <li> Nothing miraculous, but i have seen slight reduction in cellulite severity..</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks.  - No special diet.  </li>
            <li> - 20-30 minute walk everyday.    </li>
            <li> Other products I tried were sticky or left a weird layer of film which just washed off.</li>
            <li> Cons: Not sure if it will still work if I don&#x27;t walk everyday, result not noticeable immediatly.    </li>
            <li> in two weeks the container was empty?!?!?!??!?</li>
            <li> The directions say you&#x27;ll see results in 8 weeks, but I am not lying when I say I saw results in just a few days!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to review this until I had used it a least 2 months, the recommended time to see results.  </li>
            <li> Try it, you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> Does not reduce the appearance of cellulite-- sorry ladies!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Was able to get a better price on this product through this store than locally. Been using every day and the results are incredible. Very happy with this store and will visit again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great with a massager</li>
            <li> Smells so nice... Dries fast... And it really works! I&#x27;ve tried other products &amp; this one is worth the $</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once.  I noticed a nice difference shortly after using it.  But most noticeably, was when I quit using it for a few weeks and I saw cellulite as it had previously been.  I have since ordered more and hope to see the same original results.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks.  - No special diet.  - 20-30 minute walk everyday.    Pros: Not too expensive, drys quickly, not sticky, smells ok (doesn&#x27;t smell weird)  Cons: Not sure if it will still work if I don&#x27;t walk everyday, result not noticeable immediatly.    *** You will like this product if you don&#x27;t mind using it long-term and you don&#x27;t want to spend too much money on a cellulite cream.</li>
            <li> Like the smell of this product using daily have not seen any results but can&#x27;t expect results until 8 weeks. Vendor is customer oriented.  The first product I received was defective and they immediately shipped out another product with no questions asked.</li>
            <li> I have had cellulite on my back thighs since I was 16 and thought nothing would ever help. Other products I tried were sticky or left a weird layer of film which just washed off. This Neutrogena product has helped the texture and especially important to me, the feel of the back of my legs. I also like the product&#x27;s gel/cream consistency amd how it absorbs into the skin. I have only used this product for a few weeks and if it  continues to smooth out my lumps and bumps I will be extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It goes on soo smooth &amp; really helps the cellulite look better.  I have tried many creams &amp; this is the best yet.  Try it, you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to use this product but decided to try it for a video segment I saw using this versus other more expensive methods or products to get rid or help diminish the look of cellulite.  After the first week I did not notice any less dimpling in the leg (thigh) area but did notice that my skin felt tighter as though I had been working out.  It&#x27;s now been about 4 weeks of using it usually only once a day but I have noticed probably a 25% reduction in the appearance of cellulite and the feeling of having more toned  legs.  Overall, I would recommend this product if you want a little help in the cellulite area but it won&#x27;t eliminate it completely.  Personally, I will continue to use this product on a daily basis.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin oily or sticky and it&#x27;s reasonably priced compared to other products.  The only downfall is I can&#x27;t find it in stores and have to buy it online.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena has won my heart with its formulas.n This new one with anti-cellulite treatment has got me waiting for its results. I&#x27;m sure I wont be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> There is something special about this cream, it smoothes skin to the point of tightening pores. It is a very small difference, but enough to notice and warrant a touch or two. It isn&#x27;t a miracle cellulite diminishing cream, but it does soften the skin. Does not reduce the appearance of cellulite-- sorry ladies! It&#x27;s worth a try for the price. Have at it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product daily as directed for over 8 weeks. It simply doesn&#x27;t work. I couldn&#x27;t see even the slightest difference.  Save your money, especially if you&#x27;ve paid $15 at the drug store like I did.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see any difference. The can lasted a long time and the smell was nice. I do feel like I could&#x27;ve spent my money on something else!!</li>
            <li> I used this product last year before my wedding in the Cayman Islands. I started rubbing/massaging in this lotion 6-7 weeks before my trip and actually started noticing the difference around week 4. I was less conscience about the back of my legs and was able to relax more on the beach. I bought it again this year in May to prepare for wearing shorts in the Summer. I asked my husband, a skeptic who is not afraid to tell me the truth, to help me monitor if this product was truly working, and he agreed that there was definitely a noticeable difference! You&#x27;ve got to rub it in twice a day, but it only takes about 15-30 seconds to dry! This product lasts a while, you can get through the summer with only 2 bottles! It is worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update...It&#x27;s now 2013 and 2 kids later and I&#x27;m back on Amazon to order more cellulite cream for a wedding I&#x27;m attending in Vegas over Spring Break, less than 2 months away! As I&#x27;ve aged, had kids, and gotten more cellulite, I realized it will probably take me more than 2 bottles of this stuff to get me through \\&quot; A Summer.\\&quot; FYI .... I&#x27;m 37 and now have cellulite on the front and sides of my legs as opposed to just the back of them which was the case when I wrote the first review, in my late twenties. However, it still works and it&#x27;s a decent price, and I&#x27;ll use a bottle every 3-4 weeks so that I can rub it in twice a day and make sure I give it the best opportunity to work most efficiently! I&#x27;ll keep you posted on the results. FYI ....I used this stuff again after my first kid and it worked and I&#x27;ve been using an old bottle for the past 2 weeks and will let you know if I&#x27;ve achieve pleasing results by Vegas!</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a great cream and it does work. I dieted and exercised while using this cream so I can&#x27;t say for sure the cream alone works, but combined with eating better and healthy and exercising 7-9 hours a week, it definitely helps! and it makes you skin smoother and it feels significantly tighter.</li>
            <li> My legs feels so smooth after using this product, it takes a while to see a difference but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena anti-cellulite is a good product buttttttttttt...... in two weeks the container was empty?!?!?!??!? too quick!! If it convinces you to buy, buy more than one to see the difference because it was completed very quickly! It leaves your skin very soft!!!! and my skin were very well hydrated. I bought it for first time two weeks ago and went back to buy two more to see more difference.</li>
            <li> Nothing will get rid of cellulite unless you get liposuction..enough said..but they sell everything today with promises..wish it had worked..i do like neutrogena products but not this one..it could not produce miracles..lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks.. I&#x27;ve like it enough that i&#x27;m ordering another bottle. Nothing miraculous, but i have seen slight reduction in cellulite severity.. Also, because of the ingredients, im willing to give give it another go.. Caffeine has known properties to reduce the look of cellulite, Seaweed has been known to reduce water, Retinol helps aid in the production of collagen which helps skin look supple.. Hey for 16 Bucks, why not..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have the patience to wait months or yrs for it to work, if it even does.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because everything you read these days says that creams and lotions don&#x27;t work to reduce cellulite.  I purchased this product because it received the best reviews for this price range and it had all the ingredients that these creams should have.  The directions say you&#x27;ll see results in 8 weeks, but I am not lying when I say I saw results in just a few days!  I recently lost 70 pounds and even though I work out 5 days a week, I still have cellulite on my legs and butt.  This product doesn&#x27;t erase everything, but I don&#x27;t even think surgical procedures can do that.  What it does do is it plumps your skin just enough to smooth out the cellulite areas and make it much less noticeable...and the results don&#x27;t go away in just a few hours, it stays that way!  My legs lot a lot more tone and smooth.  There lotion does smell more \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; than floral or buttery like other lotions, but you only smell it when it comes out, the smell doesn&#x27;t linger at all once you put it on.  I got the product on March 10th, I use it twice a day, and I still have plenty left because you don&#x27;t have to use a lot, it spreads well.  I would definitely recommend this product, it works much better than lotion alone and it&#x27;s not nearly as expensive as all the creams that probably do the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> I purchased it in June and now it 9/2/2011 and just have a little left; can&#x27;t really tell if it helped me as much as I expected because I work out everyday and try to tone up my arms with different types of light weights.  I will buy 1 more bottle of this product.  It lasts about 2.5 months.</li>
            <li> This product really works. Can&#x27;t find it online anymore.sad</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this as much as directed, but then again I don&#x27;t majorly need it. I just wanted to get rid of those bumps! It helps, it does, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good Housekeeping recommended this product and claimed for the price it was the best overall.  I have found this to be true and have used it for the past 2 years.  I am sure some of the more pricey products might do a better job but I am not willing to pay $300 or $400 for this.</li>
            <li> This cream really works. The two main ingredients that are known to help reduce the appearance of cellulite, retinol and caffeine are present. Keep in mind this does not make cellulite disappear, it reduces the appearance of. I love this stuff for bikini season.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to review this until I had used it a least 2 months, the recommended time to see results.  I have now used it for 3 months and I swear there is no improvement.  I am not fat at all.  5&#x27;4&amp;#34; and 120 lbs. I&#x27;m 43, mother of 2 teens, I work out 3 days a week and eat good.  I do have minimal to average cellulite on my thighs.  I used this product twice a day for 3 months.  It feels great, silky smooth, makes my skin feel great but truthfully I don&#x27;t care about that.  I wanted it to reduce the signs of cellulite.  I just switched to Nivea brand...we&#x27;ll see.</li>
