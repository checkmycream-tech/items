            <li>I LOVE the way this soap smells and wish they made a perfume or body spray with this scent.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d compare its quality to just as good as Yardley&#x27;s soap with a more exotic unique beautiful scent.  </li>
            <li>If more are available, I plan to order more.  </li>
            <li>most rich lather I have ever encountered in a bath soap</li>
            <li>you like a strong floral scent</li>
            <li>Ready to stock up and buy more!</li>
            <li>I get my sore spots and being able to shower and enjoy a quick massage</li>
            <li>- lovely orchid, fresh,</li>
            <li>this soap is no longer available in stores</li>
            <li>Great product with lots of latter</li>
            <li>it is free of a lot of the harmful chemicals found in some soaps (parabens etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>having that clean lavender scent on me.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff so much.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>I wanted the white w/o fragrance but it is a good soap.</li>
            <li>very surprised how many bars and how long they last love the feeling on my skin also smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>I feel so fresh and clean after using this</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly...</li>
            <li>LOVE the scent and leaves skin so very soft!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite for post-gym showers.</li>
            <li>this can be a good thing if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li>this is a nice alternative to the traditional bar</li>
            <li>This is  one of my favorite soaps love the Olay line forgot that I still had one of these bars left and when my husband used the last bar I had to get more</li>
            <li>This product keeps my skin feeling soft and smelling great for a long time after my shower.</li>
            <li>I love this product I am totally hooked</li>
            <li>First of all, I didn&#x27;t buy this soap because I wanted the massaging qualities.  </li>
            <li>- the bar is soft and smooth, and my skin feels so soft and smooth after I use the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragrance is lovely and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>but after the first use, I knew I would buy it again because of the soap itself.  </li>
            <li>But the soap gets mushy and falls apart way too fast!</li>
            <li>Really, $2.50/soapbar is not bad considering what you get back - of every soap I&#x27;ve tried so far, including premium luxury soaps, this soap has THE MOST GENEROUS LATHER</li>
            <li>I always used this in the past and like everything, when you find something good, they stop making it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Texture - it has bits of the crushed orchid, and I love soap that has bits or pieces of anything in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell</li>
            <li>this product leaves skin very greasy.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and the whole bar turns to mush.</li>
            <li>I first bought this soap because it was purple and would match my new bathroom</li>
            <li>Sure wish their other items were as reasonably/appropriately priced.</li>
            <li>though - the massage beads on top of the soap only last for a couple of bathings.  </li>
            <li>They arrived as described and were priced comparable to local stores when I was able to find some locally.</li>
            <li>I also love the one in the blue box / same brand</li>
            <li>so you really are cleaning yourself, the scent stays on your skin for a LONG time, the soap gets soft as you bathe giving it a creamy texture (not hard like you find with a lot of the mainstream cheap soaps), there are REAL orchid pieces in the soap, and it&#x27;s moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Too bad its not in the stores anymore, AWESOME</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants soft skin after their shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried oil of olay soap bars since I&#x27;m too cheap at the drugstores to buy the more expensive brands</li>
            <li>although the massaging action does not last long I still enjoy my shower.</li>
            <li>My wife love this product and some times is hard to find it at Walmart.</li>
            <li>Like any busy mom</li>
            <li>- my skin is sensitive, but this soap doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it with a wash rag and it it so soft against my skin.</li>
            <li>The other reviewer is right,</li>
            <li>from online and the local drugstore and other upscale specialty shops which could last me for years and which I box up with my clothes to finely scent them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a soap addict (as evidenced by my 5 large boxes of dozens of different scented soaps of different types(organic, triple-milled, french pre de provence, bath &amp; body</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t care about the nubbies because like other reviewers say they wear down very quickly,</li>
            <li>It is very soft and therefore does not last as long.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought for a friend...this the 3rd order. They love it!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff so much. It smells amazing and makes my skin feel wonderful. Bonus: my bathroom smells glorious all day after I shower.</li>
            <li> I have been looking every where to find Olay bath bar soap.</li>
            <li> After seeing the massaging design on this bar soap in multiple women&#x27;s magazines I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Like any busy mom I get my sore spots and being able to shower and enjoy a quick massage seemed like an excellent time saver and treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like a strong floral scent this bar has a nice orchid fragrance. The massage design didn&#x27;t last very long. I think I got four showers out of it before it was just another bar of soap. That said, the design is great. This is my new favorite for post-gym showers. It&#x27;s not overly drying and leaves only a subtle scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re already a fan of Olay&#x27;s bath bars this is a nice alternative to the traditional bar but if you&#x27;re looking for a long-lasting massage experience I&#x27;d pass.</li>
            <li> I am not too keen on the scent. It is very soft and therefore does not last as long. By.</li>
            <li> most rich lather I have ever encountered in a bath soap</li>
            <li> I love this product I am totally hooked I even use it a s a scent for my car. I just take a bar and poke holes in the box and place it under the front seat.  It makes my car smell lovely just like I feel lovely after using it. Too bad its not in the stores anymore, AWESOME</li>
            <li> Soap smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> First of all, I didn&#x27;t buy this soap because I wanted the massaging qualities.  I&#x27;m a soap addict (as evidenced by my 5 large boxes of dozens of different scented soaps of different types(organic, triple-milled, french pre de provence, bath &amp; body works bodywashes/shower gels, etc.) from online and the local drugstore and other upscale specialty shops which could last me for years and which I box up with my clothes to finely scent them.  I usually look for the best quality soap with the most beautiful exotic scents at great deals.  I bought it at my local Walgreen&#x27;s because I wanted to try oil of olay bars, it was on sale in the store, and i liked the beautiful packaging and the strong beautiful feminine scent of orchids.  I&#x27;ve never tried oil of olay soap bars since I&#x27;m too cheap at the drugstores to buy the more expensive brands but lately since being enlightened on the benefits of the more expensive brands of soaps, I&#x27;ve begun to try the other more expensive brands.

The soap bar gets MUCH softer and MUCH smaller (considering it&#x27;s small already) as you bathe so it doesn&#x27;t last as long as other soap bars.  I can&#x27;t comment on the massaging beads because that wasn&#x27;t the reason I bought the soap but the feeling IS massaging.  The other reviewer is right, though - the massage beads on top of the soap only last for a couple of bathings.  Overall, I&#x27;d compare its quality to just as good as Yardley&#x27;s soap with a more exotic unique beautiful scent.  Now, if only Yardley could make the same type of soap, I&#x27;d be in soap heaven!! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any soap, if you want to have it last longer, keep it away from water and get a soapholder with holes on the bottom so the water doesn&#x27;t stay to liquefy the soap.ith any soap, if you want to have it last longer, keep it away from water and get a soapholder with holes on the bottom so the water doesn&#x27;t stay to liquefy the soap.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Cannot longer buy on the stored</li>
            <li> Olay Luscious Embrace Body Bar with Massaging Design with Jojoba Butter &amp; Crushed Orchid Extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love, love, love this bar of soap.  I don&#x27;t even know where to start to tell you all about this wonderful bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture - it has bits of the crushed orchid, and I love soap that has bits or pieces of anything in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell - lovely orchid, fresh, beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Massaging balls - feels so good.  I love it so much, I used up all the circles in one setting!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel - the bar is soft and smooth, and my skin feels so soft and smooth after I use the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t make me itch - my skin is sensitive, but this soap doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does its job - I feel so fresh and clean after using this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t get any better than this!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  The lavender smell in it is just what is needed when I shower before bedtime, I sleep so good having that clean lavender scent on me.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It is the only soap that I use.  Smells great and lathers nicely while fitting well in your hand.  Suppliers sent soap promptly.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> This soap is the most moisturizing I have ever used.  The fragrance is lovely and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is  one of my favorite soaps love the Olay line forgot that I still had one of these bars left and when my husband used the last bar I had to get more this soap is no longer available in stores so bought 2 packs should last a while since we use different soaps. Great scent and leaves your body feeling good and although the massaging action does not last long I still enjoy my shower. Hopefully when I need to order it will still be around.</li>
            <li> I wanted the white w/o fragrance but it is a good soap.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I finally found this! Not in stores anywhere! LOVE the scent and leaves skin so very soft! Fast shipping! Great product and price! Ready to stock up and buy more!</li>
            <li> I have now stocked my soap bar....</li>
            <li> This product keeps my skin feeling soft and smelling great for a long time after my shower. I use it with a wash rag and it it so soft against my skin. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants soft skin after their shower.</li>
            <li> I always used this in the past and like everything, when you find something good, they stop making it.  So when I found that Amazon sell this soap, I was thrilled.  Now I can give some as a gift, as this soap is my best friends favorite.  I am moving next year and I.m stocking up for my move.You might think I&#x27;m crazy, but I want to have quanity for when I move.[[ASIN:B004A7PAU4 Olay Bath Luscious Embrace, 4.25-Ounce,  4-bars  (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I ordered it because my local Walmart no longer carries it in their store.</li>
            <li> I first bought this soap because it was purple and would match my new bathroom but after the first use, I knew I would buy it again because of the soap itself.  Wonderful scent, creamy lather....I love this product.  I have it on auto delivery so I will never be without&lt;br /&gt;my Olay Embrace.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this item . They arrived as described and were priced comparable to local stores when I was able to find some locally. Sure wish their other items were as reasonably/appropriately priced.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the deal was great.  If more are available, I plan to order more.  Again, Iove this product!</li>
            <li> I like the massaging bar design because  it feels like you&#x27;re massaging your skin while it moisturizes at the same time. And the soap smells good too.</li>
            <li> the best bar soap ever</li>
            <li> Great product with lots of latter</li>
            <li> my all time favorite soap...</li>
            <li> Rounds out your shower experience with body wash and lotion.</li>
            <li> the best soap. 5 star rating</li>
            <li> see my review of this earlier on another order.  Love the stuff</li>
            <li> My wife love this product and some times is hard to find it at Walmart. I recommend it for dry skin persons that needs a bit of moisture!</li>
            <li> nice smell, lasts quite well. was looking for something else, olay moisture bar and found this, works quite well, my brother fell in love with it</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly...I love it!</li>
            <li> i dont like this product. this product leaves skin very greasy. this can be a good thing if you have dry skin. it smelled ok,too.</li>
            <li> Aromatherapy for my shower! Love the scent. Great price too.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this soap in any store, got it in a gift pack for xmas. Love it and looking to receiving my soap every 3 months. Thanks</li>
            <li> This soap smell good, but it make me itch &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;....will never buy this soap again....</li>
            <li> very surprised how many bars and how long they last love the feeling on my skin also smells wonderful. SUPRISED</li>
            <li> I LOVE the way this soap smells and wish they made a perfume or body spray with this scent. But the soap gets mushy and falls apart way too fast! The little purple chunks in it come out and stop up the drain and the whole bar turns to mush. I will probably keep using it though because it smells so good.</li>
            <li> I love love love this soap!! I also love the one in the blue box / same brand Olay Luscious Embrace.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care about the nubbies because like other reviewers say they wear down very quickly, what I love&lt;br /&gt;is the scent. I look forward to showering now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a ton of allergies too and can&#x27;t use scented lotions etc but this soap doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all&lt;br /&gt;and it is free of a lot of the harmful chemicals found in some soaps (parabens etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use this on my face, I only use it on my body. It does not make me feel dried out and want to claw&lt;br /&gt;my shins off! That says a lot!</li>
