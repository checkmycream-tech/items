            <li>I don&#x27;t normally wear any reddish nail colors, but I LOVE this one, two layers will be perfect.</li>
            <li>However,  I thought it would lean more towards the wine color.  </li>
            <li>lovely nonetheless.</li>
            <li>and it was well wrapped :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this color.  </li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t have to say more.</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much I had to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>Such good quality!  </li>
            <li>I received the polish in less than a week and it is perfect!</li>
            <li>Beautiful, rich red.</li>
            <li>sophisticated and mysterious in a good way~</li>
            <li>The color is exactly like the picture!!</li>
            <li>Originally I thought this would have been a purple shade</li>
            <li>My mom LOVED OPI Bagota BlackBerry forever, but they apparently changed it a couple years ago...</li>
            <li>This color nail polish is true to the color.  </li>
            <li>and I am always looking for a good red.  </li>
            <li>This seller had the right price and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Worth the money to spend on nail polish.</li>
            <li>As with other OPI polishes, it lasts and lasts and it now a favorite for many off my friends.</li>
            <li>Slides on smoothly, looks great, long lasting!</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more red. ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly order again.</li>
            <li>OPI is very high quality</li>
            <li>Bring up skin tone yet not too much.</li>
            <li>I Like so much  </li>
            <li>You have to polish 3 coats for it to look deep and rich</li>
            <li>Very nice darker red and as usual a quality product from OPI.</li>
            <li>I love this deep red color.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Very long lasting, Doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
            <li>This is the color I wanted it to be, a deep dark rich red.</li>
            <li>Bought some of these for the Wife, apparently OPI is the &#x27;crème de la crème&#x27; of nail varnishes</li>
            <li>It is indeed a classic dark wine - but not so dark the color is not immediately evident and identifiable as &amp;#34;wine&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I ordered other colors and this is the one I will use for Christmas and new years.</li>
