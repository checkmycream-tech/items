            <li>I still love the revealed 2 the best .</li>
            <li>I bought this palette after getting the Revealed 2, which I loved.</li>

            <li>True to color and great pigmentation.</li>
            <li>I always wish there were more matte darker colors.</li>
            <li>I love most, if not all of the shades.</li>
            <li>There are mostly shimmers</li>
            <li>I love the palette I just wish they could figure out a better way to package it.</li>
            <li>I love this pallet wish they had one with some brighter matte colours</li>
            <li>I love the shades in this palette and bought this after getting a sample of the eyeshadow through BirchBox.</li>
            <li>I love the Revealed 3 palette.</li>
            <li>Of the 3 Revealed palettes Coastal Scents has come out with, the Revealed 2 is my favorite, but the Revealed 3 is winning me over more and more.</li>
            <li>I really love the purple and gold shades in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this product so far, and can&#x27;t wait to try it out.</li>
            <li>This selection is geared more towards people with cool tones.  </li>
            <li>quality for cheap</li>
            <li>It is a $20 palette that is a great dupe for Naked 3....</li>
            <li>There are some nice buttery textured colours, particularly the shimmer ones.</li>
            <li>I have the first revealed palette and that one is even better.</li>
            <li>I was so excited for this palette ever since I recieved a sample of it in a birchbox.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this one yet, but from swatching it, the colours are very pretty.</li>
            <li>The eye shadows are very pigmented and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>My daughter in law absolutely loves it!!</li>
            <li>Some reviews said that the packaging wasn&#x27;t adequate and the shadows came broken, but mine arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>this is a wonderful product, and while another reviewer had given this a poor rating for packaging I find that the packaging was quite adequate for what this is.  </li>
            <li>The mattes do tend to be a little powdery and the colour payoff isn&#x27;t as great as the shimmery shadows, but they can be worked with.</li>
            <li>Some colors were powdery but all in all, this is a fantastic palette for the price and very well suited for brown eyes.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>This is my second favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally did.</li>
            <li>This one has more light matte shades than the previous palettes.</li>
            <li>The purple, browns and charcoal grey colors are great but 2-3 shades are downright useless as they are neither pigmented nor of a good texture.</li>
            <li>The colors suit my grey eyes beautifully, there is minimal fall out, and there is ample amount of product.  </li>
            <li>It is affordable and last long for a good price.</li>
            <li>It also has a fantastic deep grey/ purple shimmer color.</li>
            <li>So much support.</li>
            <li>The palette itself is very slim and lightweight, and closes via magnets.</li>
            <li>Each time I used it I ended up with very sparkly cheeks.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t complain about a $20 palette.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice though and it was fairly long lasting.</li>
            <li>The colors were not as pigmented as i expected them to be, nonetheless this is a great neutral palette for everyday looks.</li>
            <li>I have green eyes and there are many shades that I thought worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and compares to the Naked brand</li>
            <li>20 unharmed brand new colors.</li>
            <li>Brand new palette handling with care in the box.</li>
            <li>I had the second palette but wanted more pink and purple.  </li>
            <li>The colors in the 2nd one feel much satiny than the colors in revealed-3</li>
            <li>It applies easily, last all day, requires very little, the cubes have more in them than I thought.  </li>
            <li>I looked at a lot of tutorial/reviews on Youtube and ultimately decided to buy the Revealed 1 and 3, to complete the set.</li>

            <li> I use this palette for everyday use.</li>
            <li> There is some fall out on a lot of the shadows but a few taps of your brush</li>
            <li> i was a little disappointed that one of the eyeshadows in the palette was pulverized...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I own all 3 Coastal Scents palettes. This is my second favorite. This one has more light matte shades than the previous palettes. It also has a fantastic deep grey/ purple shimmer color. I always wish there were more matte darker colors. I mix this palette with the 2nd palette. For the cost, pigmentation and quality, you beat it.</li>
            <li> Some colors were powdery but all in all, this is a fantastic palette for the price and very well suited for brown eyes. I have the first revealed palette and that one is even better. Will recommend this to others and would purchase again</li>
            <li> I am pretty darn impressed with this palette for the price. I hesitated on buying this for a while, reading all the reviews and going back and looking at the photos a lot before actually making the purchase. I&#x27;m glad I finally did. I love most, if not all of the shades. When I use with a shadow primer, they last a very long time. They&#x27;re heavily pigmented and high quality. I was happy with Coastal Scents blush and not disappointed with the eyeshadow, too! Five stars!</li>
            <li> I love the shimmer colors the best.  It applies easily, last all day, requires very little, the cubes have more in them than I thought.  This selection is geared more towards people with cool tones.  I like it very much and I&#x27;m not easy to please with make up as I have sensitive skin, tend to cry a lot and smear.  It passed the test.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful !</li>
            <li> Excellent seller A+++++++</li>
            <li> i was a little disappointed that one of the eyeshadows in the palette was pulverized...not sure if that was due to shipping or from the factory...but it wasn&#x27;t a big enough deal to try to pursue. Life goes on.</li>
            <li> My daughter in law absolutely loves it!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing eye palette for anyone. There are mostly shimmers but there are satins and mattes as well. 20 unharmed brand new colors. True to color and great pigmentation. Packaged amazing. So much support. Brand new palette handling with care in the box. This was an amazing deal and amazing palette. Thank you for the opportunity! HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> Loved it! The eye shadows are very pigmented and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I love the palette I just wish they could figure out a better way to package it. I was so excited for this palette ever since I recieved a sample of it in a birchbox. I felt my heart drop when I opened it...</li>
            <li> The colors were not as pigmented as i expected them to be, nonetheless this is a great neutral palette for everyday looks.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, smooth formula that wears well with a primer</li>
            <li> Amazing palette&lt;br /&gt;Good quality for cheap</li>
            <li> I bought this palette after getting the Revealed 2, which I loved. I looked at a lot of tutorial/reviews on Youtube and ultimately decided to buy the Revealed 1 and 3, to complete the set. I haven&#x27;t used this one yet, but from swatching it, the colours are very pretty. There are some nice buttery textured colours, particularly the shimmer ones. The mattes do tend to be a little powdery and the colour payoff isn&#x27;t as great as the shimmery shadows, but they can be worked with. The Revealed palettes work well with the Coastal Scents Eyeshadow Primer, and they last for hours without creasing. Some reviews said that the packaging wasn&#x27;t adequate and the shadows came broken, but mine arrived in perfect condition. There is a little bubble wrap envelope inside the box, covering the palette itself. There was no bubble wrap on the outside, but the envelope was sufficient to protect it.The palette itself is very slim and lightweight, and closes via magnets. There is no mirror inside but that isn&#x27;t a problem for me. I&#x27;m really happy with this product so far, and can&#x27;t wait to try it out.</li>
            <li> I love this pallet wish they had one with some brighter matte colours</li>
            <li> I have coastal scents 2 and 3 palettes. The colors in the 2nd one feel much satiny than the colors in revealed-3 but I like the variety in this palette. My eyelids are pigmented and hence I need to apply some darker shades. The purple, browns and charcoal grey colors are great but 2-3 shades are downright useless as they are neither pigmented nor of a good texture. I would not complain though as it is a great deal anyway!</li>
            <li> Not as pigmented as UD or lorac Pro and there is some fall out.  However, for the price, you get good colors and an even distribution of matte and shiny eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> I got samples of this palette on my Birch box and my Beauty Box 5. This are NOT pigmented and i feel i was applying chalk instead of eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Great pallet from coastal scent.  It is affordable and last long for a good price. I have Coastal Scent Revealed 2 and very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye shadow palette I have ever found! Worth every penny and compares to the Naked brand that&#x27;s double the price. This shadow is pigmented, stays where you put it, dose not stick in the creases and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I love the shades in this palette and bought this after getting a sample of the eyeshadow through BirchBox. Really beautiful colors!</li>
            <li> These colors are very nice blendable shades.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The product is great.  I had to order it after receiving a sample of it in my Birch Box.  The colors are perfect and it stays on all day.  The only complaint I have is that one of the colors was damaged.  It&#x27;s still useable though and I didn&#x27;t want to have to wait to use it while waiting for the return process.</li>
            <li> I have the other 2 previous coastal scents pallattes and I was not as impressed with this one . The colors didn&#x27;t seem any different than the previous 2 and not as pigmented as I would expect . I still love the revealed 2 the best .</li>
            <li> I had the second palette but wanted more pink and purple.  This was perfect</li>
            <li> I love the Revealed 3 palette. This is now the finishing touch of my Revealed collection. Coastal Scents does not disappoint!</li>
            <li> I had a little trouble getting this to stay in place because it is so powdery. Each time I used it I ended up with very sparkly cheeks. The colors are nice though and it was fairly long lasting. I have green eyes and there are many shades that I thought worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the deal....this is a wonderful product, and while another reviewer had given this a poor rating for packaging I find that the packaging was quite adequate for what this is.  It is a $20 palette that is a great dupe for Naked 3....in point of fact I regret purchasing Naked 2 and 3....for a variety of reasons ranging from fall out to amount of product to color saturation....however, I DO NOT regret this purchase for one minute.  The colors suit my grey eyes beautifully, there is minimal fall out, and there is ample amount of product.  I have never purchased coastal scents before, but I will do so again.</li>
            <li> This palette has grown in me since I purchased it. Some of the lighter colors aren&#x27;t as pigmented and a little chalky, but the majority of the shadows in this palette are soft and pigmented. They apply and blend nicely. If you wear a shadow primer/base underneath, they won&#x27;t crease. Of the 3 Revealed palettes Coastal Scents has come out with, the Revealed 2 is my favorite, but the Revealed 3 is winning me over more and more. I really love the purple and gold shades in it. Great mix of warm and cool tones for a variety of looks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK- not perfect but definitely well worth the money. I use this palette for everyday use. There is some fall out on a lot of the shadows but a few taps of your brush and it&#x27;s taken care of. I really can&#x27;t complain about a $20 palette. The colors are similar to the Naked 3 palette but I wouldn&#x27;t call it a dupe.</li>
