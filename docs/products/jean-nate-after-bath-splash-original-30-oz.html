            <li>I do not think the scent is as strong as it used to be, but it is still refreshing on the body.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too strong.  </li>
            <li>Love the fresh, clean scent of this after bath splash and use it every day!</li>
            <li>The original scent was strong and lasted all day.</li>
            <li>I wanted a light citrus scent--this wasn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li>I pour some on a spray bottle, and take it along in an ice chest, when I will be outdoors in the heat, and it sure refreshes me and at the same time, I smell good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fresh, clean smell that gets many compliments.</li>
            <li>I called the company, and they confirmed that they changed the original scent.</li>
            <li>This is not the original.</li>
            <li>Where is the original?</li>
            <li>it is NOT the original formulation.</li>
            <li>I would rather pay more for it and get the real thing.</li>
            <li>I like the light fresh fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It went from one drop on my wrist to the trash can just that quick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to be able to find such big bottles of it.  </li>
            <li>Cool Fresh smell.</li>
            <li>good service and the product is what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I used this when I was 18 years old for many years.</li>
            <li>Memories of my life in the 60&#x27;s pour right out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to others who like a fresh, clean smell.</li>
            <li>The old scent was light and citrusy.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It has such a fresh, clean smell to it.  </li>
            <li>(when I could no longer find it), so I certainly know what I&#x27;m talking about.  </li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It really made me want to read more about Eve&#x27;s Other Worldly duties.</li>
            <li>I have left the top off in hopes that evaporation will condense it down to the right fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It still smells as fresh as back in those days.</li>
            <li>Many people cannot deal with a heavy scent nowadays.</li>
            <li>My disappointment of the fragrance comes from my memories of wearing this fragrance many, many years ago.</li>
            <li>As usual, Kelley makes you want more.</li>
            <li>If this is the original formula for the After Bath Splash, it is watered down with something.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cost near what it did 20 years ago BUT BEWARE THE SHIPPING</li>
            <li>Revlon could have changed the make-up of this fragrance, my memory could be playing tricks on me, or the container I received could be old.</li>
            <li>I have used this splash for several months and really like it.</li>
            <li>I love Jean Nate, it was something My late husband bought me every year.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It almost smells right - but not really.  </li>
            <li>know it is not a popular item for the younger generation, but I am pleased.</li>

            <li> good service and the product is what I expected.  thanks.</li>
            <li> bottle was open in shipping, so had leaked out.</li>
            <li> Have been using for 40 years and it&#x27;s the best splash after a shower - Especially for the Summer months .  Cool Fresh smell. Never run out so stock up .</li>
            <li> The book was a wonderful read. It really made me want to read more about Eve&#x27;s Other Worldly duties. As usual, Kelley makes you want more. It was a great read!</li>

            <li> If this is the original formula for the After Bath Splash, it is watered down with something.  It almost smells right - but not really.  I have left the top off in hopes that evaporation will condense it down to the right fragrance.  I used this product from 1960 to 2008-ish  (when I could no longer find it), so I certainly know what I&#x27;m talking about.  I would rather pay more for it and get the real thing.</li>
            <li> Looked for it everywhere but could only find it here. I read that they changed the formula but this is the origional scent, you will not be disappointed. It doesn&#x27;t cost near what it did 20 years ago BUT BEWARE THE SHIPPING MORE THAN DOUBLES THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> My disappointment of the fragrance comes from my memories of wearing this fragrance many, many years ago. Revlon could have changed the make-up of this fragrance, my memory could be playing tricks on me, or the container I received could be old.</li>

            <li> I just love this product and have been unable to find it and purchase up here in Canada for at least the past ten years I finally found it at Fragrancenet.com I purchased 2 bottles and will purchase more as time goes on . The service was excellent and I was not charged any additional costs just what was quoted to me I am one very Happy Camper as they would say  The fragrance is still as I remember it  very refreshing just great for summer .</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it is hard to find especially in larger sizes. You had it and I received it sooner than expected. The product is as good as the first one I ever bought.</li>
            <li> This is not the original. I used this when I was 18 years old for many years. The original scent was strong and lasted all day. This one does not last 2 seconds. I hate it. Where is the original? This stuff stinks I wouldn&#x27;t  recommend this to my dog.</li>
            <li> Jean Nate After Bath Splash, Original-30 OZ: Oh what an after bath splash. I&#x27;ve used this splash since the 60&#x27;s. when I found it again on Amazon,I placed the order. It still smells as fresh as back in those days.Once one has ever used it, you never want to be without it.It is so refreshing and  light, and it smell so good!</li>
            <li> I have used this Jean Nate Splash for over 25 years. It is refreshing to put on after a bath or shower. It is good product to use instead of perfume when you are going to be with a crowd of people or in a confined space. The scent is pleasant but not overwhelming. Many people cannot deal with a heavy scent nowadays. I do not think the scent is as strong as it used to be, but it is still refreshing on the body.</li>
            <li> I pour the splash into  a spritz bottle and spray my self before getting into bed.&lt;br /&gt;my bed spells great.</li>
            <li> A wonderful light fragrance! Perfect for hot summer days! I would definitely repurchase this item.</li>
            <li> It was fir my mom...she loves it!</li>
            <li> I have used this splash for several months and really like it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my Mother and she loves it, don&#x27;t use it myself-------lol</li>
            <li> I had been wearing Jean Nate since I was a little girl, and I am 48. The changed the original formula and put in a moldy, woodsy, disgusting scent. I put it on, and thought I had a bad bottle. I bought another one, and it was the same. I called the company, and they confirmed that they changed the original scent. This was a big mistake on their part. The old scent was light and citrusy. This is really horrible!</li>
            <li> The ingredients listed in online description are NOT the same as those on the actual product received. The reason for this purchase was to purposefully avoid a certain chemical and unfortunately what was received contained the very element that I am allergic to.&lt;br /&gt;The product description should be updated-- it is NOT the original formulation.</li>
            <li> My favorite for decades.  Use it for every day and will reorder.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I find Jean Nate&#x27; very refreshing, and look for it when needed.....I love the product and use it all season.</li>
            <li> Memories of my life in the 60&#x27;s pour right out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love Jean Nate, it was something My late husband bought me every year.&lt;br /&gt;I know it is not a popular item for the younger generation, but I am pleased.</li>
            <li> excellent price and delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still waiting for cases hybrid and 5peace</li>
            <li> I love Jean Nate and have been using it for many, many years.  I&#x27;m happy to be able to find such big bottles of it.  It has such a fresh, clean smell to it.  I highly recommend it to others who like a fresh, clean smell.</li>
            <li> My bottle of Jean Nate Bath Splash  must of been opened-prior&lt;br /&gt;  to packing for shipoment ($10 +)  When I received it CARTON was&lt;br /&gt;  wet with 1/4 of my Bath Splash !!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;  After waiting over 8 days for it-------I am not returning it-------but&lt;br /&gt;  will never buy from this SUPPLIER AGAIN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Dolores</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  It isn&#x27;t too strong.  I like the light fresh fragrance.  After bath splash is also good to spray on anytime.</li>
