            <li> I love this product!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This Total Results Sleek shampoo and conditioner is a total failure for me. It&#x27;s not like the former (?) Matrix Sleek Look shampoo, etc., which was so very effective in keeping hair frizz-free after washing. I&#x27;m totally disappointed with these \\&quot;total results\\&quot;. Looking around for another shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Very Great Product I Bought this For My Weave (Peruvian, Brazilian And Malasian) After Viewing A Couple Reviews On It On YouTube and I Must Say I Love It And It Smells Great. I Would Recommend To Others</li>

            <li> Works just like when my stylist uses it on me!</li>

Maybe I&#x27;ve changed or maybe the formula for this set has changed, but I don&#x27;t remember it being so heavy before.  I won&#x27;t use again and will stick with my current products.</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months. It has really made my hair soft and silky and the Best part it&#x27;s totally affordable! I recommend it 100%!1</li>

            <li> I have been using it from last 1 year now and it works really well. my hair feels smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Great Service and Price.</li>
            <li> Did not stop my hair from being &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; in texture. Arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, however, you can buy it at Wal Mart for the same Price.  It is way easier to just but it while shopping!</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of products in my hair. I can tell this set is one of the bests.</li>
