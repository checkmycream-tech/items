            <li>Smell was just okay</li>
            <li>this scent is a more medicinal lavender scent vs. lilac.</li>
            <li>Lovely scent and bottle.</li>

            <li>I hope Baylis &amp; Harding continues to make it for those of us who still love it.</li>
            <li>The Baylis and Harding perfumed talc with Lavender and Lilac are so well made and enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li>Always one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells mostly of lavender.  </li>
            <li>Very silky powder- nice scent!  </li>
            <li>It is not too strong and not too light</li>
            <li>Lightly scented and not overpowering to the senses.</li>
            <li>Glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Not as aromic as Yardly but smells good and pleasantly soft.</li>
            <li>I like to layer clean scents and this is a way to do that if you purchase the B&amp;H soap and lotions.</li>
            <li>either.&lt;br /&gt;it keeps a sweet smelling odor through the day.</li>
            <li>it on after u bathe, or even when it is hot for a cooling,&lt;br /&gt;refreshing feeling !&lt;</li>
            <li>Hard to find a really good lilac/lavender bath powder, so was happy to discover this English brand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a lovely, soft scent.  </li>
            <li>two of my favorite fragrances in one soft, scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased varied powders for years and this is by far my favorite</li>
            <li>The powder was a bit tamer than I expected, but overall I love this product!!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it just as a very basic talc, not so special!</li>
            <li>I expected a more floral scent...</li>
            <li>much appreciated by recipient.  </li>
            <li>Wants another one.</li>
            <li>Lavender is known for it&#x27;s soothing, relaxing qualities, and I really needed this while recovering from surgery.</li>
            <li>I recommend the entire line, however I feel that the Petal Fresh Lotions in the same scents are actually a better buy with a thicker lotion, prettier scent and 1/3 the price.</li>
            <li>Bath powders are becoming increasingly harder to find.</li>
            <li>, I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the 7 ounce size - it is such a value.</li>
            <li>the price is a little high but the product is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Not a heavy scent, but lasting.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years; it is sometimes hard to fine in local shops or stores.  </li>
            <li>and it was sticky-clumped when I was not completely dry--</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way- pretty container also...</li>

            <li> I was very disappointed in this talc.  </li>

            <li> didn&#x27;t care for the fragrance- and it was sticky-clumped when I was not completely dry-- would not buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for Lilac powder and couldn&#x27;t find it -  until I saw it on Amazon.  I have not been disappointed with the fragrance!  It&#x27;s just a lovely, soft scent.  I really enjoy it!</li>

            <li> Very pleasant mild scent in this talcum</li>
            <li> Did not like the smell at all.  I was very disappointed in this talc.  I believe I will stick to store bought from now on.</li>
            <li> A gift...much appreciated by recipient.  Wants another one.</li>
            <li> Heavenly, scented powder.&lt;br /&gt;Dust it on after u bathe, or even when it is hot for a cooling,&lt;br /&gt;refreshing feeling !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it, and will buy it again. ♥</li>
            <li> Hard to find a really good lilac/lavender bath powder, so was happy to discover this English brand. Lavender is known for it&#x27;s soothing, relaxing qualities, and I really needed this while recovering from surgery. I even shake a bit inside my pillow case at night. Not a heavy scent, but lasting. When I read the seller only had one left (after I received mine), I immediately ordered a second.</li>
            <li> I love sprinkling floral bath powders onto the mattress cover when I change the bed linens. Bath powders are becoming increasingly harder to find. I hope Baylis &amp; Harding continues to make it for those of us who still love it.</li>
            <li> The powder was a bit tamer than I expected, but overall I love this product!!!</li>

            <li> Paackage came apart and spilled the powder all over the package.</li>
            <li> Always one of my favorite scents. Too bad younger women don&#x27;t realize how cooling it is to apply a little powder under the bra after a shower in the Summer. I&#x27;d feel sticky without it.</li>
            <li> I expected a floral, lilac/lavendar aroma and it is not that at all...can&#x27;t stand it!  Nothing floral about it.&lt;br /&gt;I have plenty of lilac scented items and not one has this terrible smell.</li>

            <li> This scented talc does not have enough of a lilac scent.. It has a stronger lavender scent I think.  I think it might even be somewhat of a medicinal scent when I try to describe this powder.</li>
            <li> Perfumed Talcum Powder has a very pleasant lavender smell.  It is silky and last all day.</li>
            <li> Very silky powder- nice scent!  A little goes a long way- pretty container also...</li>
