            <li>I don&#x27;t find it as moisturing as needed and it might be better for summer but no sunscreen</li>
            <li>but it is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;m going organic now in using this cream.</li>

            <li>, it makes my face feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>A light moisturizer with no greasiness or smell.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s far too good for that.</li>
            <li>overall feels really good on the skin</li>
            <li>I love it so far</li>
            <li>You will see results and feel the lovely soft skin you will get from using it.</li>
            <li>Rock is well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m liking this one very much</li>
            <li>I would five more stars, but we only used it twice.</li>
            <li>Love that it comes in such a large size</li>
            <li>A rich cream that goes on very smoothly and penetrates my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone and plan to continue using it for as long as it is available!</li>
            <li>OK MOISTURIZER.I HAVE VERY DRY</li>
            <li>I really like this cream</li>
            <li>Gently rub the two together on your face then gently pat into your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>DIDN&#x27;T REALLY</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like this Moisturizer</li>
            <li>I accidentally left it in VA after just starting it, but I am sooooo happy to have it back.</li>
            <li>I  grew up in the 70&#x27;s when oil was used daily for suntanning, also I&#x27;m under a huge  amount of stress taking care of my aging &amp; most difficult Mother (that I love dearly).</li>
            <li>; just wish their line were more extensive, larger.</li>
            <li>My face is very soft and really made a difference with one use.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li>All the commercial products are filled with chemicals and barely helped my skin issues at all.</li>
            <li>my skin tone to normal.</li>
            <li>This cream is thick, absorbs quickly and evenly, and leaves your face smooth with no oil.</li>
            <li>i m not sure it feels okay when you put it on night but in the  morning my skin feels dry like its not really moisturizing good enough</li>
            <li>Also It makes the fine lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li>This product is an all natural cream with all organic products.</li>
            <li>face has completely cleared up including no redness.</li>
            <li>but so far it seems to be working.</li>
            <li>I was at the point where I was thinking about having photo finish done to my upper chest area  for the amount of 2,500 which I can&#x27;t really afford anyway.</li>
            <li>I am 56 years old.</li>
            <li>... sinks right in.</li>
            <li>This cream helped minimize peeling significantly to the point where it was hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li>Very good on my face, I was looking for a moisteriser for my face due to the cold weather and this did not moisterize the way I expected.  </li>
            <li>This cream so far has left my face soft and I don&#x27;t seem to have the tightening feeling and flaking a little while after using it.</li>
            <li>I had zero intentions of reintegrating cosmetics, but due to the random patches of dry skin that would plague my face once a month, I decided there had to be something out there that was natural, organic, and effective.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the organic moisturizer that I&#x27;ve been looking for.  A rich cream that goes on very smoothly and penetrates my dry, sensitive skin. A little goes a long way. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I do find it lightening some sun spots and overall feels really good on the skin ... sinks right in. I don&#x27;t find it as moisturing as needed and it might be better for summer but no sunscreen</li>
            <li> i have been searching for a face moisturizer for my skin and i&#x27;m liking this one very much</li>
            <li> This cream is thick, absorbs quickly and evenly, and leaves your face smooth with no oil. I stopped using moisturizer, and almost all cosmetics, once discovering the long list of toxic chemicals the majority of brands contained. I had problems with acne for my entire life and once I stopped using these toxic products, it cleared up very quickly (yay!). I had zero intentions of reintegrating cosmetics, but due to the random patches of dry skin that would plague my face once a month, I decided there had to be something out there that was natural, organic, and effective. Well, here you have it. My acne has not returned yet after two weeks of use and I don&#x27;t save it for that once a month time, it&#x27;s far too good for that. Keeping it in the refrigerator is another treat. It feels so nice to apply this creamy chilled moisturizer. I have been using it 2-3 times per day - more last week when my face got badly sun burnt. This cream helped minimize peeling significantly to the point where it was hardly noticeable. A+. This is such an amazing product with a wonderful and caring staff. I would recommend this product to anyone and plan to continue using it for as long as it is available!</li>
            <li> no problems with breakouts or irritation, nice consistency</li>
            <li> Very good cream, makes me look younger.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream but it is not my favorite. It felt as if there was a film over my skin when I would put it on. It did moisturize through the day. It did has a light scent that was neither easing or displeasing.</li>
            <li> I like this face cream. It&#x27;s made with natural ingredients &amp; is gentle on my skin, and the big bonus...not nearly as expensive as store bought brands. I kind of wish it contained sun screen though, but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I just started using this.  I love it so far and so so does my daughter.  My face is very soft and really made a difference with one use.  I would five more stars, but we only used it twice. Udate: returning product. Burning my skin after several uses and dry</li>
            <li> With all the chemicals and preservatives in all the day to day products we use, its destroying our skin. This product is an all natural cream with all organic products. Highly recommend giving this a try. You will see results and feel the lovely soft skin you will get from using it. Is a wonderful anti-aging cream too.</li>
            <li> Amazing product for rosacea users. I also mix a half vitamin E gel capsule with every use. The cream helps the thick, sticky vitamin E absorb easier. Gently rub the two together on your face then gently pat into your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face has completely cleared up including no redness. I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;m going organic now in using this cream. All the commercial products are filled with chemicals and barely helped my skin issues at all. No more antibiotics as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red Rock is well worth the purchase. I keep it refrigerated as well, as I only have to use small amounts per use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: A year later and I still have half a jar left. I still keep it refrigerated and my skin still looks great! Thank you. ❤&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with Amazon.com shipping as well.</li>
            <li> Very good on my face, I was looking for a moisteriser for my face due to the cold weather and this did not moisterize the way I expected.  I have to use it with a drop of another face cream that mositerizes.  Overall, I do like the face cream and it has left my face smoother and it&#x27;s great for the neck area. No allergic reactions or blemishes using this face cream.</li>
            <li> OK MOISTURIZER.I HAVE VERY DRY SKIN.IT DIDN&#x27;T REALLY HELP.IT DIDN&#x27;T BREAK MY SKIN OUT LIKE MOST MOISTURIZERS.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve only used the cream twice but so far it seems to be working. I have dry patches on my face and some &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; creams have made my face burn or turn red. This cream so far has left my face soft and I don&#x27;t seem to have the tightening feeling and flaking a little while after using it. My skin stays soft.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this cream. It has no alcohol or mineral oil in it. These two ingredients are in 95% of all cream products out there.  Mineral oil clogs pours and alcohol...well who would want to put alcohol on their skin?</li>
            <li> i m not sure it feels okay when you put it on night but in the  morning my skin feels dry like its not really moisturizing good enough and I also don t like that it contains sodium hydroxide since I hear its not good on the skin.</li>
            <li> Great cream; just wish their line were more extensive, larger.</li>
            <li> OMG. I have found the Holy Grail of  face &amp; skin moisturizing &amp; evening out  my skin tone to normal. Until last week I had terrible skin problems. I  grew up in the 70&#x27;s when oil was used daily for suntanning, also I&#x27;m under a huge  amount of stress taking care of my aging &amp; most difficult Mother (that I love dearly). I could not wear the color red, pink or purple because my skin tone was so splotchy. I was at the point where I was thinking about having photo finish done to my upper chest area  for the amount of 2,500 which I can&#x27;t really afford anyway. After using this product for 3 days on my chest, hands, arms &amp; face I am very happy to say for the first time in years my skin  looks normal, even toned &amp; well moisturized. I put it on 2 times a day, I&#x27;m at day 6 &amp; what a miracle. I cant wait to try the eye serum &amp; Rosacea cream. I am 56 years old. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT!  From Donna Richards</li>
            <li> Very good cream. I&#x27;m happy with purchase. Will buy again. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer. Have noticed a difference in my skin after just a couple of days. Love that it comes in such a large size so I won&#x27;t run out so often.</li>
            <li> I really like this Moisturizer, it makes my face feel so smooth. I love the fact it&#x27;s organic, I feel good about using it. Also It makes the fine lines less noticeable. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Its&#x27; good moisturizer but the smell is not great, especially since it&#x27;s on your face...</li>
            <li> I accidentally left it in VA after just starting it, but I am sooooo happy to have it back. A light moisturizer with no greasiness or smell. I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Smells great, weightless, skin has cleared up and has more moisture. I keep it in the fridge and love the refreshing coolness when putting it on.</li>
