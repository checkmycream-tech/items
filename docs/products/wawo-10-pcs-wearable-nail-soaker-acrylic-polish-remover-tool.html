    <ol>
            <li>came on time and it works wonderfully</li>
            <li>Worked great!</li>
            <li>I use these every now and but prefer the cotton pad, foil method the best</li>
            <li>Incredible product.  </li>
            <li>works great for what I needed it for.  </li>
            <li>I thought these would be great to help remove stubborn polish.</li>
            <li>Great for soaking off gel/acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>These soakers work great for taking shellac and acrylics off.</li>
            <li>These are great.  </li>
            <li>Love these!!</li>
            <li>And they stay on fairly well.</li>
            <li>These have not been a good product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to save the time and the aluminium foil although you need to get the tips how to use it.</li>
            <li>i love mine!</li>
            <li>Be sure to have paper towels on hand!</li>
            <li>They leaked acetone all over, split along the top edges (not just on my thumbs, on my pinky fingers, too!)</li>
            <li>They are all one sized and fit great on pinky and ring finger but \\&quot;strangle\\&quot; the rest of my fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe my set was defective, but buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li>they break very easily.</li>
            <li>I love them, they make everything so easy!</li>
            <li>very cheap material.</li>
            <li>I say more?  </li>
            <li>Many people are complaining about the tops dissolving from the nail polish.</li>
            <li>Would order again If i need more.</li>
            <li>I guess they count top and bottom as 2 pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unless you can reuse the nail polish remover more than once.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic!</li>
            <li>They worked okay.  </li>
            <li>so they could stand up better.  </li>
            <li>Best 4 bucks i have spent in a while</li>
            <li>Glad they were cheap.</li>
            <li>After about 20 minutes the polish will just float off of your nails-so cool!  </li>
            <li>They tip over so easily.</li>
            <li>Cheap and</li>
            <li>but once I received them it was worth it!</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for and in this case it is so true.</li>
            <li>It takes a great deal of effort to try to get all the fingers, and it gets more difficult as more are on your fingers.</li>
            <li>i am very satisfied with these break the gloss on 5 nails put on 5 pods, soak while breaking the gloss on the next 5 and transfer over,&lt;br /&gt;done  </li>
            <li>and did not do a good enough job of soaking off my gel polish for me to be willing to even think of ordering them again.</li>
            <li>Great product doesn&#x60;t waste product.</li>
            <li>so it was worth trying.  </li>
            <li>This product design is interesting and sounds wonderful, however, I found it to be messy, uncomfortable, and more work than the more tried-and-true methods.</li>
            <li>The major problem was keeping the solution on the nail because if I filled it up too full, it leaked.  </li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s why they are so cheap, but I don&#x27;t have time to be sitting around waiting a month at a time for a new shipment.</li>
            <li>Works beautifully and uses much less product with virtually no mess!</li>
            <li>Initially the part of the hole where you stick your finger in disintegrated which allowed the acetone to flow out the top, then eventually it ripped and fell off completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not terribly difficult to put on.  </li>
            <li>I is exactly as advertised once again</li>
            <li>so much nicer then using a bowl of acetone!</li>
            <li>The tops cracked and crumbled from the chemical upon FIRST USE.</li>
            <li>First of all, they leak around the seal where you stick your fingers in.</li>
            <li>I used these exactly one time.</li>
            <li>Acetone at the rubber on the first time using.</li>
            <li>far as ths product goes, its a great idea, but I paint my nails almost everyday.</li>
            <li>Didnt work at well as I would have liked, however, it did keep the black nail polish I used from dying my nails like it always did.</li>
            <li>I had to throw them out after once use because every pink top ripped.  </li>
            <li>However I have tried them on, and wouldn&#x27;t suggest anyone who doesn&#x27;t have really skinny fingers to get them...</li>
            <li>The product takes too much volume of nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>But the acetone eats through the pink top.</li>
            <li>This has saved me so much time and money.</li>
            <li>These are really neat.</li>
            <li>But they use up so much nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>u cant do much anyway</li>
            <li>Also easy to clean and disinfect but recommend buying two sets just in case you lose one of them or you have back to back clients needing them..</li>
            <li>However, I found it impossible to do all 10 fingers at once, because you need a free hand to scrape off the gel polish and this is best done by removing one finger at a time since it only works if you scrape the stuff off as soon as removing it from the acetone.  </li>
            <li>I learned that you have to pour only 1/2 full before you stick your finger in.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes these would make soak-offs easier and faster, not so.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Its more efficient to have a little bowl to dip your fingers in.</li>
            <li>Really funcions well and not messy at all.</li>
            <li>The seals work well as long as it&#x27;s not over full.</li>
            <li>These make getting those tough to remove glitter polishes quick and easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>sure they leak some and are al little tight on some digits,but over all effective ,cost efficient made my life easier, My client can still move around a little also.</li>
            <li>might as well save ur money and remove it the old fashion way</li>
            <li>Saves time, and no mess.  </li>
            <li>By the time I actually got it on my nail, it did not seem like it was secure and half of the remover already leaked out.</li>
            <li>If they are filled to cover your nail completely you waste lot of fingernail polish remover and you cannot pour it back into the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually fill about half full and put pink cap on and then put finger in top.  </li>
            <li>I bought a set of these to make soaking off my Axxium Nail Gels easier and apparently that is not what you are supposed to use these for despite what the description says.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;These little things went into the trash after the first use.</li>
            <li>Saved my nails from being stripped down, and I didn&#x27;t have to use a whole bowl of solution.</li>

            <li> Saved my nails from being stripped down, and I didn&#x27;t have to use a whole bowl of solution.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails with gel polish and hate soaking them off, so I was really excited to try these little soakers.</li>
            <li> I have small hands, so it wasn&#x27;t because of large fingers.</li>
            <li> I wish i had know about it long time ago.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the pink caps were actually disintegrating from the acetone.</li>
            <li> They were very tight on my fingers turning the tips in the soaker blue in some cases and leaving an uncomfortable ring mark for more than 15 minutes after removing.</li>
            <li> Even WORSE -- acetone DESTROYS the pink tops, almost right away.</li>
            <li> soak half a cotton ball with acetone and place into the clear tip along one half.</li>
            <li> They are tight on larger hands and still leak&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Pink Rubber part dissolves in Acetone.  </li>
            <li> The pink part shredded with one use.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to overfill as they will seep out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While it seems like a lot of work, it is so much less uncomfortable and works better with less wasted acetone.</li>
            <li> A little tight on the thumb, but you adjust them back a bit</li>
            <li> Not sure if I lime these at all use them only one time and probably not ever again</li>
            <li> These are a total waste of money!</li>
            <li> At first this Seller did send me the wrong item and it took forever to receive my item</li>
            <li> Not worth returning to an address out of the country.</li>
            <li> and we found other ways to remove the gel polishes with less mess and aggravation.</li>
            <li> They can be loose on small hands</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product because I was sick of wrapping my nails in foil with a cotton ball etc.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t work, and made quite a mess.</li>
            <li> They are a little messy so protect your work space.</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s no good way to pour acetone into these things, the acetone doesn&#x27;t always cover the entire nail, they squeeze your fingers uncomfortably and turn the skin up to the first knuckle white from cutting off the circulation and then soaking the skin in acetone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think its a waste of nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Instead of filling a bowl with remover these little soakers do the job!</li>
            <li> These little babbies work every time!  </li>
            <li> I had a difficult time getting them to hold enough acetone and some of them leaked.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> It is just a very messy process.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moPPEUHSNDID1F]]Very poor performance when compared to other polish removing techniques!  </li>
            <li> except they came late</li>
            <li> Not thrilled about that.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it a 2 star rating is that it arrived sooooooooo late.  </li>
            <li> However packing is not good, the stuff was flatten out.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll stick with cotton pads and acetone for tough to remove polish.</li>
            <li> If you overfill the reservoir then you spill nail polish even worse</li>
            <li> Waist not want not lol.  </li>
            <li> Out of 5 different techniques the family tested this was the worst performer and got the lowest score.  </li>
            <li> For the money you can not go wrong.</li>
            <li> These are very difficult to adjust and the nailpolish just doesnt come off well at all.</li>
            <li> Just when I got them positioned where the leaking wasn&#x27;t so bad</li>
            <li> They do what they are supposed to do but it is painful to leave on the fingers</li>
            <li> and I hate sitting there just to remove it</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Incredible product.  I wish i had know about it long time ago. Saves time, and no mess.  I would recommend anyone to purchase it.  Don&#x27;t hesitate!!!!</li>
            <li> These are not the same ones you&#x27;ll find in the nail salon, even though they may look the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the acetone in them to soak off my gel polish and with in seconds the pink rubber had completely disintegrated.</li>
            <li> I bought a set of these to make soaking off my Axxium Nail Gels easier and apparently that is not what you are supposed to use these for despite what the description says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pink Rubber part dissolves in Acetone.  Need I say more?  I had to throw them out after once use because every pink top ripped.  Initially the part of the hole where you stick your finger in disintegrated which allowed the acetone to flow out the top, then eventually it ripped and fell off completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.  Buy the OPI wraps with the aluminum foil...  They use 1/4 the amount of Acetone.  They&#x27;re not terribly difficult to put on.  And they stay on fairly well.</li>
            <li> I am a cosmo teacher and I ordered these for my school. I love them, they make everything so easy!</li>
            <li> came on time and it works wonderfully I is exactly as advertised once again thank you so yeah except they came late</li>
            <li> I used them 1 time and they fell apart. Crumbling in my hands. Not worth returning to an address out of the country.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t work, and made quite a mess.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I lime these at all use them only one time and probably not ever again</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.  However on the second use three of the pink lids ripped completely off. Not thrilled about that.</li>
            <li> These are very difficult to adjust and the nailpolish just doesnt come off well at all. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I would rather just scrub my nails with acetone than take the time to fill these up and try and get them on my fingers. They leak EVERYWHERE! By the time I actually got it on my nail, it did not seem like it was secure and half of the remover already leaked out. I think I&#x27;ll stick with cotton pads and acetone for tough to remove polish.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moPPEUHSNDID1F]]Very poor performance when compared to other polish removing techniques!  Out of 5 different techniques the family tested this was the worst performer and got the lowest score.  These have not been a good product. Some of the issues are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* They leak fingernail polish&lt;br /&gt;* They can be loose on small hands&lt;br /&gt;* They are tight on larger hands and still leak&lt;br /&gt;* If you overfill the reservoir then you spill nail polish even worse&lt;br /&gt;* If you under fill the reservoir then they will not work well&lt;br /&gt;* Many people are complaining about the tops dissolving from the nail polish. Since we stopped using them this did not happen as they are no longer in use.&lt;br /&gt;* If they are filled to cover your nail completely you waste lot of fingernail polish remover and you cannot pour it back into the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall they just did not work well and we found other ways to remove the gel polishes with less mess and aggravation.</li>
            <li> Giving these to friends and family.  works great for what I needed it for.  Would order again If i need more.</li>
            <li> very cheap material. they break very easily.Don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be great to help remove stubborn polish. The pink part shredded with one use. I have small hands, so it wasn&#x27;t because of large fingers. These are a total waste of money!</li>
            <li> The description and picture show 10 nail soakers and it says \\&quot;10 Pieces\\&quot;. I only received 5 soakers. I guess they count top and bottom as 2 pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as ths product goes, its a great idea, but I paint my nails almost everyday. I think its a waste of nail polish remover. Unless you can reuse the nail polish remover more than once. They don&#x27;t send any instructions with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this  to specifically remove glitter polishes, but I have yet to use them. However I have tried them on, and wouldn&#x27;t suggest anyone who doesn&#x27;t have really skinny fingers to get them... They are all one sized and fit great on pinky and ring finger but \\&quot;strangle\\&quot; the rest of my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was unsure about this product, but figured it was under $3 what do I have to lose.  Also shipping took awhile since its coming from China.</li>
            <li> So done with foil. I still use the cotton soaked in remover and then put  these on. Works fantastic! An inexpensive product that works well. A little tight on the thumb, but you adjust them back a bit and it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> Really funcions well and not messy at all. Instead of filling a bowl with remover these little soakers do the job!</li>
            <li> i love mine! I use them all the time to soak off both acrylics and gel polish. so much nicer then using a bowl of acetone!</li>
            <li> The product takes too much volume of nail polish remover. It takes a great deal of effort to try to get all the fingers, and it gets more difficult as more are on your fingers. It is just a very messy process.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes these would make soak-offs easier and faster, not so. I had a difficult time getting them to hold enough acetone and some of them leaked.  They were very tight on my fingers turning the tips in the soaker blue in some cases and leaving an uncomfortable ring mark for more than 15 minutes after removing. My hands are M/L size 7 ring finger if that is helpful. Hope the review helps someone. Wish I was leaving a rave review.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product because I was sick of wrapping my nails in foil with a cotton ball etc. But the acetone eats through the pink top. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I bought these to soak off my gel polish (instead of just peeling them off). Worked great! Saved my nails from being stripped down, and I didn&#x27;t have to use a whole bowl of solution.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it a 2 star rating is that it arrived sooooooooo late.  Weeks later than promised.  The item itself, I cannot speak of because I have still not used it and know if its function meets a 5Star.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. Great for soaking off gel/acrylic nails. This has saved me so much time and money. No wasting remover.</li>
            <li> Love these!! Tip: soak half a cotton ball with acetone and place into the clear tip along one half. Works beautifully and uses much less product with virtually no mess!</li>
            <li> They do what they are supposed to do but it is painful to leave on the fingers</li>
            <li> Didnt work at well as I would have liked, however, it did keep the black nail polish I used from dying my nails like it always did. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Seemed like a helpful gadget, but they leak and tip over and spill. Even WORSE -- acetone DESTROYS the pink tops, almost right away. The tops cracked and crumbled from the chemical upon FIRST USE. I had to throw them out. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I waited an entire month for these to be delivered. They shipped from Hong Kong. I do my own nails with gel polish and hate soaking them off, so I was really excited to try these little soakers. First of all, they leak around the seal where you stick your fingers in. Just when I got them positioned where the leaking wasn&#x27;t so bad I noticed that the pink caps were actually disintegrating from the acetone. I was only to use them once. I guess that&#x27;s why they are so cheap, but I don&#x27;t have time to be sitting around waiting a month at a time for a new shipment.</li>
            <li> These soakers work great for taking shellac and acrylics off. I am a nail tech so I use them on a daily basis. At first this Seller did send me the wrong item and it took forever to receive my item but once I received them it was worth it!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for and in this case it is so true. Cheap and the caps just crack when you use acetone.</li>
            <li> i am very satisfied with these break the gloss on 5 nails put on 5 pods, soak while breaking the gloss on the next 5 and transfer over,&lt;br /&gt;done  sure they leak some and are al little tight on some digits,but over all effective ,cost efficient made my life easier, My client can still move around a little also. Best 4 bucks i have spent in a while</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to save the time and the aluminium foil although you need to get the tips how to use it. However packing is not good, the stuff was flatten out.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give these a try instead of using foil.  They worked okay.  The major problem was keeping the solution on the nail because if I filled it up too full, it leaked.  The price is low so it was worth trying.  I use these every now and but prefer the cotton pad, foil method the best</li>
            <li> I do like the Wearable Nail Soakers for nail Polish remover they work great.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I wish they had a flatter bottom so they could stand up better.  They tip over so easily. I do recycle the Acrylic Polish remover.  Waist not want not lol.  For the money you can not go wrong.</li>
            <li> These are really neat. But they use up so much nail polish remover.While your soaking off the nail polish you are also allowing the acetone to be soaked by your skin. Its more efficient to have a little bowl to dip your fingers in.</li>
            <li> Acetone eats at the rubber instantly, these are garbage unless you are using non-acetone, which then there&#x27;s no reason to soak regular polish. I bought these to soak off gels. Threw them away. Glad they were cheap.</li>
            <li> So I wear a lot of nailpolish and I hate sitting there just to remove it so I thought these would take care of that these can leak and with these on your hands u cant do much anyway might as well save ur money and remove it the old fashion way</li>
            <li> These do work well to soak off gel polish but they do leak. I learned that you have to pour only 1/2 full before you stick your finger in. Be sure to have paper towels on hand! These were quite a bit easier than the foil wraps and the Acetone can be poured back into the bottle after use.</li>
            <li> Great product doesn&#x60;t waste product. Also easy to clean and disinfect but recommend buying two sets just in case you lose one of them or you have back to back clients needing them..</li>
            <li> I used these exactly one time. They leaked acetone all over, split along the top edges (not just on my thumbs, on my pinky fingers, too!) and did not do a good enough job of soaking off my gel polish for me to be willing to even think of ordering them again. Maybe my set was defective, but buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> Was not helpful. Acetone at the rubber on the first time using.</li>
            <li> These make getting those tough to remove glitter polishes quick and easy to remove.  Be careful not to overfill as they will seep out.  I usually fill about half full and put pink cap on and then put finger in top.  The seals work well as long as it&#x27;s not over full.</li>
            <li> The traditional process for removing gel nail polish can be hit or miss and when it&#x27;s miss it takes FOREVER to work.  These little babbies work every time!  After about 20 minutes the polish will just float off of your nails-so cool!  They are a little messy so protect your work space.</li>
            <li> These things do NOT work at all, AND they leak fingernail polish remover everywhere !!!  Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> These are great.  However, I found it impossible to do all 10 fingers at once, because you need a free hand to scrape off the gel polish and this is best done by removing one finger at a time since it only works if you scrape the stuff off as soon as removing it from the acetone.  You can wander around with these on unlike a tray where you have to sit there.</li>
            <li> This product design is interesting and sounds wonderful, however, I found it to be messy, uncomfortable, and more work than the more tried-and-true methods. Stick with the bowl or the foil and cotton-ball methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seal between the rubber and the plastic leaks (all over the place and almost constantly), there&#x27;s no good way to pour acetone into these things, the acetone doesn&#x27;t always cover the entire nail, they squeeze your fingers uncomfortably and turn the skin up to the first knuckle white from cutting off the circulation and then soaking the skin in acetone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are ten total nail soakers. If you get 5, you&#x27;ve been ripped off. Maybe there should only be five for ease of use, but you are paying for ten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These little things went into the trash after the first use. They did work, but I&#x27;ll stick to the following method instead:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Unroll a cotton ball and tear into five or so pieces. Also, take some tin foil and tear it or cut it into about 4&amp;#34;x4&amp;#34; squares.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Take the shine off the surface of the nail polish, acrylic nails, etc. with a nail file.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Put acetone in the lid of the acetone bottle.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Dip a piece of cotton into the acetone. You don&#x27;t have to make it swim in the stuff, just get enough to soak the cotton piece.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Cover a nail with this piece of cotton and wrap any excess length around your finger.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Wrap the cotton and your finger with tin foil.&lt;br /&gt;6.  Repeat for all or part of the nails you need to soak.&lt;br /&gt;7.  Leave on for 15 minutes for gel or acrylic, 1-5 minutes for nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;8.  Use orange stick to remove material. File off softened substance if there is any remaining. Repeat as necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it seems like a lot of work, it is so much less uncomfortable and works better with less wasted acetone.</li>
