            <li>I am amazed at how wonderful this product is</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re looking to avoid aluminum, crystal deodorants may not be your best</li>
            <li>I am so very happy with this spray!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 95 degree, humid day here and its working great!</li>
            <li>I went off the great reviews for this and am so happy I ordered it!</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with how well it works!</li>
            <li>This gives me no issues and smells great.</li>
            <li>Great if you&#x27;re looking for a tea-tree leaf oil product.</li>
            <li>It has a great scent</li>
            <li>Its great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just really happy with this.</li>
            <li>this product has a very nice scent.</li>
            <li>I also use the spray on more \\&quot;delicate\\&quot; parts of my body and I am so impressed!</li>
            <li>I also use the &amp;#34;rock&amp;#34; and am very happy, and odor free!</li>
            <li>I honestly can recommended!</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Giving up my stick deodorants for good.  </li>
            <li>It has a very nice scent and it goes on nicely.  </li>
            <li>This is a great light scent, and works great.</li>
            <li>I like the very light scent of this spray and that you can spray just about anywhere on your body!</li>
            <li>I used to use the crystal essence roll on in the lavender scent, it worked ok but wasnt great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very refreshing feeling and this will be my go to scent and form of deodorant in conjunction with the roll on for a while.</li>
            <li>I use this for any part of my body that needs refreshing!</li>
            <li>and I am in love!</li>
            <li>First, the scent is wonderful!</li>
            <li>I am unfortunately kind of a sweaty person, so I am still getting used to not plugging my pores up with aluminum, but this brand has been the most successful in treating my body odor.</li>
            <li>Great smell and easy to use.</li>
            <li>this smells good though the smell is very light and after a couple of hours I can&#x27;t smell it at all.</li>
            <li>product itself is amazing.</li>
            <li>I make my own deodorant at home now.</li>
            <li>many reviewers say explicitly to do so for optimum effectivness.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells okay, but fair warning, for those of you with heightened sense of smell and finicky noses like me,  </li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t burn or sting or cause me to break out, and it controls BO odor as good as or better than the antiperspirant I used to use.</li>
            <li>It is kind of flowery</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use this alone on my underarms but with a deodorant or milk of magnesia on top it works great :)</li>
            <li>This deodorant spray is effective, just like the non-fragrance version.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, what&#x27;s not to love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since a spray is sanitary to share, both my mom and my boyfriend have borrowed it before, and both have liked it too.</li>
            <li>This smells nice</li>
            <li>Took a bus tour where it was warm in the bus, we were on and off walking around and touring in 80 degree weather.....</li>
            <li>The scent is nice when you apply.</li>
            <li>It seems to fight germs and bacteria while maintaining a wonderful soft &amp;#34;just out of the bath&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Crystal Essence Chamomile spray is the most effective for me.</li>
            <li>This is so much more effective.  </li>
            <li>So far, the best I have tried without the baking soda.</li>
            <li>This is the most wonderful natural spray deodorant I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, and it&#x27;s such a great product!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li>then I would recommend buying Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel Formula Towelettes to freshen up and then maybe use more of this body spray again.</li>
            <li>The Body Spray and the Crystal stick are however my favorite.</li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with the Thai Crystal Stick and feel quite confident when I do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Haven&#x27;t been adventurous enough to give up the antiperspirant roll-ons, but very happy to see Amazon/Marketplace offer this product and fragrance online!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Crystal unscented roll on for over a year now, and love it.</li>
            <li>Love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>and this is the one that I use the most.</li>
            <li>I love this smell.</li>
            <li>I love this brand of deodorant.  </li>
            <li>love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>It works better the longer you use it.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Edited 6 months later: I still think this is a good deodorant and a great brand</li>
            <li>However, many deodorants also contain aluminum, along with chemicals called parabens, which have also been linked to breast cancer.</li>
            <li>So, you&#x27;re clearly better off avoiding both antiperspirants and deodorants.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While many claim to be aluminum-free, they are referring to aluminum chlorohydrate, aluminum chloride, aluminum hydroxybromide or aluminum</li>
            <li>The aluminum is taken into sweat ducts in the top layer of your skin where they act as a plug, stopping the flow of sweat to your skin&#x27;s</li>
            <li>These deodorants are recommended by many cancer treatment centers.</li>
            <li>and I love that.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Second, it works great!</li>
            <li>Like most people reviewing this, I bought it as an attempt to lower my aluminum exposure.</li>
            <li>but I do love this stuff when I am home, doing laundry, and at the gym.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of keeping me smelling fresh</li>
            <li>it is great for being so natural!</li>
            <li>and I like the clean feeling of not having gunk under my pits!    </li>
            <li>I then sprayed the Chamomile Body Spray on top of that as I like a light scent.</li>
            <li>its very fresh and most important does not have chemicals like most deo&#x27;s do</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true, it does keep stench away for longer!</li>
            <li>It is not sticky on the skin, applies easily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s oily, so it dribbles rather than diffuses when sprayed, and it smells strongly of tea-tree leaf oil (think</li>
            <li>Love this product, fresh scent, easy spray, works great for odor control, all natural, no chemicals!</li>
            <li>This product is touted as a body deodorant, but I find it works marvelously as a cool, refreshing foot</li>
            <li>I love the way this smells light, clean and a bit earthy.</li>
            <li>I expect it to last longer than my store bought deodorants, making it even more cost effective!</li>
            <li>The unscented is fine, too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great buy for those with super busy non stop lives.</li>
            <li>I prefer the roll on type, but this is by far the best natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural deodorants, and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li>This scent is light and feminine, without being all up in your face.</li>
            <li>The smell is very understated, but nice.</li>
            <li>on I especially love this scent chamomile and green tea</li>
            <li>As far as functionality, I did notice a reduction in foot sweat which was good.</li>
            <li>The scent is light, fresh, and clean, it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on clothing, and it works with my body&#x27;s PH for 24hr protection!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to rinse it with hot water, removed the top of the sprayer etc, but it just is not working.  </li>
            <li>It is clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>-ons have ingredients that are not so good for the body when absorbed throughout he skin, stick to natural rocks or sprays that have no chemical</li>
            <li>It goes on floral, but then settles into a clean scent I often associate with men&#x27;s deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Wow, love this spray!  </li>
            <li>she was right!</li>
            <li>Since the switch, she&#x27;d been cool &amp;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing those will be good for touch-ups later in the day when I am not home to shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so true.</li>
            <li>for which I paid good price compare to anybody else who selling similar product!</li>
            <li>However, this is why the product MUST be applied to freshly bathed, CLEAN skin, since it needs a clean slate to start with.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this product I used the Pomegranate scent, which was too strong for me.</li>
            <li>although the spray has clogged once or twice, it  cleans easily with hot water running over the pump.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d deliberately seek out, but it&#x27;s not repulsive either, and in any case the scent fades quickly.</li>
            <li>It arrived very fast with my satisfaction!</li>
            <li>Works fairly well as long as you&#x27;re not in a situation where you&#x27;ll be sweating a lot!</li>
            <li>While all three work, the chamomile and green tea smells great on me (the others don&#x27;t mesh with my body chemistry).  </li>
            <li>I enjoy this product and will use it more for travel since it will require only one bottle for me vs. two, but don&#x27;t let that deter you, I would recommend it on</li>
            <li>It kept me fresh all day.</li>
            <li>Really stopped the sweat smell (REALLY STOPPED THE SWEAT SMELL), and I love the scent....</li>
            <li>It keeps me smelling fresh even after a workout session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Personally, I feel most comfortable at work and with my boyfriend wearing a product that includes an antiperspirant..</li>
            <li>During that time I have tried countless brands of natural deodorant, and have struggled to find one that works and has a pleasant, mild scent.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, your skin has to be clean for it to work (and I recommend drying off and using something bottled to wet the stick to avoid bacteria, even if you just spray bottled water on yourself or the stick).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very strong almost sickeningly sweet floral smell right out of the bottle (from the Chamomile), BUT don&#x27;t worry it dissipates quickly to a light &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent once on your skin (from the Green Tea).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On bottle number 2 or 3, I switched to this lovely Chamomile &amp; green tea scented version, and I&#x27;ve been using it happily for several years now.</li>
            <li>My whole family has converted since then, and we can&#x27;t believe how nice it is to have given up the chemicals and the problem at the same time!</li>
            <li>This is hands down the most effective natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>This is mostly for a women&#x27;s taste, but it can be used for men also, due to its light tones that does not over power.  </li>
            <li>It is a natural deodorant, so I am fine with the hassle of re-applying.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last super long, but it&#x27;s better than most others out there.</li>
            <li>The sprayer worked for the first week, but then stopped working.  </li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time.</li>
            <li>The spray is cooling and soothing to hot, puffy feet, and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>you already have odor on your skin or clothes, it must be cleaned first.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would be able to get away from Degree extra strength for men</li>
            <li>those first two weeks to slough the underarm skin.</li>
            <li>Multiply this by one or more times a day for a lifetime</li>
            <li>Use it daily- love it</li>
            <li>I have also found other natural deodorant alternatives that smell better, Herban Cowboy in the blossom scent is now my favorite</li>
            <li>I apply right after a shower very liberally.</li>
            <li>i like the smell and they have some other really nice smells like lavender and pomegranate.</li>
            <li>Crystal Natural Deodorant is by far the best natural spray and this chamomile and green tea is fresh and clean natural scents.  </li>
            <li>for this particular scent, the Chamomile &amp; Green Tea pleasant, and could be considered unisex.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own had I not purchased it with the other!</li>
            <li>this study was a pretty clear sign that the metal was being absorbed from antiperspirant sprays and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fresh out of the shower, I make sure my under arms are completely dry.</li>
            <li>Potassium Alum or Ammonium Alum are natural mineral salts made up of molecules that are too large to be absorbed by your skin.</li>
            <li>You cannot really reapply this to already sweaty skin and expect it to work anymore.</li>
            <li>The Pomegranate of the Roll-On is a much stronger scent(not</li>
            <li>Salt stops the bacteria that causes odor from forming and it works really great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>much prefer the Crystal roll on product.</li>
            <li>I use the roll on deodorant and this spray and that is all I really need for BO control.</li>
            <li>very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s get this straight.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Light enough for a man or a woman.</li>
            <li>and I really like the smell of the product.</li>
            <li>It of course isn&#x27;t as effective as the ones that have bad-for-you stuff like heavy metals in them, but come on -</li>
            <li>Too many other foot-spray products on the market that also smell like peppermint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to revert back to my original brand deodorant.</li>
            <li>key is to spray it on clean skin before bacteria sets in or</li>
            <li>As you spray it smells a little strong subsides almost immediately!</li>
            <li>I actually recommend this brand over HC for pregnant women in the original fragrance-free version because it doesn&#x27;t have any essential oils.</li>
            <li>The crystal deodorant is more effective than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, and I like the delicate fragrance of this version.</li>
            <li>for example contains rosemary which is a essential oil some pregnant ladies may wish to avoid.</li>
            <li>ended up having to find a drugstore for some real deodorant/antiperspirant so I wouldn&#x27;t offend those near me!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I sprayed a little on after bathing in the morning and by evening I was still feeling clean and getting compliments on the fresh scent.</li>
            <li>&quot; deodorant stones are a popular natural deodorant alternative, often used by health-conscious shoppers looking to avoid the aluminum and other chemicals common in most antiperspirants</li>
            <li>Some 20,000 people in the village of Camelford were exposed to the chemical for several weeks, and then went on to develop a rare form of early-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, along with showing the presence of high levels of aluminum in their tissues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deodorants</li>
            <li>Refreshing green tea and chamomile scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth mentioning that deodorants are not the same thing as antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>Regular deodorant not only irritates my skin after shaving, but I notice that when I shower it doesn&#x27;t wash off easily.</li>
            <li>All of the scents for this body spray smell strong only for the second you spray them</li>
            <li>The key is you have to spray it on right after you shower before the bacteria set in.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to be more natural and move away from harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>and I have *very* sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>To use I just run the Crystal stick under the water &amp; then give my pits a quick spray and let it air dry for a minute before putting on my shirt!     </li>
            <li>A review of the common sources of aluminum exposure for humans found that antiperspirant use can significantly increase the amount of aluminum absorbed by your body.</li>
            <li>Concentrations of aluminum were higher in the tissue closest to the underarm than in the central breast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This, too, has many beneficial extracts and oils (tea-tree, witch hazel, rosemary, sage, chamomile) and works well for its other uses--soothes and disinfects minor scrapes and insect bites, relieves sunburn discomfort (I use it to spot-treat acne).</li>
            <li>I should note that I don&#x27;t get particularly smelly in general, but this product works well for me.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this to anyone that wants a spray deodorant to last all day.  </li>
            <li>If you stink and rub a natural roll-on or rock on you, the stink will stay in the product forever</li>
            <li>Its natural and no chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I like natural products and this one works for me.</li>
            <li>In some cases, it is clear that they may be wreaking havoc directly on your brain.</li>
            <li>Given that antiperspirants are used on your armpits, the aluminum salt concentration is highest near your breast tissue.</li>
            <li>She surprised me by saying that she&#x27;d given it up some time before &amp; switched to a natural deodorant, and that it turned out her body had just been over-compensating.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t mask my natural scent, and if I do choose to wear a fragrance, it doesn&#x27;t clash with it.</li>
            <li>After listening  a doctor speak about the cancers caused by metals in deodorants, I began searching for natural options.</li>
            <li>Ever see the Portlandia episode about natural deodorants?</li>
            <li>The product itself works, however the spray bottle is dysfunctional and the liquid spray that collects on my skin if I am fortunate enough to get the sprayer to work, runs down under my arm, wasting time and money as well as feeling uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Natural, cruelty free body deodorant with a delicate fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The aluminum in crystal deodorant stones is a different type of compound known as an alum, the most common form being potassium alum, also known as potassium aluminum sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but now I only use typical deodorant or antiperspirant for special occasions.</li>
            <li>that the smell isn&#x27;t over whelming to my baby &amp; doesn&#x27;t contain potentially toxic chemicals, she spends a lot of time near my pits for nursing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;B.O. is caused by a bacteria on specific parts of your body, near your sweat glands, that feeds off the sweat.</li>
            <li>This and all natural cruelty-free products work about the same.</li>
            <li>It usually lasts all day if it&#x27;s cool out.</li>
            <li>The combination of chamomile and green tea yields a fresh, not too flowery perfume that does not overpower when sprayed on lavishly.</li>
            <li>Further, when women shave under their arms it can result in a higher aluminum-salt absorption rate due to the damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But since it&#x27;s long-awaited re-release, they amped up the peppermint fragrance from the subtle, clean scent it used to have.</li>

            <li> I also use the spray on more \\&quot;delicate\\&quot; parts of my body and I am so impressed!</li>
            <li> I also use the &amp;#34;rock&amp;#34; and am very happy, and odor free!</li>
            <li> I honestly can recommended!</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Giving up my stick deodorants for good.  </li>
            <li> It has a very nice scent and it goes on nicely.  </li>
            <li> This is a great light scent, and works great.</li>
            <li> I like the very light scent of this spray and that you can spray just about anywhere on your body!</li>
            <li> I used to use the crystal essence roll on in the lavender scent, it worked ok but wasnt great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very refreshing feeling and this will be my go to scent and form of deodorant in conjunction with the roll on for a while.</li>
            <li> I use this for any part of my body that needs refreshing!</li>
            <li> and I am in love!</li>
            <li> First, the scent is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I am unfortunately kind of a sweaty person, so I am still getting used to not plugging my pores up with aluminum, but this brand has been the most successful in treating my body odor.</li>
            <li> Great smell and easy to use.</li>
            <li> this smells good though the smell is very light and after a couple of hours I can&#x27;t smell it at all.</li>
            <li> product itself is amazing.</li>
            <li> I make my own deodorant at home now.</li>
            <li> many reviewers say explicitly to do so for optimum effectivness.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells okay, but fair warning, for those of you with heightened sense of smell and finicky noses like me,  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t burn or sting or cause me to break out, and it controls BO odor as good as or better than the antiperspirant I used to use.</li>
            <li> It is kind of flowery</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this alone on my underarms but with a deodorant or milk of magnesia on top it works great :)</li>
            <li> This deodorant spray is effective, just like the non-fragrance version.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, what&#x27;s not to love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since a spray is sanitary to share, both my mom and my boyfriend have borrowed it before, and both have liked it too.</li>
            <li> This smells nice</li>
            <li> Took a bus tour where it was warm in the bus, we were on and off walking around and touring in 80 degree weather.....</li>
            <li> The scent is nice when you apply.</li>
            <li> It seems to fight germs and bacteria while maintaining a wonderful soft &amp;#34;just out of the bath&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Crystal Essence Chamomile spray is the most effective for me.</li>
            <li> This is so much more effective.  </li>
            <li> So far, the best I have tried without the baking soda.</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful natural spray deodorant I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> I love the smell, and it&#x27;s such a great product!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li> then I would recommend buying Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel Formula Towelettes to freshen up and then maybe use more of this body spray again.</li>
            <li> The Body Spray and the Crystal stick are however my favorite.</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with the Thai Crystal Stick and feel quite confident when I do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Haven&#x27;t been adventurous enough to give up the antiperspirant roll-ons, but very happy to see Amazon/Marketplace offer this product and fragrance online!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Crystal unscented roll on for over a year now, and love it.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant.</li>
            <li> and this is the one that I use the most.</li>
            <li> I love this smell.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of deodorant.  </li>
            <li> love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> It works better the longer you use it.</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Edited 6 months later: I still think this is a good deodorant and a great brand</li>
            <li> However, many deodorants also contain aluminum, along with chemicals called parabens, which have also been linked to breast cancer.</li>
            <li> So, you&#x27;re clearly better off avoiding both antiperspirants and deodorants.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While many claim to be aluminum-free, they are referring to aluminum chlorohydrate, aluminum chloride, aluminum hydroxybromide or aluminum</li>
            <li> The aluminum is taken into sweat ducts in the top layer of your skin where they act as a plug, stopping the flow of sweat to your skin&#x27;s</li>
            <li> These deodorants are recommended by many cancer treatment centers.</li>
            <li> and I love that.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Second, it works great!</li>
            <li> Like most people reviewing this, I bought it as an attempt to lower my aluminum exposure.</li>
            <li> but I do love this stuff when I am home, doing laundry, and at the gym.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of keeping me smelling fresh</li>
            <li> it is great for being so natural!</li>
            <li> and I like the clean feeling of not having gunk under my pits!    </li>
            <li> I then sprayed the Chamomile Body Spray on top of that as I like a light scent.</li>
            <li> its very fresh and most important does not have chemicals like most deo&#x27;s do</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, it does keep stench away for longer!</li>
            <li> It is not sticky on the skin, applies easily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oily, so it dribbles rather than diffuses when sprayed, and it smells strongly of tea-tree leaf oil (think</li>
            <li> Love this product, fresh scent, easy spray, works great for odor control, all natural, no chemicals!</li>
            <li> This product is touted as a body deodorant, but I find it works marvelously as a cool, refreshing foot</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells light, clean and a bit earthy.</li>
            <li> I expect it to last longer than my store bought deodorants, making it even more cost effective!</li>
            <li> The unscented is fine, too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great buy for those with super busy non stop lives.</li>
            <li> I prefer the roll on type, but this is by far the best natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural deodorants, and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li> This scent is light and feminine, without being all up in your face.</li>
            <li> The smell is very understated, but nice.</li>
            <li> on I especially love this scent chamomile and green tea</li>
            <li> As far as functionality, I did notice a reduction in foot sweat which was good.</li>
            <li> The scent is light, fresh, and clean, it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on clothing, and it works with my body&#x27;s PH for 24hr protection!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to rinse it with hot water, removed the top of the sprayer etc, but it just is not working.  </li>
            <li> It is clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> -ons have ingredients that are not so good for the body when absorbed throughout he skin, stick to natural rocks or sprays that have no chemical</li>
            <li> It goes on floral, but then settles into a clean scent I often associate with men&#x27;s deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Wow, love this spray!  </li>
            <li> she was right!</li>
            <li> Since the switch, she&#x27;d been cool &amp;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing those will be good for touch-ups later in the day when I am not home to shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so true.</li>
            <li> for which I paid good price compare to anybody else who selling similar product!</li>
            <li> However, this is why the product MUST be applied to freshly bathed, CLEAN skin, since it needs a clean slate to start with.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this product I used the Pomegranate scent, which was too strong for me.</li>
            <li> although the spray has clogged once or twice, it  cleans easily with hot water running over the pump.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d deliberately seek out, but it&#x27;s not repulsive either, and in any case the scent fades quickly.</li>
            <li> It arrived very fast with my satisfaction!</li>
            <li> Works fairly well as long as you&#x27;re not in a situation where you&#x27;ll be sweating a lot!</li>
            <li> While all three work, the chamomile and green tea smells great on me (the others don&#x27;t mesh with my body chemistry).  </li>
            <li> I enjoy this product and will use it more for travel since it will require only one bottle for me vs. two, but don&#x27;t let that deter you, I would recommend it on</li>
            <li> It kept me fresh all day.</li>
            <li> Really stopped the sweat smell (REALLY STOPPED THE SWEAT SMELL), and I love the scent....</li>
            <li> It keeps me smelling fresh even after a workout session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Personally, I feel most comfortable at work and with my boyfriend wearing a product that includes an antiperspirant..</li>
            <li> During that time I have tried countless brands of natural deodorant, and have struggled to find one that works and has a pleasant, mild scent.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, your skin has to be clean for it to work (and I recommend drying off and using something bottled to wet the stick to avoid bacteria, even if you just spray bottled water on yourself or the stick).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very strong almost sickeningly sweet floral smell right out of the bottle (from the Chamomile), BUT don&#x27;t worry it dissipates quickly to a light &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent once on your skin (from the Green Tea).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On bottle number 2 or 3, I switched to this lovely Chamomile &amp; green tea scented version, and I&#x27;ve been using it happily for several years now.</li>
            <li> My whole family has converted since then, and we can&#x27;t believe how nice it is to have given up the chemicals and the problem at the same time!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the most effective natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> This is mostly for a women&#x27;s taste, but it can be used for men also, due to its light tones that does not over power.  </li>
            <li> It is a natural deodorant, so I am fine with the hassle of re-applying.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last super long, but it&#x27;s better than most others out there.</li>
            <li> The sprayer worked for the first week, but then stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time.</li>
            <li> The spray is cooling and soothing to hot, puffy feet, and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> you already have odor on your skin or clothes, it must be cleaned first.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would be able to get away from Degree extra strength for men</li>
            <li> those first two weeks to slough the underarm skin.</li>
            <li> Multiply this by one or more times a day for a lifetime</li>
            <li> Use it daily- love it</li>
            <li> I have also found other natural deodorant alternatives that smell better, Herban Cowboy in the blossom scent is now my favorite</li>
            <li> I apply right after a shower very liberally.</li>
            <li> i like the smell and they have some other really nice smells like lavender and pomegranate.</li>
            <li> Crystal Natural Deodorant is by far the best natural spray and this chamomile and green tea is fresh and clean natural scents.  </li>
            <li> for this particular scent, the Chamomile &amp; Green Tea pleasant, and could be considered unisex.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own had I not purchased it with the other!</li>
            <li> this study was a pretty clear sign that the metal was being absorbed from antiperspirant sprays and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fresh out of the shower, I make sure my under arms are completely dry.</li>
            <li> Potassium Alum or Ammonium Alum are natural mineral salts made up of molecules that are too large to be absorbed by your skin.</li>
            <li> You cannot really reapply this to already sweaty skin and expect it to work anymore.</li>
            <li> The Pomegranate of the Roll-On is a much stronger scent(not</li>
            <li> Salt stops the bacteria that causes odor from forming and it works really great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> much prefer the Crystal roll on product.</li>
            <li> I use the roll on deodorant and this spray and that is all I really need for BO control.</li>
            <li> very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s get this straight.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Light enough for a man or a woman.</li>
            <li> and I really like the smell of the product.</li>
            <li> It of course isn&#x27;t as effective as the ones that have bad-for-you stuff like heavy metals in them, but come on -</li>
            <li> Too many other foot-spray products on the market that also smell like peppermint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to revert back to my original brand deodorant.</li>
            <li> key is to spray it on clean skin before bacteria sets in or</li>
            <li> As you spray it smells a little strong subsides almost immediately!</li>
            <li> I actually recommend this brand over HC for pregnant women in the original fragrance-free version because it doesn&#x27;t have any essential oils.</li>
            <li> The crystal deodorant is more effective than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, and I like the delicate fragrance of this version.</li>
            <li> for example contains rosemary which is a essential oil some pregnant ladies may wish to avoid.</li>
            <li> ended up having to find a drugstore for some real deodorant/antiperspirant so I wouldn&#x27;t offend those near me!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I sprayed a little on after bathing in the morning and by evening I was still feeling clean and getting compliments on the fresh scent.</li>
            <li> &quot; deodorant stones are a popular natural deodorant alternative, often used by health-conscious shoppers looking to avoid the aluminum and other chemicals common in most antiperspirants</li>
            <li> Some 20,000 people in the village of Camelford were exposed to the chemical for several weeks, and then went on to develop a rare form of early-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, along with showing the presence of high levels of aluminum in their tissues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deodorants</li>
            <li> Refreshing green tea and chamomile scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth mentioning that deodorants are not the same thing as antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> Regular deodorant not only irritates my skin after shaving, but I notice that when I shower it doesn&#x27;t wash off easily.</li>
            <li> All of the scents for this body spray smell strong only for the second you spray them</li>
            <li> The key is you have to spray it on right after you shower before the bacteria set in.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to be more natural and move away from harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> and I have *very* sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> To use I just run the Crystal stick under the water &amp; then give my pits a quick spray and let it air dry for a minute before putting on my shirt!     </li>
            <li> A review of the common sources of aluminum exposure for humans found that antiperspirant use can significantly increase the amount of aluminum absorbed by your body.</li>
            <li> Concentrations of aluminum were higher in the tissue closest to the underarm than in the central breast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This, too, has many beneficial extracts and oils (tea-tree, witch hazel, rosemary, sage, chamomile) and works well for its other uses--soothes and disinfects minor scrapes and insect bites, relieves sunburn discomfort (I use it to spot-treat acne).</li>
            <li> I should note that I don&#x27;t get particularly smelly in general, but this product works well for me.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this to anyone that wants a spray deodorant to last all day.  </li>
            <li> If you stink and rub a natural roll-on or rock on you, the stink will stay in the product forever</li>
            <li> Its natural and no chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I like natural products and this one works for me.</li>
            <li> In some cases, it is clear that they may be wreaking havoc directly on your brain.</li>
            <li> Given that antiperspirants are used on your armpits, the aluminum salt concentration is highest near your breast tissue.</li>
            <li> She surprised me by saying that she&#x27;d given it up some time before &amp; switched to a natural deodorant, and that it turned out her body had just been over-compensating.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t mask my natural scent, and if I do choose to wear a fragrance, it doesn&#x27;t clash with it.</li>
            <li> After listening  a doctor speak about the cancers caused by metals in deodorants, I began searching for natural options.</li>
            <li> Ever see the Portlandia episode about natural deodorants?</li>
            <li> The product itself works, however the spray bottle is dysfunctional and the liquid spray that collects on my skin if I am fortunate enough to get the sprayer to work, runs down under my arm, wasting time and money as well as feeling uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Natural, cruelty free body deodorant with a delicate fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The aluminum in crystal deodorant stones is a different type of compound known as an alum, the most common form being potassium alum, also known as potassium aluminum sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but now I only use typical deodorant or antiperspirant for special occasions.</li>
            <li> that the smell isn&#x27;t over whelming to my baby &amp; doesn&#x27;t contain potentially toxic chemicals, she spends a lot of time near my pits for nursing!</li>
            <li> /&gt;B.O. is caused by a bacteria on specific parts of your body, near your sweat glands, that feeds off the sweat.</li>
            <li> This and all natural cruelty-free products work about the same.</li>
            <li> It usually lasts all day if it&#x27;s cool out.</li>
            <li> The combination of chamomile and green tea yields a fresh, not too flowery perfume that does not overpower when sprayed on lavishly.</li>
            <li> Further, when women shave under their arms it can result in a higher aluminum-salt absorption rate due to the damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But since it&#x27;s long-awaited re-release, they amped up the peppermint fragrance from the subtle, clean scent it used to have.</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve only gotten to test it while slightly active.</li>
            <li> While other natural deodorants either work by (unsuccessfully) just trying to cover up the smell of body odor, or contain toxic antibacterial agents like triclosan, Crystal Essence works by &amp;#34;salting the earth,&amp;#34; so to speak.</li>
            <li> There is evidence, however, that this aluminum is absorbed into your body where it may cause serious damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> True to the product&#x27;s claims, I&#x27;ve found it to be long-lasting (up to 24 hours), non-staining and it leaves no white residue behind.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in Crystal Deodorant naturally inhibit/slow down the growth of this bacteria.</li>
            <li> Deodorants may actually be less problematic than antiperspirants, as they work by neutralizing the smell of your sweat and by antiseptic action against bacteria, but do not prevent sweating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aluminum is not normally found in the human body, so</li>
            <li> It may sound weird</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crystal Body Deodorant for a long time now</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> About a year ago I decided to stop wearing traditional anti-antiperspirants due to a family history of breast cancer.</li>
            <li> The deodorant also contains zinc, which aids skin healing especially for inflammation (like from razor burn, hidradentritis suppurativa, or other ailments), and you&#x27;ll find it in baby diaper rash creams, too, for that reason.</li>
            <li> but if you are in a bikini and sweat and then dry off then you won&#x27;t even know.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I&#x27;d ramped up my anti-perspirant strength to the one just shy of prescription, and I still wasn&#x27;t feeling confident.</li>
            <li> It works well for 1/2 a day, then you need to wash, dry, re-apply.</li>
            <li> At least this spray doesn&#x27;t make my pits feel sticky like the Toms of Main stick.</li>
            <li> According to the review, after a single underarm application of antiperspirant, about .012 percent of the aluminum may be absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually too busy for that where I work.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the smell, and it&#x27;s such a great product!</li>
            <li> The sprayer worked for the first week, but then stopped working.  I have to pour it in my hands to put it on, and this wastes product.  I&#x27;ve tried to rinse it with hot water, removed the top of the sprayer etc, but it just is not working.  I won&#x27;t buy this product again.  I make my own deodorant at home now.</li>
            <li> Natural, cruelty free body deodorant with a delicate fragrance.  Works well as a deodorant but does not stop perspiration.</li>
            <li> I prefer the roll on type, but this is by far the best natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve used! The scent is light, fresh, and clean, it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on clothing, and it works with my body&#x27;s PH for 24hr protection! I&#x27;ve been using it for years!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant. I am allergic to any with metal or powder it seems and I have *very* sensitive skin. This gives me no issues and smells great. It of course isn&#x27;t as effective as the ones that have bad-for-you stuff like heavy metals in them, but come on - it is great for being so natural! I apply right after a shower very liberally. It usually lasts all day if it&#x27;s cool out. If it&#x27;s really muggy and hot then I would recommend buying Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel Formula Towelettes to freshen up and then maybe use more of this body spray again. You cannot really reapply this to already sweaty skin and expect it to work anymore.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Chamomile Body Spray, a [[ASIN:B000L978FU Crystal - Crystal Stick Body Deodorant, 4.25 oz sticks]] and a [[ASIN:B0028FGUHW Crystal essence Deodorant Roll-On, Pomegranate 2.25 fl oz]]. I waited to use them til the next time I showered as the package and many reviewers say explicitly to do so for optimum effectivness. It may sound weird but I put the roll on under one arm and I used the stick, which is odorless, on the other pit. I then sprayed the Chamomile Body Spray on top of that as I like a light scent. I&#x27;ll give you my experience with both.     The Pomegranate of the Roll-On is a much stronger scent(not a bad smell to me as I like pomegranate scented things) but it does dissapate some as it dries. It also takes slightly longer to dry than the stick version, which takes slightly longer to dry than &#x27;regular&#x27; deodorants. I enjoy this product and will use it more for travel since it will require only one bottle for me vs. two, but don&#x27;t let that deter you, I would recommend it on it&#x27;s own had I not purchased it with the other! I am very satisfied with how well it works! It&#x27;s true, it does keep stench away for longer! Where as with typical deodorants I would notice odor before going to bed, with this, I still don&#x27;t smell even when I wake up in the morning and I like the clean feeling of not having gunk under my pits!    The Body Spray and the Crystal stick are however my favorite. I like the very light scent of this spray and that you can spray just about anywhere on your body! Also being a breastfeeding mom I like that the smell isn&#x27;t over whelming to my baby &amp; doesn&#x27;t contain potentially toxic chemicals, she spends a lot of time near my pits for nursing! To use I just run the Crystal stick under the water &amp; then give my pits a quick spray and let it air dry for a minute before putting on my shirt!     I recommend this product to anyone &amp; it&#x27;s cheaper than other deodorants &amp; given other reviews I expect it to last longer than my store bought deodorants, making it even more cost effective! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time. It kept me fresh all day. I sprayed a little on after bathing in the morning and by evening I was still feeling clean and getting compliments on the fresh scent. It&#x27;s a great buy for those with super busy non stop lives. It seems to fight germs and bacteria while maintaining a wonderful soft &amp;#34;just out of the bath&amp;#34; scent. Buy It!!! You&#x27;ll like it!!</li>
            <li> About a year ago I decided to stop wearing traditional anti-antiperspirants due to a family history of breast cancer. During that time I have tried countless brands of natural deodorant, and have struggled to find one that works and has a pleasant, mild scent. I am unfortunately kind of a sweaty person, so I am still getting used to not plugging my pores up with aluminum, but this brand has been the most successful in treating my body odor. I use it in conjunction with the Thai Crystal Stick and feel quite confident when I do. Sometimes I can even go two days without re-applying. The first time I tried this product I used the Pomegranate scent, which was too strong for me. This scent is light and feminine, without being all up in your face.</li>
            <li> This product is touted as a body deodorant, but I find it works marvelously as a cool, refreshing foot spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use [[ASIN:B0079QKTCM Heel To Toe Cooling Foot Spray]]. But since it&#x27;s long-awaited re-release, they amped up the peppermint fragrance from the subtle, clean scent it used to have. Lots of beneficial extracts and oils (peppermint, chamomile, tea leaf, licorice root, grapeseed, tea-tree, spearmint), but don&#x27;t want feet smelling like candy canes. Too many other foot-spray products on the market that also smell like peppermint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried [[ASIN:B000Z93J54 Desert Essence Tea Tree Relief Spray 4 oz.]]. This, too, has many beneficial extracts and oils (tea-tree, witch hazel, rosemary, sage, chamomile) and works well for its other uses--soothes and disinfects minor scrapes and insect bites, relieves sunburn discomfort (I use it to spot-treat acne). Great if you&#x27;re looking for a tea-tree leaf oil product. It&#x27;s oily, so it dribbles rather than diffuses when sprayed, and it smells strongly of tea-tree leaf oil (think pine-sol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found Crystal Essence mineral deodorant body spray in a health/vitamin store. Refreshing green tea and chamomile scent. The spray is cooling and soothing to hot, puffy feet, and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering. Leaves no residue. Both green tea and chamomile have antiseptic and anti-inflammatory qualities, and the mineral salts will help prevent odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t been adventurous enough to give up the antiperspirant roll-ons, but very happy to see Amazon/Marketplace offer this product and fragrance online!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Crystal unscented roll on for over a year now, and love it. Wanted to try something scented &amp; easier to apply in non-armpit areas. This stuff smells okay, but fair warning, for those of you with heightened sense of smell and finicky noses like me,  it&#x27;s a very strong almost sickeningly sweet floral smell right out of the bottle (from the Chamomile), BUT don&#x27;t worry it dissipates quickly to a light &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent once on your skin (from the Green Tea).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is amazing. This product doesn&#x27;t burn or sting or cause me to break out, and it controls BO odor as good as or better than the antiperspirant I used to use. Granted, I don&#x27;t have excessive sweat issues, but my sweat smells awful and I have a skin disease called Hidradenitis suppurativa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B.O. is caused by a bacteria on specific parts of your body, near your sweat glands, that feeds off the sweat. The ingredients in Crystal Deodorant naturally inhibit/slow down the growth of this bacteria. However, this is why the product MUST be applied to freshly bathed, CLEAN skin, since it needs a clean slate to start with. The deodorant also contains zinc, which aids skin healing especially for inflammation (like from razor burn, hidradentritis suppurativa, or other ailments), and you&#x27;ll find it in baby diaper rash creams, too, for that reason. I used this spray around my bikini area in the last week for the HS and razor burn and it&#x27;s helping already.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant. I&#x27;ve been using Crystal Body Deodorant for a long time now and this is the one that I use the most. I love this smell. It is clean and fresh! As you spray it smells a little strong subsides almost immediately! All of the scents for this body spray smell strong only for the second you spray them and then it goes away. I like that it has no chemicals in it, nor parabens, etc. I use this for any part of my body that needs refreshing! Underarms, Feet, and even private parts. It lasts for about 8 hours and then reapply it if needed. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural deodorants, and this is the best by far. It has a great scent and I only need to apply it once in the morning and usually once again in the afternoon/evening If I&#x27;m going back out. It doesn&#x27;t last super long, but it&#x27;s better than most others out there.</li>
            <li> Crystal Natural Deodorant is by far the best natural spray and this chamomile and green tea is fresh and clean natural scents.  Would recommend this to anyone that wants a spray deodorant to last all day.  This is mostly for a women&#x27;s taste, but it can be used for men also, due to its light tones that does not over power.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Use mineral salts after showering. Salt stops the bacteria that causes odor from forming and it works really great.&lt;br /&gt;The key is to spray it on clean skin before bacteria sets in or it won&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;If you already have odor on your skin or clothes, it must be cleaned first. If you stink and rub a natural roll-on or rock on you, the stink will stay in the product forever (you will apply the stink next time you use it)&lt;br /&gt;Rocks must be wetted then rubbed liberally all over every part of underarm.&lt;br /&gt;Roll-ons have ingredients that are not so good for the body when absorbed throughout he skin, stick to natural rocks or sprays that have no chemical fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Crystal Essence Chamomile spray is the most effective for me. It is kind of flowery but i wouldn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;girlie&amp;#34;, guys can use it too.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of deodorant.  Its natural and no chemicals.  The spray is even easier to use so I definitely recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> The product itself works, however the spray bottle is dysfunctional and the liquid spray that collects on my skin if I am fortunate enough to get the sprayer to work, runs down under my arm, wasting time and money as well as feeling uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer the Crystal roll on product.</li>
            <li> Spray pump does not work. The smell is very understated, but nice. I did not try to return this item.</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful natural spray deodorant I have ever used!  It has a very nice scent and it goes on nicely.  I do have to wait a few minutes for your armpits to dry before you can put clothes on.  It works for about 8 hours and then I have to re-apply.  It is a natural deodorant, so I am fine with the hassle of re-applying.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> love the fragrance. subtle and not overpowering. product works well too.</li>
            <li> is not what i prefer as people around such and odor do not appreciate having to cover their noses to survive</li>
            <li> I like natural products and this one works for me.</li>
            <li> I use this in my groin/crotch area and all over to decrease body odor. I tend to sweat in my groin area and found it embarrassing. I spray this and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it even if I go exercising. The key is you have to spray it on right after you shower before the bacteria set in. I use the roll on deodorant and this spray and that is all I really need for BO control. Changed my life. I have been trying to be more natural and move away from harsh chemicals. I never thought I would be able to get away from Degree extra strength for men but now I only use typical deodorant or antiperspirant for special occasions. This is all I need for everyday use. And it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue so if you are wearing tank tops you don&#x27;t have to worry about white chunks under your arm. Be warned that this is not an antiperspirant. You will sweat but it won&#x27;t smell as offensive. When sweat mixes with clothing there is a smell that will still happen but if you are in a bikini and sweat and then dry off then you won&#x27;t even know. Its great. For the price at least try it. It works better the longer you use it. I also recommend using an exfoliating face scrub under your arms those first two weeks to slough the underarm skin. If you use a stronger deoderant/antiperspirant I find that it takes a few days to get that residue off of the skin.</li>
            <li> Great smell and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a great light scent, and works great. Love this product</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how wonderful this product is I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else from now on I especially love this scent chamomile and green tea</li>
            <li> Wow, love this spray!  Really stopped the sweat smell (REALLY STOPPED THE SWEAT SMELL), and I love the scent.... very light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.  Giving up my stick deodorants for good.  This is so much more effective.  I&#x27;m a convert.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all and this one is a winner. It keeps me smelling fresh even after a workout session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited 6 months later: I still think this is a good deodorant and a great brand but I&#x27;m taking a star off because a couple months after I start using it the spray nozzle got clogged and  stop working. I recommend buying the salt stone or the roll on version of this same product instead of this one. I have also found other natural deodorant alternatives that smell better, Herban Cowboy in the blossom scent is now my favorite but this one is all-right. I actually recommend this brand over HC for pregnant women in the original fragrance-free version because it doesn&#x27;t have any essential oils. HC for example contains rosemary which is a essential oil some pregnant ladies may wish to avoid.</li>
            <li> Love this product, fresh scent, easy spray, works great for odor control, all natural, no chemicals!</li>
            <li> I wish this dried faster - it takes 5 minutes of waiting for this stuff to dry. The scent is acceptable - it&#x27;s not a scent I&#x27;d deliberately seek out, but it&#x27;s not repulsive either, and in any case the scent fades quickly. As far as functionality, I did notice a reduction in foot sweat which was good. One complaint though, the sprayer is rather flimsy - unless you hold the bottle vertically with the tip up, you will get leakage and/or a failure to spray.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this alone on my underarms but with a deodorant or milk of magnesia on top it works great :)</li>
            <li> This deodorant spray is effective, just like the non-fragrance version.  The combination of chamomile and green tea yields a fresh, not too flowery perfume that does not overpower when sprayed on lavishly.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s get this straight. Even though aluminum is widely distributed in the earth&#x27;s crust, it is NOT needed in ANY amounts in your body. All evidence to date points to aluminum as a poison that serves no beneficial role in your body and should be avoided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Aluminum is widely recognized as a neurotoxin, which has been found in increased concentrations in the brains of people with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Unfortunately, if you use antiperspirants or some deodorants, you are most likely exposing yourself to aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Aluminum salts can account for 25 percent of the volume of some antiperspirants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  A review of the common sources of aluminum exposure for humans found that antiperspirant use can significantly increase the amount of aluminum absorbed by your body. According to the review, after a single underarm application of antiperspirant, about .012 percent of the aluminum may be absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Multiply this by one or more times a day for a lifetime and you can have a massive exposure to aluminum -- a poison that is not meant to be in your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Antiperspirants work by clogging, closing, or blocking the pores that release sweat under your arms -- with the active ingredient being aluminum. Not only does this block one of your body&#x27;s routes for detoxification (releasing toxins via your underarm sweat), but it raises concerns about where these metals are going once you roll them (or spray them) on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  In some cases, it is clear that they may be wreaking havoc directly on your brain. In 1988, for instance, a truck driver accidentally poured 20 tons of aluminum sulphate into a tank containing drinking water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Some 20,000 people in the village of Camelford were exposed to the chemical for several weeks, and then went on to develop a rare form of early-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, along with showing the presence of high levels of aluminum in their tissues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deodorants and Antiperspirants Linked to Cancer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Alzheimer&#x27;s disease is not the only reason to ditch your aluminum-containing antiperspirant and deodorant, as this metal has also been linked to cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  A 2006 study found that aluminum salts can mimic the hormone estrogen, and chemicals that imitate that hormone are known to increase breast cancer risk. Animal studies have also found that aluminum can cause cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Given that antiperspirants are used on your armpits, the aluminum salt concentration is highest near your breast tissue. Further, when women shave under their arms it can result in a higher aluminum-salt absorption rate due to the damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  In a 2007 study published in the Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry, researchers tested breast samples from 17 breast-cancer patients who had undergone mastectomies. The women who used antiperspirants had deposits of aluminum in their outer breast tissue. Concentrations of aluminum were higher in the tissue closest to the underarm than in the central breast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Aluminum is not normally found in the human body, so this study was a pretty clear sign that the metal was being absorbed from antiperspirant sprays and roll-ons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s worth mentioning that deodorants are not the same thing as antiperspirants. Deodorants may actually be less problematic than antiperspirants, as they work by neutralizing the smell of your sweat and by antiseptic action against bacteria, but do not prevent sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  However, many deodorants also contain aluminum, along with chemicals called parabens, which have also been linked to breast cancer. So, you&#x27;re clearly better off avoiding both antiperspirants and deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supposedly \\&quot;Safe\\&quot; Crystal Alum Antiperspirants&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  \\&quot;Crystal\\&quot; deodorant stones are a popular natural deodorant alternative, often used by health-conscious shoppers looking to avoid the aluminum and other chemicals common in most antiperspirants anddeodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  However, if you&#x27;re looking to avoid aluminum, crystal deodorants may not be your best choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  While many claim to be aluminum-free, they are referring to aluminum chlorohydrate, aluminum chloride, aluminum hydroxybromide or aluminum zirconium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  These types of aluminum are widely used in antiperspirants and deodorants. The aluminum is taken into sweat ducts in the top layer of your skin where they act as a plug, stopping the flow of sweat to your skin&#x27;s surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  There is evidence, however, that this aluminum is absorbed into your body where it may cause serious damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The aluminum in crystal deodorant stones is a different type of compound known as an alum, the most common form being potassium alum, also known as potassium aluminum sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Potassium Alum or Ammonium Alum are natural mineral salts made up of molecules that are too large to be absorbed by your skin. They form a protective layer on your skin that inhibits the growth of odor-causing bacteria. These deodorants are recommended by many cancer treatment centers.</li>
            <li> Organic deodorant that doesn&#x27;t include any dangerous chemicals</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I&#x27;d ramped up my anti-perspirant strength to the one just shy of prescription, and I still wasn&#x27;t feeling confident. I had a chance lunch with a friend who had always had issues with underarm sweating, and told her about how frustrated I was with antiperspirant. She surprised me by saying that she&#x27;d given it up some time before &amp; switched to a natural deodorant, and that it turned out her body had just been over-compensating. Since the switch, she&#x27;d been cool &amp; dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went out immediately &amp; bought the unscented variety of this Crystal Spray, and I couldn&#x27;t believe it-- she was right! On bottle number 2 or 3, I switched to this lovely Chamomile &amp; green tea scented version, and I&#x27;ve been using it happily for several years now. My whole family has converted since then, and we can&#x27;t believe how nice it is to have given up the chemicals and the problem at the same time!</li>
            <li> this product has a very nice scent. works well for me and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like regular deods or anti-persps</li>
            <li> I just started using Crystal this week and I am in love! By recommendation of another reviewer, I bought the stick [[ASIN:B000L978FU Crystal - Crystal Stick Body Deodorant, 4.25 oz sticks]] and the spray as well. Most importantly, your skin has to be clean for it to work (and I recommend drying off and using something bottled to wet the stick to avoid bacteria, even if you just spray bottled water on yourself or the stick).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh out of the shower, I make sure my under arms are completely dry. Then I spray the stick with the Crystal Spray and apply it to my underarms. I do this about three times on each underarm and it last the entire day. I found that spraying a little on the stick instead of my underarms dries it a lot faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stick itself has no fragrance and I love that. It doesn&#x27;t mask my natural scent, and if I do choose to wear a fragrance, it doesn&#x27;t clash with it. Regular deodorant not only irritates my skin after shaving, but I notice that when I shower it doesn&#x27;t wash off easily. That problem has been eliminated by switching to the Crystal Stick. I also use the spray on more \\&quot;delicate\\&quot; parts of my body and I am so impressed! Anyone that has issues with sweating in places other than your underarms needs to try the Crystal spray! You&#x27;ll love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve only gotten to test it while slightly active. I will have to update my review once I wear it to work out! I also bought the Crystal wipes [[ASIN:B004MB7YDO Crystal Body Deodorant Towelettes -- 24 Towelettes]] but I haven&#x27;t gotten to try them yet. I&#x27;m guessing those will be good for touch-ups later in the day when I am not home to shower.</li>
            <li> After listening  a doctor speak about the cancers caused by metals in deodorants, I began searching for natural options. I found this Crystal Essence line, and was attracted to it because I could order the roll on deodorant and the body mist in the same scent. I love the way this smells light, clean and a bit earthy. Using this product was a trial, which is now a keeper.</li>
            <li> i like the smell and they have some other really nice smells like lavender and pomegranate. its very fresh and most important does not have chemicals like most deo&#x27;s do</li>
            <li> I really like this product. The crystal deodorant is more effective than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, and I like the delicate fragrance of this version. The unscented is fine, too. I also use the &amp;#34;rock&amp;#34; and am very happy, and odor free!</li>
            <li> I am so very happy with this spray! I used to use the crystal essence roll on in the lavender scent, it worked ok but wasnt great. I went off the great reviews for this and am so happy I ordered it! First, the scent is wonderful! Light enough for a man or a woman. Second, it works great! Maybe my body and the lavender scent just dont work well together. I have also ordered this in the towelettes to take on vacation. I think I&#x27;ll order the roll on as well. I&#x27;m just really happy with this. It&#x27;s a 95 degree, humid day here and its working great!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the most effective natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried. While other natural deodorants either work by (unsuccessfully) just trying to cover up the smell of body odor, or contain toxic antibacterial agents like triclosan, Crystal Essence works by &amp;#34;salting the earth,&amp;#34; so to speak. Using non-toxic mineral salts it turns your armpits into surfaces on which odor-causing bacteria can&#x27;t grow. True to the product&#x27;s claims, I&#x27;ve found it to be long-lasting (up to 24 hours), non-staining and it leaves no white residue behind. It&#x27;s also not tested on animals, contains no aluminum, and is endorsed by Cancer Treatment Centers. Honestly, what&#x27;s not to love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this particular scent, the Chamomile &amp; Green Tea pleasant, and could be considered unisex.  It goes on floral, but then settles into a clean scent I often associate with men&#x27;s deodorant.  Since a spray is sanitary to share, both my mom and my boyfriend have borrowed it before, and both have liked it too.</li>
            <li> Like most people reviewing this, I bought it as an attempt to lower my aluminum exposure. Please note, this is a deodorant and NOT an antipersperant! Personally, I feel most comfortable at work and with my boyfriend wearing a product that includes an antiperspirant.. but I do love this stuff when I am home, doing laundry, and at the gym. It does a good job of keeping me smelling fresh and I really like the smell of the product. I should note that I don&#x27;t get particularly smelly in general, but this product works well for me. It is not sticky on the skin, applies easily (I rub it in after about 3 sprays) and although the spray has clogged once or twice, it  cleans easily with hot water running over the pump. I&#x27;ll re-purchase!</li>
            <li> Ever see the Portlandia episode about natural deodorants? It&#x27;s so true. This smells nice but no matter what, if you are frantically walking to class or working hard, you will get stinky. Will I continue to use this? Yes. I&#x27;d rather be stinky after a hard days work than know I&#x27;ve killed a beagle/used products that test on animals. This and all natural cruelty-free products work about the same. At least this spray doesn&#x27;t make my pits feel sticky like the Toms of Main stick.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 different scents of this brand.  While all three work, the chamomile and green tea smells great on me (the others don&#x27;t mesh with my body chemistry).  I have been allergic to deodorant for 12 years, so I have tried several brands.  This ties with Pit Powder by Muddy H20.</li>
            <li> Works fairly well as long as you&#x27;re not in a situation where you&#x27;ll be sweating a lot! Then it fails... :(  Took a bus tour where it was warm in the bus, we were on and off walking around and touring in 80 degree weather.....ended up having to find a drugstore for some real deodorant/antiperspirant so I wouldn&#x27;t offend those near me! The scent is nice when you apply. Takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this. It smells just like the roll on does and give me variety when I don&#x27;t want to use the roll on. It&#x27;s a very refreshing feeling and this will be my go to scent and form of deodorant in conjunction with the roll on for a while. I only wish i could find this on the ground. The roll on lasts for about two or three months. This I feel I have to use sparingly because you can get carried away with the spray.</li>
            <li> Use it daily- love it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would. I have to revert back to my original brand deodorant.</li>
            <li> this smells good though the smell is very light and after a couple of hours I can&#x27;t smell it at all.</li>
            <li> For myself I need nature deodorant in spray(roll on deodorant it&#x27;s not comfortable for me) for which I paid good price compare to anybody else who selling similar product! It arrived very fast with my satisfaction! I honestly can recommended! Just try it! Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I like the scents, chamomile being my fave. It works well for 1/2 a day, then you need to wash, dry, re-apply. I&#x27;m usually too busy for that where I work. I use the crystal rock and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> So far, the best I have tried without the baking soda. I do I have to re-apply after 7 hours.</li>
