            <li>so I was excited to try it!</li>
            <li>I was offered a Facial Wash Konjac Sponge from Amaki Skincare for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it.</li>
            <li>You can clean your face without soap!</li>
            <li>Made my face feel eally clean without any cleanser used!</li>
            <li>This is a very cool scrubber I&#x27;ve never felt anything like it before.</li>
            <li>but when soaked becomes a soft sponge that feels great on my face.  </li>
            <li>Great for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It was kind of fun</li>
            <li>That was sweet!</li>
            <li>This sponge is so cool!</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel fresh and clean!!</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels healthy and clean since I switched to the sponge.  </li>
            <li>This was an easy transaction.</li>
            <li>My skin felt well cleansed and exfoliated after using it, and the suction cup worked fine on my bathroom mirror.  </li>
            <li>it was so smooth.  </li>
            <li>and I remembered how much my friend liked her charcoal sponge</li>
            <li>I got a great lather from the konjac sponge, better than I expected.</li>
            <li>so I was able to use it right away.</li>
            <li>I have never been someone who enjoys all the soap and face creams that it can take to have your skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>After use my skin feels clean and smooth but not abraded.</li>
            <li>This Konjac Sponge actually comes with a suction hanger which I think is absolutely AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use it, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it has done anything.</li>
            <li>Talk about economical!</li>
            <li>I use to use my hands to wash my face but after using this, my face feels twice as clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin super clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>No worries tho, as per the directions  I soaked it in warm water and it expanded &amp; became very soft,</li>
            <li>Ive met my go to skin care sponge right here!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s right!</li>
            <li>I am blown away by that and super excited.</li>
            <li>First and foremost it  arrived on time, attractively packaged and with directions on the back which is always helpful.</li>
            <li>Would not buy at the full price.</li>
            <li>It feels so cool on your face.</li>
            <li>If you wanted, just cut the string off the sponge and let it dry out on its own dish by your tub - problem solved!</li>
            <li>a perfect fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box was very small when I opened it, which had me hesitant.</li>
            <li>The sponge is very smooth without anything and leaves my skin very soft after washing with just water.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it has a string attached to it is another reason why I like it so much so that you can easily hang it up which saves space.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with its own little suction cup hook.</li>
            <li>and I was unsure if it would be worth a hoot.</li>
            <li>I love this sponge,  it doubles in size and is soft.  </li>
            <li>think that all my dreams would come true with this but even after the first day of using this I could feel my heart fluttering with the realization that this may be my miracle</li>
            <li>My opinion may differ from yours, however I hope that my review helps you decide whether this is the right product for your needs or not.</li>
            <li>Its just the right amount, not greasy or anything.</li>
            <li>I have a bunch of whiteheads right below bottom lip.</li>
            <li>I used this right away, and i have already started to notice my face getting cleaner.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re gentle and clean well.  </li>
            <li>I love how gentle it is on my sometimes sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Very unusual looking sponge.</li>
            <li>I very highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>This all natural sponge takes out all the impurities from your skin and leaves it clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>then I did the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>And actually, I feel like this mostly spreads oils around on my face rather than removing them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s summer, hot, humid and sweaty</li>
            <li>I have use it both with and without additional cleansers and it seems to work either way much to my astonishment!  </li>
            <li>and I recommend it highly - Fast Shipping too !</li>
            <li>It does exactly what the product describe.</li>
            <li>Using this sponge with my cleanser nightly, it&#x27;s pretty neat.  </li>
            <li>Soft and clean.</li>
            <li>When you open it it is hard as a rock, but when submerged into warm water it becomes a nice sponge.</li>
            <li>I soaked it for 5 minutes like recommended and that little cute sponge grew up!</li>
            <li>I like that it can be used either with or without soap because the charcoal draws out the toxins and gunk and cleansers tend to dry my face out causing more breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Nice smooth skin after using with my liquid African black soap foaming cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It has been so gentle to my skin even after a months use.</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like how my skin feels after washing with this sponge.</li>
            <li>There is absolutely nothing like that.</li>
            <li>I am stunned  and amazed at how fast it worked.  </li>
            <li>My face is much smoother with no blackheads</li>
            <li>How can you beat economical and all natural?</li>
            <li>The bamboo charcoal with activated carbon and minerals is terrific at deep cleaning with or without your own cleanser.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates your skin and promotes healthy cell regeneration and is gentle enough for those with rosacea or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Its easy to disinfect with either a little apple cider vinegar and water or by placing in boiling water but that will break down the fibers more quickly so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend overdoing it.  </li>
            <li>This little sponge left my face feeling so good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really important to hang these up and dry them out, because just like anything else that is porous and gts we, it can mildew.</li>
            <li>Having never used a charcoal sponge I wasn&#x27;t too sure what to expect, I imagined that black chalky residue getting on me and having to rinse it off or something</li>
            <li>I gad high hopes for this item...</li>
            <li>I have tried a few Konjac Sponges and absolutely love them</li>
            <li>but that is just a new routine for me that will develop soon.</li>
            <li>This thing was really tiny when I first got it</li>
            <li>Will continue using it and hope I get pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>So I hang mine by my mirror, making sure it&#x27;s not touching anything</li>
            <li>This little sponge is so cool!</li>
            <li>I started out as a doubter and ended up a new frequent customer.</li>
            <li>It left my skin, even the delicate areas under my eyes feeling soft, smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft yet exfoliates really well at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;ll expand and be really soft.</li>
            <li>to my relief it was a soft, almost gelatin like sponge.  </li>
            <li>I simply use the sponge with water and rub it gently around my face and neck and then rinse.</li>
            <li>The sponge is soft and does not hurt or scratches your face.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t compare to a regular washcloth</li>
            <li>When I said it leaves my face soft</li>
            <li>It expanded and I was surprised.  </li>
            <li>It is so soft ut pulles out the blackheads and grime that gets into the pires on your face.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for removing Dead skin.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this Konjac Sponge from Amaki Skincare for anyone who uses or wants to use one of these for their face.</li>
            <li>She loves how soft it is on her face after it is hydrated.</li>
            <li>and it will be a part of my new daily</li>
            <li>Wow, I have never had such a soft sponge.</li>
            <li>This arrives super hard and small, but it puffs up nicely to a smooth soft sponge.</li>
            <li>A beauty product that is natural, actually works and is so cost efficient?</li>
            <li>if youleavr it on the course the underside ma not dry fully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently started a new face routine with a few new washes and medicationss</li>
            <li>I really like this little sponge.</li>

            <li> This Konjac Sponge actually comes with a suction hanger which I think is absolutely AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use it, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it has done anything.</li>
            <li> Talk about economical!</li>
            <li> I use to use my hands to wash my face but after using this, my face feels twice as clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin super clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> No worries tho, as per the directions  I soaked it in warm water and it expanded &amp; became very soft,</li>
            <li> Ive met my go to skin care sponge right here!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s right!</li>
            <li> I am blown away by that and super excited.</li>
            <li> First and foremost it  arrived on time, attractively packaged and with directions on the back which is always helpful.</li>
            <li> Would not buy at the full price.</li>
            <li> It feels so cool on your face.</li>
            <li> If you wanted, just cut the string off the sponge and let it dry out on its own dish by your tub - problem solved!</li>
            <li> a perfect fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box was very small when I opened it, which had me hesitant.</li>
            <li> The sponge is very smooth without anything and leaves my skin very soft after washing with just water.  </li>
            <li> The fact that it has a string attached to it is another reason why I like it so much so that you can easily hang it up which saves space.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with its own little suction cup hook.</li>
            <li> and I was unsure if it would be worth a hoot.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge,  it doubles in size and is soft.  </li>
            <li> think that all my dreams would come true with this but even after the first day of using this I could feel my heart fluttering with the realization that this may be my miracle</li>
            <li> My opinion may differ from yours, however I hope that my review helps you decide whether this is the right product for your needs or not.</li>
            <li> Its just the right amount, not greasy or anything.</li>
            <li> I have a bunch of whiteheads right below bottom lip.</li>
            <li> I used this right away, and i have already started to notice my face getting cleaner.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re gentle and clean well.  </li>
            <li> I love how gentle it is on my sometimes sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very unusual looking sponge.</li>
            <li> I very highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> This all natural sponge takes out all the impurities from your skin and leaves it clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> then I did the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> And actually, I feel like this mostly spreads oils around on my face rather than removing them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s summer, hot, humid and sweaty</li>
            <li> I have use it both with and without additional cleansers and it seems to work either way much to my astonishment!  </li>
            <li> and I recommend it highly - Fast Shipping too !</li>
            <li> It does exactly what the product describe.</li>
            <li> Using this sponge with my cleanser nightly, it&#x27;s pretty neat.  </li>
            <li> Soft and clean.</li>
            <li> When you open it it is hard as a rock, but when submerged into warm water it becomes a nice sponge.</li>
            <li> I soaked it for 5 minutes like recommended and that little cute sponge grew up!</li>
            <li> I like that it can be used either with or without soap because the charcoal draws out the toxins and gunk and cleansers tend to dry my face out causing more breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Nice smooth skin after using with my liquid African black soap foaming cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It has been so gentle to my skin even after a months use.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like how my skin feels after washing with this sponge.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely nothing like that.</li>
            <li> I am stunned  and amazed at how fast it worked.  </li>
            <li> My face is much smoother with no blackheads</li>
            <li> How can you beat economical and all natural?</li>
            <li> The bamboo charcoal with activated carbon and minerals is terrific at deep cleaning with or without your own cleanser.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates your skin and promotes healthy cell regeneration and is gentle enough for those with rosacea or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Its easy to disinfect with either a little apple cider vinegar and water or by placing in boiling water but that will break down the fibers more quickly so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend overdoing it.  </li>
            <li> This little sponge left my face feeling so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really important to hang these up and dry them out, because just like anything else that is porous and gts we, it can mildew.</li>
            <li> Having never used a charcoal sponge I wasn&#x27;t too sure what to expect, I imagined that black chalky residue getting on me and having to rinse it off or something</li>
            <li> I gad high hopes for this item...</li>
            <li> I have tried a few Konjac Sponges and absolutely love them</li>
            <li> but that is just a new routine for me that will develop soon.</li>
            <li> This thing was really tiny when I first got it</li>
            <li> Will continue using it and hope I get pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> So I hang mine by my mirror, making sure it&#x27;s not touching anything</li>
            <li> This little sponge is so cool!</li>
            <li> I started out as a doubter and ended up a new frequent customer.</li>
            <li> It left my skin, even the delicate areas under my eyes feeling soft, smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft yet exfoliates really well at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;ll expand and be really soft.</li>
            <li> to my relief it was a soft, almost gelatin like sponge.  </li>
            <li> I simply use the sponge with water and rub it gently around my face and neck and then rinse.</li>
            <li> The sponge is soft and does not hurt or scratches your face.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t compare to a regular washcloth</li>
            <li> When I said it leaves my face soft</li>
            <li> It expanded and I was surprised.  </li>
            <li> It is so soft ut pulles out the blackheads and grime that gets into the pires on your face.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for removing Dead skin.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this Konjac Sponge from Amaki Skincare for anyone who uses or wants to use one of these for their face.</li>
            <li> She loves how soft it is on her face after it is hydrated.</li>
            <li> and it will be a part of my new daily</li>
            <li> Wow, I have never had such a soft sponge.</li>
            <li> This arrives super hard and small, but it puffs up nicely to a smooth soft sponge.</li>
            <li> A beauty product that is natural, actually works and is so cost efficient?</li>
            <li> if youleavr it on the course the underside ma not dry fully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started a new face routine with a few new washes and medicationss</li>
            <li> I really like this little sponge.</li>
            <li> You have to remember to get it wet when you first get in the shower because it needs a little time to soften up.</li>
            <li> For those who have never used a Konjac Sponge these do arrive HARD and at first will have you second guessing the idea of using this sponge but don&#x27;t worry just run it under water</li>
            <li> Thanks for including the little suction hanger!  </li>
            <li> The sponge and suction cup are both small, so they are unobtrusive on a large mirror.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this I thought it was going to be hard like a volcanic stone or something but</li>
            <li> Taking care of it is simple, simple press the water out and hang it to air dry by the attached string and included suction cup to conveniently hang in your shower or bath.</li>
            <li> It also takes too long to soften up enough to use.</li>
            <li> It is a long lasting sponge and something everyone should try.</li>
            <li> I like that this company includes a suction cup mounted hook and there is a string for hanging the sponge so it will dry properly and not get moldy.</li>
            <li> I just hang it on the suction cup in the shower and let it dry and use it daily!!  </li>
            <li> You want to keep it in a place where it dry out as much as possible in between uses.</li>
            <li> This one feels &amp;#34;fluffier&amp;#34; than my last one after you wet it.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses I can report that my sensitive skin wasn&#x27;t irritated in the slightest bit.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> but especially someone with sensitive skin that has trouble with other exfoliators.</li>
            <li> I used a regular bath sponge on the other arm and the the soap.</li>
            <li> Not the tile, not the wall, had to stick it to the mirror to let it hang and dry.</li>
            <li> Also came pre-threaded with a string for hanging it to dry and</li>
            <li> I mean SOFT, like little kid again soft.</li>
            <li> Might be a little harsh for those with overly sensitive or dry skin or if you have any irritation already.</li>
            <li> Its like a regular little sponge but with benefits.</li>
            <li> This little jewel is supposed to last 2-3 MONTHS!</li>
            <li> My skin felt crazy smooth and refreshed just from using the sponge.</li>
            <li> I ordered a similar sponge for my wife a few months ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Facial Wash Konjac Sponge everyday for over a month now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been curious about these</li>
            <li> This neat little sponge comes with a suction cup and hook for you to hang it on to dry and for convenience.</li>
            <li> Mine was a dark dark grey and it&#x27;s really hard when it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> My skin is maybe a little smoother, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any other differences from using other products.</li>
            <li> I just have a hard time rinsing all of my facial cleaner out.</li>
            <li> the only negative?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be really sad when I need to replace this little bundle of joy of mine :(</li>
            <li> It came in a tiny little package and was rock hard.</li>
            <li> If you have the odd blackhead around your lip or in any odd place they will disappear in no time.  </li>
            <li> Just a minor complaint and in no way affected the usability of this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just a little sponge, I didn&#x27;t want to get my hopes up and</li>
            <li> I was like a little piece of charcoal.</li>
            <li> I let it soak up water and squeezed it out a little.</li>
            <li> This little Konjac sponge is a keeper!</li>
            <li> it comes in very hard and rough to the touch, but softens if you soak it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I took this out of the package, but following the directions on the box, it does soften up with water.  </li>
            <li> a small suction cup hook was included in the box...</li>
            <li> Its virtually odorless is the 1st thing I noticed when I took it out of its package, along with being hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> Hard</li>
            <li> I adore this small hard working sponge!</li>
            <li> Are you serious?</li>
            <li> I do find it difficult to remember to soak it before I need it sometimes</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I have been telling everyone about this gem!</li>
            <li> I was really shocked.</li>
            <li> Do not expect to get a sponge the size of your hand as you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I cannot get the stupid suction cup to stick in the tile around my bathtub.</li>
            <li> Washcloths just spread all that nasty around.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I ordered a similar sponge for my wife a few months ago. I decided to keep this one for myself. I was pleasantly surprised by this product. It came in a tiny little package and was rock hard. Once it is soaked in warm water, it expands and softens up. It feels awesome on your face and probably helps with exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> I have tried a few Konjac Sponges and absolutely love them so when I got the opportunity to try this one I was thrilled! I love how gentle it is on my sometimes sensitive skin and it feels amazing when you use your favorite cleanser with it! There is no smell to the sponge itself and it&#x27;s very easy to use. For those who have never used a Konjac Sponge these do arrive HARD and at first will have you second guessing the idea of using this sponge but don&#x27;t worry just run it under water and it&#x27;ll expand and be really soft. The fact that it has a string attached to it is another reason why I like it so much so that you can easily hang it up which saves space. This Konjac Sponge actually comes with a suction hanger which I think is absolutely AMAZING! You just suction cup it in your shower for easy access! I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****UPDATE******&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Facial Wash Konjac Sponge everyday for over a month now and I absolutely love this sponge more now then I did the first time I used it. It has been so gentle to my skin even after a months use. It&#x27;s very easy to use still and helps my cleanser get into all the spots that it needs to get into to cleanse my skin. I&#x27;m going to be really sad when I need to replace this little bundle of joy of mine :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> When I first saw this I thought it was going to be hard like a volcanic stone or something but to my relief it was a soft, almost gelatin like sponge.  This thing was really tiny when I first got it and I was unsure if it would be worth a hoot. I soaked it for 5 minutes like recommended and that little cute sponge grew up! It was kind of fun just watching it grow.  Like those bath toys we had a decade or so ago. After the recommended growth time I squeezed out the excess water and just used the sponge to wash my arm. It felt like I was using feathers or silk it was so smooth.  Definitely NOT the volcanic stone I envisioned when I saw the product.  My skin felt crazy smooth and refreshed just from using the sponge. I had not even tried any soaps yet. Just for comparison sake I used a regular bath sponge on the other arm and the the soap. This little Konjac sponge is a keeper! The skin on the test arm was a bazillion percent smoother and softer than the traditional bath sponge arm. I was really shocked. I started out as a doubter and ended up a new frequent customer. the only negative? I cannot get the stupid suction cup to stick in the tile around my bathtub. Not the tile, not the wall, had to stick it to the mirror to let it hang and dry. Just a minor complaint and in no way affected the usability of this product. If you wanted, just cut the string off the sponge and let it dry out on its own dish by your tub - problem solved! Getting some for each of my friends for a &amp;#34;Little But Mighty&amp;#34; gift idea! I received this item at a reduced cost for testing and evaluation purposes. This review is my  unbiased and independent opinion and based entirely on my examination of, and my personal experience with,  this product. My opinion may differ from yours, however I hope that my review helps you decide whether this is the right product for your needs or not.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about this thing. My skin is maybe a little smoother, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any other differences from using other products. And actually, I feel like this mostly spreads oils around on my face rather than removing them. It also takes too long to soften up enough to use.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge,  it doubles in size and is soft.  I will purchase this again</li>
            <li> This is a very cool scrubber I&#x27;ve never felt anything like it before. It gets so soft,but gets into the nooks and crannies of your face. Really nice scrubber.</li>
            <li> I gad high hopes for this item...I have been using it about 2 weeks and don&#x27;t see any benefit or difference from using this or my hands. Will continue using it and hope I get pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I took this out of the package, but following the directions on the box, it does soften up with water.  It works very well.  My skin felt well cleansed and exfoliated after using it, and the suction cup worked fine on my bathroom mirror.  The sponge and suction cup are both small, so they are unobtrusive on a large mirror.</li>
            <li> I can only say I wish I knew about these sooner. My face has never been softer. This Konjac sponge is amazing. I simply use the sponge with water and rub it gently around my face and neck and then rinse. It is a long lasting sponge and something everyone should try. Trust me! You&#x27;ll never be without one again.</li>
            <li> This sponge works great. I use it nightly now. I use to use my hands to wash my face but after using this, my face feels twice as clean. The sponge is soft and does not hurt or scratches your face.</li>
            <li> I started using Konjac sponges several months ago and I love them.  This konjac sponge is a great quality product. This one feels &amp;#34;fluffier&amp;#34; than my last one after you wet it.  It&#x27;s soft yet exfoliates really well at the same time.  I like that it came with its suction cup and hook included.  In my opinion the sponge does as good a job at exfoliating and cleaning as a brush does and you don&#x27;t have to buy batteries or replacement heads. The bamboo charcoal with activated carbon and minerals is terrific at deep cleaning with or without your own cleanser. My skin looks and feels healthy and clean since I switched to the sponge.  The sponge is good for about three months and you can pop it in the microwave every 1-2 weeks for 60 seconds to disinfect it.  I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> This arrives super hard and small, but it puffs up nicely to a smooth soft sponge. It feels great when I use it. Good product!</li>
            <li> I really like this little sponge. It exfoliates without feeling like I&#x27;m taking off my skin.  You have to remember to get it wet when you first get in the shower because it needs a little time to soften up.</li>
            <li> Works great! Nice smooth skin after using with my liquid African black soap foaming cleanser.  It&#x27;s summer, hot, humid and sweaty so this is really nice to get a good clean to remove all of the sweat and grease from the day. Also came pre-threaded with a string for hanging it to dry and a small suction cup hook was included in the box... Bonus!!  Might be a little harsh for those with overly sensitive or dry skin or if you have any irritation already. I look forward to seeing what changes may happen to my skin in the future with continued use. I&#x27;m happy with my purchae</li>
            <li> I got a sponge similar to this for my friends birthday a while ago and she raved about how well it worked and how much she loved it! I&#x27;ve recently started a new face routine with a few new washes and medicationss and I remembered how much my friend liked her charcoal sponge so I got one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just a little sponge, I didn&#x27;t want to get my hopes up and think that all my dreams would come true with this but even after the first day of using this I could feel my heart fluttering with the realization that this may be my miracle product!&lt;br /&gt;My face is looking awesome. This is so good at soaking up impurities and ridding my skin of excess oils and built up gunk from a days work. It really doesn&#x27;t compare to a regular washcloth Shh Kshatriya I was using. Washcloths just spread all that nasty around. The sponge picks it up an risks it away.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a suction cup holder. It&#x27;s really important to hang these up and dry them out, because just like anything else that is porous and gts we, it can mildew. If you leave it in the shower all the humidity can stay in it or if youleavr it on the course the underside ma not dry fully. So I hang mine by my mirror, making sure it&#x27;s not touching anything and I haven&#x27;t had a problem!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to it this and it will be a part of my new daily routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion</li>
            <li> I adore this small hard working sponge! Ive recently started reading a lot about the benefits of charcoal for your skin and jumped at the opportunity to review this at a discount. First and foremost it  arrived on time, attractively packaged and with directions on the back which is always helpful. Its virtually odorless is the 1st thing I noticed when I took it out of its package, along with being hard as a rock. No worries tho, as per the directions  I soaked it in warm water and it expanded &amp; became very soft, yet with enough texture to get in to your pores. After a few uses I can report that my sensitive skin wasn&#x27;t irritated in the slightest bit. It left my skin, even the delicate areas under my eyes feeling soft, smooth and clean. Taking care of it is simple, simple press the water out and hang it to air dry by the attached string and included suction cup to conveniently hang in your shower or bath. You can also put it in a ziploc baggie and store it in your fridge!&lt;br /&gt;The product is supposed to last 2-3 months...what? I am blown away by that and super excited. A beauty product that is natural, actually works and is so cost efficient? Ive met my go to skin care sponge right here! Needless to say, I have been telling everyone about this gem!</li>
            <li> Very unusual looking sponge. Smaller than expected. I received at a reduced price. Would not buy at the full price.</li>
            <li> I have never been someone who enjoys all the soap and face creams that it can take to have your skin clean and smooth. A lot of products break my skin out as well. I&#x27;ve tried charcoal masks before and liked the way that they made my skin feel afterwards. So a sponge with charcoal already in it was a perfect fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box was very small when I opened it, which had me hesitant. However, after expanding in warm water, the sponge was the perfect size for your face. Do not expect to get a sponge the size of your hand as you will be disappointed. To me, it&#x27;s a great size to not have the sponge getting water everywhere you don&#x27;t want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way my face feels after using this sponge. I haven&#x27;t tried with products and honestly, I don&#x27;t know that I will. The sponge is very smooth without anything and leaves my skin very soft after washing with just water.  I had the sponge resting against a mirror and noticed that the side next to the mirror never hardened back up by evening from the morning, so allowing it to hang without touching a surface probably would be best for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing sponge.  love it</li>
            <li> This was an easy transaction. I have been using this for about a month. I really like how my skin feels after washing with this sponge.</li>
            <li> This little sponge is so cool! I have use it both with and without additional cleansers and it seems to work either way much to my astonishment!  After use my skin feels clean and smooth but not abraded. I do find it difficult to remember to soak it before I need it sometimes but that is just a new routine for me that will develop soon. I will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> This little sponge left my face feeling so good. Soft and clean. I like that it can be used either with or without soap because the charcoal draws out the toxins and gunk and cleansers tend to dry my face out causing more breakouts.  When I said it leaves my face soft I mean SOFT, like little kid again soft. I don&#x27;t even feel like i need any moisturizer after using it. Its just the right amount, not greasy or anything.It exfoliates your skin and promotes healthy cell regeneration and is gentle enough for those with rosacea or sensitive skin. They even suggest it for Babies! Each sponge can last up to 6 weeks if you take care of it. Mine was a dark dark grey and it&#x27;s really hard when it&#x27;s dry but it softens with warm water.  I like that this company includes a suction cup mounted hook and there is a string for hanging the sponge so it will dry properly and not get moldy. Its easy to disinfect with either a little apple cider vinegar and water or by placing in boiling water but that will break down the fibers more quickly so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend overdoing it.  Having never used a charcoal sponge I wasn&#x27;t too sure what to expect, I imagined that black chalky residue getting on me and having to rinse it off or something but that&#x27;s not the case at all. There is absolutely nothing like that. Its like a regular little sponge but with benefits. I have switched permanently to these, the benefits of charcoal and of konjac are so impressive you&#x27;ll be glad to try it. I did receive mine at a promotional price for agreeing to post my review about how I felt it works but that in no way affected my opinion. I would recommend this sponge to anyone but especially someone with sensitive skin that has trouble with other exfoliators. I hope you found this information helpful for you.</li>
            <li> I used the sponge wondering what I was doing.  I was like a little piece of charcoal. I put it warm water as the directions said,  It expanded and I was surprised.  I used it and wellllll I works great.  I have a bunch of whiteheads right below bottom lip. They are about gone.  The texture of the sponge totally changes. It comes with suction hook with cup for hang drying.  I am stunned  and amazed at how fast it worked.  I started using on my face every two to three days and I can no tell you how much I am enjoying the results.  If you have the odd blackhead around your lip or in any odd place they will disappear in no time.  I can not rave about this product enough. I received a discount on this product for an honest unbiased opinion.</li>

            <li> I use Konjac sponges every time I wash my face with face wash or a facial scrub. I like how they feel and the results that I get. I was offered a Facial Wash Konjac Sponge from Amaki Skincare for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it. I ordered it immediately and couldn&#x27;t wait to try this one. It arrived before I showered that night so I was able to use it right away. I let it soak up water and squeezed it out a little. Then ii put my face wash on and began to rub it all over my face using circular motions. I got a great lather from the konjac sponge, better than I expected. This Konjac sponge is also slightly bigger when it was fully soaked. I definitely recommend this Konjac Sponge from Amaki Skincare for anyone who uses or wants to use one of these for their face.</li>
            <li> I used this right away, and i have already started to notice my face getting cleaner. it comes in very hard and rough to the touch, but softens if you soak it. you dont even have to use soap, you can if you want but no need. love it!</li>
            <li> % stars? No way! 9 or 10 maybe! This sponge is super amazing! When you open it it is hard as a rock, but when submerged into warm water it becomes a nice sponge. It cleans with or without soap...that&#x27;s right! You can clean your face without soap! This all natural sponge takes out all the impurities from your skin and leaves it clean and fresh. This neat little sponge comes with a suction cup and hook for you to hang it on to dry and for convenience. This little jewel is supposed to last 2-3 MONTHS! Are you serious? How awesome is that?! Talk about economical! How can you beat economical and all natural? I will be buying more when it is time to replace it, I love love love it! I very highly recommend this product! Men and women alike will benefit from this sponge! Try it and you will be hooked!</li>
