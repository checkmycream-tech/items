            <li> That&#x27;s very disappointing when it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;Eau de Parfum&amp;#34; and costs so much.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, never blind-buy fragrances, get samples first.</li>
            <li> If I could I would have the company make a laundry detergent,dryer sheets,&amp; delicate wash to smell like this!!!!!MMMMMMM HEAVEN!!!!!!!</li>

It&#x27;s never over powering so you can never spray to much.I even spray it on my pillows.Its addicting and you will get TONS of compliments.Its never musky or cheap old lady drug store smelling.You will never offend anyone with this pleasant aroma.If I could I would have the company make a laundry detergent,dryer sheets,&amp; delicate wash to smell like this!!!!!MMMMMMM HEAVEN!!!!!!!</li>

            <li> I was highly optimistic about this scent after reading all the positive reviews but was so very disappointed when I received it.  It does not smell clean or fresh- it quite frankly smells like a deodorant feminine hygeine product.  I wish I could smell another bottle to see if I got a bad one, but no one sells it where I live.  Such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> When I get out of the shower I love to smell &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34;.  I use this along with the body wash and lotion afterwards.  And if I am going out later it doesnt Clash with my &amp;#34;going out perfume&amp;#34; that I will use.  I get alot of compliments on how good it smells.</li>
