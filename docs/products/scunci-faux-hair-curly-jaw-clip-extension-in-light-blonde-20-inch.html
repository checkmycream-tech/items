            <li> I thought a ponytail extension might be way to thin, but it had a LOT of volume :).</li>
            <li> The pale blonde streaks are  nice the other color a super dull drab dirty ash blonde that is not seen on real people yhat I have ever seen.  </li>
            <li> (it goes down to my midback), the colour is very pretty, and it&#x27;s THICK.</li>

            <li> I plan on wearing this once the weather cools down</li>
            <li> so mine stuck out from my head a little bit exposing the clip.</li>
            <li> a little tricky.</li>
            <li> WHAT HEAVY BUT</li>
            <li> I didnt use it once, since it looks fake.</li>

            <li> I was so excited to try this but it just doesnt look natural. I didnt use it once, since it looks fake. It came in fast and it looked ok, just it just far away from looking natural.</li>
            <li> I plan on wearing this once the weather cools down it&#x27;s too hot to wear any fake hair it just makes me even hotter</li>
            <li> I always buy these ponytails  one of them was ratty &amp; used I want you to send me a me a new one</li>
            <li> I bought this for a halloween costume and it worked perfectly.  It&#x27;s a great length, is really full, and truly looked nice.  My only complaint is that, for me, the clip was way too big.  I ended up removing the clip and bobby pinning it on.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stay in hair!! It was very aggravating trying to get it to stay in. I should have returned it.</li>
            <li> I love my Scunci Faux Hair, it is so natural looking and I get millions of complements every day. I feel younger with my hair in a ponytail and it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> The match is perfect it looks so real always loved this faux hair they use to sell it in Walgreens so convenient now they only sell it in the black .........why ?</li>
            <li> Even my hairdresser was impressed when i took it to her to shorten a bit. I bought a couple of them!</li>
            <li> Color is wrong. It get&#x27;s ratty and looks very cheap. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> do not get Faux hair extensions! there horrible and look fake, i had dirty looks everywhere!</li>
            <li> THE HAIR LOOKS LIKE DOLL HAIR AND DOESNT LOOK GOOD. I WILL SAY HOWEVER THAT THIS COMPANY WAS VERY UNDERSTANDING AND WAS EXCELLENT IN THEIR RETURN POLICY.</li>
            <li> Scunci Faux Hair Curly Jaw Clip Extension In Light Blonde, 20-Inch  Its BLONDE , Full of curls and so CUTE !!! Fast shipper... Was worth the money...</li>
            <li> perfect!  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> this thing has a Barbie doll type hair. it feels so fake and looks so fake. not worth it. I returned it immediately</li>
            <li> Eeeeee! I love this so much! It&#x27;s REALLY long, so much more so than I expected (it goes down to my midback), the colour is very pretty, and it&#x27;s THICK. I thought a ponytail extension might be way to thin, but it had a LOT of volume :). 10/10 would recommend.</li>
            <li> I LOOOOve these clips they are so easy to use, my only thing is that if u u use them a lot they tend to wear out pretty quick they don&#x27;t maintain the luster shiny look and u gotta carefully brush them I recommend using spray olive oil or coconut oil. But yeah, I like em I buy them every couple of months or so! I like using two for a pretty long hair ponytails effect..</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT AND WILL ORDER MORE.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT OTHER STYLES YOU HAVE MY DAUGHTER WOULD LIKE TO ORDER ONE.</li>
            <li> Really nice but you need to have very ash blonde hair.  The pale blonde streaks are  nice the other color a super dull drab dirty ash blonde that is not seen on real people yhat I have ever seen.  If your hair is really blonde youvciuld get away with it possible.  Only 2 color choices lost money I opened it .  At least it cheap.  Should say light ASH blond!!!!!!  The claw clip is great.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old desperately wants long hair.  She &amp; I have both been really happy with this item for the price.  She was forever buying the headband style ones from the dollar stores, but they would tangle within minutes of putting them on - and she could never wear them a second time.  We&#x27;ve had this for a while now, and she&#x27;s worn it at least 10 times and it still looks great!</li>
            <li> its doesnt match my hair color and the hair looks fake</li>
            <li> this attaches to your head with a clip. the clip is pretty enormous so it will go over a fairly large bun but i have long hair so mine stuck out from my head a little bit exposing the clip. a little tricky. i bought it for a barbie halloween costume and it was fine bc i just put a scrunchy around the clip and it covered it well. the hair looks real and its very pretty</li>
            <li> My Friends &amp; I used to get these at all the big RX places,I always bought 2 cause sometimes they were sold out.Then the \\&quot;Marts\\&quot; stopped selling the blonde ones.Eventually,the \\&quot;Cvgreens\\&quot; stopped selling the blondes too.THANKS AMAZON! I told my blonde &amp;brunette Friends &amp; where to get them &amp;cheaper too! FEARFULLY,When I need them,word will have gotten out &amp; I won&#x27;t be able to get them anymore.We all know they are the best brand of this product for any price!TYVM AMAZON!You have saved me for the time being from rain,fog,&amp;dirty. hair days.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY what we needed for the dance recital!  Easy and really nice!</li>
            <li> Waaaaaaay more blonde than it looks!</li>
            <li> ALITTLE LIGHTER THAN WHAT I WANTED BUT IS VERY PRETTY AND SOME WHAT HEAVY BUT A QUICK DO ANYTIME IS GREAT WILL BE BUYING MORE BUT A LITTLE SHORTER  NEXT TIME</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift and she looked great!</li>
