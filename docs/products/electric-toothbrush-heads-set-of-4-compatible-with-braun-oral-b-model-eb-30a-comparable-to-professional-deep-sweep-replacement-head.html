    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s soothing to use these heads. I have never felt any irritation whilst brushing. These heads last a long time and barely show wear. I suggest using these heads as you will enjoy your experience with them.</li>
            <li> I actually just left the dentist and she told me I had beautiful teeth and was quite surprised when I told her I haven&#x27;t had my teeth professionally cleaned in over 10 years. I attribute that to this brush,it&#x27;s the only thing I use to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> The bristle action is very effective. The disadvantage for me was the larger size of the brush, compared to other brands.  It was uncomfortable while brushing my back teeth.</li>
            <li> High quality generic toothbrush heads for our Oral B toothbrushes. Cheaper ones lose bristles or pinch the cheeks. These are great. Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Replacement brush heads, will fit certain Oral- B models. My oral b has the circular head, but I though let&#x27;s give it a try. It fits and works great. The brush head is larger than I&#x27;m used to, but I do feel like it&#x27;s doing a great job. The fine light blue bristles at the tip, get the gums nice and clean. Each brush head has a color coded ring on the bottom, so you won&#x27;t be sharing the same tip with anyone. Of these will fit your electric toothbrush, I highly recommend them. The name brand replacement toothbrush heads cost a fortune. This is a great alternative.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. Opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Works great. Perfect fit.</li>
            <li> These worked very well overall. It did fit on my oral b but its not exactly a perfect fit. It takes some effort to take it off and on which wouldn&#x27;t be a real disadvantage to someone who is using this themselves, but I have 4 people that use the same toothbrush and just interchange the  head .  The bristles seem of good quality, a little softer than the manufacturer&#x27;s version but that is not necessarily a bad thing, jut a matter of personal preference.  For the price currently listed on amazon these are definitely worth getting over the name brand heads.  Received limited time promotional discount for honest / unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Did not fit well on my Oral B</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these didn&#x27;t fit my Sharp brush, but as the seller didn&#x27;t claim they do, I can&#x27;t really hold that against them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are of a medium stiffness, which works well for me.  Overall I think these are pretty good quality and work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for a discounted price in return for an honest review.  All opinions expressed are my own, and not biased by this fact.</li>
            <li> It said that it would fit Oral B....but doesn&#x27;t fit correctly. The brush doesn&#x27;t go all the way down onto the brush holder. If you force it somewhat it does go all the way down...but you have to pry it off. Misleading product information. Works OK so far...</li>
            <li> Love these!!  Thank you very much!!</li>
            <li> Great Quality.  Arrived on time, works perfect! Great to have it shipped to the house, I don&#x27;t like shopping in crowds.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the quality and won&#x27;t know for awhile.  Thanks for asking.</li>
            <li> I was running low on my toothbrush heads. Now instead of having just one on backup I have 4. I love that they work on more than one type of electric toothbrush. The price is perfect for the quality. Which is pretty great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my house we change brushes every time a person is sick or every 6 months which ever comes first. So we go through a lot throughout the year. I will definitely be purchasing more to add to my stockpile.</li>
            <li> Works great! I bought these for my wife and so far so good! No issues and very durable heads!</li>
            <li> Product is as described. Fits my oral B toothbrush. Love it, and a great deal!</li>
            <li> My teeth where in really bad condition according to my dentist and she recommend me this product because I can put it on any Oral B Model I want and use it. I loved it because they were disposable and they cleaned my teeth very well. I constantly use them and they never wear out its like amazing how good of product this is. It comes with a set of 4 which will last you a very long time. They are made from very good quality. I recommend this to everyone who brushes their teeth a lot and would like to give this a try. you won&#x27;t regret it honestly.</li>
            <li> The product looked remarkably like the manufacturer&#x27;s brush head, but the bristles looked less refined than the original equipment.  I put one on my toothbrush; it went on with a bit of difficulty.  I tried brushing with it and was not quite satisfied.  When I tried to take it off my powerhead, it broke into three pieces -- the main body of the brush head, a piece of innards that came off separately, and the part that was stuck on my toothbrush.  Fortunately I was able to pry that piece off with a screw driver and pliers.  It seems like a piece of junk.  Not worth going to the post office to return it.</li>
            <li> I Love these!!!  What a FANTASTIC price!  The best part, they fit multiple brushes, which works for my household.  I have 2 grad daughters and a son that all need refills on their toothbrushes.  To got to the grocery store and buy them would cost me much more than what I paid here!</li>
            <li> They fit my Braun Oral B, and stay on just fine! But, they certainly aren&#x27;t the same quality as the original brand. They are kind of like soft toothbrush heads (which is not a bad thing...its good for your gums), but I don&#x27;t anticipate them holding up as well as the other ones.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrush heads, i recently had a wisdom tooth removed and needed a replacement for my old toothbrush head. These toothbrush heads are really soft but yet do the job! The price is also fantastic for the value you get out of the four toothbrush heads. These toothbrush heads have gentle bristles but have no trouble getting out plaque and leftover food. I will defiantly re purchase this item once i run out. 5/5!</li>
            <li> Is a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;The product has to inform good friends</li>
