            <li>As a professional stylist, I&#x27;ve always try to use the best product for the job.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman tweezers are by far the best I&#x27;ve used over the years.</li>
            <li>Love these tweezers!&lt;br /&gt;These are very easy to use and precise!&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are great and real quality!  </li>
            <li>nothing short of the best tweezer out today</li>
            <li>A great set at a fair price because they last for years and years!</li>
            <li>I like how you can choose the case color, as it makes it cute.</li>
            <li>so I finally invested and just perfect!</li>
            <li>These are okay.  </li>
            <li>The most valuable part is the nifty case.  </li>
            <li>Love the pointed tip and the accuracy that they have in getting even the smallest hair.  </li>

            <li>plan to buy more.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t recommend it more.</li>
            <li>Perfect tweezers - love having two pair options, and the case keeps them sharp and aligned.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this item for a friend and they loved it so much I had to get one for myself!</li>
            <li>Love this little set perfect for purse or traveling..  </li>
            <li>really would not recommend this set or buy it again as cute and practical as it seems because its nice and organized in the pouch.</li>
            <li>These are the best tweesers available, hands down.</li>
            <li>Leather case keeps them in place, clean and easy to find..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d question the person who would discontinue such a great lil&#x27; set of tweezers.</li>
            <li>Two different sizes in one great case.  </li>
            <li>If you drop them, even one time, then can dent and nick at the tips and the edge which can ruin that wonderful seamless edge that makes them such fabulous tweezers for finer hairs.  </li>
            <li>Only tweezers I will buy are Tweezerman, they are precise, work right and have a great variety.  </li>
            <li>purple case is not as bright as the one in the picture but that didn&#x27;t really bother me but just an fyi for any one that is particular about their color choices..:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect for the hard to grab hairs.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the full size version.  </li>
            <li>I recently tried the tweezers and love how easy it is to pluck your eyebrows!  </li>
            <li>Love these handy, small, very precise, tweezers.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, exactingly machined and sharpened and with a very fine point, these are the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used for splinters and general first aid.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I was debating between several styles and am very pleased with these.</li>
            <li>I dropped my first pair several times and even though my husband filed the ends for me, they were never quite as good as when they were brand new.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>These are the best tweezers and if I don&#x27;t loose the, they should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.  </li>
            <li>But these are worth every penny I paid for them.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them for long, but they&#x27;re really good so far, and the case makes transport really easy.</li>
            <li>Must use with care, steady hands üëê!!</li>
            <li>Same Tweezerman quality I&#x27;ve come to know, only in a perfect size for my smaller hands.</li>
            <li>First tweezerman that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>Once you use them you won&#x27;t be able to go back to others.  </li>
            <li>(if you don&#x27;t have Amazon Prime definitely invest in the 79$ deal per year totally worth it!!)</li>
            <li>This set is a much more affordable alternative to getting the larger individual ones and easy to keep together and put away.</li>
            <li>the flat works well for normal trimming and the point tip is great for getting the tiny hair.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes in a little case and the price was just right!</li>
            <li>I have a few &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; hairs on my face (one between my eyes and one below my bottom lip) that I was FINALLY able to remove after I received these tweezers!</li>
            <li>but I expected these to work better.</li>
            <li>They just don&#x27;t seem to grasp very well.</li>
            <li>so it was sealed and very well protected (even from any dust particles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this set.</li>
            <li>Neither tweezer is nearly as sharp as I thought they would be, now I need to purchase More.</li>
            <li>think the tweezers are way too sharp at the edges and that is why many of my hair also just cut while trying to pull it</li>
            <li>The smaller pair is easier on the wallet and super convenient.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like it magically finds the hair every time and grips tightly without ever breaking the hair.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>set travels well due to its slightly smaller size and the nice case.  </li>
            <li>This is my second pair of Tweezerman tweezers and I love them except for one little problem.  </li>
            <li>The metal at the tips is quite soft.  </li>
            <li>The round point is very useful.</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m purchasing new ones, is my daughter borrowed mine, and you know how that is!</li>
            <li>(in fact it&#x27;s easier to stow away and conceal) and they grip like no other tweezers I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better, I&#x27;ve had worse.</li>
            <li>None of them work well, the splinter works better, Recommend to bay the full size pricey one because this short cut is as bad as one from Walmart.</li>
            <li>Expensive, but pretty worth it.</li>

            <li> Expensive, but pretty worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually leather &amp; normal size tweezers can fit in it for future use when these little things inevitably fail.</li>
            <li> wished I had just bought the regular slanted  tweezer, did not really need these versions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came in a clear hard case plastic cover</li>
            <li> Only thing is that if you are not used to using this type of tweesers, be very careful!!</li>
            <li> They are too sharp to use for eyebrows, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I got them sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> I would not purchase any other brand of tweesers.</li>
            <li> problem was the tweezers actually and it might just be that my skin is way too sensitive and my hair is brittle but unfortunately it just did not work well for me at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have already dropped the regular tweezers once (call me clumsy) and they ended up with a nick on one end.</li>
            <li> They are extremely sharp!</li>
            <li> One is a really small point, the other somewhat wider.  </li>
            <li> I bought this set because I wanted to change my existing set in my little purse that I always keep in my handbag</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Tweezerman and they have not let me down!</li>
            <li> Sephora discontinued selling this, I&#x27;m assuming that it&#x27;s to sway people into buying two separate tweezers which is 2x&#x27;s the $ or to direct people to buy their store-brand tweezers, which are just as expensive</li>
            <li> and as we all already know plucking your eyebrows is painful to begin with; on top of that having to do it over and over again was not only frustrating and time consuming but painful</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for tweezers, then look no more because these are the ones for you!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> nothing short of the best tweezer out today</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> I prefer the full size version.  I should have paid more attention the the mediocre reviews on this product.  Will keep for travel.</li>
            <li> I love Tweezerman Tweezers and this is the perfect set! I love that it comes in a little case and the price was just right!</li>
            <li> Love these tweezers!&lt;br /&gt;These are very easy to use and precise!&lt;br /&gt;These are the only brand I buy now. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, exactly as described. I would highly recommend this to anyone. Tweezerman honors all their products and happily keeps your items in perfect condition. The recipient of this gift was thrilled!</li>
            <li> This is my second set of these.  I have had my own set at the house that my daughter and I have shared for three years.  She left for the dorm this year, so I bought her a set with the leather case in her school color.  She loves them! A great set at a fair price because they last for years and years!</li>
            <li> They work great! I&#x27;ve always used Tweezerman and they have not let me down! I like how you can choose the case color, as it makes it cute. If you&#x27;re looking for tweezers, then look no more because these are the ones for you!</li>
            <li> I like these tweezers for splinters and getting the occasional tick off.  They are too sharp to use for eyebrows, in my opinion.  I grab the hair and it cuts it before I can pull it out.</li>
            <li> Not as impressed with these as my original tweezermans.</li>
            <li> Always been a tweeterman fan!</li>
            <li> These are great quality!</li>
            <li> I just absolutely love this tweezerman products! My dad has used this product forever so I finally invested and just perfect!</li>
            <li> Love these tweezers and the carrying case! I got them sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> These are okay.  I&#x27;ve had better, I&#x27;ve had worse. The most valuable part is the nifty case.  It&#x27;s actually leather &amp; normal size tweezers can fit in it for future use when these little things inevitably fail.</li>
            <li> Neither tweezer is nearly as sharp as I thought they would be, now I need to purchase More. Will not buy again</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers I have found!  Love the pointed tip and the accuracy that they have in getting even the smallest hair.  However, beware of putting the tweezers in the case if you lose the rubber tip that comes with it for protection.  I have ruined two pairs of the taller tweezer after putting it back in the case after I lost the rubber tip.  The point hit the leather case and bent both times.  I will be leaving the tweezers in a draw third time around rather than putting them in the case.  Unless you have the protective rubber tips.</li>
            <li> Love these handy, small, very precise, tweezers. The case is nice, however, Im not found of the color, but purple was all they offered. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Great tweezers! I freaked out once when I thought I lost them because these are amazing with the best grip. It doesn&#x27;t affect me at all that they are mini (in fact it&#x27;s easier to stow away and conceal) and they grip like no other tweezers I&#x27;ve used before. The smaller pair is easier on the wallet and super convenient.</li>
            <li> Love this set! Great deal and shipping was fast</li>
            <li> Perfect tweezers - love having two pair options, and the case keeps them sharp and aligned. Great for home and travel. I was debating between several styles and am very pleased with these.</li>
            <li> This is my second pair of Tweezerman tweezers and I love them except for one little problem.  The metal at the tips is quite soft.  If you drop them, even one time, then can dent and nick at the tips and the edge which can ruin that wonderful seamless edge that makes them such fabulous tweezers for finer hairs.  I dropped my first pair several times and even though my husband filed the ends for me, they were never quite as good as when they were brand new.&lt;br /&gt;This set travels well due to its slightly smaller size and the nice case.  They are a bit more difficult to use because of the smaller size though.  I have already dropped the regular tweezers once (call me clumsy) and they ended up with a nick on one end.</li>
            <li> wished I had just bought the regular slanted  tweezer, did not really need these versions.</li>
            <li> Everything was according to my expectations.</li>
            <li> Only tweezers I will buy are Tweezerman, they are precise, work right and have a great variety.  Love this little set perfect for purse or traveling..  plan to buy more.Leather case keeps them in place, clean and easy to find..</li>
            <li> Really great tweezers! Expensive, but pretty worth it. I haven&#x27;t used them for long, but they&#x27;re really good so far, and the case makes transport really easy.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the hard to grab hairs.  Best tweezers around.  Worth the price.  Like the case and tips.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this item for a friend and they loved it so much I had to get one for myself! Tweezerman products are AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Same Tweezerman quality I&#x27;ve come to know, only in a perfect size for my smaller hands. The case is great also, makes them easy to organize and keeps the tweezer tips undamaged.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, exactingly machined and sharpened and with a very fine point, these are the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used for splinters and general first aid.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers and if I don&#x27;t loose the, they should last a lifetime. The round point is very useful.</li>
            <li> Have used one of the Tweezerman mini tweezers and wanted one of these sets.  They work great and the price was the best around,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d question the person who would discontinue such a great lil&#x27; set of tweezers. Sephora discontinued selling this, I&#x27;m assuming that it&#x27;s to sway people into buying two separate tweezers which is 2x&#x27;s the $ or to direct people to buy their store-brand tweezers, which are just as expensive I believe.  This set is a much more affordable alternative to getting the larger individual ones and easy to keep together and put away.</li>
            <li> As a professional stylist, I&#x27;ve always try to use the best product for the job. Tweezerman tweezers are by far the best I&#x27;ve used over the years. The only reason I&#x27;m purchasing new ones, is my daughter borrowed mine, and you know how that is!</li>
            <li> Maybe it was operator error but I expected these to work better. They just don&#x27;t seem to grasp very well.</li>
            <li> Love it! Two different sizes in one great case.  One is a really small point, the other somewhat wider.  Both, just what I needed. I&#x27;ve been traveling all over with these!</li>
            <li> First tweezerman that I don&#x27;t like. None of them work well, the splinter works better, Recommend to bay the full size pricey one because this short cut is as bad as one from Walmart.</li>
            <li> I bought this set because I wanted to change my existing set in my little purse that I always keep in my handbag and it look like the best choice compared to what else I found on Amazon at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it promptly (if you don&#x27;t have Amazon Prime definitely invest in the 79$ deal per year totally worth it!!) within 2 days and of course packing and all was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in a clear hard case plastic cover so it was sealed and very well protected (even from any dust particles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purple case is not as bright as the one in the picture but that didn&#x27;t really bother me but just an fyi for any one that is particular about their color choices..:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem was the tweezers actually and it might just be that my skin is way too sensitive and my hair is brittle but unfortunately it just did not work well for me at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to try and pull out a hair from my eye brow multiple times and as we all already know plucking your eyebrows is painful to begin with; on top of that having to do it over and over again was not only frustrating and time consuming but painful and my skin was just all red from the rubbing and pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the tweezers are way too sharp at the edges and that is why many of my hair also just cut while trying to pull it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really would not recommend this set or buy it again as cute and practical as it seems because its nice and organized in the pouch.</li>
            <li> These are the best!  I have a few &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; hairs on my face (one between my eyes and one below my bottom lip) that I was FINALLY able to remove after I received these tweezers!</li>
            <li> These are the best tweesers available, hands down. Nothing compares to these. Only thing is that if you are not used to using this type of tweesers, be very careful!! They are extremely sharp! Must use with care, steady hands üëê!! Keep away from children. But these are worth every penny I paid for them. I would not purchase any other brand of tweesers. They make awesome scissors for grooming of eyebrows, etc..</li>
            <li> Once you use them you won&#x27;t be able to go back to others.  It&#x27;s like it magically finds the hair every time and grips tightly without ever breaking the hair.  Can&#x27;t recommend it more.</li>
            <li> I really like this set. the flat works well for normal trimming and the point tip is great for getting the tiny hair.</li>
            <li> I recently tried the tweezers and love how easy it is to pluck your eyebrows!  They are great and real quality!  Kudos</li>
