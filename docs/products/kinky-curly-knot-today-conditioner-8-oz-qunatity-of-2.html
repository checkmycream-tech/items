            <li>but I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love knot today leave in condition.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes the curls, adds a healthy volume look to the hair, and it helps in detaining my curly hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a solo leave-in this isn&#x27;t that great, but it&#x27;s a good foundation for other products.</li>
            <li>After some googleing I came across this product - all of the reviews are true!</li>
            <li>The smell is light and marshmellowy.  </li>
            <li>Since we have been continually using this conditioner, her hair has improved significantly.</li>
            <li>This product does not run when I sweat when working out at the gym, nor does this product build up quickly in my hair.</li>
            <li>But it makes your hair so smooth and much easier to comb through.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells fantastic and my hair LOVES it so much.  </li>
            <li>I have tried dozens of products for my daughter&#x27;s very fine, very curly hair and very sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>once I figured out the right portion size of product I needed for my hair</li>

            <li>It this hot summer.  </li>
            <li>You can mix it with water to make the product last even longer -- plus it helps your hair absorb the product better.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate that it does not leak out of my hair in hot weather or when sweating.  </li>
            <li>All you out there with curly hair know it&#x27;s very difficult to find a good quality conditioner for a fair price that works.  </li>
            <li>When I get out of the shower, I follow it up with my &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 Leave-in Miracle Plus KeratinSpray&amp;#34; Very easy to comb through (with a wide tooth comb).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been experimenting with how long i could go between shampooing, and my hair started to dread if i go more than a 8 or 9 days.  </li>
            <li>I wet my hair in the morning, put about a quarter size amount in the palm of my hand, rub it together and smooth it into my hair paying special attention to my ends.</li>
            <li>I have fine coarse wiry curls.</li>
            <li>In my attempt to find the best product for my natural hair type, I have tried just about every African American hair care product for natural hair on the market to include Eco Styler gel which dries my hair out, as well as Shea moisture curl enhancing products, and various others.</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing this conditioner for my daughter who has very curly hair for almost a year now.  </li>
            <li>They told me they really like this product.</li>
            <li>The custard not so much.  </li>
            <li>i use it so much.  </li>
            <li>still haven&#x27;t kept it for more than 2 days but on the second day the elastic didn&#x27;t ruin the curls as it used to, and this made my second day hair very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have kinky 4c hair, makes my hair soft!</li>
            <li>I love that it is natural ingredients, and contains very little ingredients.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to it a couple weeks ago by one of my coworkers because I have natural hair.</li>
            <li>Every natural woman should try.</li>
            <li>staple...love it...closes to all natural ingredients</li>
            <li>In fact the whole Kinky-Curly line is the only product line I have found that enhances my TWA curls.</li>
            <li>I only  wish they made a larger size at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for a friend who is transitioning back to her natural hair.  </li>

            <li> I also will mix this product with a little bit of  natural oils such as castor, coconut, olive, almond, avocado or jojoba oils and this conditions and seals my ends at the same time.</li>
            <li> I use Jessicurl creamy shampoo and only dry it with a t- shirt!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other leave-ins and this is the only one I kept coming back to and eventually stuck with.</li>
            <li> I use the curly girl approach type 3B, long coils if i use KinkyCurly frizz if i don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> I use it on my ends and from the middle of my hair down...</li>
            <li> Her hair was so dry that it would become matted with absolutely no effort at all.  </li>
            <li> My hair is coarse with tight curls what I used to call \\&quot;Nappy...</li>
            <li> But I wet my hair, slap the conditioner in, and go about my day.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I used it as part of Kimmaytube&#x27;s leave in, but my 4c/4z hair would still be a little dry when following her recipe to a T.</li>
            <li> The next day (or whenever my thick hair decides to dry all the way)</li>
            <li> but my hair stilled looked dry with little to no curl definition.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair typically</li>
            <li> I mix it with Jamaican Black Castor Oil, Jojoba Oil  and aloe vera to moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li> : adds volume so if u already have a very thick hair it might turn humongous on the second day, and as it adds volume and curls so it makes the hair look a lot shorter.</li>
            <li> Knot today is one of those few.  </li>
            <li> Tried the ecostyler gel but it dried out my hair a lot and made it hard and it flaked).</li>
            <li> When I sleep on my curly hair, I usually wake up with tangles..</li>
            <li> There are very few conditioners that I can use in my hair that keep it moist all day.  </li>
            <li> My daughter’s hair became extremely dry after our failed attempt at straightening via a keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li> bad</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have tried dozens of products for my daughter&#x27;s very fine, very curly hair and very sensitive scalp. So far this is the best.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to it a couple weeks ago by one of my coworkers because I have natural hair. I was trying to figure out what was I going to do w/It this hot summer.  With the combination of the kinky curly custard this is a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this conditioner for my daughter who has very curly hair for almost a year now.  All you out there with curly hair know it&#x27;s very difficult to find a good quality conditioner for a fair price that works.  This conditioner defiantly fits the bill.  My daughter’s hair became extremely dry after our failed attempt at straightening via a keratin treatment.  Her hair was so dry that it would become matted with absolutely no effort at all.  Since we have been continually using this conditioner, her hair has improved significantly.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff. I have been using it for a year now and I love it. I love that it is natural ingredients, and contains very little ingredients. I am a white girl with blonde beach waves and kinks. When I sleep on my curly hair, I usually wake up with tangles..I wash my hair typically every 2-3 days...I wish I found this stuff when I was younger!! It is so great. I use it on my ends and from the middle of my hair down...I don&#x27;t really put it up around the frame of my face or scalp--unless if I am really tangled up!! But it makes your hair so smooth and much easier to comb through. If you have curly hair, you should strongly consider this product!! When I get out of the shower, I follow it up with my &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 Leave-in Miracle Plus KeratinSpray&amp;#34; Very easy to comb through (with a wide tooth comb). Before this product, I would spend 15 minutes combing my curls..now it is sometimes 2-7 minutes depending...IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Every natural woman should try. Comb slides thru like silk.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a friend who is transitioning back to her natural hair.  She was constantly complaining that she could not comb her hair.  After some googleing I came across this product - all of the reviews are true! She loves it and no longer dreads combing her hair.</li>
            <li> This product is my go to styler, detangler and leave in conditioner.  It&#x27;s smells fantastic and my hair LOVES it so much.  I will use this for life!!!</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter both LOVE this product. They have two different types of hair (wife is black and daughter is bi-racial) and it works great for both of their hair!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I mix it with Jamaican Black Castor Oil, Jojoba Oil  and aloe vera to moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li> Ordered this item as stocking stuffers for my daughters.  They told me they really like this product. I&#x27;ve seen them using it all the time.</li>
            <li> I use the curly girl approach type 3B, long coils if i use KinkyCurly frizz if i don&#x27;t.  I use it for leave in conditioner and also instead of shampoo.  I&#x27;ve been experimenting with how long i could go between shampooing, and my hair started to dread if i go more than a 8 or 9 days.  I use Jessicurl creamy shampoo and only dry it with a t- shirt!  Who knew?</li>
            <li> staple...love it...closes to all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie. In my attempt to find the best product for my natural hair type, I have tried just about every African American hair care product for natural hair on the market to include Eco Styler gel which dries my hair out, as well as Shea moisture curl enhancing products, and various others. I keep coming back to Kinky-Curly Knot Today leave-in conditioner because it does not make my hair feel greasy. My hair feels moisturized all day long. This product does not run when I sweat when working out at the gym, nor does this product build up quickly in my hair. I wet my hair in the morning, put about a quarter size amount in the palm of my hand, rub it together and smooth it into my hair paying special attention to my ends. I comb or bush my hair into a desired style, or leave it curly, and I am good to go! Excellent product that works for my hair type. I only  wish they made a larger size at a reasonable price. I also will mix this product with a little bit of  natural oils such as castor, coconut, olive, almond, avocado or jojoba oils and this conditions and seals my ends at the same time.</li>
            <li> This product delivers! It works well by itself with your favorite oil! It gave me a blown out look w/o the heat! I have kinky 4c hair, makes my hair soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other leave-ins and this is the only one I kept coming back to and eventually stuck with. Previously, I used it as part of Kimmaytube&#x27;s leave in, but my 4c/4z hair would still be a little dry when following her recipe to a T. I&#x27;ve switched it up a bit by using the Knot Today, Vegetable Glycerin, grapeseed and jojoba oil. My hair has never felt better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a solo leave-in this isn&#x27;t that great, but it&#x27;s a good foundation for other products.</li>
            <li> this is my go-to product. I have fine coarse wiry curls. This product is moisturizing and helps define curls. It helps detangle and soften hair too</li>
            <li> One of the best conditioners I own for my natural hair.  You can mix it with water to make the product last even longer -- plus it helps your hair absorb the product better.  Win-win!  If you make a moisture spritz for your hair, mix this with water and some drops of essential oils. The smell is light and marshmellowy.  Some people don&#x27;t care for that but I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love knot today leave in condition. In fact the whole Kinky-Curly line is the only product line I have found that enhances my TWA curls. (I&#x27;ve tried Miss Jessie&#x27;s, Jane Carter and Shae Moisture they are cream based products that do nothing for my hair...I could feel the greasiness of the product on my hair but my hair stilled looked dry with little to no curl definition. Tried the ecostyler gel but it dried out my hair a lot and made it hard and it flaked). My hair is coarse with tight curls what I used to call \\&quot;Nappy...bad hair\\&quot;....once I figured out the right portion size of product I needed for my hair I have been eating up the compliments....now I say I have good hair!</li>
            <li> Great leave-in conditioner!</li>
            <li> There are very few conditioners that I can use in my hair that keep it moist all day.  Knot today is one of those few.  I&lt;br /&gt;use the shampoo too.  The custard not so much.  But I wet my hair, slap the conditioner in, and go about my day.  I buy this stuff in 2 and 3 packs b/c i use it so much.  I appreciate that it does not leak out of my hair in hot weather or when sweating.  My fave style technique is to wash my hair, leave damp...put in a generous amt of conditioner, but in 4-6 big braids in my hair. The next day (or whenever my thick hair decides to dry all the way) i take out the braids and have an awesome curly look.</li>
            <li> This is actually by my wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair type is 2b and it&#x27;s perfect for me. It moisturizes the curls, adds a healthy volume look to the hair, and it helps in detaining my curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly it also worked as a protecting element when I went swimming.&lt;br /&gt;I still haven&#x27;t kept it for more than 2 days but on the second day the elastic didn&#x27;t ruin the curls as it used to, and this made my second day hair very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Acts as a moisturizer and curls definer, detangler, protector and it&#x27;s not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: adds volume so if u already have a very thick hair it might turn humongous on the second day, and as it adds volume and curls so it makes the hair look a lot shorter.</li>
