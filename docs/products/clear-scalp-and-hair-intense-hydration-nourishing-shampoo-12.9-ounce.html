            <li>It feels great to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both ways weren&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy, smells wonderful, lathers well, rinses clean, and does a good job of cleaning my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a  nice shampoo with a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>I use it every day and my hair feels so healthy I don&#x27;t even use conditioner anymore!</li>
            <li>If it does well here, it should be even better with softer water (and nicer hair!).</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>My husband tried it and he also liked it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells nice without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling nice.</li>
            <li>use this in conjunction with a suave conditioner (Morrocan Infusion) and the two work really nicely together, leaving my  hair</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s nice is the complementary conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It smells good, leaves my scalp clean, and gives my hair a narural shine.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant clean scent, lathers nicely, rinses beautifully, and leaves my hair soft and shiny, even on those day I skip the conditioner.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it was a drizzly, dreary day, and even after being out in the rain a couple of times, my hair still looked great.  </li>
            <li>love, love, LOVE this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely in love.</li>
            <li>no matter how thoroughly I scrub the shampoo into my scalp, repeating did a better job than just doing it once.</li>
            <li>This one does moisture my hair more than the frizz control one</li>
            <li>I also need to experiment with the appropriate after shampoo leave in creme.  </li>
            <li>The combination of the shampoo and conditioner is magical.  </li>
            <li>I have experimented with more of them than I can count.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and leaves my hair looking and feeling fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- LOVE the scent.</li>
            <li>This shampoo was good for a thorough clean on both scalp and hair, and unlike the conditioner version, I didn&#x27;t have to use too much of it to get a good lather.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very clean and fruity</li>
            <li>and I have to admit that it is pretty much as good as the &amp;#34;Washee&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>However, at the time of this review, Walmart has it available for $4.98, so you can do a bit better on the pricing if you shop around.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell, first of all.. not overpowering, just fresh.</li>
            <li>, I think this shampoo could be fantastic for those with genuinely damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I have been trying Clear&#x27;s conditioners, and they&#x27;ve been really good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This smells very pleasant and doesn&#x27;t leave a strong perfumey scent behind (which is very important to me as strong scents make me sneeze).</li>
            <li>I could tell that this had a significant effect on the texture of my hair because it was softer after a combination of both the shampoo and conditioner than just the conditioner alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the third Clear shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, and it&#x27;s the best of the bunch.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m fairly sure I&#x27;ve tried just about every store brand shampoo and conditioner at one time or another, as well as several of the pricier salon brands (when I could afford to), and while I&#x27;ve found a few that I liked, I haven&#x27;t, until now, found that perfect combination that worked exactly as I wanted it to on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are several ingredients that are good not just for your scalp, but for your hair, as well (coconut oil, for example).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells nice but not overpowering and the end result was soft, manageable hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to switch completely from my old brand to this one.</li>
            <li>It comes out thick and creamy, makes good suds and smells nice without being overly scented--</li>
            <li>For the VERY FIRST time, my dandruff is GONE.  </li>
            <li>If given a choice, I still prefer to use higher end products like Biolage, but I keep coming back to Clear as it is a great product that can be easily found in stores.</li>
            <li>I love just about everything that The Clear line puts out and this shampoo is not exception!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It lathers nicely, even with a tiny amount, and rinses away quickly.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair which can tend to be either weighed down or dry, so I was very impressed with how light and clean my hair felt.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to fuss over shampoo and such but, the first time I used it, I did notice that it made a nice, rich foam as I was working it into the hair.</li>
            <li>Smells very nice and left my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>I love clear scalp and hair hydration nourishing shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fresh, powdery scent, not overly floral.</li>
            <li>I do not suspect I&#x27;ll be able to use this duo in the summer, because the climate where I live gets pretty humid.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, curly hair and this worked fine, but was nothing remarkable.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is supposed to nourish and clean the hair, and it seems like it does that very well.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure this would help with either since I also have to use dandruff shampoo and it barely works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Nourishing Shampoo, along with the coordinating conditioner, for several weeks and am really happy with it.  </li>
            <li>The bottle has a good design, as it can be turned upside down when it is running out.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>this product, my hair feels very soft and stays wonderfully smooth.  </li>
            <li>It does feel a little like it&#x27;s coating the hair, but in this case, that&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Clear products.</li>
            <li>No complaints, just not AMAZING results, but perfectly great considering 1)</li>
            <li>So if you just want a good cleansing and a soft texture, perhaps for long hair, then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use either product without the other, so my opinion, while glowing and all things positive, isn&#x27;t for just the shampoo on its own..</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use either product without the other, so my opinion, while glowing and all things positive, isn&#x27;t for just the shampoo on its own.</li>
            <li>It also feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li>And unlike many heavy moisturizing shampoos/conditioners, this one didn&#x27;t leave my hair looking like I rubbed oil into it, just shiny and clean.</li>
            <li>I do have somewhat soft water, so that may play a part in how quickly the suds rinsed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a tremendous fan of Clear products.</li>
            <li>I do still need a trim and update but my hair looks better now since I switched to this shampoo, and I am wearing my hair down more whereas before I would hide my flat hair in a pony tail.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers generously (you don&#x27;t need to squeeze a whole lot out)</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s fragrant (but not too powerfully so), and it leaves my hair a bit thicker and softer/shinier than my old shampoo did.</li>
            <li>They have made a VERY obvious and fantastic change to my hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say if it hydrates the scalp as I did not notice any difference.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>So, I decided I would give this one a try since it is scalp and hair intense hydration...</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how much tamer my hair was after using the Intense Hydration formula.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended it!</li>
            <li>This smells really nice...subtle and not a chemical smell.  </li>
            <li>and this lathers and spreads nicely and moisturizes enough to use only a spray in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length, fine hair that falls flat within a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo my hair is shiny clean and is less dry and my scalp feels amazing.</li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant to try this because I have long fine hair and sometimes hydrating shampoos leave my hair</li>
            <li>Sorry for using so many caps, but I&#x27;m super excited.  </li>
            <li>the shampoo or conditioner will open up during delivery and then you get a box full of shampoo covered items.</li>
            <li>a lot of intense hydration types translate to greasy and heavy, but with the clear scalp I just feel my hair isn&#x27;t as dry and fly away, not weighed</li>
            <li>And the combination of the two - the Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Nourishing Shampoo and Conditioner - has had a noticeable and much appreciated affect on the shine, softness, and smoothness of my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have any particular scent, either.</li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t leave me with a WOW feeling, or even really help out my frizz too much.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, but very dry.</li>
            <li>as many of the other Clear products?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this in tandem with the matching conditioner.</li>
            <li>It does seem like it cleans my hair well, though without conditioner my hair feels a little shaggy, so if you have longer hair, you&#x27;re not going to be able to coast by with just this and no conditioner at all.</li>
            <li>I am always trying to find a shampoo that will clean my hair as well as add alittle moisture to my scalp as my scalp has gotten a bit dry as I have gotten older.  </li>
            <li>I had switched to natural over a year ago, and been using the Whole Foods shampoo line, not realizing how drab my hair had gotten</li>
            <li>This rating and review is based on the combined use of the Clear Scalp Intense Hydration Nourishing Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li>This rating and review is based on the combined use of the Clear Scalp Intense Hydration Nourishing Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li>have an aggressive form of lupus and take some harsh medications for it, so that dries me out even more and makes me resistant to a lot of beauty products.</li>
            <li>I do have wavy hair normally</li>
            <li>scent of the shampoo is strong enough to last the day without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>Not only did it do a fine job cleaning my hair, it left it feeling moisturized even before I applied the conditioner, which I&#x27;ve NEVER felt before.</li>
            <li>Now, this new incarnation is a bit perplexing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although, this shampoo squeezes out in a creamy ribbon like a lotion, it lathers up nice, has a fresh and subtle flowery fragrance, and leaves my hair very soft and somewhat bouncy when dry.  </li>
            <li>Whatever Clear is doing with shampoos seems to cut through all that, and I hope they keep it up!</li>
            <li>And, it had a stringy quality that I usually do not see with these products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The search for the perfect shampoo and conditioner to manage all that has been long and largely disappointing to this point.</li>
            <li>And, I&#x27;m not certain, but this may be why this particular product does not have the same rich lather</li>
            <li>If you have dry hair, you&#x27;re still going to need conditioner (almost everyone needs conditioner, actually), but all else being equal, you will probably be pleased with how this shampoo makes your hair feel.  </li>
            <li>only caveat is that if you have dyed hair, the ingredients in this shampoo are not friendly to that (they will accelerate color loss more than a dye-friendly shampoo).</li>
            <li>Now, Clear&#x27;s shampoos?</li>
            <li>With Clear, the time isn&#x27;t traumatic anymore-</li>
            <li>I am not always a fan of drugstore brands, but Clear makes a quality product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried a clear scalp shampoo I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>I really like Clear Scalp products, especially their [[ASIN:B007RTR8AC</li>
            <li>This shampoo left my hair feeling very silky soft and looking shiny.</li>
            <li>Calling it \\&quot;Clear</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised by this shampoo.</li>
            <li>When I got this product I was surprised at how everything just sort of livened up, from the fragrance to the lather to the body in my hair.</li>
            <li>I can actually feel my hair being so much softer, and that&#x27;s before conditioner.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and will definitely buy it again if I see it at the store.</li>
            <li>Not only did my hair feel much softer after just one use, but my curls were curls and not frizzed out</li>
            <li>soft-- almost unheard of with our water.</li>
            <li>I am in the process of transitioning to natural.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It was so soft, it didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>but right now my scalp feels very dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li>I tried Clear the first day I noticed how it made my dry hair feel heavier and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It has a nice subtle pear scent and leaves hair soft and manageable while relieving any symptoms of dry, itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>expensive shampoo that thought was the best in hard water.</li>
            <li>Like other hair care products in the Clear line I have tried this CLEAR SCALP AND HAIR INTENSE HYDRATION NOURISHING SHAMPOO works as advertises.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried a shampoo/conditioner that actually made it easier to manage my hair in between washes, but this one has definitely improved that whole frizz factor, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>price point on this at present (around $5.80) puts it in the ballpark of most mid-level, common consumer shampoos.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and thick, but also very fine.  </li>

            <li>CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce]].  </li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Plus for all its talk of hydration, my hair barely felt like there was any difference.</li>
            <li>However, I found that it caused my hair to be actually too soft and unmanageable.</li>
            <li>shampoo that left my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It is scented but the smell isn&#x27;t too powerful, dissipating after use after a few hours.</li>
            <li>I am also using it with the conditioner and highly recommend this for people with dry hair.</li>
            <li>The way I generally test a shampoo is to look mainly at how well it cleans my scalp, but also to use both the shampoo and conditioner one day while using only the same conditioner (no shampooing) the next day.</li>
            <li>It felt soft but dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Clear Hydration line works just about as well as I expected.</li>

            <li> There are several ingredients that are good not just for your scalp, but for your hair, as well (coconut oil, for example).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells nice but not overpowering and the end result was soft, manageable hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to switch completely from my old brand to this one.</li>
            <li> It comes out thick and creamy, makes good suds and smells nice without being overly scented--</li>
            <li> For the VERY FIRST time, my dandruff is GONE.  </li>
            <li> If given a choice, I still prefer to use higher end products like Biolage, but I keep coming back to Clear as it is a great product that can be easily found in stores.</li>
            <li> I love just about everything that The Clear line puts out and this shampoo is not exception!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lathers nicely, even with a tiny amount, and rinses away quickly.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair which can tend to be either weighed down or dry, so I was very impressed with how light and clean my hair felt.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to fuss over shampoo and such but, the first time I used it, I did notice that it made a nice, rich foam as I was working it into the hair.</li>
            <li> Smells very nice and left my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I love clear scalp and hair hydration nourishing shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fresh, powdery scent, not overly floral.</li>
            <li> I do not suspect I&#x27;ll be able to use this duo in the summer, because the climate where I live gets pretty humid.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair and this worked fine, but was nothing remarkable.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is supposed to nourish and clean the hair, and it seems like it does that very well.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this would help with either since I also have to use dandruff shampoo and it barely works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Nourishing Shampoo, along with the coordinating conditioner, for several weeks and am really happy with it.  </li>
            <li> The bottle has a good design, as it can be turned upside down when it is running out.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> this product, my hair feels very soft and stays wonderfully smooth.  </li>
            <li> It does feel a little like it&#x27;s coating the hair, but in this case, that&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Clear products.</li>
            <li> No complaints, just not AMAZING results, but perfectly great considering 1)</li>
            <li> So if you just want a good cleansing and a soft texture, perhaps for long hair, then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use either product without the other, so my opinion, while glowing and all things positive, isn&#x27;t for just the shampoo on its own..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use either product without the other, so my opinion, while glowing and all things positive, isn&#x27;t for just the shampoo on its own.</li>
            <li> It also feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li> And unlike many heavy moisturizing shampoos/conditioners, this one didn&#x27;t leave my hair looking like I rubbed oil into it, just shiny and clean.</li>
            <li> I do have somewhat soft water, so that may play a part in how quickly the suds rinsed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a tremendous fan of Clear products.</li>
            <li> I do still need a trim and update but my hair looks better now since I switched to this shampoo, and I am wearing my hair down more whereas before I would hide my flat hair in a pony tail.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers generously (you don&#x27;t need to squeeze a whole lot out)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s fragrant (but not too powerfully so), and it leaves my hair a bit thicker and softer/shinier than my old shampoo did.</li>
            <li> They have made a VERY obvious and fantastic change to my hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say if it hydrates the scalp as I did not notice any difference.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> So, I decided I would give this one a try since it is scalp and hair intense hydration...</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much tamer my hair was after using the Intense Hydration formula.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended it!</li>
            <li> This smells really nice...subtle and not a chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> and this lathers and spreads nicely and moisturizes enough to use only a spray in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, fine hair that falls flat within a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo my hair is shiny clean and is less dry and my scalp feels amazing.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to try this because I have long fine hair and sometimes hydrating shampoos leave my hair</li>
            <li> Sorry for using so many caps, but I&#x27;m super excited.  </li>
            <li> the shampoo or conditioner will open up during delivery and then you get a box full of shampoo covered items.</li>
            <li> a lot of intense hydration types translate to greasy and heavy, but with the clear scalp I just feel my hair isn&#x27;t as dry and fly away, not weighed</li>
            <li> And the combination of the two - the Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Nourishing Shampoo and Conditioner - has had a noticeable and much appreciated affect on the shine, softness, and smoothness of my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have any particular scent, either.</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t leave me with a WOW feeling, or even really help out my frizz too much.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, but very dry.</li>
            <li> as many of the other Clear products?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this in tandem with the matching conditioner.</li>
            <li> It does seem like it cleans my hair well, though without conditioner my hair feels a little shaggy, so if you have longer hair, you&#x27;re not going to be able to coast by with just this and no conditioner at all.</li>
            <li> I am always trying to find a shampoo that will clean my hair as well as add alittle moisture to my scalp as my scalp has gotten a bit dry as I have gotten older.  </li>
            <li> I had switched to natural over a year ago, and been using the Whole Foods shampoo line, not realizing how drab my hair had gotten</li>

            <li> This rating and review is based on the combined use of the Clear Scalp Intense Hydration Nourishing Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li> have an aggressive form of lupus and take some harsh medications for it, so that dries me out even more and makes me resistant to a lot of beauty products.</li>
            <li> I do have wavy hair normally</li>
            <li> scent of the shampoo is strong enough to last the day without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Not only did it do a fine job cleaning my hair, it left it feeling moisturized even before I applied the conditioner, which I&#x27;ve NEVER felt before.</li>
            <li> Now, this new incarnation is a bit perplexing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although, this shampoo squeezes out in a creamy ribbon like a lotion, it lathers up nice, has a fresh and subtle flowery fragrance, and leaves my hair very soft and somewhat bouncy when dry.  </li>
            <li> Whatever Clear is doing with shampoos seems to cut through all that, and I hope they keep it up!</li>
            <li> And, it had a stringy quality that I usually do not see with these products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The search for the perfect shampoo and conditioner to manage all that has been long and largely disappointing to this point.</li>
            <li> And, I&#x27;m not certain, but this may be why this particular product does not have the same rich lather</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair, you&#x27;re still going to need conditioner (almost everyone needs conditioner, actually), but all else being equal, you will probably be pleased with how this shampoo makes your hair feel.  </li>
            <li> only caveat is that if you have dyed hair, the ingredients in this shampoo are not friendly to that (they will accelerate color loss more than a dye-friendly shampoo).</li>
            <li> Now, Clear&#x27;s shampoos?</li>
            <li> With Clear, the time isn&#x27;t traumatic anymore-</li>
            <li> I am not always a fan of drugstore brands, but Clear makes a quality product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a clear scalp shampoo I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> I really like Clear Scalp products, especially their [[ASIN:B007RTR8AC</li>
            <li> This shampoo left my hair feeling very silky soft and looking shiny.</li>
            <li> Calling it \\&quot;Clear</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised by this shampoo.</li>
            <li> When I got this product I was surprised at how everything just sort of livened up, from the fragrance to the lather to the body in my hair.</li>
            <li> I can actually feel my hair being so much softer, and that&#x27;s before conditioner.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and will definitely buy it again if I see it at the store.</li>
            <li> Not only did my hair feel much softer after just one use, but my curls were curls and not frizzed out</li>
            <li> soft-- almost unheard of with our water.</li>
            <li> I am in the process of transitioning to natural.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It was so soft, it didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> but right now my scalp feels very dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> I tried Clear the first day I noticed how it made my dry hair feel heavier and hydrated.</li>
            <li> It has a nice subtle pear scent and leaves hair soft and manageable while relieving any symptoms of dry, itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> expensive shampoo that thought was the best in hard water.</li>
            <li> Like other hair care products in the Clear line I have tried this CLEAR SCALP AND HAIR INTENSE HYDRATION NOURISHING SHAMPOO works as advertises.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a shampoo/conditioner that actually made it easier to manage my hair in between washes, but this one has definitely improved that whole frizz factor, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> price point on this at present (around $5.80) puts it in the ballpark of most mid-level, common consumer shampoos.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and thick, but also very fine.  </li>
            <li> CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]] and</li>
            <li> CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce]].  </li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Plus for all its talk of hydration, my hair barely felt like there was any difference.</li>
            <li> However, I found that it caused my hair to be actually too soft and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> shampoo that left my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It is scented but the smell isn&#x27;t too powerful, dissipating after use after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I am also using it with the conditioner and highly recommend this for people with dry hair.</li>
            <li> The way I generally test a shampoo is to look mainly at how well it cleans my scalp, but also to use both the shampoo and conditioner one day while using only the same conditioner (no shampooing) the next day.</li>
            <li> It felt soft but dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Clear Hydration line works just about as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> It left my hair flat and un-styleable.</li>
            <li> Our water is SO hard that it comes out of the tap a pretty turquoise blue (copper pipes and calcium)</li>
            <li> it can be hard to know which one to grab first.</li>
            <li> Worked much like Pantene products I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
            <li> My frizz is down, and I don&#x27;t need to reach for my leave-in conditioners nearly as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even gotten rid of the dry skin flakes and cut down on the amount of hair breakage and shedding that I&#x27;ve spent my whole life thinking was &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> Previously before I started using this, I was using the Clear Frizz control and it wasn&#x27;t helping with frizz</li>
            <li> This winter, my hair has been extra dry.</li>
            <li> It had no effect on my dry scalp, which was left feeling itchy.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got dry or thick hair and want something a cut above the lowest price product, this is a very decent option.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a scent that will make anyone desperate to try it, or even be all that noticeable in your hair after use (I can sniff out a Biolage user at fifty paces), but who cares about smelling like a brand when LOOKING like one is so very much better.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll be sticking with this shampoo and matching conditioner for as long as I</li>
            <li> But these are minor points in my case.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that totally frizzes out in the Florida humidity, and as I&#x27;ve gotten older, it&#x27;s grown a bit coarser and curlier and much harder to manage.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> It is still dry.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hair in the winter, and have found this to be a blessing.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry curly hair and my scalp is also dry.</li>
            <li> It also seems pretty gentle on my thin, weak</li>
            <li> And we all know that cactus, which is supposedly an ingredient in this shampoo, puts up with a lot of dry air!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I do have very dry hair.</li>
            <li> (I just assumed I was long due for a hair cut).</li>
            <li> The final results were a little \\&quot;over-moisturizerd.\\</li>
            <li> I should say that I have a lot of hair though - very long and thick - so it takes a pretty heavy product to weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I can wear my long hair down after using this, without a lot of embarrassment.  </li>
            <li> I have to blow dry my hair to avoid a frizzy mess, but on humid or rainy days it often becomes frizzy quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worked so well, in fact, that my endless search is over.</li>
            <li> I have never had this probably with any other brand of shampoo.</li>
            <li> I still do use a cream rinse, but I&#x27;m not sure that would be necessary...</li>
            <li> I also had issues using shampoo every day because it would increase the effects so it was done every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick, very wavy hair that frizzes easily and is currently dry thank to the long, very cold Vermont winter we&#x27;ve dealt with that will not go away!</li>
            <li> After using this every other day I also noticed my scalp isn&#x27;t as flaky as before and definitely less</li>
            <li> It does appear to improve moisture in your hair as it keeps down frizzies while still holding body.</li>
            <li> and this did not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I used it with some other conditioners (mainly little hotel bottles like gilchrest and soames) and</li>
            <li> and I do have less frizz than I had with the frizz</li>
            <li> A little soapy with a slight fragrance that I assume has something to do with the cactus extracts or whatever.</li>
            <li> A little soapy with a slight fragrance that I assume has something to do with the cactus extracts or whatever.</li>
            <li> I like the little symbol on the bottle</li>
            <li> Could this be the reason why the scent is a little like aloe?</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a bad product, but I think I will stick with my Total Care Clear.</li>
            <li> I like the Clear products and there is nothing wrong with this Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that it can leave your hair greasy if you do not wash it every day, but I&#x27;ve never experienced this since I do wash and condition my hair daily.  </li>
            <li> It was just this weird flat lifeless mess.</li>
            <li> &quot; My hair was slightly \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; looking (I honestly do mean \\&quot;slightly\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> not sure why</li>
            <li> it left my hair really weird.</li>
            <li> This shampoo might just help me get through next winter without drastically cutting it all</li>
            <li> The shampoo is thick and creamy, just like that overpriced salon shampoo.</li>
            <li> I can use a very small amount and it still minimizes tangling during shampooing.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get confused.</li>
            <li> That time in the shower between rinsing out the shampoo, right before I put on conditioner is awful for me, my hair immediately tangles and feels disgusting dry, even under water.</li>
            <li> anyhow, it is usually almost impossible to get a shampoo to lather, this one does well.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to tell the effect of a shampoo when you also use a conditioner.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised by this shampoo. I had switched to natural over a year ago, and been using the Whole Foods shampoo line, not realizing how drab my hair had gotten (I just assumed I was long due for a hair cut). When I got this product I was surprised at how everything just sort of livened up, from the fragrance to the lather to the body in my hair. I have shoulder length, fine hair that falls flat within a couple of hours. I do still need a trim and update but my hair looks better now since I switched to this shampoo, and I am wearing my hair down more whereas before I would hide my flat hair in a pony tail. The shampoo lathers generously (you don&#x27;t need to squeeze a whole lot out), it&#x27;s fragrant (but not too powerfully so), and it leaves my hair a bit thicker and softer/shinier than my old shampoo did.

            <li> I have been trying Clear&#x27;s conditioners, and they&#x27;ve been really good. No complaints, just not AMAZING results, but perfectly great considering 1) The state my hair is in 2) What the products promise and 3) The price points. Now, Clear&#x27;s shampoos? They have made a VERY obvious and fantastic change to my hair. That time in the shower between rinsing out the shampoo, right before I put on conditioner is awful for me, my hair immediately tangles and feels disgusting dry, even under water. With Clear, the time isn&#x27;t traumatic anymore- I can actually feel my hair being so much softer, and that&#x27;s before conditioner.

            <li> This is a  nice shampoo with a pleasant scent.  It left my hair feeling soft and manageable. My husband tried it and he also liked it.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that totally frizzes out in the Florida humidity, and as I&#x27;ve gotten older, it&#x27;s grown a bit coarser and curlier and much harder to manage. It also tends to dryness, especially at the ends between hair cuts as well as at my scalp, which is prone to flake. The search for the perfect shampoo and conditioner to manage all that has been long and largely disappointing to this point. In fact, I&#x27;m fairly sure I&#x27;ve tried just about every store brand shampoo and conditioner at one time or another, as well as several of the pricier salon brands (when I could afford to), and while I&#x27;ve found a few that I liked, I haven&#x27;t, until now, found that perfect combination that worked exactly as I wanted it to on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love, love, LOVE this shampoo. Not only did it do a fine job cleaning my hair, it left it feeling moisturized even before I applied the conditioner, which I&#x27;ve NEVER felt before.

It&#x27;s not a scent that will make anyone desperate to try it, or even be all that noticeable in your hair after use (I can sniff out a Biolage user at fifty paces), but who cares about smelling like a brand when LOOKING like one is so very much better. I&#x27;m a customer for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: This rating and review is based on the combined use of the Clear Scalp Intense Hydration Nourishing Shampoo and Conditioner. I didn&#x27;t use either product without the other, so my opinion, while glowing and all things positive, isn&#x27;t for just the shampoo on its own.</li>
            <li> I am not always a fan of drugstore brands, but Clear makes a quality product. This shampoo smells nice without being overpowering. It cleans without drying my hair out. The bottle has a good design, as it can be turned upside down when it is running out. If given a choice, I still prefer to use higher end products like Biolage, but I keep coming back to Clear as it is a great product that can be easily found in stores.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is supposed to nourish and clean the hair, and it seems like it does that very well. I&#x27;ve used it now for a week, with and without conditioner, and can tell you that it was quite satisfactory. It is scented but the smell isn&#x27;t too powerful, dissipating after use after a few hours. It does seem like it cleans my hair well, though without conditioner my hair feels a little shaggy, so if you have longer hair, you&#x27;re not going to be able to coast by with just this and no conditioner at all. I really like this product and will definitely buy it again if I see it at the store.</li>
            <li> I love clear scalp and hair hydration nourishing shampoo. It has a pleasant clean scent, lathers nicely, rinses beautifully, and leaves my hair soft and shiny, even on those day I skip the conditioner. I haven&#x27;t tried a clear scalp shampoo I don&#x27;t like.  a lot of intense hydration types translate to greasy and heavy, but with the clear scalp I just feel my hair isn&#x27;t as dry and fly away, not weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have very dry hair. My hair is fine, but very dry.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to tell the effect of a shampoo when you also use a conditioner. The way I generally test a shampoo is to look mainly at how well it cleans my scalp, but also to use both the shampoo and conditioner one day while using only the same conditioner (no shampooing) the next day. I could tell that this had a significant effect on the texture of my hair because it was softer after a combination of both the shampoo and conditioner than just the conditioner alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of how it left my scalp, it did a serviceable job with one shampoo, but, as is so often the case no matter how thoroughly I scrub the shampoo into my scalp, repeating did a better job than just doing it once. I&#x27;m guessing this has something to do with how particles build up on your scalp than anything else, but I have this issue with all shampoos, not just this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smells very pleasant and doesn&#x27;t leave a strong perfumey scent behind (which is very important to me as strong scents make me sneeze). It does appear to improve moisture in your hair as it keeps down frizzies while still holding body. I should say that I have a lot of hair though - very long and thick - so it takes a pretty heavy product to weigh it down. I don&#x27;t know how it would affect someone with finer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price point on this at present (around $5.80) puts it in the ballpark of most mid-level, common consumer shampoos. However, at the time of this review, Walmart has it available for $4.98, so you can do a bit better on the pricing if you shop around. If you&#x27;ve got dry or thick hair and want something a cut above the lowest price product, this is a very decent option.</li>
            <li> Like other hair care products in the Clear line I have tried this CLEAR SCALP AND HAIR INTENSE HYDRATION NOURISHING SHAMPOO works as advertises.  It has a nice subtle pear scent and leaves hair soft and manageable while relieving any symptoms of dry, itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I really like Clear Scalp products, especially their [[ASIN:B007RTR8AC CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]] and [[ASIN:B007RTR8UM CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce]].  I was a bit hesitant to try this because I have long fine hair and sometimes hydrating shampoos leave my hair flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, this shampoo squeezes out in a creamy ribbon like a lotion, it lathers up nice, has a fresh and subtle flowery fragrance, and leaves my hair very soft and somewhat bouncy when dry.  I do have wavy hair normally and this did not weigh my hair down. I can&#x27;t really say if it hydrates the scalp as I did not notice any difference.  Nevertheless, I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Previously before I started using this, I was using the Clear Frizz control and it wasn&#x27;t helping with frizz and it was actually drying out my scalp. So, I decided I would give this one a try since it is scalp and hair intense hydration...well after two weeks of using this, it has not hydrated my scalp one bit! It is still dry. I have never had this probably with any other brand of shampoo. This one does moisture my hair more than the frizz control one and I do have less frizz than I had with the frizz control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this shampoo doesn&#x27;t do what it says it is going to do.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Clear products. I have been since basically day one. Their Total Care line has worked miracles on my hair and scalp. This winter, my hair has been extra dry. Basically, everything I have tried works for a short period and then it is back to the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clear Hydration line works just about as well as I expected. It has a pleasant scent. Leaves my hair feeling nice. But it didn&#x27;t leave me with a WOW feeling, or even really help out my frizz too much. Plus for all its talk of hydration, my hair barely felt like there was any difference. It wasn&#x27;t a bad product, but I think I will stick with my Total Care Clear.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was good for a thorough clean on both scalp and hair, and unlike the conditioner version, I didn&#x27;t have to use too much of it to get a good lather. Smells very nice and left my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m putting the shampoo and conditioner in the same review, which means I will copy this to the conditioner review, because I would never use them separately.  I have extremely dry hair in the winter, and have found this to be a blessing.  I can wear my long hair down after using this, without a lot of embarrassment.  It does feel a little like it&#x27;s coating the hair, but in this case, that&#x27;s a good thing.  I like the little symbol on the bottle - it&#x27;s a cactus, but it also appears to be a hair strand being coated with moisturizer protection. And we all know that cactus, which is supposedly an ingredient in this shampoo, puts up with a lot of dry air!  I do not suspect I&#x27;ll be able to use this duo in the summer, because the climate where I live gets pretty humid.  I also need to experiment with the appropriate after shampoo leave in creme.  But these are minor points in my case. This shampoo might just help me get through next winter without drastically cutting it all off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t like when the shampoo and conditional are in the exact same style bottle because int he shower with water in the eyes it can be hard to know which one to grab first. But in this case, the bottle sits well either right-side-up or up-side-down. I just put the conditioner up-side-down and I don&#x27;t get confused.</li>
            <li> I like that it sudses so well. I can use a very small amount and it still minimizes tangling during shampooing.  I still do use a cream rinse, but I&#x27;m not sure that would be necessary...it&#x27;s a habit!  My hair is not tinted, but a friend of mine says it seems to protect her hair color between retouches, prevents fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> This shampoo left my hair feeling very silky soft and looking shiny. However, I found that it caused my hair to be actually too soft and unmanageable. My hair would not keep a curl in it. So if you just want a good cleansing and a soft texture, perhaps for long hair, then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Wonderful item.....I use it every day and my hair feels so healthy I don&#x27;t even use conditioner anymore!</li>
            <li> I love just about everything that The Clear line puts out and this shampoo is not exception! I loved the smell, first of all.. not overpowering, just fresh. The shampoo is thick and creamy, just like that overpriced salon shampoo. Best of all, I loved the way my hair felt afterwards. I have curly hair which can tend to be either weighed down or dry, so I was very impressed with how light and clean my hair felt.  I used this shampoo with the coordinating conditioner and I absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li> This is the third Clear shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, and it&#x27;s the best of the bunch. I have thick, very wavy hair that frizzes easily and is currently dry thank to the long, very cold Vermont winter we&#x27;ve dealt with that will not go away! I cannot believe how much tamer my hair was after using the Intense Hydration formula. Not only did my hair feel much softer after just one use, but my curls were curls and not frizzed out messes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers nicely, even with a tiny amount, and rinses away quickly. I do have somewhat soft water, so that may play a part in how quickly the suds rinsed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the shampoo is strong enough to last the day without being overpowering. It&#x27;s a fresh, powdery scent, not overly floral.</li>
            <li> This is basically a dandruff shampoo.  Calling it \\&quot;Clear Scalp\\&quot; is just a less-stigmatizing way of saying that.  If you don&#x27;t have problems with flaking and/or itching/dryness of the scalp, you don&#x27;t need this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you do have scalp issues, this is a pleasant-smelling way of addressing them.  If you have dry hair, you&#x27;re still going to need conditioner (almost everyone needs conditioner, actually), but all else being equal, you will probably be pleased with how this shampoo makes your hair feel.  There are several ingredients that are good not just for your scalp, but for your hair, as well (coconut oil, for example).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only caveat is that if you have dyed hair, the ingredients in this shampoo are not friendly to that (they will accelerate color loss more than a dye-friendly shampoo).</li>
            <li> I like the Clear products and there is nothing wrong with this Shampoo.  It comes out thick and creamy, makes good suds and smells nice without being overly scented-- but it didn&#x27;t hydrate my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why but right now my scalp feels very dry and itchy.  And I was hoping this shampoo would help --perhaps the conditioner would-- but I noticed no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;Nice shampoo that left my hair soft and manageable. It had no effect on my dry scalp, which was left feeling itchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo for a couple of weeks and I have to admit that it is pretty much as good as the &amp;#34;Washee&amp;#34; expensive shampoo that thought was the best in hard water. Our water is SO hard that it comes out of the tap a pretty turquoise blue (copper pipes and calcium) anyhow, it is usually almost impossible to get a shampoo to lather, this one does well. It also seems pretty gentle on my thin, weak hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in conjunction with a suave conditioner (Morrocan Infusion) and the two work really nicely together, leaving my  hair soft-- almost unheard of with our water. I used it with some other conditioners (mainly little hotel bottles like gilchrest and soames) and the combo isn&#x27;t as nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this for any type of water or hair. If it does well here, it should be even better with softer water (and nicer hair!).</li>
            <li> I am an african american female with relaxed hair. I am in the process of transitioning to natural. This shampoo works miracles. It smells good, leaves my scalp clean, and gives my hair a narural shine. My hair feels so soft. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have very dry curly hair and my scalp is also dry. I wasn&#x27;t sure this would help with either since I also have to use dandruff shampoo and it barely works. I also had issues using shampoo every day because it would increase the effects so it was done every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried Clear the first day I noticed how it made my dry hair feel heavier and hydrated. After using this every other day I also noticed my scalp isn&#x27;t as flaky as before and definitely less irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is very pleasant  and not overpowering. I am also using it with the conditioner and highly recommend this for people with dry hair.</li>
            <li> I am always trying to find a shampoo that will clean my hair as well as add alittle moisture to my scalp as my scalp has gotten a bit dry as I have gotten older.  This shampoo does the trick.  After using this shampoo my hair is shiny clean and is less dry and my scalp feels amazing. My hairdresser daughter has even noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration shampoo and conditioner.  For the VERY FIRST time, my dandruff is GONE.  Sorry for using so many caps, but I&#x27;m super excited.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 1.5 months now and my hair smells great and my dandruff is gone.  I&#x27;ve had dandruff since I was kid, and I&#x27;ve even tried medicated shampoos.  Nothing worked until now.  The combination of the shampoo and conditioner is magical.  I&#x27;ve heard that it can leave your hair greasy if you do not wash it every day, but I&#x27;ve never experienced this since I do wash and condition my hair daily.  I highly recommended it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to fuss over shampoo and such but, the first time I used it, I did notice that it made a nice, rich foam as I was working it into the hair. It smells nice but not overpowering and the end result was soft, manageable hair. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I am a tremendous fan of Clear products. I have experimented with more of them than I can count. Now, this new incarnation is a bit perplexing. It contains cactus extract. Could this be the reason why the scent is a little like aloe? And, I&#x27;m not certain, but this may be why this particular product does not have the same rich lather as many of the other Clear products?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this in tandem with the matching conditioner. The final results were a little \\&quot;over-moisturizerd.\\&quot; My hair was slightly \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; looking (I honestly do mean \\&quot;slightly\\&quot;). And, it had a stringy quality that I usually do not see with these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to guess, I think this shampoo could be fantastic for those with genuinely damaged hair. For me, who still needs a touch of moisture as this harsh winters melts away, I think it was just too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clear Scalp and Hair Intense Hydration Nourishing Shampoo, along with the coordinating conditioner, for several weeks and am really happy with it.  My hair is long and thick, but also very fine.  I have to blow dry my hair to avoid a frizzy mess, but on humid or rainy days it often becomes frizzy quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product, my hair feels very soft and stays wonderfully smooth.  The first time I used it was a drizzly, dreary day, and even after being out in the rain a couple of times, my hair still looked great.  I am very happy with how this shampoo and conditioner work for me.  It smells nice and leaves my hair looking and feeling fantastic.</li>
            <li> This smells really nice...subtle and not a chemical smell.  It also feels clean and soft. I have very long hair and this lathers and spreads nicely and moisturizes enough to use only a spray in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo with the conditioner for over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- LOVE the scent. It&#x27;s very clean and fruity&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves my hair soft and lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;- I feel that this product makes my hair appear healthier and a bit shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Not a con on the product itself, but packaging.  These bottles are not sealed off in plastic bags when shipped so once in awhile the shampoo or conditioner will open up during delivery and then you get a box full of shampoo covered items.</li>
            <li> I use a variety of hair products and have found this one to be a wonderful product.  It&#x27;s creamy, smells wonderful, lathers well, rinses clean, and does a good job of cleaning my hair.  What&#x27;s nice is the complementary conditioner.  Wonderful!  (At the time of this writing, the price can&#x27;t be beat either!)</li>
            <li> This stuffs smells awesome. I loved it. It feels great to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it left my hair really weird. It felt soft but dry. It was so soft, it didn&#x27;t do anything. It left my hair flat and un-styleable. It wasn&#x27;t shiny.  It was just this weird flat lifeless mess. I tried it with and without the conditioner. Both ways weren&#x27;t great. Without the conditioner it is just dryer.</li>
            <li> my scalp is clearing up  and my hair is beautiful</li>
