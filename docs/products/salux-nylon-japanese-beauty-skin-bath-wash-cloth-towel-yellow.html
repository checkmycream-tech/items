            <li>It&#x27;s such a wonderful experience every time I use it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure you buy from the correct seller, since I see people complaining about receiving a knock-off.</li>
            <li>Just keeping your skin smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li>but I am so glad to have found it online.  </li>
            <li>They were a couple of bucks more, so I hope they are the correct SALUX brand items made in Japan.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love Amazon</li>
            <li>But it is better than a loofah.</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Some people might not be able to handle the roughness of the cloth</li>
            <li>This is 1000 times better.</li>
            <li>and it gets my skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I dab on some of my face wash on it and its giving me a better exfoliation than any face scrub every has.     </li>
            <li>, GLAD I GOT 2&lt;br /&gt;sara</li>
            <li>Salux rags are fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and it rinses out much better.</li>
            <li>These are the good ones too- super huge and not as  pricey as some others.  </li>
            <li>My father loved this brand so much that he used to ask me to buy Salux for him by the dozens :)</li>
            <li>I feel so clean and scrubbed up after!</li>
            <li>The Salux Nylon Japanese Bath Wash Cloth Towel is a very good exfoliating wash cloth for your body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before and remember the incredible feeling of how this towel left my skin.  </li>
            <li>(JUST BE SURE THAT YOURS-RECEIVED IS A GENUINE &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>so easy to get my back, and it feels incredible.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and feels so invigorating against the skin.</li>
            <li>A quick internet search will lead you to the Salux website - buy them there!</li>
            <li>I bought this from the seller &amp;#34;JapanSuperMall&amp;#34; and it was quick and totally authentic wash cloth.</li>
            <li>A little practice make perfect.</li>
            <li>This thing works good but a little too good.</li>
            <li>I have had many problems ordering authentic ones on amazon, and am happy to finally get another real one.</li>
            <li>This cheap item is also Made</li>
            <li>and it is cheap.  </li>
            <li>This wash cloth/towel makes your skin feel so smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>After you use this, your skin is energized and extremely smooth.   </li>
            <li>With its texture, using this washcloth on your body and legs is like getting a light massage - stimulating.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>leaves my skin feeling smooth and invigorated.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased skin polishing clothes before, but these are far superior.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to find them at Amazon</li>
            <li>If you used original Salux cloth, which is Made In Japan, this is not Salux cloth.  </li>
            <li>I own and purchased a new Salux from Amazon&#x27;s vendor.  </li>
            <li>I had read great reviews about the Salux towel on another beauty site and didn&#x27;t think to read the Amazon reviews since I&#x27;ve had such success with them in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you wont feel clean.</li>
            <li>But the best part is how soft and silky your entire body is after use.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother my skin, and it get you REALLY clean.</li>
            <li>However, Like many others, I received a cheap knock-off brand called \\&quot;Leyijie\\&quot; from China, which is inferior to the real Salux towel.</li>
            <li>so you feel clean and rejuvenated without having scratches on the skin  </li>
            <li>I feel really, really clean when I&#x27;m through with my shower.  </li>
            <li>It makes me feel clean and all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was very cheap and does lather and exfoliate very well compared to loofa, sponges, and those plastic poofballs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product just what I expected.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll definitely get good exfoliation from it though.</li>
            <li>I have used these since I was a younger kid and have loved them.  </li>
            <li>the package picture indicates you can scrub your own back with one quite easily.  </li>
            <li>Great for camping, drum corps, vacations, or any other activities where you might want a quickly drying cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Received quick, will use this seller again for this product.</li>
            <li>Inc. Other sellers through Amazon may be more honest in their descriptions of these Salux cloths.</li>
            <li>and I am very surprised that they allow this to continue!!!!</li>
            <li>It feels good to scrub on my dry flaky skin.  </li>
            <li>It also dries very quickly and really polishes your skin.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much soap with this cloth and it rinses easily.</li>
            <li>I have been using these wash cloths for several years and absolutely love them!</li>
            <li>They exoliate very well and hold up in the wash great- just wash with towels and let air dry.</li>
            <li>My roomate thought it was too much for her uber sensitive skin, but I love these!</li>
            <li>That said, I also ordered from KASHAYA INC, and they also provided an authentic item (they had different colors available at the time i ordered).</li>
            <li>It may take some time to get use to using but its worth it.  </li>
            <li>This product is well worth it.</li>
            <li>The size is big and they are sturdy and they exfoliate my skin nicely.</li>
            <li>but well worth it if you like to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Amazon was nice enough to refund the money, but why do they let this seller continue this con?</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let other reviews turn you off from trying this simple yet wonderful product.</li>
            <li>It makes your whole body feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I really like it and still have my original.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this for the face, but it is excellent at removing dry rough skin everywhere else.</li>
            <li>Yes, it feels more like a plastic mesh bag than anything; however, it gets the job done, dries fast, is light, and lets you scrub your back to your heart&#x27;s content!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>many others, I received a cheap knock-off brand called \\&quot;Leyijie\\&quot; which was *totally* inferior to the real Salux towel.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for anyone wanting much more exfoliation than a normal washcloth or bath pouf.</li>
            <li>Far superior to a regular cotton washcloth or loofah.</li>
            <li>My back feels great too after a back scrub with&lt;br /&gt;the wash cloth.</li>
            <li>It came very fast and is exactly as specified.</li>
            <li>May seem too aggressive at first but remember you are in control of the pressure you apply.</li>
            <li>Funny thing is, it&#x27;s made out of synthetic stuff, a 60/40 nylon/polyester blend.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much, feeling exfoliated!</li>
            <li>and I found them even better and longer lasting than the ones I had purchased before.</li>
            <li>(I also have given these as gifts to my family and friends, that is just how much I like them!)</li>
            <li>I first found thee when I lived in Japan 20 years ago.</li>
            <li>If you order from pandora, you will get the real thing!</li>
            <li>I bought the yellow one and like many others, was sent a rip off brand.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re textured like loofahs, but are more like a standard washcloth in shape and use.</li>
            <li>bought this to replace my 6 months old original Salux cloth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of huge, I&#x27;ve read reviews where people say they cut them in pieces, but I like the long cloth for back scrubbing.</li>
            <li>This is also the best washrag to use if you are using charcoal or any other black soaps.</li>
            <li>I feel so soft and clean all over.</li>
            <li>The towel is fairly long so you can get a really good scrub on your back.  </li>
            <li>That picture sold me back then and am pleased to have found a source now that I live in Tennessee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He said my back was super soft and smooth....</li>
            <li>The packaging is the cheap Chinese knockoff version of the real SALUX cloth packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Holds the soap in for the whole shower.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on a review I found from another site, my Salux weighs 1.2 oz -- the correct weight for the real deal.</li>
            <li>Just wanted to say thank you to Cp ASiana Inc., for delivering the real deal Salux cloths.</li>
            <li>It also dries extremely fast.  </li>
            <li>I also lather up with lotion after each shower, but this really made the difference.</li>
            <li>I love rough exfoliation.</li>
            <li>They really last and leave your skin exfoliated and smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin thanks Salux.</li>
            <li>It feels much like the scrub side of a sponge.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is really long so it is easy to reach the back.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;It accomplishes what other reviews have said, leaving you with amazingly exfoliated soft skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long enough to cleanse the entire back area and suds up wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>They dry fast too, and it is easy to rinse..</li>
            <li>If you used original Salux cloth before, you will know this is not the same</li>
            <li>I use this every other day in the shower with my favorite shower gel or soap.</li>
            <li>Simple, effective, long lasting and worth every penny of its very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This is a must for me, no more washrags to shower, is very wide and soo long the perfect thing to scrub your back, come in diferent colors, much better than i</li>
            <li>It also makes my shower gel last longer, as only a tiny amount is needed for a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who may have doubts as I did.  </li>
            <li>Rinses cleanly out in seconds, fold twice and &amp;#34;whip&amp;#34; the water out of it and it will be almost dry.</li>
            <li>With just one wash, my 6 months old Salux cloth and this 1 day old cheap knock off looks same.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used &#x27;normal washclothes&#x27; since finding these.  </li>
            <li>Maybe  worth spending the extra 75cents</li>
            <li>This wash cloth is long enough to wash my back and the fabric is excellent for removing the dead skin cells that accumulate on the skin.</li>
            <li>My husband noticed right away when giving me a back rub.</li>
            <li>The cloth itself is a nylon exfoliating cloth, short enough so that you can grip it easily, but wide enough so that you can clean your back easily.</li>
            <li>But this may spoil the value of Salux cloth for new users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of them things that I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>I had been trying to find this where I live and no body has it.</li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t grow mildew due to its super fast drying ability.</li>
            <li>(same price) and was MUCH happier with the real thing.</li>
            <li>Those who are downrating this cloth must have very sensitive skin -- I do not find it overly abrasive at all.</li>
            <li>Use this softly on gentle areas but put a little more pressure on places you want to exfoliate (knees, elbow, back and chest).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thin and very porous, so it rinses clean and dries quickly if hung up after use.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, this was not the Salux (Japanese) that I ordered,but the Leyijie Chinese knockoff.</li>
            <li>This is much higher quality than your standard loofah, suds just as well</li>
            <li>Because you can whip the water out so easily, it can be hung outside of the shower to completely dry without dripping.</li>
            <li>I think they make great hostess gifts, stocking suffers, inexpensive pick me up gifts, and highly recommend them to everyone.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates all dead skin and makes you feel extra clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>A very scratchy fabric, cut extra long so that it&#x27;s easy to wash your back.</li>
            <li>The product was mailed a few days after ordering and arrived just fine.  </li>
            <li>Amazon CS certainly will take care of you if you receive a counterfeit item (Leyjie instead of Salux) but it is a pain to have to report, repackage return, especially when you plan on giving these as gifts, and have a \\&quot;deadline\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I know this because I have since purchased from them directly</li>
            <li>It is still gentle enough to use on my face.  </li>
            <li>It was a lot rougher than I thought it would be (like sandpaper) but it does lather soap well and my skin was incredibly soft afterwards, even my husband noticed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can see this being an irritant for people with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and silky every time.</li>
            <li>PRODUCT, MANUFACTURED IN JAPAN [NOT in China], or its quality WILL NO-WHERE NEARLY MATCH</li>
            <li>just like most other people say, it makes your skin tingle, and it&#x27;s big enough to grab with both hands and rub your whole back with no problem.</li>
            <li>Also great for cleaning bathrooms and other tough jobs.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;recycling&amp;#34; act extends their VERY useful life-span ANOTHER few</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are just rough enough to give a nice tingly feeling when you scrub down, yet soft and flexible.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the original longer ones, not cheap like swap meet ones.</li>
            <li>These are NOT Salux cloths of Japanese manufacture, but cheap, thin, light Chinese knockoffs.</li>
            <li>You need to get use to these cloths, at first they feel really rough on your skin</li>
            <li>Bought this based on the reviews and the simple fact I need a new washcloth.</li>
            <li>I ordered from this vendor and received a quality product, but beware some vendors on amazon will send you a cheap imitation, I had it happen to me when I tried ordering a different color from a different vendor.</li>
            <li>SEND IT BACK IMMEDIATELY, UNOPENED, FOR A REFUND!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW OF THE ORIGINAL, &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; JAPANESE-MADE CLOTH: .........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WATCH OUT DIRT AND BODY-GREASE...HERE IT COMES!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an almost-all synthetic, long washcloth with a REAL &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; propensity to &amp;#34;sloth&amp;#34; away dead skin, dirt and body oils that leave you feeling &amp;#34;invigorated&amp;#34; after every shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The material is ok, but the weave of it makes it way too tough.</li>
            <li>My wife and I where introduce to the Japanese wash cloths by a friend that travels frequently to Japan.</li>
            <li>but once you get used to them you wont want to go back to the old face cloth to wash your body</li>
            <li>You can vary the amount of tension you use to do anything from a &amp;#34;super scrub&amp;#34; to a barely there soap up and rinse.</li>
            <li>This merchant is a liar and a cheat, and Amazon apparently condones the dishonesty.</li>
            <li>It is not as harsh as a loofah, it suds up like the bath fluffy sponge, but has more exfoliating properties.  </li>
            <li>I have NEVER been disappointed with Amazon (speedy, reliable, great prices) until this purchase.  </li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T buy these if your looking for the original, robust, heavy, rough Salux cloths.</li>
            <li>This is actually quite a large cloth, so I cut mine down and made three: one for my face, one to use in the bath and one to use in the shower at the gym.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin or anything, but I have to barely graze this thing across me when I use it because it is so rough.</li>
            <li>long lasting  not too soft</li>
            <li>Basic product, so no complaints there, but when you order a product that is as light as a few pieces of paper, and it costs less than $3 -</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s such a wonderful experience every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li> sure you buy from the correct seller, since I see people complaining about receiving a knock-off.</li>
            <li> Just keeping your skin smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> but I am so glad to have found it online.  </li>
            <li> They were a couple of bucks more, so I hope they are the correct SALUX brand items made in Japan.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love Amazon</li>
            <li> But it is better than a loofah.</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Some people might not be able to handle the roughness of the cloth</li>
            <li> This is 1000 times better.</li>
            <li> and it gets my skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I dab on some of my face wash on it and its giving me a better exfoliation than any face scrub every has.     </li>
            <li> , GLAD I GOT 2&lt;br /&gt;sara</li>
            <li> Salux rags are fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and it rinses out much better.</li>
            <li> These are the good ones too- super huge and not as  pricey as some others.  </li>
            <li> My father loved this brand so much that he used to ask me to buy Salux for him by the dozens :)</li>
            <li> I feel so clean and scrubbed up after!</li>
            <li> The Salux Nylon Japanese Bath Wash Cloth Towel is a very good exfoliating wash cloth for your body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and remember the incredible feeling of how this towel left my skin.  </li>
            <li> (JUST BE SURE THAT YOURS-RECEIVED IS A GENUINE &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> so easy to get my back, and it feels incredible.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and feels so invigorating against the skin.</li>
            <li> A quick internet search will lead you to the Salux website - buy them there!</li>
            <li> I bought this from the seller &amp;#34;JapanSuperMall&amp;#34; and it was quick and totally authentic wash cloth.</li>
            <li> A little practice make perfect.</li>
            <li> This thing works good but a little too good.</li>
            <li> I have had many problems ordering authentic ones on amazon, and am happy to finally get another real one.</li>
            <li> This cheap item is also Made</li>
            <li> and it is cheap.  </li>
            <li> This wash cloth/towel makes your skin feel so smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> After you use this, your skin is energized and extremely smooth.   </li>
            <li> With its texture, using this washcloth on your body and legs is like getting a light massage - stimulating.  </li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> leaves my skin feeling smooth and invigorated.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased skin polishing clothes before, but these are far superior.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to find them at Amazon</li>
            <li> If you used original Salux cloth, which is Made In Japan, this is not Salux cloth.  </li>
            <li> I own and purchased a new Salux from Amazon&#x27;s vendor.  </li>
            <li> I had read great reviews about the Salux towel on another beauty site and didn&#x27;t think to read the Amazon reviews since I&#x27;ve had such success with them in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you wont feel clean.</li>
            <li> But the best part is how soft and silky your entire body is after use.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother my skin, and it get you REALLY clean.</li>
            <li> However, Like many others, I received a cheap knock-off brand called \\&quot;Leyijie\\&quot; from China, which is inferior to the real Salux towel.</li>
            <li> so you feel clean and rejuvenated without having scratches on the skin  </li>
            <li> I feel really, really clean when I&#x27;m through with my shower.  </li>
            <li> It makes me feel clean and all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was very cheap and does lather and exfoliate very well compared to loofa, sponges, and those plastic poofballs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product just what I expected.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll definitely get good exfoliation from it though.</li>
            <li> I have used these since I was a younger kid and have loved them.  </li>
            <li> the package picture indicates you can scrub your own back with one quite easily.  </li>
            <li> Great for camping, drum corps, vacations, or any other activities where you might want a quickly drying cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Received quick, will use this seller again for this product.</li>
            <li> Inc. Other sellers through Amazon may be more honest in their descriptions of these Salux cloths.</li>
            <li> and I am very surprised that they allow this to continue!!!!</li>
            <li> It feels good to scrub on my dry flaky skin.  </li>
            <li> It also dries very quickly and really polishes your skin.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much soap with this cloth and it rinses easily.</li>
            <li> I have been using these wash cloths for several years and absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> They exoliate very well and hold up in the wash great- just wash with towels and let air dry.</li>
            <li> My roomate thought it was too much for her uber sensitive skin, but I love these!</li>
            <li> That said, I also ordered from KASHAYA INC, and they also provided an authentic item (they had different colors available at the time i ordered).</li>
            <li> It may take some time to get use to using but its worth it.  </li>
            <li> This product is well worth it.</li>
            <li> The size is big and they are sturdy and they exfoliate my skin nicely.</li>
            <li> but well worth it if you like to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Amazon was nice enough to refund the money, but why do they let this seller continue this con?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let other reviews turn you off from trying this simple yet wonderful product.</li>
            <li> It makes your whole body feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I really like it and still have my original.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this for the face, but it is excellent at removing dry rough skin everywhere else.</li>
            <li> Yes, it feels more like a plastic mesh bag than anything; however, it gets the job done, dries fast, is light, and lets you scrub your back to your heart&#x27;s content!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> many others, I received a cheap knock-off brand called \\&quot;Leyijie\\&quot; which was *totally* inferior to the real Salux towel.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for anyone wanting much more exfoliation than a normal washcloth or bath pouf.</li>
            <li> Far superior to a regular cotton washcloth or loofah.</li>
            <li> My back feels great too after a back scrub with&lt;br /&gt;the wash cloth.</li>
            <li> It came very fast and is exactly as specified.</li>
            <li> May seem too aggressive at first but remember you are in control of the pressure you apply.</li>
            <li> Funny thing is, it&#x27;s made out of synthetic stuff, a 60/40 nylon/polyester blend.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much, feeling exfoliated!</li>
            <li> and I found them even better and longer lasting than the ones I had purchased before.</li>
            <li> (I also have given these as gifts to my family and friends, that is just how much I like them!)</li>
            <li> I first found thee when I lived in Japan 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> If you order from pandora, you will get the real thing!</li>
            <li> I bought the yellow one and like many others, was sent a rip off brand.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re textured like loofahs, but are more like a standard washcloth in shape and use.</li>
            <li> bought this to replace my 6 months old original Salux cloth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of huge, I&#x27;ve read reviews where people say they cut them in pieces, but I like the long cloth for back scrubbing.</li>
            <li> This is also the best washrag to use if you are using charcoal or any other black soaps.</li>
            <li> I feel so soft and clean all over.</li>
            <li> The towel is fairly long so you can get a really good scrub on your back.  </li>
            <li> That picture sold me back then and am pleased to have found a source now that I live in Tennessee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He said my back was super soft and smooth....</li>
            <li> The packaging is the cheap Chinese knockoff version of the real SALUX cloth packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Holds the soap in for the whole shower.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on a review I found from another site, my Salux weighs 1.2 oz -- the correct weight for the real deal.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to say thank you to Cp ASiana Inc., for delivering the real deal Salux cloths.</li>
            <li> It also dries extremely fast.  </li>
            <li> I also lather up with lotion after each shower, but this really made the difference.</li>
            <li> I love rough exfoliation.</li>
            <li> They really last and leave your skin exfoliated and smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin thanks Salux.</li>
            <li> It feels much like the scrub side of a sponge.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is really long so it is easy to reach the back.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;It accomplishes what other reviews have said, leaving you with amazingly exfoliated soft skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long enough to cleanse the entire back area and suds up wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> They dry fast too, and it is easy to rinse..</li>
            <li> If you used original Salux cloth before, you will know this is not the same</li>
            <li> I use this every other day in the shower with my favorite shower gel or soap.</li>
            <li> Simple, effective, long lasting and worth every penny of its very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This is a must for me, no more washrags to shower, is very wide and soo long the perfect thing to scrub your back, come in diferent colors, much better than i</li>
            <li> It also makes my shower gel last longer, as only a tiny amount is needed for a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who may have doubts as I did.  </li>
            <li> Rinses cleanly out in seconds, fold twice and &amp;#34;whip&amp;#34; the water out of it and it will be almost dry.</li>
            <li> With just one wash, my 6 months old Salux cloth and this 1 day old cheap knock off looks same.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used &#x27;normal washclothes&#x27; since finding these.  </li>
            <li> Maybe  worth spending the extra 75cents</li>
            <li> This wash cloth is long enough to wash my back and the fabric is excellent for removing the dead skin cells that accumulate on the skin.</li>
            <li> My husband noticed right away when giving me a back rub.</li>
            <li> The cloth itself is a nylon exfoliating cloth, short enough so that you can grip it easily, but wide enough so that you can clean your back easily.</li>
            <li> But this may spoil the value of Salux cloth for new users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of them things that I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> I had been trying to find this where I live and no body has it.</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t grow mildew due to its super fast drying ability.</li>
            <li> (same price) and was MUCH happier with the real thing.</li>
            <li> Those who are downrating this cloth must have very sensitive skin -- I do not find it overly abrasive at all.</li>
            <li> Use this softly on gentle areas but put a little more pressure on places you want to exfoliate (knees, elbow, back and chest).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and very porous, so it rinses clean and dries quickly if hung up after use.  </li>
            <li> Sure enough, this was not the Salux (Japanese) that I ordered,but the Leyijie Chinese knockoff.</li>
            <li> This is much higher quality than your standard loofah, suds just as well</li>
            <li> Because you can whip the water out so easily, it can be hung outside of the shower to completely dry without dripping.</li>
            <li> I think they make great hostess gifts, stocking suffers, inexpensive pick me up gifts, and highly recommend them to everyone.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates all dead skin and makes you feel extra clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> A very scratchy fabric, cut extra long so that it&#x27;s easy to wash your back.</li>
            <li> The product was mailed a few days after ordering and arrived just fine.  </li>
            <li> Amazon CS certainly will take care of you if you receive a counterfeit item (Leyjie instead of Salux) but it is a pain to have to report, repackage return, especially when you plan on giving these as gifts, and have a \\&quot;deadline\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I know this because I have since purchased from them directly</li>
            <li> It is still gentle enough to use on my face.  </li>
            <li> It was a lot rougher than I thought it would be (like sandpaper) but it does lather soap well and my skin was incredibly soft afterwards, even my husband noticed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can see this being an irritant for people with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and silky every time.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT, MANUFACTURED IN JAPAN [NOT in China], or its quality WILL NO-WHERE NEARLY MATCH</li>
            <li> just like most other people say, it makes your skin tingle, and it&#x27;s big enough to grab with both hands and rub your whole back with no problem.</li>
            <li> Also great for cleaning bathrooms and other tough jobs.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;recycling&amp;#34; act extends their VERY useful life-span ANOTHER few</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are just rough enough to give a nice tingly feeling when you scrub down, yet soft and flexible.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the original longer ones, not cheap like swap meet ones.</li>
            <li> These are NOT Salux cloths of Japanese manufacture, but cheap, thin, light Chinese knockoffs.</li>
            <li> You need to get use to these cloths, at first they feel really rough on your skin</li>
            <li> Bought this based on the reviews and the simple fact I need a new washcloth.</li>
            <li> I ordered from this vendor and received a quality product, but beware some vendors on amazon will send you a cheap imitation, I had it happen to me when I tried ordering a different color from a different vendor.</li>
            <li> SEND IT BACK IMMEDIATELY, UNOPENED, FOR A REFUND!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW OF THE ORIGINAL, &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; JAPANESE-MADE CLOTH: .........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WATCH OUT DIRT AND BODY-GREASE...HERE IT COMES!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an almost-all synthetic, long washcloth with a REAL &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; propensity to &amp;#34;sloth&amp;#34; away dead skin, dirt and body oils that leave you feeling &amp;#34;invigorated&amp;#34; after every shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The material is ok, but the weave of it makes it way too tough.</li>
            <li> My wife and I where introduce to the Japanese wash cloths by a friend that travels frequently to Japan.</li>
            <li> but once you get used to them you wont want to go back to the old face cloth to wash your body</li>
            <li> You can vary the amount of tension you use to do anything from a &amp;#34;super scrub&amp;#34; to a barely there soap up and rinse.</li>
            <li> This merchant is a liar and a cheat, and Amazon apparently condones the dishonesty.</li>
            <li> It is not as harsh as a loofah, it suds up like the bath fluffy sponge, but has more exfoliating properties.  </li>
            <li> I have NEVER been disappointed with Amazon (speedy, reliable, great prices) until this purchase.  </li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T buy these if your looking for the original, robust, heavy, rough Salux cloths.</li>
            <li> This is actually quite a large cloth, so I cut mine down and made three: one for my face, one to use in the bath and one to use in the shower at the gym.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin or anything, but I have to barely graze this thing across me when I use it because it is so rough.</li>
            <li> long lasting  not too soft</li>
            <li> Basic product, so no complaints there, but when you order a product that is as light as a few pieces of paper, and it costs less than $3 -</li>
            <li> OMG it felt a little rough at first</li>
            <li> Plenty long enough to wrap around the back of your body from almost any angle, over the shoulder or whatever.</li>
            <li> Hopefully that information helps someone else know if they got the genuine article or a fake.</li>
            <li> These are not the long, high-quality, scrubby shower towels sold by Salux.  </li>
            <li> It is shaped like a long scarf and made from some sort of netting.  </li>
            <li> and I am starting to see improvements in my rough areas.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long</li>
            <li> seemed abit too long</li>
            <li> I will continue to order them and use them for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Just one lasts a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I have really long and dry hair, so</li>
            <li> It is sad that Amazon is showing original Salux cloth picture for this item.  </li>
            <li> After using Salux, I could not go back to using other bath sponges.</li>
            <li> it works better than a loofah, but after a few searches I noticed I had gotten a fake one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually Mr. Natural and Organic kinda guy, but this cloth is an exception.</li>
            <li> Even my perpetually dry knee caps are smoothed out!</li>
            <li> I wanted something to wash my back that was a little bit of a scrubbing cloth.  </li>
            <li> Read carefully.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a ton of bad reviews on here for no reason other than people were trying to be cheap!</li>
            <li> We just recently moved into a very small city that doesn&#x27;t have an Asian market or anything.  </li>
            <li> There are much smaller, less tightly knit, and rougher.  </li>
            <li> I have found that cloth this has definitely smoothed and gotten rid of the small bumps on my skin.</li>
            <li> Extremely dissatisfied with both seller and Amazon.</li>
            <li> These things can be a little rough on your skin with some pressure.</li>
            <li> (especially if you&#x27;re really dirty and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin!!)</li>
            <li> Its durable soaps up extremely well and helps the skin by shedding all that dead skin</li>
            <li> I read previous reviews regarding the knock off, but, I thought once Amazon was informed about the deception to their customers, they would rectify the deception.  </li>
            <li> plus i used much less soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They produce copious amounts of foam from small amounts of almost any body-wash liquid or bar soaps and the cloths, themselves, last me at least a couple of years before they must be replaced (always, because a couple of inches of their ends begin to tear off after that amount of time/usage, during the type of back-scrub motions as exhibited on the package&#x27;s front side)</li>
            <li> Water, a little soap, rub together and scrub your skin.  </li>
            <li> In the past few years I have been unable to find them at my health food store or a local Japanese market.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really rough, so it can be hard to get use to.  </li>
            <li> This is somewhere between a washcloth, a loofah sponge, and a bath fluffy sponge.  </li>
            <li> I used the Korean Italy Cloth a few days ago and tried this for a day to day wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Some might find it too harsh of an exfoliation for the face</li>
            <li> This was the invention of the year in Japan a few years ago and I can see why.</li>
            <li> Scrubs all the dead skin cells off.</li>
            <li> If you have a range of motion problem due to bad joints or large muscles, this product will be an eye opener.</li>
            <li> usually fully-dries in less then</li>
            <li> My breakouts were bad (no tank tops for me in this hot desert)</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve read the reviews, as I usually do on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> For $12 bucks, no big deal, but this has taught me a sad lesson.</li>
            <li> usually i just use my hand and soap.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t rub that hard if it hurts &#x3D;</li>
            <li> If you scrub too hard, you will make your skin hurt like a sunburn.</li>
            <li> well but not too hard</li>
            <li> you had same bad experience with this item, don&#x27;t just like this comment</li>
            <li> They are something called Leyijie - which is thin and decidedly inferior to the Salux.  </li>
            <li> This is my beauty secret.</li>
            <li> The seller is using false advertising...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thin synthetic mesh that drains and dries quickly, so it never smells bad or mildews.</li>
            <li> I am shocked that Amazon still sells these, especially given all the scathing reviews.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the towels that arrived are not even the SALUX brand.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a washing cloth, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m getting a refund.</li>
            <li> They are stiffer and not for the faint of heart, in fact my husband uses the gentler ones, but I like these.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have read the reviews, I got a fake one</li>
            <li> I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> I do not believe it would be any rougher and unpleasant feeling.  </li>
            <li> I hate it when sellers deliberately make a profit on shipping \\&quot;and handling\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This wash cloth is horrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best wash cloth ever.  Holds the soap in for the whole shower.  Saves on soap!</li>
            <li> Received quick, will use this seller again for this product. It&#x27;s the original longer ones, not cheap like swap meet ones. great product love using it. Makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> Those who are downrating this cloth must have very sensitive skin -- I do not find it overly abrasive at all. I have even used this on my face and neck. Just don&#x27;t rub that hard if it hurts &#x3D;P. I have found that cloth this has definitely smoothed and gotten rid of the small bumps on my skin. Even my perpetually dry knee caps are smoothed out! No, this don&#x27;t feel like cloth. Yes, it feels more like a plastic mesh bag than anything; however, it gets the job done, dries fast, is light, and lets you scrub your back to your heart&#x27;s content!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on a review I found from another site, my Salux weighs 1.2 oz -- the correct weight for the real deal. Hopefully that information helps someone else know if they got the genuine article or a fake.</li>
            <li> I found these when I lived in Guam where you could find them in the grocery stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the package picture indicates you can scrub your own back with one quite easily.  That picture sold me back then and am pleased to have found a source now that I live in Tennessee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are just rough enough to give a nice tingly feeling when you scrub down, yet soft and flexible.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived before without this scrub towel. It&#x27;s such a wonderful experience every time I use it.</li>
            <li> These are incorrectly labeled as SALUX brand Japanese towels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see I am not the only reviewer to complain about this and I can&#x27;t believe Amazon hasn&#x27;t done something to reprimand the supplier. I had read great reviews about the Salux towel on another beauty site and didn&#x27;t think to read the Amazon reviews since I&#x27;ve had such success with them in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many others, I received a cheap knock-off brand called \\&quot;Leyijie\\&quot; which was *totally* inferior to the real Salux towel. I know this because I have since purchased from them directly (same price) and was MUCH happier with the real thing. A quick internet search will lead you to the Salux website - buy them there!</li>
            <li> Great product just what I expected. This is not the softy Japanese wash cloth you purchase else where. My wife and I where introduce to the Japanese wash cloths by a friend that travels frequently to Japan. You need to get use to these cloths, at first they feel really rough on your skin but once you get used to them you wont want to go back to the old face cloth to wash your body you wont feel clean.</li>
            <li> It came very fast and is exactly as specified. I haven&#x27;t used &#x27;normal washclothes&#x27; since finding these.  These are the good ones too- super huge and not as  pricey as some others.  They exoliate very well and hold up in the wash great- just wash with towels and let air dry. I highly recommend for anyone wanting much more exfoliation than a normal washcloth or bath pouf.</li>
            <li> I have been using yellow SALUX Nylon Japanese washcloths for about 20 years.  In the past few years I have been unable to find them at my health food store or a local Japanese market.  I was really excited to find them at Amazon and I ordered two.  Unfortunately, the towels that arrived are not even the SALUX brand.  They are something called Leyijie - which is thin and decidedly inferior to the Salux.  Amazon and the vendor should both be embarassed to send this product when Salux is pictured and advertised.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to say thank you to Cp ASiana Inc., for delivering the real deal Salux cloths. I have had many problems ordering authentic ones on amazon, and am happy to finally get another real one. Amazon CS certainly will take care of you if you receive a counterfeit item (Leyjie instead of Salux) but it is a pain to have to report, repackage return, especially when you plan on giving these as gifts, and have a \\&quot;deadline\\&quot;.  That said, I also ordered from KASHAYA INC, and they also provided an authentic item (they had different colors available at the time i ordered). SCS and Toys &amp; Games Etc (as noted in their reviews) have sent me counterfeit items.  The cloth itself is a nylon exfoliating cloth, short enough so that you can grip it easily, but wide enough so that you can clean your back easily. I would not recommend this for the face, but it is excellent at removing dry rough skin everywhere else. They also help lather soaps and body washes. I think they make great hostess gifts, stocking suffers, inexpensive pick me up gifts, and highly recommend them to everyone.</li>
            <li> I am a Salux expert.  I have been using them since I was a toddler and don&#x27;t; go a day without them.  I should&#x27;ve read the reviews, as I usually do on Amazon.  Guess I never suspected people would knock-off a wash cloth.  These are not the long, high-quality, scrubby shower towels sold by Salux.  There are much smaller, less tightly knit, and rougher.  I am shocked that Amazon still sells these, especially given all the scathing reviews.  I have NEVER been disappointed with Amazon (speedy, reliable, great prices) until this purchase.  Extremely dissatisfied with both seller and Amazon.</li>
            <li> The product was mailed a few days after ordering and arrived just fine.  Basic product, so no complaints there, but when you order a product that is as light as a few pieces of paper, and it costs less than $3 - BUT - you get charged $2.25 for shipping!????  I hate it when sellers deliberately make a profit on shipping \\&quot;and handling\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I bought this from the seller &amp;#34;JapanSuperMall&amp;#34; and it was quick and totally authentic wash cloth. I LOVE this product!&lt;br /&gt;It was very cheap and does lather and exfoliate very well compared to loofa, sponges, and those plastic poofballs.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you buy from the correct seller, since I see people complaining about receiving a knock-off.</li>
            <li> This is my fav bathing cloth.. Its durable soaps up extremely well and helps the skin by shedding all that dead skin we as humans accumulate.  It may take some time to get use to using but its worth it.  Just keeping your skin smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> If you have a range of motion problem due to bad joints or large muscles, this product will be an eye opener. Don&#x27;t let other reviews turn you off from trying this simple yet wonderful product. Plenty long enough to wrap around the back of your body from almost any angle, over the shoulder or whatever. With regular use you can eliminate scaly, bumpy and itchy skin on your back or bum. Wrap it around your hand and it makes a great scrub &amp;#34;poof&amp;#34; for the rest of your body. Rinses cleanly out in seconds, fold twice and &amp;#34;whip&amp;#34; the water out of it and it will be almost dry. Because you can whip the water out so easily, it can be hung outside of the shower to completely dry without dripping. Also it doesn&#x27;t grow mildew due to its super fast drying ability. You can vary the amount of tension you use to do anything from a &amp;#34;super scrub&amp;#34; to a barely there soap up and rinse. May seem too aggressive at first but remember you are in control of the pressure you apply. A little practice make perfect. Simple, effective, long lasting and worth every penny of its very reasonable price. You&#x27;ll never use a loofah or brush again, no mildew or handles to break. BONUS: Makes a great washing and scrubbing accessory for household items.</li>
            <li> This is somewhere between a washcloth, a loofah sponge, and a bath fluffy sponge.  It is shaped like a long scarf and made from some sort of netting.  It rinses out very easily.  It is not as harsh as a loofah, it suds up like the bath fluffy sponge, but has more exfoliating properties.  It feels good to scrub on my dry flaky skin.  It is still gentle enough to use on my face.  The best of all worlds.  This is a great invention, and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> The product I received is NOT the product shown in the photo.  I was sent a bootleg, cheap knockoff version of the SALUX cloth.  The packaging is the cheap Chinese knockoff version of the real SALUX cloth packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pissed.</li>
            <li> Read carefully.  If you used original Salux cloth, which is Made In Japan, this is not Salux cloth.  This is a third party brand (Leyjie?) made way as Salux.  It is sad that Amazon is showing original Salux cloth picture for this item.  They have separate sticker made and pasted on this item wrapping with Salux cloth UPC code.  Looks like total fraud.  This cheap item is also Made In China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to replace my 6 months old original Salux cloth.  With just one wash, my 6 months old Salux cloth and this 1 day old cheap knock off looks same.  So, buy at your own risk.  If you used original Salux cloth before, you will know this is not the same and it is cheap.  But this may spoil the value of Salux cloth for new users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you had same bad experience with this item, don&#x27;t just like this comment, please try to post another 1 star review so that it will give some clue to the customers before buying.</li>
            <li> This cloth is the best exfoliator I have used. I ike that I can use it for my back.  It lathers it very good and I am starting to see improvements in my rough areas.  I am looking forward to beautiful smooth skin.</li>
            <li> We just recently moved into a very small city that doesn&#x27;t have an Asian market or anything.  I totally forgot to stock up on this before we moved but I am so glad to have found it online.  I have really long and dry hair, so when I use a thick/creamy conditioner it makes my back breakout (backne, yuck!)  So for 2 months, I had to use a regular pouf that you get at Target/Wal-mart.  It sucked!!!  My breakouts were bad (no tank tops for me in this hot desert) but once I received this, in one week all of it is gone.  It&#x27;s really rough, so it can be hard to get use to.  If you scrub too hard, you will make your skin hurt like a sunburn. Use this softly on gentle areas but put a little more pressure on places you want to exfoliate (knees, elbow, back and chest).  My husband likes to use it on his face but I can&#x27;t.  Totally awesome!!!</li>
            <li> This wash cloth/towel makes your skin feel so smooth and silky.  I highly recommend this to anyone who may have doubts as I did.  It&#x27;s long enough to cleanse the entire back area and suds up wonderfully.  It also dries extremely fast.  But the best part is how soft and silky your entire body is after use.  Give it a try - you will be very pleased you did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and remember the incredible feeling of how this towel left my skin.  After you use this, your skin is energized and extremely smooth.   Water, a little soap, rub together and scrub your skin.  The towel is fairly long so you can get a really good scrub on your back.  It also dries very quickly and really polishes your skin.</li>
            <li> Too scratchy for the face, but otherwise it&#x27;s heaven.  With its texture, using this washcloth on your body and legs is like getting a light massage - stimulating.  It&#x27;s long so you can hold the ends and wash your back and it helps soap make mountains of lather as you use it.  This thing feels especially great when used on your feet.  It&#x27;s thin and very porous, so it rinses clean and dries quickly if hung up after use.  Far superior to a regular cotton washcloth or loofah.</li>
            <li> something to get used to esp with sensiitive skin but the ship was quick,overall good buisness,thanks</li>
            <li> All I can say is I wish I found this sooner, just like most other people say, it makes your skin tingle, and it&#x27;s big enough to grab with both hands and rub your whole back with no problem. Great product!!</li>
            <li> This is a great way to scrub your skin. Funny thing is, it&#x27;s made out of synthetic stuff, a 60/40 nylon/polyester blend. I&#x27;m usually Mr. Natural and Organic kinda guy, but this cloth is an exception. It doesn&#x27;t bother my skin, and it get you REALLY clean. It&#x27;s kind of huge, I&#x27;ve read reviews where people say they cut them in pieces, but I like the long cloth for back scrubbing. They dry fast too, and it is easy to rinse..If you&#x27;re looking for a washing cloth, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> I received some knock off of this in the mail. Needless to say, I&#x27;m getting a refund. I have read reviews about this happening to others, I didn&#x27;t think I would soon become one of them. DO NOT BUY FROM \\&quot;SCS COLLECTIBLES\\&quot;!!!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased skin polishing clothes before, but these are far superior.  They are stiffer and not for the faint of heart, in fact my husband uses the gentler ones, but I like these.  Thank you so much, feeling exfoliated!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.  I have used it before while visiting family and planned on buying one as soon as I got around to it.  I ended up ordering it through Amazon.com.  I am 100 percent delighted with the product and use it every day.  My skin feels amazing and I will continue to use it.  Have not found anything like it anywhere.  This product is well worth it.</li>
            <li> This merchant is a liar and a cheat, and Amazon apparently condones the dishonesty. These are NOT Salux cloths of Japanese manufacture, but cheap, thin, light Chinese knockoffs. I ordered four of them, and when I saw what junk they were, threw them into my bug-out bags for emergency use. I have to reorder the correct cloths for household use. DON&#x27;T buy these if your looking for the original, robust, heavy, rough Salux cloths. For $12 bucks, no big deal, but this has taught me a sad lesson. Amazon descriptions can&#x27;t be trusted, and buying from an Amazon merchant is no guarantee of quality or truthfulness in product descriptions. FYI, on edit, the merchant selling and shipping these on my purchase was Toys &amp; Games, Etc., SCS Collectibles, Inc. Other sellers through Amazon may be more honest in their descriptions of these Salux cloths. I won&#x27;t know, I guess, until I receive the ones I ordered through Amazon from a different merchant. They were a couple of bucks more, so I hope they are the correct SALUX brand items made in Japan.</li>
            <li> I own and purchased a new Salux from Amazon&#x27;s vendor.  However, Like many others, I received a cheap knock-off brand called \\&quot;Leyijie\\&quot; from China, which is inferior to the real Salux towel. I read previous reviews regarding the knock off, but, I thought once Amazon was informed about the deception to their customers, they would rectify the deception.  I was wrong!  I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love Amazon and I am very surprised that they allow this to continue!!!!</li>
            <li> long lasting  not too soft so exfoliates well but not too hard so you feel clean and rejuvenated without having scratches on the skin  only problem i had was the length  seemed abit too long so had to fold it up alot to use it</li>
            <li> Great seller, excellent product, fast delivery. Would reorder.</li>
            <li> Bought this based on the reviews and the simple fact I need a new washcloth. OMG it felt a little rough at first but it exfoliated my back,and body so well. My husband noticed right away when giving me a back rub. He said my back was super soft and smooth....something that I never have. I also lather up with lotion after each shower, but this really made the difference.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have read the reviews, I got a fake one and I&#x27;m torn becuase it works better than a loofah, but after a few searches I noticed I had gotten a fake one. Ugh, never buying form here again. But it is better than a loofah.</li>
            <li> This is a knock-off made in China, not Japan. The packaging looks similar but is a different name brand. The seller is using false advertising... what you get is NOT what the picture depicts. There is no Salux on the packaging but the Leyijie brand only, which is NOT the same thing.</li>
            <li> we wore out one  and are thrilled to find them again! We bought 6!</li>
            <li> I bought this on someones recommendation.I have never used a loofah.This is easy to use and feels so invigorating against the skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this type of wash cloth for about 10 years and I love them. I decided to try these cloths because of the reviews and I found them even better and longer lasting than the ones I had purchased before. I will continue to order them and use them for a long time to come. The size is big and they are sturdy and they exfoliate my skin nicely. (I also have given these as gifts to my family and friends, that is just how much I like them!)</li>
            <li> Love these! They make your skin feel amazing! My roomate thought it was too much for her uber sensitive skin, but I love these!</li>
            <li> I seriously love this thing! It helps with the KP on my arms if I use it faithfully. I feel so clean and scrubbed up after!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  I feel really, really clean when I&#x27;m through with my shower.  And it rinses out so well.  Just one lasts a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I can not take a shower without one of these wash cloths. It exfoliates all dead skin and makes you feel extra clean and fresh. I have been using these since I was 13; I am 34 now!!! Some people might not be able to handle the roughness of the cloth but well worth it if you like to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> This is my beauty secret. I first found thee when I lived in Japan 20 years ago. They ae perfect and keep my skin smooth and polished.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of them things that I can&#x27;t live without. It makes me feel clean and all.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years. I have bought it for me and my family.&lt;br /&gt;It is really long so it is easy to reach the back.&lt;br /&gt;I use it instead of scrub for my body with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Los he usado por a&amp;ntilde;os. Los compro para m&amp;iacute; y mi familia.&lt;br /&gt;Son lo sufientemente largos para alcanzar la espalda f&amp;aacute;cilmente.&lt;br /&gt;Lo uso en vez de exfoliante para el cuerpo con excelentes resultados.</li>
            <li> The Salux Nylon Japanese Bath Wash Cloth Towel is a very good exfoliating wash cloth for your body. It makes your whole body feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, this was not the Salux (Japanese) that I ordered,but the Leyijie Chinese knockoff. Amazon was nice enough to refund the money, but why do they let this seller continue this con? Perhaps some customers just don&#x27;t know the difference.</li>
            <li> i just showered with this thing, and i&#x27;ve never been cleaner. so easy to get my back, and it feels incredible. plus i used much less soap. usually i just use my hand and soap. This is 1000 times better.</li>
            <li> I love it! I had been trying to find this where I live and no body has it. They have some similar but this one works.</li>
            <li> I used the Korean Italy Cloth a few days ago and tried this for a day to day wash cloth. It was a lot rougher than I thought it would be (like sandpaper) but it does lather soap well and my skin was incredibly soft afterwards, even my husband noticed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It accomplishes what other reviews have said, leaving you with amazingly exfoliated soft skin. I can see this being an irritant for people with sensitive skin but if you can stand the grittiness this should replace your current loofah or wash cloth.</li>
            <li> i freaking love this thing! i use it once a week and it gets my skin nice and smooth. i&#x27;ve used bar soap and liquid soap on it and they both lather up equally well. i haven&#x27;t had any issues with smells or anything like that. i would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This wash cloth is wonderful. I cant believe its not being sold in stores everywhere. Perfect length to get your back, amazing exfoliation, great lather. My skin feels soft and silky every time. Some might find it too harsh of an exfoliation for the face but I dont. I dab on some of my face wash on it and its giving me a better exfoliation than any face scrub every has.     I ordered from this vendor and received a quality product, but beware some vendors on amazon will send you a cheap imitation, I had it happen to me when I tried ordering a different color from a different vendor. Dont accept knock offs!</li>
            <li> (JUST BE SURE THAT YOURS-RECEIVED IS A GENUINE &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; PRODUCT, MANUFACTURED IN JAPAN [NOT in China], or its quality WILL NO-WHERE NEARLY MATCH THIS REVIEW)!&lt;br /&gt;If you DO receive a look-alike from an unscrupulous merchant and the package says &amp;#34;Made In China,&amp;#34; !SEND IT BACK IMMEDIATELY, UNOPENED, FOR A REFUND!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW OF THE ORIGINAL, &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; JAPANESE-MADE CLOTH: .........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WATCH OUT DIRT AND BODY-GREASE...HERE IT COMES!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an almost-all synthetic, long washcloth with a REAL &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; propensity to &amp;#34;sloth&amp;#34; away dead skin, dirt and body oils that leave you feeling &amp;#34;invigorated&amp;#34; after every shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They produce copious amounts of foam from small amounts of almost any body-wash liquid or bar soaps and the cloths, themselves, last me at least a couple of years before they must be replaced (always, because a couple of inches of their ends begin to tear off after that amount of time/usage, during the type of back-scrub motions as exhibited on the package&#x27;s front side)...I THEN continue to use the now-shorter, &amp;#34;spent&amp;#34; cloth for house-hold scrubbing of bath-stalls, stoves, ovens, soiled pots/pans, etc. This &amp;#34;recycling&amp;#34; act extends their VERY useful life-span ANOTHER few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It usually fully-dries in less then a couple of hours when hung from its end or draped in its middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S GREAT!! (especially if you&#x27;re really dirty and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin!!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so practical for reaching the areas of your back that you otherwise cannot.</li>
            <li> This is a must for me, no more washrags to shower, is very wide and soo long the perfect thing to scrub your back, come in diferent colors, much better than i expected.&lt;br /&gt;the name is NYLON JAPANESE BEAUTY WASH CLOTH TOWELL, CANT SHOWER WITHOUT IT, GLAD I GOT 2&lt;br /&gt;sara</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a ton of bad reviews on here for no reason other than people were trying to be cheap! Salux rags are fantastic! You will never need another exfoliating anything! Nothing else will make you feel cleaner and have softer skin. If you order from pandora, you will get the real thing! I just received my second rag from them with no problems or knock offs! Maybe  worth spending the extra 75cents so you are not on here complaining about buying from a toy company! This is also the best washrag to use if you are using charcoal or any other black soaps.</li>
            <li> I bought the yellow one and like many others, was sent a rip off brand. You can not list one product and send people another. Amazon needs to look into what is happening here. Change the listing!  This thing works good but a little too good. I love rough exfoliation. I don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin or anything, but I have to barely graze this thing across me when I use it because it is so rough. The material is ok, but the weave of it makes it way too tough. I&#x27;m going to try another brand and see what that one is like.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves these for his shower and has been using them since he traveled to Japan 20 years ago. They really last and leave your skin exfoliated and smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin thanks Salux. I felt the difference after just the second use. I feel so soft and clean all over. I&#x27;m so glad for this amazing find. I use this every other day in the shower with my favorite shower gel or soap. Very good exfoliating agent and it evened out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to wash my back that was a little bit of a scrubbing cloth.  This wash cloth is horrible.  I do not believe it would be any rougher and unpleasant feeling.  It feels much like the scrub side of a sponge.  I should have returned it.</li>
            <li> Love how smooth my skin feels after a good scrub with the SALUX&lt;br /&gt;bath wash cloth. My back feels great too after a back scrub with&lt;br /&gt;the wash cloth. Also the price is such a bargain.</li>
            <li> Best improvement on a washcloth ever. This was the invention of the year in Japan a few years ago and I can see why. A very scratchy fabric, cut extra long so that it&#x27;s easy to wash your back. It&#x27;s a thin synthetic mesh that drains and dries quickly, so it never smells bad or mildews.</li>
            <li> I have never been so exfoliated.</li>
            <li> My father loved this brand so much that he used to ask me to buy Salux for him by the dozens :)</li>
            <li> Scrubs all the dead skin cells off. I love it.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Also great for cleaning bathrooms and other tough jobs. Machine washable and lasts forever.  Nice to have a couple of them.</li>
            <li> I re-sell these at my place of business. I use them and got all my female family members to use it as well. The best in exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by cheaper imitations, Salux is the brand you want. This is much higher quality than your standard loofah, suds just as well and it rinses out much better.</li>
            <li> This is actually quite a large cloth, so I cut mine down and made three: one for my face, one to use in the bath and one to use in the shower at the gym.  Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin feeling smooth and invigorated.  It also makes my shower gel last longer, as only a tiny amount is needed for a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a very good purchase!</li>
            <li> After using Salux, I could not go back to using other bath sponges. I just love it!</li>
            <li> Saw the reviews on Makeup Alley for this so bought it here. I really like it and still have my original.</li>
            <li> I have been using these wash cloths for several years and absolutely love them! This wash cloth is long enough to wash my back and the fabric is excellent for removing the dead skin cells that accumulate on the skin. You don&#x27;t have to use much soap with this cloth and it rinses easily. I use this cloth at home, camping and I take an extra one with me when I am away from home overnight. Several colors to choose from is also a plus.</li>
            <li> These cloths aren&#x27;t quite what a lot of people expect. They&#x27;re textured like loofahs, but are more like a standard washcloth in shape and use. As a result, you get the best of both worlds. They scrub quite well, but don&#x27;t get water-logged. Great for camping, drum corps, vacations, or any other activities where you might want a quickly drying cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware though. These things can be a little rough on your skin with some pressure. I personally like that, but it may not be for you. You&#x27;ll definitely get good exfoliation from it though.</li>
            <li> I have used these since I was a younger kid and have loved them.  These are great and now I don&#x27;t have to go to the specialty store to get them.</li>
            <li> Good thing. Thank you</li>
