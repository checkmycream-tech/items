            <li>In exchange for an honest review, I received a discount price.</li>
            <li>and this really makes my skin feel wonderful.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and is perfect for my age group, over 60.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve not been able to find anything  that works as well as this does (with the price I&#x27;ve tried so many things!).  </li>
            <li>Thanks Dermalogica for a wonderful product and Amazon for making it more affordable and easy to order!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used almost every face lotion out there, and this is by far the best for my skin.</li>
            <li>This is the richest most effective moisturizer on the market.</li>

            <li>Amazing rich lotion!</li>
            <li>I blend this with the Smart Age Primer and it gives my face a beautiful glow!&lt;br /&gt;Until</li>
            <li>A great product at a very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is rich and very hydrating, just perfect for the winter weather.</li>
            <li>Stayed true to this product for two weeks, their cleanser and barrier repair were good finds for me.</li>
            <li>The product is awesome and it is exactly what it is \\&quot;super rich\\&quot; and I will love using this in the winter</li>
            <li>good and quick delivery</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it during the day during warm months because it&#x27;s very rich, but it&#x27;s perfect for winter during the day and it can be used at night all year long.</li>
            <li>The age smart is great for me</li>
            <li>I can see a huge change in my skin!</li>

            <li>Love Dermalogica products.</li>

            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a product that works better.</li>
            <li>I think this works better around my eyes than their eye serum.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>SO MOST TIMES, I ALSO SPRAY</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not sure that it provides any wrinkle reductions prevention</li>
            <li>It is in my pile of stuff that I am not using any more for I started getting pimples</li>
            <li>This is my favorite nighttime moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>My favorite ultra dense moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I use more than I probably should.</li>

            <li>I love this as my overnight lotion.</li>
            <li>I love dermalogica</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 66, and I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>It is very rich.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is so nice and rich.  </li>
            <li>(I know it sounds strange, but that&#x27;s the best way I can describe it).  </li>

            <li>My favorite, Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>The Age Smart line from Dermalogica is a nice surprise for me.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Demalogica Super Rich.  </li>
            <li>The super rich cream is great for anyone suffering from hydration and the skin is soft and rested in the morning.</li>
            <li>The texture of the cream is not too greasy and it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>It is a fabulous, acid-free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Had a great facial 4 years ago and girl recommended Dermalogica products.</li>
            <li>Gluten free too.</li>
            <li>Feels great and last all night.  </li>
            <li>but I wake up with smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Lavender scented so if you don&#x27;t enjoy, you may want to skip this product.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product and it was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I use it every day and it keeps my skin hydrated and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I very rarely use this.</li>
            <li>the Dermalogica Age Smart Super Rich Repair did not do anything, did not moisturize, it has some kind of chemical smell to it...</li>
            <li>As a result, you end up using more and more of the product to try make sure you&#x27;ve covered your entire face.      </li>
            <li>It is worth the price!</li>
            <li>Rich moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Every ones skin is different, this Dermalogica Age Smart line of skin care is very good.</li>
            <li>It is great for my driest of dry areas.  </li>
            <li>Great product for overly dry skin.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer has a clean scent and it is a richer cream that makes my skin glow.  </li>
            <li>Returned the product today and went back to good ole &#x27;cheap&#x27; eucerin sp?</li>
            <li>This is my saver, especcialy for my dry and sensetive skin in winter time, superb product, highly recomend it.</li>
            <li>Love this Age Smart line.  </li>
            <li>Dermalogica Special Cleansing Gel 8.4 oz/250 ml]]</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich but not sticky and absorbs vey quickly.</li>
            <li>I was using Dermalogica&#x27;s Skin Smoothing Cream until my derm told me to try the Super Rich Repair for a heavier moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I really like that this cream contains relatively safe chemicals (it scored 3 in the Cosmetic Database that is managed by EWG).</li>
            <li>Although , this product probably does wonderful things, I found it way too thick.</li>
            <li>and I have gone on to the full size of this product.</li>
            <li>Live in very dry climate and this is the best lotion I have found to keep my skin moist.</li>
            <li>I PREVIOUSLY HAD TRIED IT, LOVED IT AND LOVE</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich, but not greasy and easy to apply and very moisturising.</li>
            <li>my skin is more hydrated and it&#x27;s glowing love this face product, i will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>and I remain loyal.</li>
            <li>Absolutly no tightness, absorbs quickly without leaving your face shiny.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this for the day time because it&#x27;s way too oily and makes your face super shiny.</li>
            <li>By the way, the seller was super fast, I received the product very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to pump out of container &amp; very  hydrating for my aging skin.  </li>
            <li>Dermalogica Age Smart Super Rich Repair 1.7 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick - perfect for nighttime repair.  </li>
            <li>, this is a rich cream and in most cases would be too much for warmer more humid weather use, but it does the trick during dry, winter weather&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I was using it during the day and at night, and it made my skin more soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is a bit pricey but worth it...</li>
            <li>So to me, it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have been using Dermalogica products for several years now and have been more or less happy with them.  </li>
            <li>No other cream did such a good job for me in terms of keeping my dry skin in a good condition.  </li>
            <li>This is a really great product for my dry, sensitive and aging skin.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and my foundation easily absorbs and sets.</li>
            <li>During that time, my bathroom cabinets were filled with products that I was fortunate to sample and get at cost from the different beauty suppliers we used.</li>
            <li>It is by far the most intense moisturizer that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>because it is very gentle on my skin, while cleaning thoroughly.</li>
            <li>As I get older, it is keeping many of the wrinkles away and leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>cuz its hot weathr.</li>
            <li>My skin has stayed smooth and clear as a result.</li>
            <li>I have used so many different products in my lifetime and NOTHING works like this crème.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;MY FACE FIRST WITH THEIR ANTIOXIDANT HYDRATOR;</li>
            <li>After the first day, I thought the reaction must be to something I ate</li>
            <li>When your skin is particularly in need of super hydration, this is your product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, have been faithfully using it day and night for several years.  </li>
            <li>it is a super cream, it is not thick, as in gooey..</li>
            <li>I use it along my favorite Dermalogica products from the AGE Smart line and their basic line:  </li>
            <li>Putting this lotion on my clean face and neck makes my skin feel like it is enveloped in luxury and leaves my skin feeling so soft without clogging my pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, Super Rich Repair was definitely not worth the price and the hassle of using it, although it was an effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Since I am not getting any younger, I decided to try the Super Rich Repair from the AGE Smart line as a night time moisturizer.     </li>
            <li>skin is sensitive, so I also use Dermalogica&#x27;s Special Cleansing Gel, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Their products are all very good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Obvious used returned product, not even full container!</li>
            <li>I love this product I first used a sampler and then purchased a big size I love this product I went on to buy other items!</li>
            <li>Leaves my face super moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>These Age Smart products are just what I needed.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Dermalogica Age Smart products for 2 years</li>
            <li>After 5 frustrating years and great expense seeking a product to seriously moisturize dry hypersensitive skin,  I found that applying Dermatologica&#x27;s Super Rich Repair over Estee Lauder&#x27;s Verite Cream over night is extremely effective!</li>
            <li>Although price does not matter to me when it comes to skin care and Super Rich wins hands down!</li>
            <li>It does not make me break out and feels very soothing on my skin.</li>
            <li>so I use this stuff on both my hands and face at night and it really does the job.</li>
            <li>This has worked very well for me during the winter months.</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>I think there&#x27;s something in this moisturizer that really works.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I dislike the fact you cannot tell how much is in the container.  </li>
            <li>No breakouts and really like the creamy texture.</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>that I am out of the industry and pay retail cost for all of my hair and beauty products, I am very picky about what products I do purchase, know what to look for and know when something works well for me.</li>
            <li>and it is very soothing to use.</li>
            <li>This is a very neutral smelling, skin calming moisturizer.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m done in the shower my face is ready for make-up.  </li>
            <li>To me it&#x27;s very soothing almost like a lavender scent.</li>
            <li>This is so moisturizing and really a treat to put on-</li>
            <li>I use the Age smart Dynamic skin for day lotion and the special cleansing gel too.</li>
            <li>This product is true to it&#x27;s name, \\&quot;super rich\\&quot;, it is thick and rich.  </li>
            <li>I like this cream although it is rich and should only be used at night.  </li>
            <li>This product is rich and last all day!</li>
            <li>Fragrance free, rich texture, long lasting.</li>
            <li>Multi-active toner, Daily Resurfacing Cleanser, Special Cleansing Gel.  </li>
            <li>This is a heavy cream - great for my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>So many cosmetics that are safe unfortunately don&#x27;t work very well, but this is not the case.</li>
            <li>So, I have tried and used more beauty products than the average bear over the years.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the shipping time, but the cost is much less than you can find in retail stores or on the manufacturer website.</li>
            <li>but this is better than la Mer at half the price.</li>
            <li>Usually I have been very happy with the product in the past.</li>
            <li>I abolutely love it and have been using it for the last several months.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very emolient so most of the time, I leave it on for a few minutes before applying make-up.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to get older, and this very thick facial conditioner is perfect at night to keep the wrinkles in check.  </li>
            <li>And if your skin is the slightest bit damp (right after washing), the water actually repels the moisturizer and it more or less evaporates while you&#x27;re trying to apply to your face</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and I&#x27;ve found with consistent use, my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>have been using Dermalogica&#x27;s Age Smart Super Rich Repair after receiving a sample from an aesthetician after a facial a few years ago.</li>
            <li>For my super sensitive skin, Dermalogica is the only beauty lotion and make-up</li>
            <li>I had a growth next to my right eye that looked like a skin tag.  </li>
            <li>This is one of Dermalogica&#x27;s product I can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still new to using this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This is my second bottle, as I didnt want to invest too much money (it is comparable to department stores) in a new skin care program (have many half used bottles in storage).</li>
            <li>It works quickly for dry skin caused by winter dryness/ indoor heat.</li>
            <li>I discovered Dermalogica products via a local beauty salon and was reluctant first to try their products, thinking that they would try to &#x27;push&#x27; me to buy it to make profit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Have tried many other brands and keep coming back to this.</li>
            <li>Your skin will be so soft and refreshed in the morning!</li>
            <li>Very little is needed when applying over the night serum and your face will feel amazing and hydrated the next morning.  </li>
            <li>This night cream is super rich and it only takes a little so it is econmical, too!  </li>
            <li>I first tried this at a spa after skiing and it was very soothing for my very dry, sunburned and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>im only 31 and started using this product because my skin was getting dry, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference on my face</li>
            <li>Typically you can make a tube/tub/pump of Dermalogica last for more than 6 months -</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to manage a large salon and spa for several years.</li>
            <li>Super heavy, greasy moisturizer that leaves my face looking far from fresh the next day, and breaks me out.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so clean and soft unlike any other cleansing exfoliating scrub!</li>
            <li>but this product keeps my skin young and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I am 44 years old but my skin does not show that😊.</li>
            <li>Brought it for my mum who is in her early 60s.</li>
            <li>I can go straight to Target and get Olay 7 and start using it the same day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know which one I opened but suffice it to say that it was an old jar.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and have had no reactions to Dermalogica.</li>
            <li>I am 51 yrs old.</li>
            <li>You would think that  it would make your skin soft.  </li>
            <li>My skin was freaking out because I kept trying natural products.</li>
            <li>and my face is soft and just how it was before going to bed.</li>
            <li>I have eczema, adult acne, and sun spots.</li>
            <li>Leaves cleansed skin soft and touchable...</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and fine lines are less apparent.  </li>
            <li>Too thick and &#x27;sits&#x27; on top of my skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe even a little too rich.  </li>
            <li>The skin on my nose especially on the sides always gets super dry.</li>
            <li>I sometimes follow with a light toner depending on whether I wore make-up that day and how much, and I also usually put a booster or serum of some sort on my face before or with this moisturizer to further enhance the anti-aging effects, along with eye cream.</li>
            <li>The jar configuration was of the old type compared to the new one I last used.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate, and have looked everywhere for a product that is rich enough for my mature, dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Just a small drop does the trick for smooth, hydrated skin.</li>
            <li>Works really well on aging, dry skin.</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be on the dry side, especially with the hot spring and summer we&#x27;ve had here in the Seattle area.</li>
            <li>It put elasticity back in my 44 year old Florida tanned skin.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product that has made my skin completely quenched.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my face extremely soft the next morning!!</li>
            <li>It is not cheap, but it is called &amp;#34;super rich&amp;#34; for a reason: a little goes a really long way when you apply to a clean fresh face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am older (60) and have very dry skin.</li>
            <li>but I have to find their cream for summer use because it is too thick and rich.  </li>
            <li>The only negative is that it makes your skin super shiny and feels wet, so I can only put it on right before bed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 46, live in a dry region and have combination normal/dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It also makes my make up go on even, no dry patches so make up doesn&#x27;t cake.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin which breaks out if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li>First of all, this product is a seriously heavy moisturizer -</li>
            <li>I usually get 3 months worth of applications from one dispenser/jar.  </li>
            <li>The product is very expensive but a little goes a long way and quite frankly when you have been through everything that I have with products who cares how much it costs, I am just so happy that I finally found something that works.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and mostly dry</li>
            <li>The amount you will get is not much though, so its very pricey and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>My skin is very dry &amp; sensitive and I&#x27;m in my mid 60s</li>
            <li>somehow, Dermalogica does not work for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;also, no expiration on product, hard to tell how fresh when buy from not a Dermalogica site.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is indeed rich, so I only use it at night, but so far I really do like it; especially during these cold dry winter months.</li>

            <li> and this really makes my skin feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and is perfect for my age group, over 60.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve not been able to find anything  that works as well as this does (with the price I&#x27;ve tried so many things!).  </li>
            <li> Thanks Dermalogica for a wonderful product and Amazon for making it more affordable and easy to order!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost every face lotion out there, and this is by far the best for my skin.</li>

            <li> A great product at a very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is rich and very hydrating, just perfect for the winter weather.</li>
            <li> Stayed true to this product for two weeks, their cleanser and barrier repair were good finds for me.</li>
            <li> The product is awesome and it is exactly what it is \\&quot;super rich\\&quot; and I will love using this in the winter</li>
            <li> good and quick delivery</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it during the day during warm months because it&#x27;s very rich, but it&#x27;s perfect for winter during the day and it can be used at night all year long.</li>
            <li> The age smart is great for me</li>
            <li> I can see a huge change in my skin!</li>

            <li> Love Dermalogica products.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a product that works better.</li>
            <li> I think this works better around my eyes than their eye serum.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> SO MOST TIMES, I ALSO SPRAY</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not sure that it provides any wrinkle reductions prevention</li>
            <li> It is in my pile of stuff that I am not using any more for I started getting pimples</li>
            <li> This is my favorite nighttime moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> My favorite ultra dense moisturizer.  </li>

            <li> I love dermalogica</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66, and I love this cream.  </li>
            <li> It is very rich.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is so nice and rich.  </li>
            <li> (I know it sounds strange, but that&#x27;s the best way I can describe it).  </li>
            <li> Excellent night time moisturizer for dehydrated hyper-sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li> This product provides the perfect pampering for my dry skin zone</li>

            <li> And Did reduce fine lines.  </li>
            <li> My favorite, Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> The Age Smart line from Dermalogica is a nice surprise for me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Demalogica Super Rich.  </li>
            <li> The super rich cream is great for anyone suffering from hydration and the skin is soft and rested in the morning.</li>
            <li> The texture of the cream is not too greasy and it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> It is a fabulous, acid-free moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Had a great facial 4 years ago and girl recommended Dermalogica products.</li>
            <li> Gluten free too.</li>
            <li> Feels great and last all night.  </li>
            <li> but I wake up with smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Lavender scented so if you don&#x27;t enjoy, you may want to skip this product.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product and it was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day and it keeps my skin hydrated and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I very rarely use this.</li>
            <li> the Dermalogica Age Smart Super Rich Repair did not do anything, did not moisturize, it has some kind of chemical smell to it...</li>
            <li> As a result, you end up using more and more of the product to try make sure you&#x27;ve covered your entire face.      </li>
            <li> It is worth the price!</li>
            <li> Rich moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Every ones skin is different, this Dermalogica Age Smart line of skin care is very good.</li>
            <li> It is great for my driest of dry areas.  </li>
            <li> Great product for overly dry skin.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has a clean scent and it is a richer cream that makes my skin glow.  </li>
            <li> Returned the product today and went back to good ole &#x27;cheap&#x27; eucerin sp?</li>
            <li> This is my saver, especcialy for my dry and sensetive skin in winter time, superb product, highly recomend it.</li>
            <li> Love this Age Smart line.  </li>
            <li> Dermalogica Special Cleansing Gel 8.4 oz/250 ml]]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich but not sticky and absorbs vey quickly.</li>
            <li> I was using Dermalogica&#x27;s Skin Smoothing Cream until my derm told me to try the Super Rich Repair for a heavier moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really like that this cream contains relatively safe chemicals (it scored 3 in the Cosmetic Database that is managed by EWG).</li>
            <li> Although , this product probably does wonderful things, I found it way too thick.</li>
            <li> and I have gone on to the full size of this product.</li>
            <li> Live in very dry climate and this is the best lotion I have found to keep my skin moist.</li>
            <li> I PREVIOUSLY HAD TRIED IT, LOVED IT AND LOVE</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich, but not greasy and easy to apply and very moisturising.</li>
            <li> my skin is more hydrated and it&#x27;s glowing love this face product, i will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> and I remain loyal.</li>
            <li> Absolutly no tightness, absorbs quickly without leaving your face shiny.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this for the day time because it&#x27;s way too oily and makes your face super shiny.</li>
            <li> By the way, the seller was super fast, I received the product very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to pump out of container &amp; very  hydrating for my aging skin.  </li>
            <li> Dermalogica Age Smart Super Rich Repair 1.7 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick - perfect for nighttime repair.  </li>
            <li> , this is a rich cream and in most cases would be too much for warmer more humid weather use, but it does the trick during dry, winter weather&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I was using it during the day and at night, and it made my skin more soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a bit pricey but worth it...</li>
            <li> So to me, it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dermalogica products for several years now and have been more or less happy with them.  </li>
            <li> No other cream did such a good job for me in terms of keeping my dry skin in a good condition.  </li>
            <li> This is a really great product for my dry, sensitive and aging skin.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and my foundation easily absorbs and sets.</li>
            <li> During that time, my bathroom cabinets were filled with products that I was fortunate to sample and get at cost from the different beauty suppliers we used.</li>
            <li> It is by far the most intense moisturizer that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> because it is very gentle on my skin, while cleaning thoroughly.</li>
            <li> As I get older, it is keeping many of the wrinkles away and leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> cuz its hot weathr.</li>
            <li> My skin has stayed smooth and clear as a result.</li>
            <li> I have used so many different products in my lifetime and NOTHING works like this crème.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;MY FACE FIRST WITH THEIR ANTIOXIDANT HYDRATOR;</li>
            <li> After the first day, I thought the reaction must be to something I ate</li>
            <li> When your skin is particularly in need of super hydration, this is your product.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, have been faithfully using it day and night for several years.  </li>
            <li> it is a super cream, it is not thick, as in gooey..</li>
            <li> I use it along my favorite Dermalogica products from the AGE Smart line and their basic line:  </li>
            <li> Putting this lotion on my clean face and neck makes my skin feel like it is enveloped in luxury and leaves my skin feeling so soft without clogging my pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, Super Rich Repair was definitely not worth the price and the hassle of using it, although it was an effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Since I am not getting any younger, I decided to try the Super Rich Repair from the AGE Smart line as a night time moisturizer.     </li>
            <li> skin is sensitive, so I also use Dermalogica&#x27;s Special Cleansing Gel, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Their products are all very good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Obvious used returned product, not even full container!</li>
            <li> I love this product I first used a sampler and then purchased a big size I love this product I went on to buy other items!</li>
            <li> Leaves my face super moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> These Age Smart products are just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Dermalogica Age Smart products for 2 years</li>
            <li> After 5 frustrating years and great expense seeking a product to seriously moisturize dry hypersensitive skin,  I found that applying Dermatologica&#x27;s Super Rich Repair over Estee Lauder&#x27;s Verite Cream over night is extremely effective!</li>
            <li> Although price does not matter to me when it comes to skin care and Super Rich wins hands down!</li>
            <li> It does not make me break out and feels very soothing on my skin.</li>
            <li> so I use this stuff on both my hands and face at night and it really does the job.</li>
            <li> This has worked very well for me during the winter months.</li>
            <li> This works very well.</li>
            <li> I think there&#x27;s something in this moisturizer that really works.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I dislike the fact you cannot tell how much is in the container.  </li>
            <li> No breakouts and really like the creamy texture.</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> that I am out of the industry and pay retail cost for all of my hair and beauty products, I am very picky about what products I do purchase, know what to look for and know when something works well for me.</li>
            <li> and it is very soothing to use.</li>
            <li> This is a very neutral smelling, skin calming moisturizer.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done in the shower my face is ready for make-up.  </li>
            <li> To me it&#x27;s very soothing almost like a lavender scent.</li>
            <li> This is so moisturizing and really a treat to put on-</li>
            <li> I use the Age smart Dynamic skin for day lotion and the special cleansing gel too.</li>
            <li> This product is true to it&#x27;s name, \\&quot;super rich\\&quot;, it is thick and rich.  </li>
            <li> I like this cream although it is rich and should only be used at night.  </li>
            <li> This product is rich and last all day!</li>
            <li> Fragrance free, rich texture, long lasting.</li>
            <li> Multi-active toner, Daily Resurfacing Cleanser, Special Cleansing Gel.  </li>
            <li> This is a heavy cream - great for my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> So many cosmetics that are safe unfortunately don&#x27;t work very well, but this is not the case.</li>
            <li> So, I have tried and used more beauty products than the average bear over the years.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the shipping time, but the cost is much less than you can find in retail stores or on the manufacturer website.</li>
            <li> but this is better than la Mer at half the price.</li>
            <li> Usually I have been very happy with the product in the past.</li>
            <li> I abolutely love it and have been using it for the last several months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very emolient so most of the time, I leave it on for a few minutes before applying make-up.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to get older, and this very thick facial conditioner is perfect at night to keep the wrinkles in check.  </li>
            <li> And if your skin is the slightest bit damp (right after washing), the water actually repels the moisturizer and it more or less evaporates while you&#x27;re trying to apply to your face</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and I&#x27;ve found with consistent use, my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> have been using Dermalogica&#x27;s Age Smart Super Rich Repair after receiving a sample from an aesthetician after a facial a few years ago.</li>
            <li> For my super sensitive skin, Dermalogica is the only beauty lotion and make-up</li>
            <li> I had a growth next to my right eye that looked like a skin tag.  </li>
            <li> This is one of Dermalogica&#x27;s product I can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still new to using this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This is my second bottle, as I didnt want to invest too much money (it is comparable to department stores) in a new skin care program (have many half used bottles in storage).</li>
            <li> It works quickly for dry skin caused by winter dryness/ indoor heat.</li>
            <li> I discovered Dermalogica products via a local beauty salon and was reluctant first to try their products, thinking that they would try to &#x27;push&#x27; me to buy it to make profit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Have tried many other brands and keep coming back to this.</li>
            <li> Your skin will be so soft and refreshed in the morning!</li>
            <li> Very little is needed when applying over the night serum and your face will feel amazing and hydrated the next morning.  </li>
            <li> This night cream is super rich and it only takes a little so it is econmical, too!  </li>
            <li> I first tried this at a spa after skiing and it was very soothing for my very dry, sunburned and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> im only 31 and started using this product because my skin was getting dry, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference on my face</li>
            <li> Typically you can make a tube/tub/pump of Dermalogica last for more than 6 months -</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to manage a large salon and spa for several years.</li>
            <li> Super heavy, greasy moisturizer that leaves my face looking far from fresh the next day, and breaks me out.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so clean and soft unlike any other cleansing exfoliating scrub!</li>
            <li> but this product keeps my skin young and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I am 44 years old but my skin does not show that😊.</li>
            <li> Brought it for my mum who is in her early 60s.</li>
            <li> I can go straight to Target and get Olay 7 and start using it the same day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know which one I opened but suffice it to say that it was an old jar.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have had no reactions to Dermalogica.</li>
            <li> I am 51 yrs old.</li>
            <li> You would think that  it would make your skin soft.  </li>
            <li> My skin was freaking out because I kept trying natural products.</li>
            <li> and my face is soft and just how it was before going to bed.</li>
            <li> I have eczema, adult acne, and sun spots.</li>
            <li> Leaves cleansed skin soft and touchable...</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and fine lines are less apparent.  </li>
            <li> Too thick and &#x27;sits&#x27; on top of my skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe even a little too rich.  </li>
            <li> The skin on my nose especially on the sides always gets super dry.</li>
            <li> I sometimes follow with a light toner depending on whether I wore make-up that day and how much, and I also usually put a booster or serum of some sort on my face before or with this moisturizer to further enhance the anti-aging effects, along with eye cream.</li>
            <li> The jar configuration was of the old type compared to the new one I last used.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate, and have looked everywhere for a product that is rich enough for my mature, dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Just a small drop does the trick for smooth, hydrated skin.</li>
            <li> Works really well on aging, dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be on the dry side, especially with the hot spring and summer we&#x27;ve had here in the Seattle area.</li>
            <li> It put elasticity back in my 44 year old Florida tanned skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product that has made my skin completely quenched.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my face extremely soft the next morning!!</li>
            <li> It is not cheap, but it is called &amp;#34;super rich&amp;#34; for a reason: a little goes a really long way when you apply to a clean fresh face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am older (60) and have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> but I have to find their cream for summer use because it is too thick and rich.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that it makes your skin super shiny and feels wet, so I can only put it on right before bed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46, live in a dry region and have combination normal/dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It also makes my make up go on even, no dry patches so make up doesn&#x27;t cake.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin which breaks out if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li> First of all, this product is a seriously heavy moisturizer -</li>
            <li> I usually get 3 months worth of applications from one dispenser/jar.  </li>
            <li> The product is very expensive but a little goes a long way and quite frankly when you have been through everything that I have with products who cares how much it costs, I am just so happy that I finally found something that works.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and mostly dry</li>
            <li> The amount you will get is not much though, so its very pricey and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry &amp; sensitive and I&#x27;m in my mid 60s</li>
            <li> somehow, Dermalogica does not work for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;also, no expiration on product, hard to tell how fresh when buy from not a Dermalogica site.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is indeed rich, so I only use it at night, but so far I really do like it; especially during these cold dry winter months.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and rich</li>
            <li> It would be for very dry skin but not extremely helpful for eczema and redness.  </li>
            <li> The bottle will last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> Also, this product does not last very long.  </li>
            <li> I am a few years from 40 and have spent too much time in the sun in my 20s.  </li>
            <li> At long last I now have the solution to dry flaky skin!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews because they take too long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a long time.</li>
            <li> have been using this for a long time now.</li>
            <li> Unlike other brands that sell anti-aging products based on medical research this one does not provoke allergic reactions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had seriously dry skin this winter.  </li>
            <li> I tend to use in summer AND winter because my skin is so dry.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks really dry since I started using this product and I will never buy it again.  </li>
            <li> Because my skin is dry</li>
            <li> I kept having reactions including hives and extremely dry areas with even flaking.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> the last few months, I was never one to cleanse or moisturizer my face on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Its heavy duty without breaking out my skin, and I know of no other lotion that does that.</li>
            <li> I live in Nevada and it&#x27;s really dry here, so to have products do as advertised is sometimes hard to find.  </li>
            <li> My skin is transforming into the over 40-club; and the typical creams, lotions and moisturizers were NOT enough, or were TOO greasy</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be dry and dull and this product has completely solved those issues.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 8 or 9 years now, I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I use everyday, but it last, I buy maybe 2 a year.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.  </li>
            <li> It it thick, emollient and soothing, even for sensitive skin, but never greasy.</li>
            <li> Goes on thick and creamy however, is not heavy on the my skin.</li>
            <li> know Dermalogica might run a little on the expensive side, but it&#x27;s highly worth it!</li>
            <li> Now granted I am, obviously, sensitive but that was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> so you only need to use a small amount of it every time.  </li>
            <li> Now, however, I make a conscious effort to at least cleanse &amp; moisturize daily and use the mask at least twice a week.</li>
            <li> No scent and you only need a small dollop.</li>
            <li> It is pricy but you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple other of their products (eye cream and repair serum) and had no problem.  </li>
            <li> Only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> Plus, a little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> It definitely moisturizes, but feels icky.</li>
            <li> I have used it for at least 4 years &amp; actually ran out this morning to my surprise.  </li>
            <li> The real con is that it is expensive.  </li>
            <li> I only use this at night because it is so thick</li>
            <li> Night use recommended only as it is quite thick.  </li>
            <li> I typically use Active Moist as my daytime moisturizer, but needed something a little heavier for night time.  </li>
            <li> so you only need a very small amount.</li>
            <li> I brought this from Amazon as the previous one has been used up.</li>
            <li> The oil in the jar was also separated from the cream somewhat and it had a slightly rancid smell when applied to the face.</li>
            <li> Been using line about a month and a half...</li>
            <li> I used this for less than two weeks, and the growth disappeared.  </li>
            <li> IT WAS LESS MONEY FROM AMAZON!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> LESS USAGE AND EASIER TO GET ON.  </li>
            <li> gave it 4 stars  but would give it a 5 star rating  if it were less</li>
            <li> like I do because it is slightly on the oily side.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of products for my acne and spots, and this calms my skin down at night and allows it to recover after heavy washing etc.</li>
            <li> This does the trick for battling dry skin, especially during the cold, dry months.</li>
            <li> (I have combination skin, T-zone is a little oily).</li>
            <li> I buy this about four times a year so a little over $200.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer goes on a little oily, but your skin will absorb it within 10 mins.</li>
            <li> it is a little pricey</li>
            <li> Just a little heavy for my skin type.</li>
            <li> A little bit heavy for 40&#x27;s ages.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years.  </li>
            <li> If you want a heavy moisturizer (they describe it as a balm on Dermalogica&#x27;s website)</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day, almost everyday</li>
            <li> Mutivaitamin Recovery Masque, Multivitamin Thermofoliant,  Multivitamin Power Firm, Intensive Eye Repair, Skin Smoothing Cream.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my skin, makes it feel greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not to heavy for daytime under foundation.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products even ones more expensive but this still is the winner!!!</li>
            <li> She has dry &amp; dull skin, and has been using this product for the past 6 months.</li>
            <li> I would especially recommend this product for winter (cold and dry season).</li>
            <li> and this winter has been so dry that my skin has been tough to moisturize.</li>
            <li> (felt so sick anyway) and used the cream again the 2nd night - BIG MISTAKE!!!!</li>
            <li> It is a little thick</li>
            <li> HAVE SEEN A DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE IN MY DRY SKIN.  </li>
            <li> Having said that, if you have dried up skin, THIS IS THE ONE TO ORDER!</li>
            <li> For some reason my forehead would usually breakout in a rash when the product would not agree with my skin.  </li>
            <li> I went to a dermatologist for help but after 5 visits later I realized she was useless.  </li>
            <li> I had small psoriasis areas on my face.</li>
            <li> I usually order this product every 21/2 months</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t get past these products.</li>
            <li> Yes this product I am not sure about.</li>
            <li> and I am not sure if this is causing the pimples.</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive, so I trade off days with CereVe facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Like a medicinal scent but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> For my age I have very few wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Last year I suffered wind burn while running in the cold weather.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late</li>
            <li> It is really thick, which is just what I need.</li>
            <li> IT IS THICK,</li>
            <li> This crème is so thick you can&#x27;t even rub it in.  </li>
            <li> (I say that because sometimes, I get too tired and lazy)  </li>
            <li> either crazy congested or so dry it&#x27;s peeling skin</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I live in Minnesota and the harsh cold, dry air is terrible on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is very thick</li>
            <li> It also is very thick (which I like), so I wouldn&#x27;t use it during the daytime.</li>
            <li> In the last few years (3 years) I have tried a number of moisturizers with no luck or horrible results.  </li>
            <li> I was not happy with the product that I received.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen several people on blogs say they hate the smell.  </li>
            <li> but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Their products lead to visible results and considering their effect on the skin, they are not even that expensive.</li>
            <li> It was difficult after washing my face to apply this product.</li>
            <li> But this was HORRIBLE - fever &amp; hives over my entire body!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got difficult</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product!</li>
            <li> The downside is that it is the consistency of tar and almost impossible to spread evenly over your face.  </li>
            <li> Not too bad.</li>
            <li> If so, you have a bad product.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed...</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Dermalogica products, but this is the worst one I have ever tried.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just a little heavy for my skin type.</li>
            <li> Super heavy, greasy moisturizer that leaves my face looking far from fresh the next day, and breaks me out. I like several Dermalogica products, but this one doesn&#x27;t react well with my combo skin. I&#x27;ve had it for about 1.5 years and can&#x27;t seem to finish the bottle!</li>
            <li> Maybe even a little too rich.  It is great for my driest of dry areas.  The bottle will last me a long time.  When I use it up I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Beware! Obvious used returned product, not even full container!</li>
            <li> im only 31 and started using this product because my skin was getting dry, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference on my face my skin is more hydrated and it&#x27;s glowing love this face product, i will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Works well. My skin is very dry &amp; sensitive and I&#x27;m in my mid 60s I use it at night and it keeps my skin feeling great. One of the best I ever used. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and mostly dry but this product keeps my skin young and hydrated. I am 44 years old but my skin does not show that😊. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product! All dermalogica products are awesome!</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer! It&#x27;s rich but not sticky and absorbs vey quickly. I only use it at night. A little goes a long way, and I&#x27;ve found with consistent use, my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking I could use it for either the summer or winter but I was wrong.  The product is awesome and it is exactly what it is \\&quot;super rich\\&quot; and I will love using this in the winter but I have to find their cream for summer use because it is too thick and rich.  Having said that, if you have dried up skin, THIS IS THE ONE TO ORDER!</li>
            <li> Items arrived with the box and a plastic wrapped over it. Brought it for my mum who is in her early 60s. She has dry &amp; dull skin, and has been using this product for the past 6 months. I brought this from Amazon as the previous one has been used up. She applies this product on a daily basis, before she goes to bed. The texture of the cream is not too greasy and it is fragrance free. It is a little thick so you only need to use a small amount of it every time.  Overall, she felt this product regains her skin elasticity  and also hydrates her skin perfectly. She loves this product and it is a must have item for her.</li>
            <li> This Dermalogica product is a must in my collection. I have used it for years and I remain loyal. It is a fabulous, acid-free moisturizer. It it thick, emollient and soothing, even for sensitive skin, but never greasy. I use it over an exfoliating cream at night. My skin drinks it up.</li>
            <li> Had a great facial 4 years ago and girl recommended Dermalogica products. I switched and never went back!  I use the Age smart Dynamic skin for day lotion and the special cleansing gel too.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dermalogica products for several years now and have been more or less happy with them.  I typically use Active Moist as my daytime moisturizer, but needed something a little heavier for night time.  Since I am not getting any younger, I decided to try the Super Rich Repair from the AGE Smart line as a night time moisturizer.     First of all, this product is a seriously heavy moisturizer - so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for it does the job.  The downside is that it is the consistency of tar and almost impossible to spread evenly over your face.  And if your skin is the slightest bit damp (right after washing), the water actually repels the moisturizer and it more or less evaporates while you&#x27;re trying to apply to your face (I know it sounds strange, but that&#x27;s the best way I can describe it).  As a result, you end up using more and more of the product to try make sure you&#x27;ve covered your entire face.      Also, this product does not last very long.  Typically you can make a tube/tub/pump of Dermalogica last for more than 6 months - but my pump ran out after just a couple months of using this as a night cream.  Probably because of the issues cited above.    Overall, Super Rich Repair was definitely not worth the price and the hassle of using it, although it was an effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great product - no cons</li>
            <li> Love the product and the price at Amzaon</li>
            <li> This is a really great product for my dry, sensitive and aging skin.  It does not make me break out and feels very soothing on my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product for overly dry skin. I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the shipping time, but the cost is much less than you can find in retail stores or on the manufacturer website.</li>
            <li> I am a dermalogica fan and this product did not disappoint.  It is very thick and rich so I use it at night.  I am a nurse so I was my hands a zillion times a day so I use this stuff on both my hands and face at night and it really does the job.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.  Great hydration.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product monthsss ago.  It was never delivered.  The lady that does my facials thought it was just what I needed.  Well, I&#x27;ll never know as I won&#x27;t go through this process again.  I can go straight to Target and get Olay 7 and start using it the same day.</li>
            <li> The best night cream for aging skin! Gluten free too.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Demalogica Super Rich.  It is the BEST moisturizer I have ever used.  It gives my skin a wonderful texture and feeling.</li>
            <li> It definitely moisturizes, but feels icky.</li>
            <li> Love Dermalogica products.</li>
            <li> I ordered one jar and was given another jar for Christmas.  I don&#x27;t know which one I opened but suffice it to say that it was an old jar.  The jar configuration was of the old type compared to the new one I last used. The oil in the jar was also separated from the cream somewhat and it had a slightly rancid smell when applied to the face. It is obvious to me that whoever shipped it had it in stock for quite sometime before releasing it for sale.  I was not happy with the product that I received.  Usually I have been very happy with the product in the past.</li>
            <li> Had gottn a sample of this-it felt WONDERFUL&amp;I nevr experiencd moisture like that. Got it home&amp;made me break out mayb cuz its hot weathr. Will try it again in winter.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is so nice and rich.  I had seriously dry skin this winter.  This moisturizer helped repair my skin and was not too greasy.  I apply the tiniest bit to my face,neck and decolletage.  It helps keep my complexion even and moisturized, especially through the winter.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer Ever!! I used to use Cream De La Mer but this is better than la Mer at half the price. Although price does not matter to me when it comes to skin care and Super Rich wins hands down!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I blend this with the Smart Age Primer and it gives my face a beautiful glow!&lt;br /&gt;Until the last few months, I was never one to cleanse or moisturizer my face on a regular basis. Basically, I took my youth for granted! Now, however, I make a conscious effort to at least cleanse &amp; moisturize daily and use the mask at least twice a week. And boy have my efforts paid off! I can see a huge change in my skin! And by all the compliments - so can others!&lt;br /&gt;I know Dermalogica might run a little on the expensive side, but it&#x27;s highly worth it! You will see the results within no time!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for aging skin (like for people age 40 and up).  In the last few years (3 years) I have tried a number of moisturizers with no luck or horrible results.  For some reason my forehead would usually breakout in a rash when the product would not agree with my skin.  I went to a dermatologist for help but after 5 visits later I realized she was useless.  I have been trying to find a product that would work on my skin and this appears to be it.  The product is very expensive but a little goes a long way and quite frankly when you have been through everything that I have with products who cares how much it costs, I am just so happy that I finally found something that works.  By the way, the seller was super fast, I received the product very quickly. I would definitely recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> Love this Age Smart line.  Have all the products.  They are great for my skin.  I live in Nevada and it&#x27;s really dry here, so to have products do as advertised is sometimes hard to find.  These Age Smart products are just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I had small psoriasis areas on my face. I started using this product on my face 3 years ago. My skin has stayed smooth and clear as a result. It also makes my make up go on even, no dry patches so make up doesn&#x27;t cake. This is very thick so you only need a very small amount. I use everyday, but it last, I buy maybe 2 a year. This product was cheaper ordering it on Amazon than buying it in a store. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This product is true to it&#x27;s name, \\&quot;super rich\\&quot;, it is thick and rich.  I use it both day and night.</li>
            <li> Best creamfor aging skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years.  No other cream did such a good job for me in terms of keeping my dry skin in a good condition.  I would especially recommend this product for winter (cold and dry season).</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used several facial moisturizers...some from Dermalogica as well.&lt;br /&gt;But the Dermalogica Age Smart Super Rich Repair did not do anything, did not moisturize, it has some kind of chemical smell to it...&lt;br /&gt;I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Excellent night time moisturizer for dehydrated hyper-sensitive dry skin. After 5 frustrating years and great expense seeking a product to seriously moisturize dry hypersensitive skin,  I found that applying Dermatologica&#x27;s Super Rich Repair over Estee Lauder&#x27;s Verite Cream over night is extremely effective!</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Works great!</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth every penny. I live in Minnesota and the harsh cold, dry air is terrible on my skin. I use this during the winter morning and night. It is really thick, which is just what I need. I switch during the warmer months to only using this at night and using a lighter moisturizer with SPF during the day.</li>
            <li> This has worked very well for me during the winter months. I was using it during the day and at night, and it made my skin more soft and moisturized. I really like that this cream contains relatively safe chemicals (it scored 3 in the Cosmetic Database that is managed by EWG). So many cosmetics that are safe unfortunately don&#x27;t work very well, but this is not the case. This works very well. I wouldn&#x27;t use it during the day during warm months because it&#x27;s very rich, but it&#x27;s perfect for winter during the day and it can be used at night all year long.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin which breaks out if I&#x27;m not careful. I very rarely use this. Too thick and &#x27;sits&#x27; on top of my skin. I do exfoliate regularly and use a serum. Will not re-purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin care cream I have ever used ....and I has used many in my life!  It works quickly for dry skin caused by winter dryness/ indoor heat.</li>
            <li> I discovered Dermalogica products via a local beauty salon and was reluctant first to try their products, thinking that they would try to &#x27;push&#x27; me to buy it to make profit.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that I bought a couple of products to try because now I use almost everything from Dermalogica. Their products lead to visible results and considering their effect on the skin, they are not even that expensive. The super rich cream is great for anyone suffering from hydration and the skin is soft and rested in the morning.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy cream - great for my extremely dry skin. I recently purchased a highly-recommended night cream which is like water compared to the texture of this product. I have extremely sensitive skin and have had no reactions to Dermalogica. Plus, a little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> Yes this is the best moisturizer!!! Definitely a winner! I have tried other products even ones more expensive but this still is the winner!!!</li>
            <li> Works really well on aging, dry skin. I am 51 yrs old. I haven&#x27;t found a product that works better.</li>
            <li> I think this works better around my eyes than their eye serum.</li>
            <li> Big fan! It makes my skin so clean and soft unlike any other cleansing exfoliating scrub! It is a must buy</li>
            <li> Although , this product probably does wonderful things, I found it way too thick. It was difficult after washing my face to apply this product. My skin felt oily and it did clog my pores. I did get a blemish after using this product.  I went back to using Dermalogica&#x27;s moisturizer to hydrate my skin</li>
            <li> A little bit heavy for 40&#x27;s ages.</li>
            <li> Lovely rich product.  Feels great and last all night.  Use it twice a day and will continue to use it as my go to moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to get older, and this very thick facial conditioner is perfect at night to keep the wrinkles in check.  No scent and you only need a small dollop.</li>
            <li> The best ever night cream.  Have used it for over 10 years.  Very good product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a night cream in combination with the dermalogica extra firming booster.  It isn&#x27;t oily or greasy and has resulted in a clearer complexion.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin. This is the thickest moisturizer I have used that is not a cream. It is scent-free which I like.</li>
            <li> This product provides the perfect pampering for my dry skin zone (I have combination skin, T-zone is a little oily).</li>
            <li> I usually order this product every 21/2 months so I&#x27;m looking for a savings....I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 years.....Thank you</li>
            <li> Dermalogica is an amazing skin care line... You will see results if you use it faithfully!  It put elasticity back in my 44 year old Florida tanned skin.  And Did reduce fine lines.  Been using line about a month and a half... I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I just start using this product a week ago and already see and feel a difference.  My skin is smoother and fine lines are less apparent.  I am a few years from 40 and have spent too much time in the sun in my 20s.  I use it at night with the night repair serum and my skin feels wonderful in the morning.  It is pricy but you only need a small amount. It is very rich.  This is another great product from Dermalogica.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has a clean scent and it is a richer cream that makes my skin glow.  It is worth the price!</li>
            <li> Great for all skin types#</li>
            <li> This is just the best moisturizer! I abolutely love it and have been using it for the last several months. My skin tends to be on the dry side, especially with the hot spring and summer we&#x27;ve had here in the Seattle area. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for years.  This says it all.  I will continue to purchase this item for years to come!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost every face lotion out there, and this is by far the best for my skin. Its heavy duty without breaking out my skin, and I know of no other lotion that does that. The amount you will get is not much though, so its very pricey and doesn&#x27;t last long. I buy this about four times a year so a little over $200. Not too bad.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews because they take too long and I do not have enough time.  But this product is amazing.  I had a growth next to my right eye that looked like a skin tag.  I used this for less than two weeks, and the growth disappeared.  I think there&#x27;s something in this moisturizer that really works.</li>
            <li> I have used so many different products in my lifetime and NOTHING works like this crème.  I can&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Goes on thick and creamy however, is not heavy on the my skin. Leaves my face super moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been using the Dermalogica Age Smart products for 2 years always saying I like a change every year but I can&#x27;t get past these products. It&#x27;s rich, but not greasy and easy to apply and very moisturising.</li>
            <li> Stayed true to this product for two weeks, their cleanser and barrier repair were good finds for me. Thought I&#x27;d support their product line and use this product at night. Turned my skin beet red, caused blemishes, and did nothing to help with the severe elements of wind/cold. Returned the product today and went back to good ole &#x27;cheap&#x27; eucerin sp? for my night time regime. Barrier repair is a good product though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a long time. I love it!</li>
            <li> I PREVIOUSLY HAD TRIED IT, LOVED IT AND LOVE THE FACT IT WAS LESS MONEY FROM AMAZON!&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE SEEN A DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE IN MY DRY SKIN.  IT IS THICK, SO MOST TIMES, I ALSO SPRAY&lt;br /&gt;MY FACE FIRST WITH THEIR ANTIOXIDANT HYDRATOR; LESS USAGE AND EASIER TO GET ON.  THE&lt;br /&gt;COMBO ARE GREAT!</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful rich night time moisturizer I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve been using Dermalogica products fro several years</li>
            <li> Excellent product - as the name states, this is a rich cream and in most cases would be too much for warmer more humid weather use, but it does the trick during dry, winter weather&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not smell - is not greasy - absorbs well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure that it provides any wrinkle reductions prevention</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 10 months. Rich moisturizer. I use at night. Goes on smoothly with great hydration. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Yes this product I am not sure about.It is in my pile of stuff that I am not using any more for I started getting pimples and I am not sure if this is causing the pimples.</li>
            <li> this is an awesome product</li>
            <li> This is my favorite nighttime moisturizer.  It&#x27;s very thick - perfect for nighttime repair.  The smell is pleasant too.</li>
            <li> Strong Plastic smell and I see no obvious improvement of my skin texture.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this moisturizer and light scent. This is my second bottle, as I didnt want to invest too much money (it is comparable to department stores) in a new skin care program (have many half used bottles in storage). My skin is transforming into the over 40-club; and the typical creams, lotions and moisturizers were NOT enough, or were TOO greasy and/or SEVERLY burned my face! This product has a premeasured dose enough for your face and neck, and last well over a month. It leaves my skin soft and my foundation easily absorbs and sets. Love it! Own it!</li>
            <li> The reason, and only reason, I didn&#x27;t like it was that I got a severe allergic reaction to it!!  I&#x27;ve used a couple other of their products (eye cream and repair serum) and had no problem.  But this was HORRIBLE - fever &amp; hives over my entire body!  Now granted I am, obviously, sensitive but that was ridiculous. After the first day, I thought the reaction must be to something I ate so I ate nothing the next day (felt so sick anyway) and used the cream again the 2nd night - BIG MISTAKE!!!! Had to go immediately to the doctor!  The cream felt great but didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
            <li> If you want a heavy moisturizer (they describe it as a balm on Dermalogica&#x27;s website) this is a great. The product does not have a smell.  I&#x27;ve seen several people on blogs say they hate the smell.  If so, you have a bad product.  I dislike the fact you cannot tell how much is in the container.  I have used it for at least 4 years &amp; actually ran out this morning to my surprise.  The real con is that it is expensive.  It would be for very dry skin but not extremely helpful for eczema and redness.  That is just my experience.</li>
            <li> My favorite ultra dense moisturizer.  I tend to use in summer AND winter because my skin is so dry.  Have tried many other brands and keep coming back to this.</li>
            <li> This crème is so thick you can&#x27;t even rub it in.  It sits on your face and does not go into your pores.  When I put it on my skin looks like it is sweating it is so greasy.  You would think that  it would make your skin soft.  Not so.  My skin looks really dry since I started using this product and I will never buy it again.  I use a lot of Dermalogica products, but this is the worst one I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> This is one of Dermalogica&#x27;s product I can&#x27;t live without.  I use it twice a day, almost everyday (I say that because sometimes, I get too tired and lazy)  and it has lasted me 5 mmonths.  I&#x27;m 46, live in a dry region and have combination normal/dry skin.  This is the only product that has made my skin completely quenched.  It&#x27;s very emolient so most of the time, I leave it on for a few minutes before applying make-up.  Because my skin is dry I use more than I probably should. The best time for me to put it on is before I go to bed.  That way, my skin will have a chance to soak it all up during sleep.  In the morning my skin feels great.  I use it along my favorite Dermalogica products from the AGE Smart line and their basic line:  Mutivaitamin Recovery Masque, Multivitamin Thermofoliant,  Multivitamin Power Firm, Intensive Eye Repair, Skin Smoothing Cream. Multi-active toner, Daily Resurfacing Cleanser, Special Cleansing Gel.  I love Dermalogica and will never every switch to another product.</li>
            <li> good and quick delivery</li>
            <li> The greatest product ever!!!!</li>
            <li> I first tried this at a spa after skiing and it was very soothing for my very dry, sunburned and sensitive skin. I continue to use it day and night during the winter months.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t believe your skin when you make up in the morning.  Just a small drop does the trick for smooth, hydrated skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  As I get older, it is keeping many of the wrinkles away and leaves my skin soft.  Dermalogica is the only skin product line that I will use.  I got it for a great price through Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great Product- Fast Shipment</li>
            <li> This is the richest most effective moisturizer on the market.</li>
            <li> At long last I now have the solution to dry flaky skin!</li>
            <li> somehow, Dermalogica does not work for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;also, no expiration on product, hard to tell how fresh when buy from not a Dermalogica site.&lt;br /&gt;Other brands do better for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second one so obviously I like it</li>
            <li> This is the best face cream. I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it and will continue to purchase it!</li>
            <li> This is my saver, especcialy for my dry and sensetive skin in winter time, superb product, highly recomend it.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for my almost 60 year old skin. It arrived on time and in excellent condition. I love all Dermalogica products and will purchase this product again and again.</li>
            <li> The Age Smart line from Dermalogica is a nice surprise for me. Unlike other brands that sell anti-aging products based on medical research this one does not provoke allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;It is rich and very hydrating, just perfect for the winter weather. Great price too.</li>
            <li> Fragrance free, rich texture, long lasting. My skin feels totally hydrated after night time appication. I can feel the difference in skin&#x27;s moisture level when applying make-up the next day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still new to using this moisturizer.  It is indeed rich, so I only use it at night, but so far I really do like it; especially during these cold dry winter months.</li>
            <li> I use this product in the evening with my Derm. Overnight Serum.  Very little is needed when applying over the night serum and your face will feel amazing and hydrated the next morning.  No breakouts and really like the creamy texture.</li>
            <li> This does the trick for battling dry skin, especially during the cold, dry months. I use  in the am and pm. It doesn&#x27;t give me pimples, either.</li>
            <li> In exchange for an honest review, I received a discount price. A great product at a very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> Their products are all very good and a little goes a long way. Four stars!</li>
            <li> My favorite, Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Skin firmer, brighter, etc.</li>
            <li> My face feels moisturized without feeling oily.  Absolutly no tightness, absorbs quickly without leaving your face shiny.  Only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> I am older (60) and have very dry skin. This product works really well I use twice daily. It is a bit expensive, so I trade off days with CereVe facial moisturizer. My skin stays hydrated with the two.</li>
            <li> This is my second  purchase of Dermalogica  and  I find it  excellent for winter dry skin....I use in the morning and my face looks  and  feels good all day. Yes, it is a bit pricey but worth it...I have given away, stopped using or thrown away  more  moisturizers  than the price of one Dermalogica cream~!&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars  but would give it a 5 star rating  if it were less expense~  :-)&lt;br /&gt; As a moisturizer, it totally deserves a 5~!</li>
            <li> It truly is an amazing product. It did everything I thought it would. My skin was freaking out because I kept trying natural products. I kept having reactions including hives and extremely dry areas with even flaking. This restored my moisture in 3 days.</li>
            <li> I used this all the time in the Winter. This product protects and keeps the skin moist. I have been using these for years!! I use the lighter cream for summer.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s and this really makes my skin feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is a very good moisturizer! I only use this at night because it is so thick but I wake up with smooth skin. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best moisturizer I have used. I received it as a sample with a facial and I have gone on to the full size of this product. Paired with Overnight Repair Serum and the Eye Reversal cream, you have yourself a terrific facial regiment. You can buy all three in the sample kit which serves as a perfect travel companion and I have given it as a gift to a friend and she loves it too!</li>
            <li> love this product.. tho it is a super cream, it is not thick, as in gooey..&lt;br /&gt;just feels wonderful on my skin... with excellent results..</li>
            <li> I love this product I first used a sampler and then purchased a big size I love this product I went on to buy other items!</li>
            <li> have been using this for a long time now. don&#x27;t even need to use moisturizer if im running short on time</li>
            <li> I use this as my nighttime moisturizer and I love it. My skin tends to be dry and dull and this product has completely solved those issues. It also is very thick (which I like), so I wouldn&#x27;t use it during the daytime. Great product and price (on Amazon) and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Live in very dry climate and this is the best lotion I have found to keep my skin moist.</li>
            <li> Love this product, as I have been using it for many years. Easy to pump out of container &amp; very  hydrating for my aging skin.  Great for travel too</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my skin, makes it feel greasy. I don&#x27;&#x27;t like any creams that don&#x27;t soak into my skin and feel like they just sit on the surface. I use dermalogica for most of my skin care but I had to send this back. Thus the two stars.</li>
            <li> I like this cream although it is rich and should only be used at night.  I do like this line of products although I have not used them often.</li>
            <li> When your skin is particularly in need of super hydration, this is your product.  Night use recommended only as it is quite thick.  Lavender scented so if you don&#x27;t enjoy, you may want to skip this product.  Your skin will be so soft and refreshed in the morning!</li>
            <li> this is the best moisturizer ive ever used&lt;br /&gt;it helps eczema and psoriasis as well&lt;br /&gt;i would never use anything else</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000PKYCJA Dermalogica Age Smart Super Rich Repair 1.7 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Dermalogica&#x27;s Age Smart Super Rich Repair after receiving a sample from an aesthetician after a facial a few years ago. It is not cheap, but it is called &amp;#34;super rich&amp;#34; for a reason: a little goes a really long way when you apply to a clean fresh face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when living in the desert, I have never needed more than the size of a pea for my face and neck. I use it daily in both the morning and evening and one 1.7 oz bottle of this will last me at least one year, so it is well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is sensitive, so I also use Dermalogica&#x27;s Special Cleansing Gel, [[ASIN:B0045KI788 Dermalogica Special Cleansing Gel 8.4 oz/250 ml]] because it is very gentle on my skin, while cleaning thoroughly. I sometimes follow with a light toner depending on whether I wore make-up that day and how much, and I also usually put a booster or serum of some sort on my face before or with this moisturizer to further enhance the anti-aging effects, along with eye cream. Putting this lotion on my clean face and neck makes my skin feel like it is enveloped in luxury and leaves my skin feeling so soft without clogging my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to manage a large salon and spa for several years. During that time, my bathroom cabinets were filled with products that I was fortunate to sample and get at cost from the different beauty suppliers we used. So, I have tried and used more beauty products than the average bear over the years. Note: Dermalogica was never one of the products we sold and I am no longer in the salon industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I am out of the industry and pay retail cost for all of my hair and beauty products, I am very picky about what products I do purchase, know what to look for and know when something works well for me. My skin ranges from being oily to dry/combination depending on the climate and time of year, but I use this moisturizer every day all year-round and it is like gold.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to moisturizer.  I have tried SOOO many but this is the only one that works for me. I use it under my foundation and I get compliments about my skin all the time.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It is very moisturizing and is perfect for my age group, over 60.</li>
            <li> I use this night and day for moisture and I love it! It&#x27;s not to heavy for daytime under foundation. Thanks Dermalogica for a wonderful product and Amazon for making it more affordable and easy to order!</li>
            <li> Fast friendly and great product</li>
            <li> Product came very quickly. I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 8 or 9 years now, I have very dry skin and it is very soothing to use. Every ones skin is different, this Dermalogica Age Smart line of skin care is very good. : - ))</li>
            <li> This night cream is super rich and it only takes a little so it is econmical, too!  Leaves my face extremely soft the next morning!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  Last year I suffered wind burn while running in the cold weather.  I purchased this product and it was fantastic.  I use it every day now!  Amazing rich lotion!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Worth every penny! #40something</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and this winter has been so dry that my skin has been tough to moisturize. I was using Dermalogica&#x27;s Skin Smoothing Cream until my derm told me to try the Super Rich Repair for a heavier moisturizer. It keeps my skin so moist overnight that I wake up in the morning and my face is soft and just how it was before going to bed. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this for the day time because it&#x27;s way too oily and makes your face super shiny.</li>
            <li> This is a very neutral smelling, skin calming moisturizer. It is by far the most intense moisturizer that I&#x27;ve ever used. I have eczema, adult acne, and sun spots. I use a lot of products for my acne and spots, and this calms my skin down at night and allows it to recover after heavy washing etc. I have not noticed more breakouts. The only negative is that it makes your skin super shiny and feels wet, so I can only put it on right before bed and it&#x27;s a little uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I love this Dermologica moisturizer...I use it every day and when I go into the spa for a facial the technician always complements me on my skin (and they can never guess my age). This moisturizer goes on a little oily, but your skin will absorb it within 10 mins. I wash my face, put on the moisturizer then take my shower. When I&#x27;m done in the shower my face is ready for make-up.  You will not be disappointed... it is a little pricey but you do not use a lot with each application. I usually get 3 months worth of applications from one dispenser/jar.  Cheers to good skin from Dermologica.</li>
            <li> Love this product, have been faithfully using it day and night for several years.  Leaves cleansed skin soft and touchable...</li>
            <li> For my super sensitive skin, Dermalogica is the only beauty lotion and make-up I&#x27;ll use.I love this as my overnight lotion.</li>
            <li> I love dermalogica it is the only face moisturizing cream I use.  The age smart is great for me I am in my late 60&amp;#34;s.  I have used the product for about 10 years.  For my age I have very few wrinkles.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite beauty products! I really only use it on my nose. I use it twice daily. The skin on my nose especially on the sides always gets super dry. I got this and the skin on my nose has never felt better! I once got sunburn on my forehead. I applied a dab of this to my forehead when it started peeling and the next day the peeling had totally stopped. I wouldn&#x27;t apply this to your entire face if you have acne prone skin like I do because it is slightly on the oily side. It smells great.. Like a medicinal scent but not overwhelming. To me it&#x27;s very soothing almost like a lavender scent. This bottle will last a while because I only use a dab of it. So to me, it&#x27;s well worth the price. Will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate, and have looked everywhere for a product that is rich enough for my mature, dry skin.  I have finally found it.  This product is rich and last all day! My skin looks great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66, and I love this cream.  I use it every day and it keeps my skin hydrated and smooth.  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> This is so moisturizing and really a treat to put on- but it doesn&#x27;t break me out or cause blackheads. I&#x27;ve got difficult either crazy congested or so dry it&#x27;s peeling skin and I&#x27;ve not been able to find anything  that works as well as this does (with the price I&#x27;ve tried so many things!).  I&#x27;m still in my 20s, but this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Excellent, my skin is very allergic and this product is great. You can see results soon</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the retail stores and just as good!</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.  Love this stuff!</li>
