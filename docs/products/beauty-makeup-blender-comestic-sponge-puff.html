            <li>These blenders are fantastic!</li>
            <li>Why pay $10+/each or more when you don&#x27;t have to?</li>
            <li>Easy to wash.</li>
            <li>it works fine</li>
            <li>and comfortable to use it...</li>
            <li>I had doubts but this little sponge turned out to be great, easy to use and easy to wash...doesn&#x27;t flake up and crumble after quite bit of use-age</li>
            <li>Give it a good clean with a strong smelling soap a few times and the smell goes away. :)</li>
            <li>This was the first one I ordered great for facial make-up.</li>
            <li>Foundation just glides on, love it so much</li>
            <li>(works best wet warm water, but not dripping wet)</li>
            <li>Great &amp;#34;knockoff&amp;#34; for some other sponges that have become a bit overpriced.</li>
            <li>Super dense.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exactly like in the picture!</li>
            <li>It works great for me it took a little while to come</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth to buy this product</li>
            <li>the texture its really soft and easy to clean</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>It truly has a beautiful finish when blending, so I would definitely reorder in the future.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more to get better quality because this has 0% quality.</li>
            <li>These sponges will last a really long time if you take good care and clean them every week.</li>
            <li>The product works great as a puppet nose, but the actual product that I received is much lighter blue than pictured hear.</li>
            <li>Really suggest in not buying this product!</li>
            <li>I loved it but was surprised by how little it was.</li>
            <li>And it blends my concealer in very well.</li>
            <li>I like the stiffness because it does not absorb too much product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I dont particularly care for this sponge.</li>
            <li>like this product because it does what it says it would but at a fraction of a normal bb</li>
            <li>Came on time, just like described in the description and looks high quality and new (unopened or anything)</li>
            <li>Its smaller than expected but that okay, and it seems to want to &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; when you use it with foundation.  </li>
            <li>it completly takes off the excese oil from face and if used to apply foundation it leaves you with a very  natural finished look.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money trying to be cheap like myself.</li>
            <li>Soft and durable sponge.  </li>
            <li>She always used this sponge and so far I didn&#x27;t heard any complaints from here.</li>
            <li>Super small.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy unlike some other sponges I used.</li>
            <li>Most beauty sponges I have used in the past were soft and squishy, this one is quite firm and isn&#x27;t as pliable as I would hope.</li>
            <li>I have washed it a few times and you have to be very gentle when squeezing it so it doesn&#x27;t crack.  </li>
            <li>It is also a little stiffer than what I expected but it does the job better than my other makeup sponges.</li>
            <li>Cheap thing is as hard as a rock!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Super dense. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I dont particularly care for this sponge. I do use it to do just the concealer under my eyes, but if I new the spong was so hard I probably would not have purchased it.</li>
            <li> Great &amp;#34;knockoff&amp;#34; for some other sponges that have become a bit overpriced. Just wish it was a bit bigger but still a great deal!</li>
            <li> Great tool for makeup, but it&#x27;s a little hard.</li>
            <li> I use this for my under eye concealing and a brush for foundation or bb cream&lt;br /&gt;I like this product because it does what it says it would but at a fraction of a normal bb</li>
            <li> When you put on your makeup it does not blend the makeup like the beauty blender. For what you pay is what you get. My wife does not like it at all.</li>
            <li> i bought this being hopeful . uhm save your money even though its only $1 something it sucks. it came earlier than what it said . but it came TORN!</li>
            <li> Came on time, just like described in the description and looks high quality and new (unopened or anything) It&#x27;s very sturdy unlike some other sponges I used. And it blends my concealer in very well.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a bit bigger. Its a bit rough. That&#x27;s about the only dislikes I have of this product.</li>
            <li> Cheap thing is as hard as a rock! It doesn&#x27;t even inflate. I had to go back to my other sponge. I waited 3 weeks for something that doesn&#x27;t even work properly. Don&#x27;t waste your money trying to be cheap like myself. Spend a little more to get better quality because this has 0% quality.</li>
            <li> For the price your getting a very good sponge! I give it 5 stars, and I would recomend to anyone</li>
            <li> Blends in makeup perfectly, I should&#x27;ve got more of than 1.  Very firm wouldn&#x27;t break or anything. Shipping takes about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I consider myself an amateur makeup artist. I got a pink sponge. It&#x27;s great for the corners of your nose, under your eyes and blending foundation into your jawline. I will be ordering 4 or 5 more!</li>
            <li> i really love this beauty sponge it apply my foundation so good and look so flawless i love using it.</li>
            <li> Love it!  This puts a wonderful finish on your face,  If i need another one, I will definitely buy from here.</li>
            <li> the sponge is everything I thought it would be  and it works so well even when I use it wet the results are good</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s exactly like in the picture! and comfortable to use it... it&#x27;s worth to buy this product and i am happy about it!</li>
            <li> The product works great as a puppet nose, but the actual product that I received is much lighter blue than pictured hear.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Blender, but I got a radio antenna instead! Very disappointed. I did not return the item as it was from China and it was only $1. Guess I got what I paid for..</li>
            <li> This was the first one I ordered great for facial make-up. Easy to wash. Foundation just glides on, love it so much I ordered the pack of four. Use one for eyes, foundation, concealer,smooths on evenly</li>
            <li> This beauty sponge was very hard. Hurt to bounce on face and to apply makeup with. Total waste of money</li>
            <li> Most beauty sponges I have used in the past were soft and squishy, this one is quite firm and isn&#x27;t as pliable as I would hope. It still works well, and the only complaint that I have is that it smells like burnt rubber mixed with shoe polish. Give it a good clean with a strong smelling soap a few times and the smell goes away. :)</li>
            <li> its perfect for every type of make up you are applying on. the texture its really soft and easy to clean</li>
            <li> this poor sponge is nothing compared to the the real deal. guess you get what you pay for. will not be purchasing again</li>
            <li> Its smaller than expected but that okay, and it seems to want to &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; when you use it with foundation.  I have washed it a few times and you have to be very gentle when squeezing it so it doesn&#x27;t crack.  maybe it was just me sponge but I have purchased others and don&#x27;t have this problem with them.</li>
            <li> I loved it but was surprised by how little it was. It truly has a beautiful finish when blending, so I would definitely reorder in the future.</li>
            <li> Soft and durable sponge.  Great for using with foundation and concealer.</li>
            <li> Awsome sponge it completly takes off the excese oil from face and if used to apply foundation it leaves you with a very  natural finished look. Love it! Price is even better. Why didnt I buy this sooner!?</li>
            <li> Super small. And real stiff and hard while applying! Won&#x27;t even get bigger when wetted. Really suggest in not buying this product!</li>
            <li> These sponges are about an inch tall. Not what i thought they were going to be.</li>
            <li> It looks SIMILAR to the photo but not exactly what I expected. When I got it it smelled a little weird but that went away mostly after I had washed it a bit. It is also a little stiffer than what I expected but it does the job better than my other makeup sponges.</li>
            <li> It is small and works well with  foundation. However it is a little hard even when wet. I like the stiffness because it does not absorb too much product. This is great for a light application.</li>
            <li> Very hard and not absorbent. I&#x27;m not satisfied with it and I found it useless. But you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> This is perfect for the price. Its not too stiff and not too soft, It&#x27;s just perfect. It arrived a lot faster than I expected. Totally recommend this sponge.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my daughter and she really love it. She always used this sponge and so far I didn&#x27;t heard any complaints from here.</li>
            <li> I expected this to be like a regular beauty sponge. It wasn&#x27;t the quality was terrible and I dont think I&#x27;m going to risk buying another from them even though I have purchased on here before and I really loved it. Save your money and buy one from the drugstore!</li>
            <li> For the price compared to original beauty blender it&#x27;s good. It&#x27;s a little hard however and doesn&#x27;t expand when wet but it does apply makeup well.</li>
            <li> I love this beauty sponge. The price is great and it is really great quality! I use it just about every day! These sponges will last a really long time if you take good care and clean them every week.</li>
            <li> i found it even harder and less useful than to just use my hands, did not blend out evenly, it was also very rough, although i do lilt to use it to get rid of my bags</li>
            <li> These blenders are fantastic! I got a lot of 10 and know I will use all of them. I travel a lot and love having a great product in my home and travel bags. Highly recommended! Why pay $10+/each or more when you don&#x27;t have to?</li>
            <li> it works fine but the color is not the same and I don&#x27;t think it was worth the wait. next time I will just go to the store to buy a blender</li>
            <li> It works great for me it took a little while to come but for id rather wait than pay 20$ for on in the mall</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible nothing like a beauty blender very hard !!! Would never purchase again I threw mine in the trash.</li>
            <li> I had doubts but this little sponge turned out to be great, easy to use and easy to wash...doesn&#x27;t flake up and crumble after quite bit of use-age I do recommend to friends. (works best wet warm water, but not dripping wet)</li>
            <li> AWFUL makeup sponge... I have many many sponges and this was the worst one I have ever felt.</li>
