            <li> Looks natural and really does wear all day, even through rain, humidity, and pokes in the face by my toddler.</li>
            <li> TLC truly is lasting color. For me, it leaves a flawless complexion until I remove it at the end of the day. I&#x27;ve never had to reapply.</li>
            <li> best makeup ever.. i will never change for another brand.. soo recomended... it really  worth it the price.. go buy it</li>
            <li> This is the only foundation I ever use. Great cover up of splotchy skin and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This foundation works great for me.  It matches my skin tone well and is lightweight. It never looks caked on like some other foundations. Whenever, I wear this, people can&#x27;t even tell I have foundation on (and I can&#x27;t feel it).  It provides just enough coverage to even out your complexion. It is also great because it doesn&#x27;t clog pores/cause breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used department store brands of foundation before (Estee Lauder, Clinique, etc.), and I actually like this one better (and it is a fraction of the price).</li>
            <li> Blends like a dream, lasts &amp; lasts even when it gets a bit wet. Does not break skin out or make it oily. What else is there to say?</li>
            <li> My go-to foundation! Covers nicely without feeling &amp;#34;madeup&amp;#34;. I have very sensitive skin and have had no problems with this makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this make up! It arrived very quickly, and I didn&#x27;t have to go to the store to pick it up! Free shipping with a couple other items I needed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this foundation and it does indeed still look good after 16 hours like it claims! Goes on very smoothly and is just thick enough without being globby. The color blends very easily and does not look cakey at all. I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> i like the price and the product it was a great opportunity... this is a nice product, looks amazing on any skin actually</li>
            <li> Almay TCL lasts all day, and is easy to apply. Though, I wish the coverage was just a tad better.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Large amount of product&lt;br /&gt;Decent blending&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;No SPF as shown in the pic&lt;br /&gt;Color is a bit dull (but it might have been the shade I has chosen)&lt;br /&gt;Weak coverage (it doesn&#x27;t do a good job hiding blemishes)&lt;br /&gt;Runny&lt;br /&gt;Easily rubs off and &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; as the day wears on (I have oily skin)</li>
            <li> I started using this after Max factor stopped making  my waterproof makeup I used forever. I like makeup that stays on outdoors to  protect and cover my skin. I am very chemically sensitive. This was after trying several others that either didn&#x27;t  cover well or stay on well. The only down side i; you have to work to get it off ;0)</li>
            <li> I usually use estee lauder foundation, but didnt have $50 this go around to spend, so i thought i would give this a shot. I dont care for it at all.Its not good quality fpundation in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding foundation that is light enough and does not look caked on.  This is perfect.  Hope it will be available forever!</li>
            <li> Stays on all day. Even in water or humidity. I like to use it with the olay and cover girl purple container powder. I haven&#x27;t switched in years!</li>
            <li> This is the same makeup I buy at the store. Came, stil in its plastic wrap, exactly the same as I get a target or walmart. With no tax and free shipping (Prime) it is easier and cheaper than at a store :)</li>
            <li> I work in a restaurant, It gets hot fast , but after 9-10 hours a day , still looks great !!</li>
            <li> I like this makeup because it&#x27;s smooth and absorbs quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t look or feel heavy on your face.  Yes I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it truly lasts for a long time.  When I get some sweat on my face, it seems to wash or absorb, etc.  It disappears after a short time, so I have to reapply it to my face.</li>
            <li> I really like this.  It has good coverage, but doesn&#x27;t leave your face oily.  It is pretty natural looking.  It&#x27;s nice to save a little by using Subscribe and Save.  And I never run out this way.</li>
