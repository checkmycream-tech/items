            <li>The quality is cheap.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite, and ,really fun to wear.</li>

            <li>Looks like it will be comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>Looks cheap in person...</li>
            <li>It fits well and is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>I have gotten SO many compliments on my \\&quot;new haircut! :)</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, it is a very fun wig.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t worn this yet because I bought so many wigs at one time - but I can tell you it looks like the picture exactly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice and soft</li>
            <li>it looks good on the manican,but you can see the cap underneath,not enough hair on it.</li>
            <li>I had hoped for better but at the price, it&#x27;s better left for Halloween.</li>
            <li>Most realistic wig and feeling.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable, light weight and feels like real hair.  </li>
            <li>No issue with seller; product arrived quickly and as described.</li>
            <li>Great wig, The hair itself does exactly what you want but not really curling iron friendly.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and looks very natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t care much for it when it arrived, but I&#x27;ve received many compliments while wearing it.</li>
            <li>fun colors too</li>
            <li>If you want to get it to wear for fun, costume etc.  </li>
            <li>I would LOVE it if, it had the &amp;#34;real scalp&amp;#34; part look... and the hair looked a tiny bit more realistic.  </li>
            <li>This is a very pretty wig.. a little avante gard, but it is  good quality, and, made well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very modern with the ombr√© style.</li>
            <li>My other wigs are more comfortable.</li>
            <li>And it was not expensive.</li>
            <li>This wig looks almost exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>The fibers started coming out the first time I took it out of the bag and unraveled it.  </li>
            <li>the bangs are too long and needed to be trimmed, and if you don&#x27;t sweep the hair just right on top</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s edgy and comfortable, light weight and easy to wear.</li>
            <li>will recommend the sexy woman Lace wig for young people and the young at heart.</li>
            <li>This wig is just as good as my more expensive wigs</li>
            <li>I tried a few wigs before this one and none really worked for me, but this one is STUNNING!</li>
            <li>it is you can see certain &#x27;glue&#x27; spots along the part seam, and it also looks very 80&#x27;s &#x27;hairband&#x27; groupie.  </li>
            <li>It is very straight and not thick at all.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t look or feel real at all.  </li>
            <li>thanks..</li>
            <li>I am impressed..that this product at this price looks real..</li>
            <li>Came fast.. will buy again..</li>
            <li>It stays on my head, very well, too.</li>
            <li>Very skunk like color contrast.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t seem to help much..</li>
            <li>Very cheep...Waste of money...</li>
            <li>People think it&#x27;s my real hair.  </li>
            <li>Not as pictured, don&#x27;t  resemble real hair would not recommend this.</li>
            <li>When this wig arrived it looked odd on top where the bangs begin.  </li>
            <li>The wig cap has adjustable straps and is made of strong material, but light enough so that when you wear the wig, it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the head.</li>
            <li>I decided I needed to try some wigs to change things up and have some fun with different looks.  </li>
            <li>To thin and doesn&#x27;t look good on me.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and the underneath seems to be made as well as my $300 wig.</li>
            <li>I bought several others from other sellers that were much more money</li>
            <li>Colors look the same but much shorter and the bangs are horiable.</li>
            <li>The only thing I really have to get used to,is the bangs..</li>
            <li>And, its so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look natural,  </li>
            <li>The crown of the wig is not stitched down properly and makes it even more obvious of wig wearage.</li>
            <li>The color shines and highlights are well mixed and gives it a classy or punk style depending how you style it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s almost the same color as my natural hair was</li>
            <li>Looks exactly as it is pictured, and it arrived much earlier than the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li>The colors are a pretty, ashy, lighter blond,and black..</li>
            <li>Instead I threw it away since I had already lost enough money I wasn&#x27;t going to invest more in a bad decision to buy the wig in the first place.</li>

            <li> Instead I threw it away since I had already lost enough money I wasn&#x27;t going to invest more in a bad decision to buy the wig in the first place.</li>
            <li> The blonde is a little darker than pictured and the second color is brown, not black.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn my other shorter wig for the last 8 months and needed to get something a little longer as my real hair is getting longer.</li>
            <li> the big plus side, Wig arrive earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> Decent little wig for the price, have gotten tons of compliments!  </li>
            <li> The blonde is a yellow blonde not a ashy or sandy as shown in photo, which would go with the dark part.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long.</li>
            <li> It is the least expensive wig I have bought and so far it is my favorite</li>
            <li> Very strange.</li>
            <li> Compliments all day and night long!!</li>
            <li> Only dislike are that the bangs are a little long</li>
            <li> Color slightly differs, very blonde.</li>
            <li> I have seen a couple of complaints about length/style, but I fully expected to have it trimmed to suit me.  </li>
            <li> Fast delevery but other than that not happy with.</li>
            <li> The wig didn&#x27;t look anything like the picture and really looked fake.  </li>

            <li> They are VERY thick and if not styled correctly, can give the wig that &amp;#34;fake hair&amp;#34; look so trim the bangs because they&#x27;re really long!</li>
            <li> Just not sure yet.</li>

            <li> I love this wig. The cap is roomy. I bought several others from other sellers that were much more money and they are tooooo tight.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig. Totally changed my look.</li>
            <li> It unfortunately  looks like you are wearing a wig. The crown of the wig is not stitched down properly and makes it even more obvious of wig wearage. I had hoped for better but at the price, it&#x27;s better left for Halloween.</li>
            <li> This wig is actually really great for the price! Looks exactly as it is pictured, and it arrived much earlier than the expected delivery date. It was packaged well, and for the couple occassions that I will need it for (I am currently bald)it will work great. My husband said it looks great too! Thank you!</li>
            <li> The quality was below my expectations.  It didn&#x27;t look or feel real at all.  The only place I would consider wearing this wig would be at a Halloween party.</li>
            <li> Most realistic wig and feeling. Its a bit thin but i like it that way and it dose not shed. The color shines and highlights are well mixed and gives it a classy or punk style depending how you style it. Not a huge fan of the bangs but they look great when I put clips in them. People will think this is your real hair and that its beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like picture. It is cut in a mullet style and colors look cheap/hideous</li>
            <li> I love this wig very good coverage a little itchy, but i think that will pass.&lt;br /&gt;Just no used to wearing this type of wig.&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully hand crafted, looks so natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy form this line of product again and the from this company.</li>
            <li> This wig was alright. The texture of the wig is very nice and soft - THAT I like about it.  It&#x27;s also breathable and light.  What I don&#x27;t like about it is you can see certain &#x27;glue&#x27; spots along the part seam, and it also looks very 80&#x27;s &#x27;hairband&#x27; groupie.  That being said, it looks very nice when paired with a knitted cap.  I pulled it back in a pony tail, then tucked it up into the knitted hat leaving the blonde bangs exposed along with some side strands showing the blonde/dark hair.  It was cute that way.  But I wouldn&#x27;t wear it without something over it.</li>
            <li> Looks better in the picture. The quality is cheap. I&#x27;ll not purchase this one again. Colors look the same but much shorter and the bangs are horiable. Fast delevery but other than that not happy with. The product.</li>
            <li> the bangs are too long and needed to be trimmed, and if you don&#x27;t sweep the hair just right on top it looks like a wig.. but it is a cute hair style and I like the colors.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t care much for it when it arrived, but I&#x27;ve received many compliments while wearing it.</li>
            <li> thanks.. I am impressed..that this product at this price looks real.. Came fast.. will buy again..less then a haircut. fun colors too</li>
            <li> Loved it... Compliments all day and night long!! It&#x27;s light the perfect color and would recommend to all my girlfriends!!</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty wig.. a little avante gard, but it is  good quality, and, made well.It stays on my head, very well, too.It doesn&#x27;t slip backwards at all. This is my husband&#x27;s favorite, and ,really fun to wear. The only thing I really have to get used to,is the bangs.. They tend to get in my eyes ,and bother me somewhat..I might decide to cut them.Just not sure yet. But this wig is very cute, and ,it makes me feel sort of daring. lol The colors are a pretty, ashy, lighter blond,and black.. And, its so soft and silky. I have gotten SO many compliments on my \\&quot;new haircut! :)</li>
            <li> I would LOVE it if, it had the &amp;#34;real scalp&amp;#34; part look... and the hair looked a tiny bit more realistic.  Nonetheless, it is a very fun wig.  And it was not expensive.</li>
            <li> Not too expensive but not that chip. I got it just in case someone will need it for a party. Personally? Not a fan.</li>
            <li> Love Love LOVE this wig!!!! Looks great feels great I have received tons of compliments about it and I have worn it almost daily</li>
            <li> This wig looks almost exactly as pictured. The highlighting is slightly different in some areas. The blonde is a little darker than pictured and the second color is brown, not black. Other than that, it is shoulder length and layered giving it a natural look! The only downside is the bangs. They are VERY thick and if not styled correctly, can give the wig that &amp;#34;fake hair&amp;#34; look so trim the bangs because they&#x27;re really long! Other than that, the hair is soft and thin, but not too thin so you don&#x27;t have to worry about any of the netting showing. The wig cap has adjustable straps and is made of strong material, but light enough so that when you wear the wig, it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the head. At times, I felt like I was wearing my own hair! : )</li>
            <li> It is comfortable, light weight and feels like real hair.  I have seen a couple of complaints about length/style, but I fully expected to have it trimmed to suit me.  I had the length shortened and the top feathered.  Sooo convenient to throw on and go!!</li>
            <li> Regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> I tried a few wigs before this one and none really worked for me, but this one is STUNNING! I am going to buy 2 or 3 more as a backup. It is comfortable and looks very natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a picture of me in the wig: [...]</li>
            <li> Coloring is way off on the photo.  The blonde is a yellow blonde not a ashy or sandy as shown in photo, which would go with the dark part.  I felt like Cruela Devil in it.  Very skunk like color contrast.  It doesn&#x27;t look natural,  makes it look like a wig.  Not a full wig either.  If you want to get it to wear for fun, costume etc.  It would be fine.  But if you don&#x27;t want anyone knowing your wearing a wig...this is not the one.</li>
            <li> After 2 Day&#x27;s of having this wig some of the bangs came out and its cheap made. Waste of money will never buy one agein.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn this yet because I bought so many wigs at one time - but I can tell you it looks like the picture exactly. It is very straight and not thick at all.Looks like it will be comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I looked wonderful on. However it does not keep it luster. No matter what I have done to help it. Nothing has worked. If you order for a couple times of use, it would be great. Would not suggest this for every day use!</li>
            <li> Its the best purchase in my life... I love it! I really love it. I can to recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Blonde isn&#x27;t blonde, it&#x27;s tan.</li>
            <li> Great wig, The hair itself does exactly what you want but not really curling iron friendly. I tried to curl it just a bit to get the hair out of my eyes but it just was not happening.  I tried twice.</li>
            <li> Love this wig  . Everyone says it looks good in me and it&#x27;s almost the same color as my natural hair was</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like the photo. Looks cheap in person...more hair than shown</li>
            <li> cute perfect blend of colors</li>
            <li> Wig was out of shape badly,  re washed it but it didn&#x27;t seem to help much..</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the color and the style in the picture. However, there were clumps of hair falling out when I pulled it out of the bag it came in. I hated the thought of sending it back but couldn&#x27;t risk wearing it out and finding clumps of hair on my clothes or in my food! I got an ok to return it but then the return address label said I had to pay for shipping it back to CHINA! Instead I threw it away since I had already lost enough money I wasn&#x27;t going to invest more in a bad decision to buy the wig in the first place.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised, Quality seems ok. Made. and my redhead somewhat of a blonde now</li>
            <li> Arrived and not anything like picture.  Several emails back and forth and seller issued credit.  Would work with seller again</li>
            <li> Very cheep...Waste of money...do not order.</li>
            <li> People think it&#x27;s my real hair.  I get a lot of compliment on it and asked who did your hair</li>
            <li> I was hoping that I could use this wig after losing my hair to chemo. I&#x27;ve worn my other shorter wig for the last 8 months and needed to get something a little longer as my real hair is getting longer. This wig looks like it would be awesome for an 80&#x27;s Rock Star costume. I think we&#x27;ll keep it because my family has had so many laughs with it. Maybe we&#x27;ll make a holiday card for next year with each one of us wearing it. Similar to how the Brady Bunch started and ended their show. It is very soft and the underneath seems to be made as well as my $300 wig. The back has an extra layer of an even lighter color of hair. It&#x27;s long. Very strange.</li>
            <li> No issue with seller; product arrived quickly and as described. However. this wig itches like crazy. My other wigs are more comfortable.</li>
            <li> all time favorite, unfortunately must be replaced every 2 months</li>
            <li> Not only does this wig look like a halloween wig, but wearing it caused a rash on my face and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Do Not Buy!!!</li>
            <li> Mine looks just like the picture, and is very cute. I like it! I have worn it plenty of times out and about, and it looks fine. Good quality considering how cheap the price is.</li>
            <li> Color slightly differs, very blonde. But my real complain is that that wig is VERY thin. If your not comfortable with people knowing that you are wearing a wig, I would not purchase. I am however not returning this item, as I bought expecting people to know that I was just changing up my style as the day might require.&lt;br /&gt;On the big plus side, Wig arrive earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> Great product, came in on time and performs as advertised, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> To thin and doesn&#x27;t look good on me.</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL BUT TOO BIG!!&lt;br /&gt;Great hair, great feel.Unfortunately too big!</li>
            <li> For the price, I didn&#x27;t expect a real nice wig but something to have fun with over the weekend.  However, the blond is very yellow and the wig looks fake.  Nothing like the picture.  I can&#x27;t wear this wig.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this wig. It fits well and is comfortable to wear. It is the least expensive wig I have bought and so far it is my favorite</li>
            <li> Wig looks very natural, I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and the excellent customer service of the merchant.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend the sexy woman Lace wig for young people and the young at heart. If you have any question about the product contac the merchant and you will receive in timely manner the response to your question. Include one of this gorgeous wig in your&lt;br /&gt;Holiday Shopping, you will not be dissapointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MC</li>
            <li> I have alopecia and have worn wigs for 20 plus years. This wig is just as good as my more expensive wigs it&#x27;s nice and soft once I worked with it I got it styled just the way i like . It&#x27;s very modern with the ombr√© style. Lots of compliments</li>
            <li> This product is very poor. The fibers started coming out the first time I took it out of the bag and unraveled it.  When I tried it on, it did not look anything like the model. Tried to return the wig but the USPS informed me the vendor was in CHINA!!! I lost my money.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t look like picture at all. its really short all over</li>
            <li> Not as pictured, don&#x27;t  resemble real hair would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I decided I needed to try some wigs to change things up and have some fun with different looks.  When this wig arrived it looked odd on top where the bangs begin.  Once I put it on though it looked great!  It&#x27;s edgy and comfortable, light weight and easy to wear.</li>
            <li> it looks good on the manican,but you can see the cap underneath,not enough hair on it. Maybe it will be used for halloween</li>
            <li> Decent little wig for the price, have gotten tons of compliments!  It&#x27;s not to heavy, fits perfectly and looks great on!  Only dislike are that the bangs are a little long but that&#x27;s just my personal taste - I don&#x27;t care for my hair in my eyes.  Glad I made the purchase!</li>
            <li> Not as pictured at all. Colors are off and the cut is not similar at all.</li>
            <li> The wig didn&#x27;t look anything like the picture and really looked fake.  Poor quality.</li>
            <li> divine, beautiful, beautiful wig when use all have to ask where I got the color tones, believe or have the doubt if my hair. is strong, good fit, beautiful shine, haircut, fast shipping.</li>
