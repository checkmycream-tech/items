            <li>The best way I can describe it is it looks like a frosted coral spice.</li>
            <li>OPI makes the best nail polish and is all that I buy so the product is always great quality.</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful...</li>
            <li>The packaging was great, it arrived sooner than I thought and had tracking.</li>

            <li>The picture is a great representation of what it truly looks like.</li>
            <li>It is a great color for my grand daughter who is almost 2!!</li>
            <li>Description was good.</li>
            <li>This polish has a good formula that is opaque in two coats, but brush strokes are visible because of the metallic quality.</li>
            <li>stays on great after many handwashings.</li>
            <li>Love this color!  </li>
            <li>I love this color!</li>
            <li>A bit too pastel and frosty for me until I got the bright idea to use a coat of OPI&#x27;s DSL Tourmaline  on top and boy did it pop.</li>
            <li>Nice color.</li>
            <li>It stays on good and I am so pleased.</li>
            <li>I liked the sparkle it had</li>
            <li>beautiful pink color, goes on so nice, very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>It seems to keep your nails very strong also..</li>
            <li>I bought this online without having seen it in person, and I love the color, which I would describe as a very frosted medium to light orange - great for the summer!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased an Opi nail polish and all I can say is I love it!!</li>
            <li>The color is gorgeous in the bottle and a very pretty rosy color.</li>
            <li>Love the &amp;#34;Your Web or Mine&amp;#34; shade of The Spiderman Collection.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s close (on my monitor), but is even more flattering.</li>
            <li>Every one of my friends says it is the most flattering nail color they&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>now I have to buy more, because they used it up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with Revlon Colorstay Longwear Nail Enamel, Bsse Coeat and Top Coat.</li>

            <li>Love the color, will order more</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>It looks more of a peachy color with hints of sort like orange, but</li>
            <li>This was too light for my own preferences.</li>
            <li>Great new color for me.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and with a glassy finish, wears well and comes in an amazing array of colors.</li>
            <li>Loved it so much that I had to have for retouching.</li>
            <li>the color is just beautiful and I will definitely be purchasing this again!!</li>
            <li>Product was described accurately.</li>
            <li>This is a great color I bought several</li>
            <li>What an attractive and different color this turned out to be.</li>
            <li>Love this color, the product, the arrival was quick and it was exactly what I thought it would be from the pictures.</li>
            <li>Another pretty color!</li>
            <li>So pretty on my toes!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gorgeous pink that got me compliments from all kinds of people, even the janitor in my building!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>OPI products are long lasting and the assortment of colors to choose from are great.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty color.</li>
            <li>OPI makes long lasting quality nail polish in a great variety of colors.</li>
            <li>I think it goes really well with my skin tone, and is definitely office appropriate.</li>
            <li>Okay the only reason I&#x27;m not giving this a 5 star is that I didn&#x27;t care for the color on me as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li>Was very watery.</li>
            <li>I did not like the color as it was more of a peach copper than a pink.</li>
            <li>I normally gravitate to pinks,roses,&amp; hot pinks.</li>
            <li>Received order fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty and unique pink.</li>
            <li>I work with my hands and have to stay neutral in my color choices, this is a soft pretty color.  </li>
            <li>Iâ€™m not usually a fan of frosty polishes, but Your Web or Mine is really wearable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like the formula, the color is interesting, not my everyday color, but a fun one all the same</li>
            <li>Nice color to wear due to its combo of a pearl coral pink, it is very neutral for spring and summer colors.</li>
            <li>It is soft but has some drama because of the shimmer.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough nice things about this pink, and have found that it flatters everyone I know who tries it on.</li>
            <li>Looks a little different depending on what light you&#x27;re in.</li>
            <li>Sometimes really pink, sometimes very coppery.</li>
            <li>no pink color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally wear darker colors and blues and wanted a soft pink to mix things up.</li>

            <li> Item delivered on time. Description was good. Nice color.</li>
            <li> Great new color for me. It is soft but has some drama because of the shimmer. It is a great color for my grand daughter who is almost 2!!</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful...I would order again.</li>
            <li> Love the &amp;#34;Your Web or Mine&amp;#34; shade of The Spiderman Collection.  Thank you for your prompt delivery. OPI products are long lasting and the assortment of colors to choose from are great.</li>
            <li> I Love OPI nail polish, because of the qualities that make everyone love OPI nail polish. Dries quickly and with a glassy finish, wears well and comes in an amazing array of colors. I bought this one, hoping the color would be close to the one shown here.  It&#x27;s close (on my monitor), but is even more flattering. It&#x27;s a gorgeous pink that got me compliments from all kinds of people, even the janitor in my building!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about this pink, and have found that it flatters everyone I know who tries it on. From ultra-white hands to tan ones, the color is so flattering. Every one of my friends says it is the most flattering nail color they&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now I have to buy more, because they used it up.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom because she saw this nail color at her dentist office on the Dental Assistant&#x27;s nails and had to have it.  I looked everywhere for the color and it finally dawned on me that Amazon may carry it.  Well of course Amazon carries the color.  I just wish that I had checked with Amazon initially which would have saved me time, energy and gas. Anyway, my mom didn&#x27;t stop talking about this color nail polish until she was wearing it on her nails.  Come to think of it, she still continued to talk about it while showing off her nails.  It is a pretty color.</li>
            <li> This is a great color I bought several so I don&#x27;t run out soon. The packaging was great, it arrived sooner than I thought and had tracking.</li>
            <li> I thought Opi would last a long time, but I had to keep reapplying. Was very watery. Base coat and top coat didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with Revlon Colorstay Longwear Nail Enamel, Bsse Coeat and Top Coat. That lasts me close to 2 weeks! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 months now.</li>
            <li> Love this color, the product, the arrival was quick and it was exactly what I thought it would be from the pictures.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased an Opi nail polish and all I can say is I love it!! It stays on good and I am so pleased. It seems to keep your nails very strong also.. the color is just beautiful and I will definitely be purchasing this again!!</li>
            <li> I had previously owned this color and ran out. Could not locate it in stores in this area.&lt;br /&gt;Found it on Amazon and it was cheaper than OPI in stores.</li>
            <li> Your Web or Mine is a frosty pink with a metallic finish. This polish has a good formula that is opaque in two coats, but brush strokes are visible because of the metallic quality. Iâ€™m not usually a fan of frosty polishes, but Your Web or Mine is really wearable. I think it goes really well with my skin tone, and is definitely office appropriate. I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photos and more at adventures-in-polishland.com</li>
            <li> Nice color to wear due to its combo of a pearl coral pink, it is very neutral for spring and summer colors.</li>
            <li> Another pretty color!</li>
            <li> well i just got my polish and i dont think so its the same colour  whatever they sent me its okay i am gonna keep it but i was looking for reddish what i got is pinkish....</li>
            <li> I did not like the color as it was more of a peach copper than a pink. The lacquer was also streaky when it was applied. I love Opi Nail Lacquer but this color was not for me. It does not look like the picture that is shown.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother. A bit too pastel and frosty for me until I got the bright idea to use a coat of OPI&#x27;s DSL Tourmaline  on top and boy did it pop.</li>
            <li> What an attractive and different color this turned out to be. I normally gravitate to pinks,roses,&amp; hot pinks. This shade is great and I really love it. The best way I can describe it is it looks like a frosted coral spice. It&#x27;s one of those shades that changes hues depending what colors you are wearing at the time. I love chameleon colors just for that reason. That&#x27;s what this shade turned out to be. This color will be one of my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; colors from now on and will go into my rotation of favorites.</li>
            <li> I discovered this color at a nail salon. Loved it so much that I had to have for retouching. My toes are still this color 2 months later. It&#x27;s very pretty and unique pink. Has a bit of a copper tone to it. Looks a little different depending on what light you&#x27;re in. Sometimes really pink, sometimes very coppery.</li>
            <li> I bought this online without having seen it in person, and I love the color, which I would describe as a very frosted medium to light orange - great for the summer!</li>
            <li> Love this color!  So pretty on my toes!  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> beautiful pink color, goes on so nice, very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Love love love this color</li>
            <li> I love this color! Received order fast.</li>
            <li> Love the color, will order more</li>
            <li> I love this color. OPI makes long lasting quality nail polish in a great variety of colors.</li>
            <li> What arrived today looks **nothing** like the picture. It does not even look pink at all. It looks more of a peachy color with hints of sort like orange, but no pink color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was too darn expensive to get a color that is not one little bit like the photo in the advertisement.</li>
            <li> Like the formula, the color is interesting, not my everyday color, but a fun one all the same</li>
            <li> Okay the only reason I&#x27;m not giving this a 5 star is that I didn&#x27;t care for the color on me as much as I thought I would. I normally wear darker colors and blues and wanted a soft pink to mix things up. This was too light for my own preferences. The color is gorgeous in the bottle and a very pretty rosy color. I liked the sparkle it had it just wasn&#x27;t me. OPI makes the best nail polish and is all that I buy so the product is always great quality. I was just a tad disappointed in this shade but it is no fault of OPI or the seller. The picture is a great representation of what it truly looks like.</li>
