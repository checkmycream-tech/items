            <li>Its nice and neat.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any kind of a cover</li>
            <li>The mini heats up really quick and it straightens hair beautifully...</li>
            <li>I love having a mini, it stored in my purse nicely with out taking all the space..</li>
            <li>heats up nice and hot and is perfect for travelling, tucking right into a gap in the suitcase or carry-on.</li>
            <li>As expected, it worked perfect and loved the design.</li>
            <li>she thinks it&#x27;s perfect: the perfect tiny size to store away, very maneuverable for fixing bangs without burning your forehead, and it gets nice and HOT.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>its ok.</li>
            <li>I bought it more for a touch up through the day product anyways</li>
            <li>and I love the purple design that is on it</li>
            <li>so you can touch your hair up more without heat damage.</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>This is the best $12 I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
            <li>Easy to carry around</li>
            <li>Fits easily in my vanity drawer</li>
            <li>I got one that does not get very hot, but that works better for me.</li>
            <li>it is perfect for doing my bangs and little touch ups at work or anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love love love heats up fast and works great on my super short bangs.</li>
            <li>so the size isn&#x27;t a huge issue.  </li>
            <li>Great results, but the cord tangles constantly and pulls itself from the outlet.</li>
            <li>, so I use it to take my frizzy flyaways on the side of my head, but it works fantastic.</li>
            <li>I use it to smooth my hair a bit after swimming.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t traveled with it yet, but I imagine it will be super easy to pack.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick to heat up, easy to handle, and pack.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with how small it was and how well it still worked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, so very great to put in a purse to take everywhere.</li>
            <li>This little hot iron is great!  </li>
            <li>but, for the price, good enough for a teenager who manages to break everything in her posession!</li>
            <li>Overall I think its a good buy.</li>
            <li>Good way to quickly straighten bangs for short hair.</li>

            <li>This is a great little straightener.</li>
            <li>I used it everyday and it by far is great quality for the price!  </li>
            <li>At $10 I feel it was worth the price.</li>
            <li>Gets hot quick and handles well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for small touch ups.</li>
            <li>And the cored is still a nice long length.</li>
            <li>I was worried based on reviews that the Mini Bundle Monster gets Very hot Fast.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product: it warms up easily and is easy to use even to curl short hair.</li>
            <li>Wish it got hotter, but overall it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>These worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get HOT</li>
            <li>The thing heats up so hot</li>
            <li>I measured it first thing when I took it out of the box.  </li>
            <li>When I first brought it, I had a pixie cut</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my 1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>rips my hair out and VERY flimsy.</li>
            <li>and it heats up fast.</li>
            <li>I can go much much closer to my roots with this than with my instyler.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ready to go in under a minute.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t straight my hair well.  </li>
            <li>Straighteners don&#x27;t really take up that much suitcase space anyway</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my full size flat iron but did the job!  </li>
            <li>Nice and small and very portable.</li>
            <li>I need a high heat to straighten my hair and this did absolutely nothing to my hair.  </li>
            <li>nice small size for dog grooming and shows.</li>
            <li>I use this to curl/straighten my SUPER short hair</li>
            <li>Would be better with the switch on the side or back instead of the middle.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something more lightweight to replace my heavy, bulky Chi.  </li>
            <li>love the color and for short hair i can get it styled with out burning my fingers,heats up fast and cools down fast</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t heat up hot enough.  </li>
            <li>Small, compact for your purse, heats well, cute color...</li>
            <li>but it got hot enough to do my bangs.</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because they don&#x27;t really get that hot other than that are just affordable.</li>
            <li>I purchased this mini iron for my 15 year old step daughter who is transitioning from relaxed hair to natural.  </li>
            <li>My only con&#x27;s are really based on my hair..</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do as well as my high end flat iron, but for a travel iron or for small areas around the scalp it does the job fine.  </li>
            <li>It barely takes up any space in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers are correct, though, it does not get hot enough.</li>

            <li> Other reviewers are correct, though, it does not get hot enough.</li>
            <li> flat iron</li>
            <li> its not adjustable but as long as nobody uses it constantly</li>
            <li> The only con I can say is that the style doesn&#x27;t hold very long.</li>
            <li> Works for small hair touch ups, which is mainly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have a bob with short layers in the back and needed something small to curl the back.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with some of the bigger ones cuz my hair is short.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I bought it and some people were saying it was only 5 inches long, but that&#x27;s not true.  </li>
            <li> I really do not like this straightener.</li>
            <li> Now that my hair has grown to ear/neck length, I had to get a larger flat iron to handle the longer pieces of my course, thick hair.</li>
            <li> But as other reviews have stated, the off switch is in the dumbest place it could be.</li>
            <li> It is entirely too small.  </li>
            <li> As previous reviews have noted it flops on side and does not stand up so you must be careful.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for the size but the color is definitely a plus, at least for me.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done but you can only have a very, VERY small amount of hair in there.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s one less thing cluttering up the counter.</li>
            <li> Prefer a very small flat iron and that&#x27;s what I got.</li>
            <li> And it takes a little longer to straighten.</li>
            <li> so this purchase was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Like I have really thick and tight curls..</li>
            <li> I received it in under a week and in a small box.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be a small usable portable straightener</li>
            <li> I got this to just do my bangs because they do a weird little mermaid thing.</li>
            <li> sucks!</li>
            <li> It works terrifyingly well for such a small object.</li>
            <li> I still use it for my random shorter pieces that haven&#x27;t grown out yet</li>
            <li> my girlfriend got this for her bangs (they look crazy in the mornings after she wakes up).</li>
            <li> Though I do think the on switch is in a bad location.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Girlfriend already had one but wanted another.  As expected, it worked perfect and loved the design.</li>
            <li> This little hot iron is great!  I used it everyday and it by far is great quality for the price!  I would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Love love love heats up fast and works great on my super short bangs.</li>
            <li> As previous reviews have noted it flops on side and does not stand up so you must be careful.  Also watch your fingers when trying to switch it off as you don&#x27;t have a lot of room to maneuver</li>
            <li> This is a great little straightener. I was impressed with how small it was and how well it still worked. I have really short hair so I didn&#x27;t need a big straightner. I haven&#x27;t traveled with it yet, but I imagine it will be super easy to pack. It barely takes up any space in my bathroom. Love it.</li>
            <li> nice small size for dog grooming and shows.</li>
            <li> Great results, but the cord tangles constantly and pulls itself from the outlet. Gets hot quick and handles well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t heat up hot enough.  I can touch it without saying ouch.</li>
            <li> sucks! rips my hair out and VERY flimsy.</li>
            <li> So so. Wish it got hotter, but overall it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my full size flat iron but did the job!  I have really short hair so the size isn&#x27;t a huge issue.  will work great for my gym bag too.</li>
            <li> Wonderful just wonderful!:)</li>
            <li> I use this to curl/straighten my SUPER short hair and I love it! It doesn&#x27;t fry my hair either, it&#x27;s the perfect temp!</li>
            <li> Works for small hair touch ups, which is mainly what I wanted. Other reviewers are correct, though, it does not get hot enough.</li>
            <li> Yes I love works perfect on my hair</li>
            <li> Love this! It&#x27;s small, so very great to put in a purse to take everywhere.</li>
            <li> love the color and for short hair i can get it styled with out burning my fingers,heats up fast and cools down fast</li>
            <li> I purchased this mini iron for my 15 year old step daughter who is transitioning from relaxed hair to natural.  She likes to iron her roots at times and this works well to blend them in with her relaxed edges.  Probably not as good as a Sedu and Chi but, for the price, good enough for a teenager who manages to break everything in her posession!</li>
            <li> Received this product yesterday and used them this morning. I have a bob with short layers in the back and needed something small to curl the back. These worked pretty well. Though I do think the on switch is in a bad location.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product: it warms up easily and is easy to use even to curl short hair. I bought it for the size but the color is definitely a plus, at least for me.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because they don&#x27;t really get that hot other than that are just affordable.</li>
            <li> Its nice and neat. Easy to carry around and it heats up fast. I can go much much closer to my roots with this than with my instyler. The only thing is that I wish I could adjust the temperature settings but I guess for $11.99 you get what u pay for. Overall I think its a good buy. If you fear burning your hair from the one temperature setting what I do is quickly pass the iron over my hair and of course using a heat protectant.</li>
            <li> I really do not like this straightener.</li>
            <li> This is the best $12 I&#x27;ve ever spent. I received it in under a week and in a small box. It doesn&#x27;t have any kind of a cover and it&#x27;s recommended that you use a heating pad to avoid a fire, but it doesn&#x27;t come with one. Ti can plug this in and turn it on and it&#x27;s ready to go in under a minute. Im a white girl with medium texture hair, so I use it to take my frizzy flyaways on the side of my head, but it works fantastic. It&#x27;s also great for small touch ups.</li>
            <li> Small, compact for your purse, heats well, cute color...LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. My hair is short. Prefer a very small flat iron and that&#x27;s what I got.</li>
            <li> I got this to just do my bangs because they do a weird little mermaid thing. It didn&#x27;t get HOT but it got hot enough to do my bangs. Nice and small and very portable. Fits easily in my vanity drawer so it&#x27;s one less thing cluttering up the counter.</li>
            <li> I was worried based on reviews that the Mini Bundle Monster gets Very hot Fast. I got one that does not get very hot, but that works better for me. I use it to smooth my hair a bit after swimming. So it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> This thing is a joke. I thought it was going to be a small usable portable straightener it is so tiny it looks like it was made for a doll. The thing heats up so hot you can&#x27;t even touch it</li>
            <li> its ok. i wish it had adjusting temperatures</li>
            <li> It gets the job done but you can only have a very, VERY small amount of hair in there. For me, I could only have about a 1/8&amp;#34; section in and would still have to go over it several times. Very low temp.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Pending use.</li>
            <li> Good way to quickly straighten bangs for short hair. It&#x27;s quick to heat up, easy to handle, and pack. Well priced.</li>
            <li> I have pros and con&#x27;s with this item... Pros amazing size.. I love having a mini, it stored in my purse nicely with out taking all the space.. And the cored is still a nice long length. The mini heats up really quick and it straightens hair beautifully... My only con&#x27;s are really based on my hair.. Like I have really thick and tight curls.. And it takes a little longer to straighten. But as for touch up and everything its amazing... I bought it more for a touch up through the day product anyways so to me its perfect and I love the purple design that is on it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t straight my hair well.  I guess thats what I get for purchasing the cheapest.</li>
            <li> It works great for my hair.  I have trouble with some of the bigger ones cuz my hair is short.  This one is perfect.  I read the reviews before I bought it and some people were saying it was only 5 inches long, but that&#x27;s not true.  I measured it first thing when I took it out of the box.  From the end to the part where the cord attaches it&#x27;s 7 inches.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning this item.  I need a high heat to straighten my hair and this did absolutely nothing to my hair.  The size was great, but needs to have plates that get hotter.</li>
            <li> It works terrifyingly well for such a small object. But as other reviews have stated, the off switch is in the dumbest place it could be. So instead of burning my hand I just unplug it while it&#x27;s on. Would be better with the switch on the side or back instead of the middle.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect!  heats up nice and hot and is perfect for travelling, tucking right into a gap in the suitcase or carry-on.</li>
            <li> When I first brought it, I had a pixie cut so I wasn&#x27;t turned off by the reviews. I think it worked awesome for my pixie cut and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Now that my hair has grown to ear/neck length, I had to get a larger flat iron to handle the longer pieces of my course, thick hair. I still use it for my random shorter pieces that haven&#x27;t grown out yet and I throw it in my gym bag to touch up my hair after I work out. The only con I can say is that the style doesn&#x27;t hold very long. But it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my 1&amp;#34; flat iron so you can touch your hair up more without heat damage.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something more lightweight to replace my heavy, bulky Chi.  This is like a doll&#x27;s hair straightener.  It may be helpful for bangs, but that&#x27;s it.  It did nothing for my shoulder length hair.  It is entirely too small.  Straighteners don&#x27;t really take up that much suitcase space anyway so this purchase was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> its a good heat temp. its not adjustable but as long as nobody uses it constantly your hair will be alright</li>
            <li> I love it..it is perfect for doing my bangs and little touch ups at work or anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I think all women should have one</li>
            <li> Works great. I bought this to use on my daughters doll&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do as well as my high end flat iron, but for a travel iron or for small areas around the scalp it does the job fine.  At $10 I feel it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend got this for her bangs (they look crazy in the mornings after she wakes up). she thinks it&#x27;s perfect: the perfect tiny size to store away, very maneuverable for fixing bangs without burning your forehead, and it gets nice and HOT.</li>
