            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clog pores and I always get compliments on my skin when I see a dermatologist.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I think for the price, the quantity should be more.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I find its texture more on heavier side like olive oil.</li>
            <li>I am sure that you can use on your hair, but I have not tried it for that purpose.</li>
            <li>So, overall its a nice product with great results.</li>

            <li>i rub this in my scalp, because i have dry hair, and its very good for the hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been experimenting for a few months using oils as lotion, and this one seems to be the best on my skin.</li>
            <li>the shower makes my skin soooo soft its amazing.  </li>
            <li>Soak a soft towel in warm water, and wring out.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think it is a good conditioner for hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s extremely mild.</li>
            <li>I receive the same results, my skin is softer, suppler, and the avocado oil seems to retain the moisture better when I apply another body moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair super silky and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>your hair like normal using warm water to open the shafts, then rinse clean, mix a bit of this oil with a rich conditioner (the one you don&#x27;t use every day)</li>
            <li>The oil came pretty quick.</li>
            <li>I purchased this at my local super market and fell in love the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>A couple of drops go a long way, so it&#x27;s const effective as well.</li>
            <li>I use this for my psoriasis and it certainly does wonders!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Avocado Oil Skin Benefits:&lt;br /&gt;Avocados are an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins A, D and E, and can provide skin with deep moisture.</li>
            <li>Avocados are an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins A, D and E, and can provide skin with deep moisture.</li>
            <li>I sugest to buy because is the right size and is pure avocado oil.</li>
            <li>had bought De La Cruz olive oil first</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many different ways to use avocado oil for a scalp and hair treatment.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried avocado oil.</li>
            <li>, makes skin feel smooth, soft and hidrated.</li>
            <li>I bought this avocado oil for my skin from Target the first time.</li>
            <li>and I wake up to soft and smooth skin every morning.</li>
            <li>I have tried blending avocado with olive oil and received remarkably positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>Apart from strengthening the hair strands, avocado oil adds a dash of shine and makes hair super soft.</li>
            <li>Apart from strengthening the hair strands, avocado oil adds a dash of shine and makes hair super soft.</li>
            <li>One of the reasons why I chose De La Cruz is because the two oils that I have ordered from them are 100% pure oil, no additives, parabens, chemicals or anything else added to their product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is stronger and very shiny.</li>
            <li>omg and my skin its a absolute</li>
            <li>, so I used a gentle shampoo / massage&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>the Kent shampoo brush from Amazon, and this worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>it is very mositurzing.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and it really feels</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, all the oils that I have used have provided my skin, body and hair with very positive results, as a moisturizer for all, and as a detangle product and conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a great moisturizer especially since I have extremely sensitive skin due to rosacea.</li>
            <li>so I was able to mix it with other things that had a scent.</li>
            <li>I avoid putting this oil on my roots as I have a strong history of oily roots with dry ends.</li>
            <li>However, although I have received positive results, each different oil has slightly different benefits, so I will continue to use them all for a healthy variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In addition to providing the skin with moisture, the antioxidants found in avocado oil -- particularly vitamins A and E --</li>
            <li>It has no odor or scent so it can be easily blended with other products.</li>
            <li>I drop a few drops in the palm of my hand on top of my regular conditioner and then smooth the mix over my ends and towards the middle shaft of my hair.</li>
            <li>Very soft feel but not greesy.  </li>
            <li>a facial product, I have used the avocado oil in conjunction with my moisturizer, oil first and followed by a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>In addition, massaging the scalp with avocado oil regularly will immediately result in positive changes in hair quality.</li>

            <li>You can buy avocado oil at your local grocery store for allot less money and you get allot more oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As body oil, I apply it right after my shower before I towel dry.</li>
            <li>The delivered results are a soft and manageable mane, without any greasy or oily residue.</li>
            <li>(I used one of my soft toweling hair turbans for this part) and&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>Avocado oil also contains sterolins, which are natural steroids.</li>

            <li>It is natural and is goos as hair conditioner</li>
            <li>It really softens the skin and facial lines.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shines like never before.</li>
            <li>last useful tip; if you have any extra eye droppers from any finished skin-care products, throw away the cap from this avocado oil and substitute the eye dropper cap instead.</li>
            <li>One last useful tip; if you have any extra eye droppers from any finished skin-care products, throw away the cap from this avocado oil and substitute the eye dropper cap instead.</li>
            <li>My hair rinsed out very well, no greasy or oily residue, and my normally dry hair was very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>preferably one that has no silicone, apply it on the ends and middle lengths, try to not pile your hair on your head as the oil with make your roots dull/heavy, keep a towel on your shoulders, turn on your favorite show for 30-45 mins, rinse with cold water, gently squeeze excess water (do NOT twist!!)</li>
            <li>I only use about 3 or 4 drops to cover both my face and neck and within a couple of minutes, my &#x60;thirty skin&#x27; absorbs the oil, leaving skin both soft and supple.</li>
            <li>This way you have more control over the amount dispensed, less waste, with an easier and faster</li>
            <li>This way you have more control over the amount dispensed, less waste, with an easier and faster application.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;-only use a little (ie a dribble or two depending on the length of your pretty locks)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mix it with a little castor seed oil and use as hot oil massage for my hair and also for my oil cleansing method.</li>
            <li>With its high level of vitamin E, avocado oil may reduce itching and inflammation of the skin and is beneficial in softening rough and cracked skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With its high level of vitamin E, avocado oil may reduce itching and inflammation of the skin and is beneficial in softening rough and cracked skin.    </li>
            <li>The oil of an avocado is able to penetrate the skin with its thin consistency; and is still thick enough to serve as a protective barrier on the skin, much like a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to providing the skin with moisture, the antioxidants found in avocado oil -- particularly vitamins A and E -- can help soothe sunburned skin.</li>
            <li>Even though it comes in a small bottle it was soo worth it.</li>
            <li>and I had received positive results as a facial moisturizer, for my dry skin, as a body moisturizer and as a hair treatment conditioner for my dry scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>It might be helping the few bumps that I do occasionally get, but I&#x27;m not 100 percent positive.</li>
            <li>By minimally lubricating my face first with oil, there is less irritation as the derma roller strips my face of the natural oils, and I have better results, less stinging, less redness, and I do not end the session as a dried out prune.</li>

            <li> Best Avocado Oil on the market!</li>
            <li> I use this for my psoriasis and it certainly does wonders! Also, i have been using this for a day time moisturizer which lasts all day long and you would expect your skin to feel oily but it doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all.</li>
            <li> I used avocado oil on my hair and scalp because I tried to color my hair with the Ambre hair color and I did it wrong. I forgot to&lt;br /&gt;add the moisturizer and I burned my hair ends. I immediately applied avocado oil directly to my entire head of long hair and noticed that all my dried out ends seemed to recover. I have since continued to apply the avocado oil to ends of my hair before every hair&lt;br /&gt;wash and no longer have the parched hair ends. It only took about 3 applications to get my hair back to where I started&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still want to get a hair trimmed for added improvement, but I will continue to use as a conditioner from now on. My hair is stronger and very shiny. You can buy avocado oil at your local grocery store for allot less money and you get allot more oil.</li>
            <li> Great prpduct!!! It helped moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> Just as described will order again</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff!!!  I use this along with jojobo and castor oil to create my own oil cleanser.  It works amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting for a few months using oils as lotion, and this one seems to be the best on my skin. It soaks in the best and seems to moisturize deeply. Very soft feel but not greesy.  If it has any smell at all it&#x27;s extremely mild. I didn&#x27;t notice any.</li>
            <li> Using on my face.  I love how my skin feels.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;I use it in my hair and body.&lt;br /&gt;after the shower makes my skin soooo soft its amazing.  It has a every light scent nothing crazy. Will repurchase again!</li>
            <li> Excellent for skin and hair. A small amount is sufficient.</li>
            <li> I know i would not be at peace without Avacado oil in my life it strengthens an moisturizes my hair too perfection, omg and my skin its a absolute must i use it for my face, my body and in every other bath. Love love love this product. I was offered this product at a discounted price for a honest review</li>
            <li> Still in store,hope my wife will like it</li>
            <li> Avocado Oil-Aceite De Aguacate-De La Cruz&lt;br /&gt;Came on time, well packaged, small size but I bought 2. I rather have quality than size, it is working for me since day one.&lt;br /&gt;Price is so good, I suggest to buy 2.&lt;br /&gt;R</li>
            <li> I sugest to buy because is the right size and is pure avocado oil. I will buy it again. I love it</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, dry hair, I live in a dry climate, and due to my &#x60;mature age&#x27; of well over 50, these issues have accelerated. Just lately, within the last several months I have started experimenting with different oils as part of my &#x60;beauty regime&#x27;. My latest acquisition has been with Avocado Oil, and I am very satisfied with all the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had bought De La Cruz olive oil first and I had received positive results as a facial moisturizer, for my dry skin, as a body moisturizer and as a hair treatment conditioner for my dry scalp and hair. One of the reasons why I chose De La Cruz is because the two oils that I have ordered from them are 100% pure oil, no additives, parabens, chemicals or anything else added to their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This avocado oil has a very light scent, but nothing that is distinguishable. Yes, it is oily, but that is what the product is...avocado oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a facial product, I have used the avocado oil in conjunction with my moisturizer, oil first and followed by a moisturizer. For my skin, the addition of avocado oil before applying the facial conditioner locks in the moisture. I only use about 3 or 4 drops to cover both my face and neck and within a couple of minutes, my &#x60;thirty skin&#x27; absorbs the oil, leaving skin both soft and supple. I have also used just 2 drops as a slight lubricant before my nightly derma rolling session. By minimally lubricating my face first with oil, there is less irritation as the derma roller strips my face of the natural oils, and I have better results, less stinging, less redness, and I do not end the session as a dried out prune. After my derma session, I apply my serums followed by the avocado oil, I let it absorb for a moment or two and finish off by applying my moisturizer last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As body oil, I apply it right after my shower before I towel dry. I receive the same results, my skin is softer, suppler, and the avocado oil seems to retain the moisture better when I apply another body moisturizer on top. In other words, my skin does not dry out as fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many different ways to use avocado oil for a scalp and hair treatment. I like to mix about 1/8 tsp in a handful of shampoo when I wash my thick, coarse textured, and dry, color treated hair. The delivered results are a soft and manageable mane, without any greasy or oily residue. Instead of the usual dryness, my hair retains the moisture until the next wash. For an intense hair and scalp treatment, avocado oil is usually used in conjunction with other oils for these treatments. I have tried blending avocado with olive oil and received remarkably positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair and Scalp Treatment:&lt;br /&gt;1) Blend:&lt;br /&gt; ½ tsp. olive oil&lt;br /&gt; ½ tsp. avocado oil&lt;br /&gt;2) Heat up slightly...I used a small glass covered jar for the blended oils, and placed the jar in a bowl of very hot&lt;br /&gt; water for about 15-20 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;3) Then massage the heated oils in small circular motions, directly into scalp and hair for 15 minutes. (I have an&lt;br /&gt; issue regarding my fingers &#x60;locking-up&#x27; during these repetitive motions, so I used a gentle shampoo / massage&lt;br /&gt; brush ...the Kent shampoo brush from Amazon, and this worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;4) Soak a soft towel in warm water, and wring out. (I used one of my soft toweling hair turbans for this part) and&lt;br /&gt; wrap around hair for about 15 minutes, letting the oils soak into the scalp and hair.&lt;br /&gt;5) Then wash thoroughly, followed by usual hair conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;6) Blow dry or style as usual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results: My hair rinsed out very well, no greasy or oily residue, and my normally dry hair was very soft and manageable. With the addition of a few spritzes of my argan oil, my hair had both body and a little (much needed) volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, all the oils that I have used have provided my skin, body and hair with very positive results, as a moisturizer for all, and as a detangle product and conditioner for my hair. However, although I have received positive results, each different oil has slightly different benefits, so I will continue to use them all for a healthy variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This concludes my review on Avocado Oil; however, if you wish to continue reading, I have put together some facts regarding the benefits of Avocado Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avocado Oil Skin Benefits:&lt;br /&gt;Avocados are an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins A, D and E, and can provide skin with deep moisture. The oil of an avocado is able to penetrate the skin with its thin consistency; and is still thick enough to serve as a protective barrier on the skin, much like a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to providing the skin with moisture, the antioxidants found in avocado oil -- particularly vitamins A and E -- can help soothe sunburned skin. Avocado oil also contains sterolins, which are natural steroids. They may be effective in boosting collagen production and in treating age spots. With its high level of vitamin E, avocado oil may reduce itching and inflammation of the skin and is beneficial in softening rough and cracked skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avocado Oil Hair and Scalp Benefits&lt;br /&gt;Avocado oil is full of hair vitamins that promote and maintain silky, healthy, and strong hair. It also contains amino acids that bind split ends, nourish hair follicles, and promote faster hair growth. The various nutrients in avocado oil protect hair from environmental pollution. Apart from strengthening the hair strands, avocado oil adds a dash of shine and makes hair super soft. In addition, massaging the scalp with avocado oil regularly will immediately result in positive changes in hair quality. Chemical treatments such as dyes and perms can also make the hair extremely dry, and for this situation, an application of avocado oil will deliver vitality to damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last useful tip; if you have any extra eye droppers from any finished skin-care products, throw away the cap from this avocado oil and substitute the eye dropper cap instead. This way you have more control over the amount dispensed, less waste, with an easier and faster application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading my review, and I hope it has been helpful in describing some of the uses and benefits for using Avocado Oil.tinue to use them all for a healthy variety.

            <li> it is very mositurzing. it has a very light smell to it. it was well wrapped in the box that it camed in that their was a &amp;#34;no spill gaurenty&amp;#34;. like it alot</li>
            <li> I purchased this at my local super market and fell in love the first time I used it! It has no odor or scent so it can be easily blended with other products. When I feel like my hair is thirsty I drop a few drops in the palm of my hand on top of my regular conditioner and then smooth the mix over my ends and towards the middle shaft of my hair. I avoid putting this oil on my roots as I have a strong history of oily roots with dry ends. It makes my hair super silky and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;-only use a little (ie a dribble or two depending on the length of your pretty locks)&lt;br /&gt;-only spread this oil/conditioner mix on the ends and on the middle lengths of your hair (avoid the roots)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ultimate Hair Treatment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash your hair like normal using warm water to open the shafts, then rinse clean, mix a bit of this oil with a rich conditioner (the one you don&#x27;t use every day) preferably one that has no silicone, apply it on the ends and middle lengths, try to not pile your hair on your head as the oil with make your roots dull/heavy, keep a towel on your shoulders, turn on your favorite show for 30-45 mins, rinse with cold water, gently squeeze excess water (do NOT twist!!) and let hair air dry with towel on your shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note* if your hair is super thick and heavy use a hair dryer on COLD for 10-15 mins when hair is damp (not soaked).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comb your hair out when damp, then flip to add a bit of volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Done!!</li>
            <li> I use it on my face at night and wake up with dewy skin. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clog pores and I always get compliments on my skin when I see a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great moisturizer especially since I have extremely sensitive skin due to rosacea.</li>
            <li> Great Product love how it worked. Nice rich oil good for skin and hair. used this product on my hair and it was ultra shiny and appeared thicker.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair along with Rosemary, and coconut oil, they are very nice and leave my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I am using my avocado oil for my face to rid of dark circles under eye.&lt;br /&gt;I find that the oil makes my skin supple, yet my dark circles have not disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;The next thing I will use my avocado oil for is my hair. My hair is excessively dry, and I would like this oil to hydrate</li>
            <li> Love this oil too good for my eyes to put around &amp; good for my skin too thanks for my purchase.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think it is a good conditioner for hair. However, I think for the price, the quantity should be more. I am pleased with my purchase. Thanks.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time. I decided to buy this to use with shea butter to make a hair concoction. It worked excellent and really moisturized my hair. Even though it comes in a small bottle it was soo worth it. Also, the oil was odorless so I was able to mix it with other things that had a scent. However, my only complaint is that you get so little :(</li>
            <li> Work great on my skin. A little go along way.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the excellent work!</li>
            <li> Just wish I got a bigger bottle</li>
            <li> i rub this in my scalp, because i have dry hair, and its very good for the hair</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product. Came in perfectly and on time. This is the first time I have tried avocado oil. So, I did not know what to expect. I find its texture more on heavier side like olive oil. I mix it with a little castor seed oil and use as hot oil massage for my hair and also for my oil cleansing method. Its results are great just like olive oil  and is super moisturizing. So, overall its a nice product with great results.</li>
            <li> All natural, no harmful chemicals o parabens, makes skin feel smooth, soft and hidrated. A couple of drops go a long way, so it&#x27;s const effective as well.</li>
            <li> Yea, i love it !! It is natural and is goos as hair conditioner</li>
            <li> The oil came pretty quick. I&#x27;ve used this product before, but I bought it at a store. It makes my skin feel very smooth and it really feels like it&#x27;s moisturizing my skin rather than just sitting on it. A little goes a long way. It hasn&#x27;t caused my skin to breakout or anything. It might be helping the few bumps that I do occasionally get, but I&#x27;m not 100 percent positive.</li>
            <li> I bought this avocado oil for my skin from Target the first time. I use it every night on my face. It really softens the skin and facial lines. It is inexpensive, and it does not make me break out. I found it on amazon and I bought it again. I use religiously every night and I wake up to soft and smooth skin every morning. I am sure that you can use on your hair, but I have not tried it for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I added this to my liquid body soap (Miracle II).&lt;br /&gt;They took this ingredient out when the founder died!!&lt;br /&gt;The price is good. Also I rub some on my hands and&lt;br /&gt;put on my hair...</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shines like never before. Very happy with this product.</li>
