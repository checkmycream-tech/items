            <li>received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li>Thought that was nice.</li>
            <li>The Eye gel was protectively packaged and was in nice condition as described on product page.  </li>
            <li>LIKED HOW IT FELT GOING</li>
            <li>I have already seen a difference in the wrinkles around my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;Received for honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li>I am 71 years old and am told all the time I do not look it!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I would love to find that perfect product that does take away puffiness when you apply it, right now and not have to pay $100 or more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and smooth and goes on very nicely.</li>
            <li>Super happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>So far, just wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I have decided to be more honest (in my reviews, and with myself) about the effectiveness of products.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant cucumber smell, is not oily, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that this eye gel is instantly refreshing and it does help with puffiness, smells nice and &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It is pleasant to use and smell fresh like cucumber.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I am sure with more use of this product it will. :)</li>
            <li>was much, much better.</li>
            <li>I use it morning and night and love it.</li>
            <li>I love the eye gel....</li>
            <li>Love this eye gel.</li>
            <li>I tried so many eye creams to&lt;br /&gt;Fix</li>
            <li>Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>Yes, like so many women, I&#x27;ve tried them all from $20-$100</li>
            <li>It gets better.</li>
            <li>The product does seem to make the are under my eyes look better.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I am quite pleased with the eye gel...</li>
            <li>I have been using this since it arrived, twice a day, love it........</li>
            <li>I will upgrade as appropriate with use.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad that products like this exist to help me shine during the moments that matter most to</li>
            <li>The product is not an inmediate miracle it has to be applied according to the seller instructions, but be sure they will always be there for you.</li>
            <li>Outstanding customer service</li>
            <li>, my eyes feel refreshing</li>
            <li>Looks like it is working but may work better on my husband.</li>
            <li>It was OK but not something I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li>AND MAYBE WOULD GET MORE STARS</li>
            <li>This stuff shows great results around the eyes FAST.</li>
            <li>and after a couple of more weeks there was still no difference.  </li>
            <li>Just wish it would do more for the under eye puffiness.</li>
            <li>Lots of follow-up emails  telling me how to apply, which would be better if received WITH product.  </li>
            <li>Feels good and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty good</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it - not sticky - goes on so easy and</li>
            <li>very cool feeling when you put it on....smooths the skin.</li>
            <li>As soon as it is applied it feels refreshing and gives you a smooth look under eyes.</li>
            <li>The good news is you can reapply as much as you need.</li>
            <li>Cool and soothing, no irritation whatsoever!  </li>
            <li>The boost in firmness is clear--now I just wish I could soak in a tub full of it!  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for a week now and cannot say enough good things!</li>
            <li>The pump bottle is easy to use and control the amount for application.</li>
            <li>I love it specially bcuz</li>
            <li>It also has done away with some fine lines.</li>
            <li>I can tell you for sure - you will love it from the first time you pull it out of the frig.</li>
            <li>change in fine lines either.</li>
            <li>product really works magic!</li>
            <li>In a couple of days I&#x27;ve seen improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>A fantastic tip</li>
            <li>This went on smoothly, goes along way</li>
            <li>the following day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Great product.</li>
            <li>the following day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light gel like formula - to be seen if it lightens as suggested.</li>
            <li>This eye gel contains potent natural ingredients that effectively minimize those problems.  </li>
            <li>but so far it has been good.  </li>
            <li>the product is exactly as described, very light, and does help soothe and reduce under eye puffiness.  </li>
            <li>The Brilliant Eye Gel by Eve Hansen is a must have for those who are dealing with puffiness, dark circles, wrinkles, sagging, loss of plump and some others issues.</li>
            <li>I am a 76 year old male and very happy with your product.  </li>
            <li>I just started using this product but so far I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it is better to apply it before makeup on freshly washed skin, but when life calls for a &amp;#34;look awake&amp;#34; moment, this gel absorbs without completely smudging your makeup like oil based</li>
            <li>(The allergies part is true)  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe it was manufactured as full as the bottle claimed.  </li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t see any results than I will be asking for a full refund.</li>
            <li>So far so good, I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet but really like the gel</li>
            <li>The pump container is not the best delivery device, it allows too much product to be wasted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cooling upon application.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this formula, the smell is slight and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Great feeling on my face and wrinkles seem to be less visible.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, and I already love it!</li>
            <li>I like the way it absorbs nicely, and it has really helped reduce any bags under my 50 year old eyes!  </li>
            <li>The texture is almost like a Vaseline but a little softer which makes it feel great when you put it</li>
            <li>It will have to do a great job to be worth it at this price for so little.  </li>
            <li>It is light and absorb fast.</li>
            <li>Product seems to be good, but my bottle (despite tiny usage) was gone extremely fast.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it for a couple of weeks, but it feels nice.  </li>
            <li>received this product in exchange for an honest review.on&#x27;t instantly disappear</li>
            <li>I do feel safe applying the eye gel, because of the vegan, natural and Organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells so fresh and minty</li>
            <li>Another thing that will keep me buying this is it&#x27;s CRUELTY FREE &amp; has a vegan formula - This eye gel treatment is not to be underestimated as it&#x27;s highly effective at reducing dark circles, puffiness and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Not really as I expected! :)</li>
            <li>It is a very good product, I use it everyday and no complains so far.</li>
            <li>This truly worked the first night I applied.</li>
            <li>For the low price I paid, I&#x27;m somewhat satisfied just using it just as a moisturizer and wouldn&#x27;t return the product, but I&#x27;m also not sold yet on buying it again</li>
            <li>will most definently be re ordering as soon as i get low...</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>This products works very well!</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty resistant to change, so if you are like me, be encouraged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty resistant to change, so if you are like me, be encouraged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I look more awake and refreshed overall.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>This product was for my wife and it was her first time trying</li>
            <li>Hopefully when I am in my 50s I can still pass for 30s ;)</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>Glad to find an eye gel that actually works!</li>
            <li>Started working from the first day I tried it.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be trying out more products from this line.</li>
            <li>and now I am back to my old one that is doing better !</li>
            <li>(that might depend on how long it lasts since the container feels very light).</li>
            <li>The price is more than reasonable and the promises are TRUE unlike any other on the market or in a dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical at first, because I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement, and then I thought to myself &amp;#34;These eye-bags didn&#x27;t happen overnight Warner, they&#x27;re not gonna go away overnight&amp;#34;, and sure enough, I kept applying it before bed for a week or so, and noticed an incredible reduction in eye bags and puffiness.</li>
            <li>Certainly most effective within a few hours after application, but there does seem to be some lasting effect</li>
            <li>Certainly most effective within a few hours after application, but there does seem to be some lasting effect</li>
            <li>Well, I have puffiness because I work long hours and nothing works as so many products say they will.  </li>
            <li>Nice consistency but haven&#x27;t seen a difference in dark circles or lines.</li>
            <li>I honestly feel the dark rings are disappearing under my eyes 👀.</li>
            <li>If I notice a change in the puffiness of the bags under my eyes or any minimizing of fine lines after using for another couple of weeks, I will come back and update this review.  </li>
            <li>It definitely tightens the eye area and fine lines on the face.</li>
            <li>So far good, no significant improvement.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye gel by Eve Hansen.  </li>
            <li>It does tighten skin around the eyes, but what I really noticed was the puffiness around my eyes</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This really does what it says.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t bother me at all so it is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye gel.</li>
            <li>It arrived very promptly even tho</li>
            <li>I never thought an eye cream could do so much to lessen the puffiness around my eyes.</li>
            <li>This cream really works.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye gel.  </li>
            <li>I wish they hadn&#x27;t said that results come fast.  </li>
            <li>It is also very lightweight gliding on, so</li>
            <li>Seemed a bit watery and really haven&#x27;t gotten any results either.</li>
            <li>So gentle on eyes and removes that pesty mascara which tends to remain on lashes.  </li>
            <li>I may be 31, but I look like I&#x27;m in my early-twenties again, thanks to this eye gel.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye gel.</li>
            <li>This product was way better than I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Consistency: The gel is thicker than many serums I am used to and takes a bit longer to rub in and absorb completely, but also seems to actually absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using the gel for only a week, so have not noticed any significant changes.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product and have high hopes that this will become part of my beauty routine.</li>
            <li>I see a little change, but I still grab the ice bags I have in my freezer and apply for 2-3 min., then I am good to go, especially if I am going out at night after a 12 hour work</li>
            <li>/&gt;It absorbs quickly with no left over shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>the description highly overate this product</li>
            <li>Works about the same as other products of its kind.</li>
            <li>This bottle is very small, but the results are stunning, It worth every penny.</li>
            <li>hope that in using it longer it will iron out the eye wrinkles a little more......</li>
            <li>I would name this smell, &amp;#34;Brief hint of arboretum&amp;#34; (even though &amp;#34;brief hint of jungle would be cooler, arboretum is a little more</li>
            <li>It feels like a lighter version of Monistat Anti-Chafing Gel which seems to be the main ingredient in all the new &amp;#34;blurring&amp;#34; cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Got a great deal on this product through a promotional offer, and got two of them for less than the price of other natural eye-gels--75%  natural--no harsh chemicals, and helps smooth wrinkles around eyes, as well as helping with under-eye puffiness and discoloration--Excellent!</li>
            <li>It seems very moisturizing so far.  </li>
            <li>I normally have puffy eyes by the end of the workweek</li>
            <li>I have noticed that the sun damage around my eyes is getting better, and not as dried out.</li>
            <li>i have 2 small children and one on the way, work full time and go to school full time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never heard of Eve Hansen, but I read the ingredients and knew it would be worth a try - especially at this price point.</li>
            <li>However I will give it a few more weeks and see.</li>
            <li>smoother appearing skin around my eyes in a few weeks, and it seems like my skin has more elasticity.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes instantly and smells like fresh cucumber.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m purely using this gel for my eyes alone because I&#x27;m using also the Pure Argan Oil together as part of my facial regimen.</li>
            <li>and it seems like I&#x27;m always trying new eye creams</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes but had no problem at all with the gel.</li>
            <li>Very soft gel for under eyes.</li>
            <li>and I did not have any reaction and my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Following the instructions, I&#x27;ve been using this product under my eyes every night and occasionally in the mornings before make-up application for two weeks now, and so far, I have not noticed any difference in my fine lines or bags.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in YEARS the constant &#x27;puffiness&#x27; under my eyes has dissipated!</li>
            <li>The price is cheaper then other top brands with the same ingredients.</li>
            <li>very useful for concealing dark spots and removing them.</li>
            <li>It really does help, just be sure to use a small amount - too much makes hair feel strange.</li>
            <li>The dark circles and puffiness start to fade away, stay away, and with continued use you only look better.  </li>
            <li>This one is clearly a hit</li>
            <li>I will definitely use this product again as the price is reasonable and it does reduce the puffiness around my eyes.</li>
            <li>(Maybe I&#x27;m just getting old.)</li>
            <li>It keeps my eyes soft without a greasy residue.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this eye gel</li>
            <li>I kept this in my fridge to add to the cooling effect this eye gel offers.</li>
            <li>No harsh smell to deal with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still to early to tell.</li>
            <li>and so far she likes it</li>
            <li>I was really surprised.</li>
            <li>The good news is that the bottle, though it is only a half ounce, will last that long.  </li>
            <li>I saw visible results on my puffy eyes and dark circles from the very first application.</li>
            <li>I have no dark circles, bags are almost gone</li>
            <li>lines: I do notices an improvement (not disappearance) in my fine lines about 15 minutes after application lasting for a few hours.</li>
            <li>For some reason I developed dark circles for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>A little of this goes a long way and the pump dispenser makes it easy to control.  </li>
            <li>with using this product, i see a major difference.</li>
            <li>my genes aren&#x27;t doing me any major favors (when it comes to aging)</li>
            <li>This gel began working very quickly, but by the time I was half way into the bottle the dark circles were completely gone!</li>
            <li>, it makes my skin feel moisturizer, not dry or pulling.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have dark circles to begin with.  </li>
            <li>I saw a real reduction in circles in both puffiness and the dark color.</li>
            <li>and i am very sleep deprived, had black circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Seeing a small change is worth trying this product especially if you use it for longer.</li>
            <li>Back in February I had a sinus infection that left my eyes very puffy and with dark circles.</li>
            <li>Such a powerful product in such a small bottle.</li>

            <li> Works very well, use sparingly and get great results!</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> The company also has great customer follow-up, with specific directions for use and how to get best results.</li>
            <li> received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> Thought that was nice.</li>
            <li> The Eye gel was protectively packaged and was in nice condition as described on product page.  </li>
            <li> LIKED HOW IT FELT GOING</li>
            <li> I have already seen a difference in the wrinkles around my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;Received for honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> I am 71 years old and am told all the time I do not look it!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I would love to find that perfect product that does take away puffiness when you apply it, right now and not have to pay $100 or more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and smooth and goes on very nicely.</li>
            <li> Super happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> So far, just wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I have decided to be more honest (in my reviews, and with myself) about the effectiveness of products.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant cucumber smell, is not oily, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that this eye gel is instantly refreshing and it does help with puffiness, smells nice and &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It is pleasant to use and smell fresh like cucumber.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I am sure with more use of this product it will. :)</li>
            <li> was much, much better.</li>
            <li> I use it morning and night and love it.</li>
            <li> I love the eye gel....</li>
            <li> Love this eye gel.</li>
            <li> I tried so many eye creams to&lt;br /&gt;Fix</li>
            <li> Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Yes, like so many women, I&#x27;ve tried them all from $20-$100</li>
            <li> It gets better.</li>
            <li> The product does seem to make the are under my eyes look better.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I am quite pleased with the eye gel...</li>
            <li> I have been using this since it arrived, twice a day, love it........</li>
            <li> I will upgrade as appropriate with use.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad that products like this exist to help me shine during the moments that matter most to</li>
            <li> The product is not an inmediate miracle it has to be applied according to the seller instructions, but be sure they will always be there for you.</li>
            <li> Outstanding customer service</li>
            <li> , my eyes feel refreshing</li>
            <li> Looks like it is working but may work better on my husband.</li>
            <li> It was OK but not something I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> AND MAYBE WOULD GET MORE STARS</li>
            <li> This stuff shows great results around the eyes FAST.</li>
            <li> and after a couple of more weeks there was still no difference.  </li>
            <li> Just wish it would do more for the under eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> Lots of follow-up emails  telling me how to apply, which would be better if received WITH product.  </li>
            <li> Feels good and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty good</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it - not sticky - goes on so easy and</li>
            <li> very cool feeling when you put it on....smooths the skin.</li>
            <li> As soon as it is applied it feels refreshing and gives you a smooth look under eyes.</li>
            <li> The good news is you can reapply as much as you need.</li>
            <li> Cool and soothing, no irritation whatsoever!  </li>
            <li> The boost in firmness is clear--now I just wish I could soak in a tub full of it!  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week now and cannot say enough good things!</li>
            <li> The pump bottle is easy to use and control the amount for application.</li>
            <li> I love it specially bcuz</li>
            <li> It also has done away with some fine lines.</li>
            <li> I can tell you for sure - you will love it from the first time you pull it out of the frig.</li>
            <li> change in fine lines either.</li>
            <li> product really works magic!</li>
            <li> In a couple of days I&#x27;ve seen improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> A fantastic tip</li>
            <li> This went on smoothly, goes along way</li>
            <li> the following day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Great product.</li>
            <li> the following day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light gel like formula - to be seen if it lightens as suggested.</li>
            <li> This eye gel contains potent natural ingredients that effectively minimize those problems.  </li>
            <li> but so far it has been good.  </li>
            <li> the product is exactly as described, very light, and does help soothe and reduce under eye puffiness.  </li>
            <li> The Brilliant Eye Gel by Eve Hansen is a must have for those who are dealing with puffiness, dark circles, wrinkles, sagging, loss of plump and some others issues.</li>
            <li> I am a 76 year old male and very happy with your product.  </li>
            <li> I just started using this product but so far I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it is better to apply it before makeup on freshly washed skin, but when life calls for a &amp;#34;look awake&amp;#34; moment, this gel absorbs without completely smudging your makeup like oil based</li>
            <li> (The allergies part is true)  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe it was manufactured as full as the bottle claimed.  </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t see any results than I will be asking for a full refund.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet but really like the gel</li>
            <li> The pump container is not the best delivery device, it allows too much product to be wasted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super cooling upon application.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this formula, the smell is slight and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Great feeling on my face and wrinkles seem to be less visible.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, and I already love it!</li>
            <li> I like the way it absorbs nicely, and it has really helped reduce any bags under my 50 year old eyes!  </li>
            <li> The texture is almost like a Vaseline but a little softer which makes it feel great when you put it</li>
            <li> It will have to do a great job to be worth it at this price for so little.  </li>
            <li> It is light and absorb fast.</li>
            <li> Product seems to be good, but my bottle (despite tiny usage) was gone extremely fast.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it for a couple of weeks, but it feels nice.  </li>
            <li> received this product in exchange for an honest review.on&#x27;t instantly disappear</li>
            <li> I do feel safe applying the eye gel, because of the vegan, natural and Organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells so fresh and minty</li>
            <li> Another thing that will keep me buying this is it&#x27;s CRUELTY FREE &amp; has a vegan formula - This eye gel treatment is not to be underestimated as it&#x27;s highly effective at reducing dark circles, puffiness and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Not really as I expected! :)</li>
            <li> It is a very good product, I use it everyday and no complains so far.</li>
            <li> This truly worked the first night I applied.</li>
            <li> For the low price I paid, I&#x27;m somewhat satisfied just using it just as a moisturizer and wouldn&#x27;t return the product, but I&#x27;m also not sold yet on buying it again</li>
            <li> will most definently be re ordering as soon as i get low...</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> This products works very well!</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty resistant to change, so if you are like me, be encouraged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty resistant to change, so if you are like me, be encouraged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I look more awake and refreshed overall.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> This product was for my wife and it was her first time trying</li>
            <li> Hopefully when I am in my 50s I can still pass for 30s ;)</li>
            <li> Thanks!  </li>
            <li> Glad to find an eye gel that actually works!</li>
            <li> Started working from the first day I tried it.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be trying out more products from this line.</li>
            <li> and now I am back to my old one that is doing better !</li>
            <li> (that might depend on how long it lasts since the container feels very light).</li>
            <li> The price is more than reasonable and the promises are TRUE unlike any other on the market or in a dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, because I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement, and then I thought to myself &amp;#34;These eye-bags didn&#x27;t happen overnight Warner, they&#x27;re not gonna go away overnight&amp;#34;, and sure enough, I kept applying it before bed for a week or so, and noticed an incredible reduction in eye bags and puffiness.</li>
            <li> Certainly most effective within a few hours after application, but there does seem to be some lasting effect</li>
            <li> Certainly most effective within a few hours after application, but there does seem to be some lasting effect</li>
            <li> Well, I have puffiness because I work long hours and nothing works as so many products say they will.  </li>
            <li> Nice consistency but haven&#x27;t seen a difference in dark circles or lines.</li>
            <li> I honestly feel the dark rings are disappearing under my eyes 👀.</li>
            <li> If I notice a change in the puffiness of the bags under my eyes or any minimizing of fine lines after using for another couple of weeks, I will come back and update this review.  </li>
            <li> It definitely tightens the eye area and fine lines on the face.</li>
            <li> So far good, no significant improvement.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel by Eve Hansen.  </li>
            <li> It does tighten skin around the eyes, but what I really noticed was the puffiness around my eyes</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This really does what it says.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t bother me at all so it is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel.</li>
            <li> It arrived very promptly even tho</li>
            <li> I never thought an eye cream could do so much to lessen the puffiness around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This cream really works.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel.  </li>
            <li> I wish they hadn&#x27;t said that results come fast.  </li>
            <li> It is also very lightweight gliding on, so</li>
            <li> Seemed a bit watery and really haven&#x27;t gotten any results either.</li>
            <li> So gentle on eyes and removes that pesty mascara which tends to remain on lashes.  </li>
            <li> I may be 31, but I look like I&#x27;m in my early-twenties again, thanks to this eye gel.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel.</li>
            <li> This product was way better than I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Consistency: The gel is thicker than many serums I am used to and takes a bit longer to rub in and absorb completely, but also seems to actually absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using the gel for only a week, so have not noticed any significant changes.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product and have high hopes that this will become part of my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I see a little change, but I still grab the ice bags I have in my freezer and apply for 2-3 min., then I am good to go, especially if I am going out at night after a 12 hour work</li>
            <li> /&gt;It absorbs quickly with no left over shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> the description highly overate this product</li>
            <li> Works about the same as other products of its kind.</li>
            <li> This bottle is very small, but the results are stunning, It worth every penny.</li>
            <li> hope that in using it longer it will iron out the eye wrinkles a little more......</li>
            <li> I would name this smell, &amp;#34;Brief hint of arboretum&amp;#34; (even though &amp;#34;brief hint of jungle would be cooler, arboretum is a little more</li>
            <li> It feels like a lighter version of Monistat Anti-Chafing Gel which seems to be the main ingredient in all the new &amp;#34;blurring&amp;#34; cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Got a great deal on this product through a promotional offer, and got two of them for less than the price of other natural eye-gels--75%  natural--no harsh chemicals, and helps smooth wrinkles around eyes, as well as helping with under-eye puffiness and discoloration--Excellent!</li>
            <li> It seems very moisturizing so far.  </li>
            <li> I normally have puffy eyes by the end of the workweek</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the sun damage around my eyes is getting better, and not as dried out.</li>
            <li> i have 2 small children and one on the way, work full time and go to school full time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never heard of Eve Hansen, but I read the ingredients and knew it would be worth a try - especially at this price point.</li>
            <li> However I will give it a few more weeks and see.</li>
            <li> smoother appearing skin around my eyes in a few weeks, and it seems like my skin has more elasticity.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes instantly and smells like fresh cucumber.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m purely using this gel for my eyes alone because I&#x27;m using also the Pure Argan Oil together as part of my facial regimen.</li>
            <li> and it seems like I&#x27;m always trying new eye creams</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes but had no problem at all with the gel.</li>
            <li> Very soft gel for under eyes.</li>
            <li> and I did not have any reaction and my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Following the instructions, I&#x27;ve been using this product under my eyes every night and occasionally in the mornings before make-up application for two weeks now, and so far, I have not noticed any difference in my fine lines or bags.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in YEARS the constant &#x27;puffiness&#x27; under my eyes has dissipated!</li>
            <li> The price is cheaper then other top brands with the same ingredients.</li>
            <li> very useful for concealing dark spots and removing them.</li>
            <li> It really does help, just be sure to use a small amount - too much makes hair feel strange.</li>
            <li> The dark circles and puffiness start to fade away, stay away, and with continued use you only look better.  </li>
            <li> This one is clearly a hit</li>
            <li> I will definitely use this product again as the price is reasonable and it does reduce the puffiness around my eyes.</li>
            <li> (Maybe I&#x27;m just getting old.)</li>
            <li> It keeps my eyes soft without a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this eye gel</li>
            <li> I kept this in my fridge to add to the cooling effect this eye gel offers.</li>
            <li> No harsh smell to deal with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still to early to tell.</li>
            <li> and so far she likes it</li>
            <li> I was really surprised.</li>
            <li> The good news is that the bottle, though it is only a half ounce, will last that long.  </li>
            <li> I saw visible results on my puffy eyes and dark circles from the very first application.</li>
            <li> I have no dark circles, bags are almost gone</li>
            <li> lines: I do notices an improvement (not disappearance) in my fine lines about 15 minutes after application lasting for a few hours.</li>
            <li> For some reason I developed dark circles for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way and the pump dispenser makes it easy to control.  </li>
            <li> with using this product, i see a major difference.</li>
            <li> my genes aren&#x27;t doing me any major favors (when it comes to aging)</li>
            <li> This gel began working very quickly, but by the time I was half way into the bottle the dark circles were completely gone!</li>
            <li> , it makes my skin feel moisturizer, not dry or pulling.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have dark circles to begin with.  </li>
            <li> I saw a real reduction in circles in both puffiness and the dark color.</li>
            <li> and i am very sleep deprived, had black circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Seeing a small change is worth trying this product especially if you use it for longer.</li>
            <li> Back in February I had a sinus infection that left my eyes very puffy and with dark circles.</li>
            <li> Such a powerful product in such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smell: Very, very, minimal natural smell--you only notice it if you try and it disappears promptly after application.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist assures me that this has more to do with the shadow cast from the slowly falling apples of my cheek, but there is no convincing me that the thinning skin and increased vascularity (seasonal allergies) don&#x27;t cause an actual color darkening.</li>
            <li> , last&#x27;s a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> soon as he uses it long enough for a result.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing effects are instant, but seeing other results, such as reduced wrinkles and and under eye circles could take several weeks of twice daily application before you see a difference.  </li>
            <li> I tried several other products to help with this issue but nothing really worked and the ones that did help a little bit made me break out in acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only begun using and look forward to seeing the long term results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite ready for the juvaderm, so in the mean time targeting the vascularity and thinning skin is the only option I have.</li>
            <li> Not completely gone</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve said in my earlier review regarding this product, there wasn&#x27;t any visible result in 2-3 weeks yet, but this is almost a month now that I&#x27;m using it, and I could see that there&#x27;s not much puffiness around my eyes.</li>
            <li> The size of the product was smaller than I expected and when I expressed a concern about this, I was advised to use an amount the size of a grain of rice, which I did.</li>
            <li> I have been trying several different products for my dark undereye circles and forehead wrinkles [and I am still a few months short of 30...</li>
            <li> The only thing the product advertised that did not work for me is the reduction of dark rings under the eyes, but I attribute that to my allergies.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no difference at all in my dark circle after several days of use.</li>
            <li> what the next morning my eyes are puffy and I have dark circles that not even my makeup or concealer can cover up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to see a difference with the dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> what the next morning my eyes are puffy and I have dark circles that not even my makeup or concealer can cover up.</li>
            <li> Maybe it takes longer for some people and maybe it only works on dark circles.</li>
            <li> Again, my dark circles don&#x27;t instantly disappear--I can&#x27;t even promise that the color changes, but my undereyes look...</li>
            <li> If it does work, it&#x27;s not very fast.</li>
            <li> This is l/2 ounce size - very small and high price.  </li>
            <li> , It does take a couple of weeks to actually notice a difference it might take less for others</li>
            <li> , It does take a couple of weeks to actually notice a difference it might take less for others</li>
            <li> I also use it for my frown lines and they are starting to make those less noticeable as well.  </li>
            <li> I tried some other eye creams with little or no success but after using this one for only a couple of days,I noticed a big difference.</li>
            <li> I could see a difference in puffiness and my small wrinkles that I am starting to develop from long college nights.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really working for me.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from this issue basically my whole life and there is nothing worse than always looking like a zombie.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of simply applying some under my eyes, there was no difference in the appearance of my bags.  </li>
            <li> When I managed to get inside it was empty.</li>
            <li> I get black circles constantly and they appear less puffy.  </li>
            <li> but I was surprised at the very small container it came in.</li>
            <li> The changes are minimal (but little changes have BIG VALUE), so it is hard to be completely objective about this.</li>
            <li> The changes are minimal (but little changes have BIG VALUE), so it is hard to be completely objective about this.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way.</li>

            <li> I never had dark circles, so I cannot state a thing about dark circles but the lines around my eyes are softer, but</li>

            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> ON.BUT HAVE NOT NOTICED ANY DIFFERENCE IN APPEARANE AFTER A FEW WEEKS USING IT  </li>
            <li> No great improvement - under-eye puffiness remains the same.  </li>

            <li> and I have seen a difference this gel has reduced the puffiness and my dark circles are slowly fading</li>
            <li> It seems to stay sticky for quite awile &amp; the area you apply it too gets very tight, but maybe that is the what it is supposed to do to provide all the results that were included in the description.  </li>
            <li> and my eyes show very little signs of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not able to get my 8 hours of beauty sleep and</li>

            <li> so I&#x27;m not able to get my 8 hours of beauty sleep and</li>
            <li> This I a small powerhouse.</li>
            <li> I was contacted by customer service and they said I was applying it wrong and gave me 2 paragraphs of very specific directions on how I should be applying the product.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> but I’ve been suffering from really bad dark circles my entire life.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time falling asleep at night</li>
            <li> I have a hard time falling asleep at night</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m giving this product at least 3 stars to start with because I do like using it as a moisturizer,</li>
            <li> This works well, giving my eyes moisture, not greasy, doesn&#x27;t cause any negative reaction from my eyes and gives me the moisture I need</li>
            <li> The other reviews must be fake.</li>
            <li> this container is very small.  </li>
            <li> Update: (Now on my second bottle and will continue to order.)</li>

            <li> And it&#x27;s very expensive for whatever result it brought about.</li>
            <li> Bad thing is I borrowed the money</li>
            <li> It might&#x27;ve had some sort of reaction with my skin since I felt a painful tingle when I applied it under my eye.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I normally have puffy eyes by the end of the workweek but this product has changed all that. The dark circles and puffiness has diminished. Not completely gone but I am sure with more use of this product it will. :)</li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel by Eve Hansen.  It does tighten skin around the eyes, but what I really noticed was the puffiness around my eyes was much, much better. Before using this product my eyes were so puffy it looked like I was crying all the time or had swollen eyes due to allergies. (The allergies part is true)  My eyes seem much bigger.  Thank you for that!!  The only thing the product advertised that did not work for me is the reduction of dark rings under the eyes, but I attribute that to my allergies.  I will definitely use this product again as the price is reasonable and it does reduce the puffiness around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Back in February I had a sinus infection that left my eyes very puffy and with dark circles.I tried some other eye creams with little or no success but after using this one for only a couple of days,I noticed a big difference.The dark circles are gone and the puffiness.I use it morning and night and love it.I have very sensitive eyes but had no problem at all with the gel.Great product.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t been used this product for very long, I can tell you that I can already see some improvement in the small around the eye wrinkles.  I really like this product and have high hopes that this will become part of my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I love the eye gel....very cool feeling when you put it on....smooths the skin.</li>
            <li> Love this eye gel. It is light and absorb fast. My dark circles is getting lighter after using it. Great deal. Will recommend to friend.</li>
            <li> Have not noticed anything</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no difference at all in my dark circle after several days of use. It might&#x27;ve had some sort of reaction with my skin since I felt a painful tingle when I applied it under my eye. However, does feel like it slightly lifts the wrinkles in my eyes a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days. I have noticed that the sun damage around my eyes is getting better, and not as dried out. It also has done away with some fine lines. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> product really works magic! can see results in just a matter of days. i have 2 small children and one on the way, work full time and go to school full time and i am very sleep deprived, had black circles under my eyes. with using this product, i see a major difference. will definitely be buying another bottle as soon as i use this one!</li>
            <li> I have been using the eye gel for abut 2 weeks.  I have seen some lightening of my under eye.  It seems very moisturizing so far.  I will update in a month.</li>
            <li> In a couple of days I&#x27;ve seen improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply even for a man.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time falling asleep at night so I&#x27;m not able to get my 8 hours of beauty sleep and what the next morning my eyes are puffy and I have dark circles that not even my makeup or concealer can cover up. I&#x27;ve been using this eye gel for a couple of weeks now I apply every night before I go to bed and I have seen a difference this gel has reduced the puffiness and my dark circles are slowly fading I can actually cover them up with my concealer now, It does take a couple of weeks to actually notice a difference it might take less for others I guess it all depends on your skin.</li>
            <li> Product seems to be good, but my bottle (despite tiny usage) was gone extremely fast.  I cannot believe it was manufactured as full as the bottle claimed.  Product seemed good, but need to use it longer.</li>
            <li> So far good, no significant improvement. But feels good on the eyes.</li>
            <li> Didnt help my bags at all.  If anything it accentuates them. A TINY botter for $15 of something that simply doesn&#x27;t work.  The other reviews mislead me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try something else.</li>
            <li> Very soft gel for under eyes.</li>
            <li> Must say I LOVE it!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> Immediately feel the cooling sensation of the eye gel.  After a few days of use, I can see slight improvement in the puffiness and darkness around my eyes.  I don&#x27;t have any concerns with wrinkles but the anti wrinkle benefits is a plus.  The pump bottle is easy to use and control the amount for application.</li>
            <li> Brilliant Eye Gel is absolutely amazing!!! I&#x27;m starting to see a difference with the dark circles under my eyes and it&#x27;s been less than a week. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just recently received this about two weeks now - I absolutely love it - not sticky - goes on so easy and little goes along way - my skin loves it - I am acne prone - oily to oily/dry combo - no break out and my skin glows - I use it all over my face and neck!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!!!! Will buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Did not notice any great difference yet. I have been using it for two weeks now. It is pleasant to use and smell fresh like cucumber.&lt;br /&gt;I hope that in using it longer it will iron out the eye wrinkles a little more......</li>
            <li> Quality ingredients - nice, lightweight feel. I&#x27;ve only been using it a week and already starting to see results</li>
            <li> I just started using this product but so far I love it!</li>
            <li> So far so good, I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet but really like the gel, it makes my skin feel moisturizer, not dry or pulling.</li>
            <li> Update: (Now on my second bottle and will continue to order.) This is a wonderful product! For some reason I developed dark circles for the first time in my life. (Maybe I&#x27;m just getting old.) This gel began working very quickly, but by the time I was half way into the bottle the dark circles were completely gone! I tried every product I could get my hands on, and nothing else worked. If you have dark circles try it. I am so impressed with this product! 10 stars! **********  I&#x27;ve never heard of Eve Hansen, but I read the ingredients and knew it would be worth a try - especially at this price point. I&#x27;ve had this for only a few days, but I really like it. I worked in the skin care industry for years and know a lot about products. I must say I&#x27;m impressed. It is a cool gel that feels wonderful!  A fantastic tip: Keep this in the door of the refrigerator and use it in the AM when you get up. We often recommended this with gel eye products. The gel already has a cooling sensation. I can tell you for sure - you will love it from the first time you pull it out of the frig. I&#x27;m going to do that tonight. I already know how it will feel. Ahhhhhh . . .</li>
            <li> Amazing gel ! I tried so many eye creams to&lt;br /&gt;Fix my eye bags but no one worked. This eye&lt;br /&gt;gel is too good and my eyes look brighter and&lt;br /&gt;Fresher now.</li>
            <li> Started using this eye gel a few weeks ago and it really tightens my skin ive now started using on my face and neck before applying my makeup works great under my foundation for a smooth finish. Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Great product! Will order again</li>
            <li> the eye gel has reduced the puffiness below my eyes. I am a 76 year old male and very happy with your product.  dick from boca raton, fl.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a couple of weeks, but it feels nice.  The puffiness is less.  I never had dark circles, so I cannot state a thing about dark circles but the lines around my eyes are softer, but still there.</li>
            <li> Not so thrilled by this eye gel. I will not recommend or purchase again.</li>
            <li> Nice consistency but haven&#x27;t seen a difference in dark circles or lines. The pump container is not the best delivery device, it allows too much product to be wasted. Although the product is acceptable for softening eye area and the gel is my preferred eye product, beware, the seller, Eve Hansen Beauty, will bombard you with emails about rating them and their product. For this reason I will NOT purchase this again. Three stars - I like the product even though I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in dark circles but I detest all the pushy emails.</li>
            <li> See no difference at all. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This product does as it claims and just a small amount goes a very long way! I would order it again.</li>
            <li> This product already has a lot of good review but I was still skeptical of whether or not this product would work, especially at this price point but there is a money back guarantee so what did I have to lose. I&#x27;m only 27, so I don&#x27;t have to deal with any wrinkles or bags yet but I’ve been suffering from really bad dark circles my entire life. Genetic. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple days and I am already seeing results, I no longer feel I need to use concealer for my under eyes. I would recommend this product to anyone needing to get rid of dark circles.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! No eye cream helped me better than this one! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> So far, just wonderful.  Great feeling on my face and wrinkles seem to be less visible.  Feels good and the price was right.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really working for me. I use it at night and again in the morning. The gel reduces my puffenec on a little.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time falling asleep at night so I&#x27;m not able to get my 8 hours of beauty sleep and what the next morning my eyes are puffy and I have dark circles that not even my makeup or concealer can cover up. I&#x27;ve been using this eye gel for a couple of weeks now I apply every night before I go to bed and I have seen a difference this gel has reduced the puffiness and my dark circles are slowly fading I can actually cover them up with my concealer now, It does take a couple of weeks to actually notice a difference it might take less for others I guess it all depends on your skin.</li>
            <li> Works very well, use sparingly and get great results!</li>
            <li> Nothing exceptional. Works about the same as other products of its kind.</li>
            <li> The Brilliant Eye Gel by Eve Hansen is a must have for those who are dealing with puffiness, dark circles, wrinkles, sagging, loss of plump and some others issues. This eye gel contains potent natural ingredients that effectively minimize those problems.  After one week using the gel, I could see noticeable improvements under my eye area. My eyes are less puffier and firmer. I am very pleased with the results.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> You know that graveyard drawer with all the under eye products? Throw them out.  This IS THE ONE!  Yes, like so many women, I&#x27;ve tried them all from $20-$100+ but, Eve Hansen thank you!  The price is more than reasonable and the promises are TRUE unlike any other on the market or in a dermatologist&#x27;s office. For the first time in YEARS the constant &#x27;puffiness&#x27; under my eyes has dissipated! This truly worked the first night I applied. It gets better. After only a few days of use the dark circles are GONE! This will be my product forever!</li>
            <li> GREAT EYE GEL! I have thrown everything eye product away. This really does what it says. I have no dark circles, bags are almost gone and my eyes show very little signs of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I need to find out if this product can be used for wrinkles above the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely keep using.</li>
            <li> Very good product. It keeps my eyes soft without a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> The product does seem to make the are under my eyes look better.</li>
            <li> Following the instructions, I&#x27;ve been using this product under my eyes every night and occasionally in the mornings before make-up application for two weeks now, and so far, I have not noticed any difference in my fine lines or bags.  I don&#x27;t really have dark circles to begin with.  If I notice a change in the puffiness of the bags under my eyes or any minimizing of fine lines after using for another couple of weeks, I will come back and update this review.  I&#x27;m posting now just because a lot of others have said they noticed immediate results, whereas I have not.  Maybe it takes longer for some people and maybe it only works on dark circles. But I&#x27;m giving this product at least 3 stars to start with because I do like using it as a moisturizer, if nothing else.  It has a pleasant cucumber smell, is not oily, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out.  For the low price I paid, I&#x27;m somewhat satisfied just using it just as a moisturizer and wouldn&#x27;t return the product, but I&#x27;m also not sold yet on buying it again (that might depend on how long it lasts since the container feels very light).</li>
            <li> no big shakes her for results but does soothe the eyes...won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> the product is exactly as described, very light, and does help soothe and reduce under eye puffiness.  I have only begun using and look forward to seeing the long term results!</li>
            <li> It is a very good product, I use it everyday and no complains so far.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I am quite pleased with the eye gel...&lt;br /&gt;After just about a week I can see and feel the difference.&lt;br /&gt;I will most definently be re ordering as soon as i get low...&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I have used the eye gel for about a week now and see a difference around my eyes already. I have sensitive skin and this eye gel doesn&#x27;t bother me at all so it is gentle on the skin. Eve Hansen is a great company to order from and they have quality products. They have great customer service - every time I order, they follow up with an email and also offer deals when you reorder from them.</li>
            <li> This I a small powerhouse. I used it for about 10 days and I&#x27;ve seen a change in my dark circled. I will continue with this product and the customer service is excellent. This is not a paid review. Seeing a small change is worth trying this product especially if you use it for longer. This product actually works. The dark circles around my eyes are dramatically lighter and this happened in about 10 days.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but I was surprised at the very small container it came in. A few times &amp; that&#x27;s all there is.</li>
            <li> It is a cooling eye gel. I&#x27;m just not sure if it supposed to help reduce dark undereye circles</li>
            <li> There was ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGE in the puffiness !! Used it faithfully for 2 weeks and now I am back to my old one that is doing better !</li>
            <li> This went on smoothly, goes along way, last&#x27;s a long time.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs quickly with no left over shine.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t solve any of the problems I purchased it for.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for the bags under my eye&#x27;s, it did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;No change in fine lines either.I did use it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m sorry, maybe it works better for&lt;br /&gt;Some one under 56 years of age. Bad thing is I borrowed the money&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been out of work for a year and needed some confidence.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geri Duritsch</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says.  Wrinkles and crows feet have disappeared. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> the description highly overate this product</li>
            <li> I have been using this since it arrived, twice a day, love it........apply as directed after washing with Cetaphil (I knew this before you emailed me these hints) LOL...........I am seeing a difference and a radiance already.  I am 71 years old and am told all the time I do not look it!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This products works very well! It helps with puffy, tired, wrinkled eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel. It&#x27;s very light and smooth and goes on very nicely. A little goes a LONG way. And it does seem to helping with under eye baggage. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Four stars b/c its only been a few days since it arrived! I will upgrade as appropriate with use. It arrived very promptly even tho it was nota &#x27;prime&#x27; item.  It is for my husband who has deep circles under his eyes. I will add to this review&lt;br /&gt;as soon as he uses it long enough for a result.</li>
            <li> Got a great deal on this product through a promotional offer, and got two of them for less than the price of other natural eye-gels--75%  natural--no harsh chemicals, and helps smooth wrinkles around eyes, as well as helping with under-eye puffiness and discoloration--Excellent! The company also has great customer follow-up, with specific directions for use and how to get best results.</li>
            <li> I giving this gel one star, for the reason that I have not yet seen any difference on my dark circles. However I will give it a few more weeks and see. Maybe even buy another bottle before I run out. If I don&#x27;t see any results than I will be asking for a full refund.</li>
            <li> I never thought an eye cream could do so much to lessen the puffiness around my eyes. With this product the skin around my eyes tightens up and looks terrific in seconds and lasts all day. And it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune!</li>
            <li> This works well, giving my eyes moisture, not greasy, doesn&#x27;t cause any negative reaction from my eyes and gives me the moisture I need</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this eye gel is instantly refreshing and it does help with puffiness, smells nice and &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, and I already love it! A very small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have decided to be more honest (in my reviews, and with myself) about the effectiveness of products. Please don&#x27;t take my lack of over enthusiasm as lack of belief in benefit: this eye gel IS brilliant, but not a miracle. I have been trying several different products for my dark undereye circles and forehead wrinkles [and I am still a few months short of 30... my genes aren&#x27;t doing me any major favors (when it comes to aging) so products need to fill in (pun)]. Most days of the week I don&#x27;t mind--but there are those moments I just want to look great and I am so glad that products like this exist to help me shine during the moments that matter most to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency: The gel is thicker than many serums I am used to and takes a bit longer to rub in and absorb completely, but also seems to actually absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: Very, very, minimal natural smell--you only notice it if you try and it disappears promptly after application. I would name this smell, &amp;#34;Brief hint of arboretum&amp;#34; (even though &amp;#34;brief hint of jungle would be cooler, arboretum is a little more honest).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine lines: I do notices an improvement (not disappearance) in my fine lines about 15 minutes after application lasting for a few hours. The good news is you can reapply as much as you need. I&#x27;m sure it is better to apply it before makeup on freshly washed skin, but when life calls for a &amp;#34;look awake&amp;#34; moment, this gel absorbs without completely smudging your makeup like oil based products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark circles: I think my circles are pickier than average. My dermatologist assures me that this has more to do with the shadow cast from the slowly falling apples of my cheek, but there is no convincing me that the thinning skin and increased vascularity (seasonal allergies) don&#x27;t cause an actual color darkening. I&#x27;m not quite ready for the juvaderm, so in the mean time targeting the vascularity and thinning skin is the only option I have. Again, my dark circles don&#x27;t instantly disappear--I can&#x27;t even promise that the color changes, but my undereyes look... brighter, warmer, healthier (less sickly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long term effect: The changes are minimal (but little changes have BIG VALUE), so it is hard to be completely objective about this. Certainly most effective within a few hours after application, but there does seem to be some lasting effect the following day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Great product. Something about their combination makes a difference. My skin is pretty resistant to change, so if you are like me, be encouraged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest review.on&#x27;t instantly disappear--I can&#x27;t even promise that the color changes, but my undereyes look... brighter, warmer, healthier (less sickly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long term effect: The changes are minimal (but little changes have BIG VALUE), so it is hard to be completely objective about this.

            <li> The product is not an inmediate miracle it has to be applied according to the seller instructions, but be sure they will always be there for you.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! So soothing and works to cover and prevent wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this product. I have only been using it for a short time but am already noticing a difference. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Really nice eye gel, takes away any puffiness in the morning! They also contacted me to say if I had any questions to contact them. Thought that was nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright!! Not really as I expected! :)</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve said in my earlier review regarding this product, there wasn&#x27;t any visible result in 2-3 weeks yet, but this is almost a month now that I&#x27;m using it, and I could see that there&#x27;s not much puffiness around my eyes. I&#x27;m purely using this gel for my eyes alone because I&#x27;m using also the Pure Argan Oil together as part of my facial regimen. I love these products!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product and it doesn&#x27;t get in my eyes in humid weather and sting.</li>
            <li> This cream really works. Outstanding customer service</li>
            <li> It really does help, just be sure to use a small amount - too much makes hair feel strange.</li>
            <li> Really refreshing! I kept this in my fridge to add to the cooling effect this eye gel offers. I saw a real reduction in circles in both puffiness and the dark color. I&#x27;ve been using this about 2 weeks and I look more awake and refreshed overall. I really enjoy this formula, the smell is slight and pleasant. Would order again!</li>
            <li> Just a dab with do you.  I get black circles constantly and they appear less puffy.  Cool and soothing, no irritation whatsoever!  Of course, it is meant to put under the bottom lids on your face only.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well. If it does work, it&#x27;s not very fast. And it&#x27;s very expensive for whatever result it brought about.</li>
            <li> This is l/2 ounce size - very small and high price.  It will have to do a great job to be worth it at this price for so little.  It&#x27;s a light gel like formula - to be seen if it lightens as suggested. It feels like a lighter version of Monistat Anti-Chafing Gel which seems to be the main ingredient in all the new &amp;#34;blurring&amp;#34; cosmetics. Will update review if it turns out to do anything visible.</li>
            <li> This is great Eye Gel. It feels great going on.  No harsh smell to deal with. Best of all, this really works!  The dark circles and puffiness start to fade away, stay away, and with continued use you only look better.  The price is cheaper then other top brands with the same ingredients. One of my best buys ever!</li>
            <li> This has brought a nice glow to my skin and feels great. The boost in firmness is clear--now I just wish I could soak in a tub full of it!  ;-)</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. As soon as it is applied it feels refreshing and gives you a smooth look under eyes. I would diffenitely recommend. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Skin feels tighter after use.</li>
            <li> smoother appearing skin around my eyes in a few weeks, and it seems like my skin has more elasticity.</li>
            <li> very useful for concealing dark spots and removing them. especially after a night of gaming, so that coworkers dont ask me.</li>
            <li> My understanding of the product was that is would reduce puffiness under my eyes.  Well, I have puffiness because I work long hours and nothing works as so many products say they will.  So, I read about EYE GEL, and thought give it a try.  I see a little change, but I still grab the ice bags I have in my freezer and apply for 2-3 min., then I am good to go, especially if I am going out at night after a 12 hour work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have to say, no, the product does not do what it claims in the advertising.  I would love to find that perfect product that does take away puffiness when you apply it, right now and not have to pay $100 or more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering my 2nd bottle!!! This product is amazing! I had deep expression lines on my forehead because my vision problems I shrink my eyes and put a lot of strength on my forehead, whit this cream those lines are almost gone. The area around my eyes look youthful and refresh. This bottle is very small, but the results are stunning, It worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have really bad dark circles and puffiness and it seems like I&#x27;m always trying new eye creams but it&#x27;s so expensive. I ordered this based on the reviews and I can see a difference. It&#x27;s been about a week. I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> The other reviews must be fake. Tiny bottle, doesn&#x27;t work. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was so hoping to see results but nothing for me ....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for one day but so far it has been good.  It seems to stay sticky for quite awile &amp; the area you apply it too gets very tight, but maybe that is the what it is supposed to do to provide all the results that were included in the description.  It&#x27;s still to early to tell.</li>
            <li> Although its been a little over 2weeks I honestly feel the dark rings are disappearing under my eyes 👀. I look forward to purchasing again.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways, to my surprise this container is very small.  To soon to tell if it works but it feels great on my skin, my eyes feel refreshing</li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel.  It moisturizes instantly and smells like fresh cucumber.  I wish they hadn&#x27;t said that results come fast.  The moisturizing effects are instant, but seeing other results, such as reduced wrinkles and and under eye circles could take several weeks of twice daily application before you see a difference.  The good news is that the bottle, though it is only a half ounce, will last that long.  A little of this goes a long way and the pump dispenser makes it easy to control.  Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> Looks like it is working but may work better on my husband. He has bags etc.</li>
            <li> The Eye gel was protectively packaged and was in nice condition as described on product page.  We purchased this EH Eye gel in a promotion to test and review.  I have been using the gel for only a week, so have not noticed any significant changes.  I do feel safe applying the eye gel, because of the vegan, natural and Organic ingredients.  It is also very lightweight gliding on, so it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s clogging or caking.  Really fair advertised price for the product.</li>
            <li> It was OK but not something I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would help with under eye puffiness and darkness. I have suffered from this issue basically my whole life and there is nothing worse than always looking like a zombie. I tried several other products to help with this issue but nothing really worked and the ones that did help a little bit made me break out in acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product WORKS and I did not have any reaction and my skin is very sensitive. The ingredients list really impressed me as well! (LOOK at my picture to see ingredients in this product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells so fresh and minty I wanted to keep using it! This eye gel is the best I had ever used and I won&#x27;t waste my time with other products now that I have found this. The texture is almost like a Vaseline but a little softer which makes it feel great when you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone who has dark circles or puffiness under their eyes because this WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out my pictures for a look at the ingredients and to get a good idea of the texture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> LIKED HOW IT FELT GOING ON.BUT HAVE NOT NOTICED ANY DIFFERENCE IN APPEARANE AFTER A FEW WEEKS USING IT  3STARS  WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO MFG. AND MAYBE WOULD GET MORE STARS</li>
            <li> Such a powerful product in such a small bottle. This stuff shows great results around the eyes FAST. Super happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of simply applying some under my eyes, there was no difference in the appearance of my bags.  I was contacted by customer service and they said I was applying it wrong and gave me 2 paragraphs of very specific directions on how I should be applying the product.  I went along with it and after a couple of more weeks there was still no difference.  Customer service gave me a refund without a hassle.  Great customer service, but the product did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!. I have been using it for a week now and cannot say enough good things! This one is clearly a hit and I will be purchasing again.! I have already seen a difference in the wrinkles around my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;Received for honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> It works pretty good I love it specially bcuz I could use makeup with it on it doesn&#x27;t look weird or feel weird</li>
            <li> Great eye Gel, Thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> Seemed a bit watery and really haven&#x27;t gotten any results either. Little pricey for quality of product😕</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay not too great for myself</li>
            <li> This product was for my wife and it was her first time trying and so far she likes it</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream ever!  So gentle on eyes and removes that pesty mascara which tends to remain on lashes.  Works wonders on my under eye moisturizing creme and wrinkle softener.  I just wish they offered this product in a larger container!</li>
            <li> It definitely tightens the eye area and fine lines on the face. Just wish it would do more for the under eye puffiness. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I was terribly disappointed in this item. The size of the product was smaller than I expected and when I expressed a concern about this, I was advised to use an amount the size of a grain of rice, which I did. The pump stopped working so I tried to disassemble the container to get at what was left and there was an even smaller tube that contained the product. When I managed to get inside it was empty. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, because I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement, and then I thought to myself &amp;#34;These eye-bags didn&#x27;t happen overnight Warner, they&#x27;re not gonna go away overnight&amp;#34;, and sure enough, I kept applying it before bed for a week or so, and noticed an incredible reduction in eye bags and puffiness. I may be 31, but I look like I&#x27;m in my early-twenties again, thanks to this eye gel. Hopefully when I am in my 50s I can still pass for 30s ;)</li>
            <li> No great improvement - under-eye puffiness remains the same.  Lots of follow-up emails  telling me how to apply, which would be better if received WITH product.  Turns out I was applying it correctly anyway.  Doubt that I&#x27;ll buy again and will probably keep looking.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product as well as the quick deliver.  The product arrived in great condition!  Thanks!  Brenda Smestad</li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel. It&#x27;s super cooling upon application. It helps soothe my tired puffy eyes. I work graveyards and need something to aid my eyes during my 12 hour shifts. This does just the thing. My boyfriend notices I&#x27;m not as puffy when I get off work too, which is a bonus! Another thing that will keep me buying this is it&#x27;s CRUELTY FREE &amp; has a vegan formula - This eye gel treatment is not to be underestimated as it&#x27;s highly effective at reducing dark circles, puffiness and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple weeks now, and I do notice that the dark circles are puffiness have decreased a lot.  I will definitely keep using this.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! feels so good on my skin. Already seeing a difference!</li>
            <li> I like the way it absorbs nicely, and it has really helped reduce any bags under my 50 year old eyes!  I also use it for my frown lines and they are starting to make those less noticeable as well.  Glad to find an eye gel that actually works!</li>
            <li> I saw visible results on my puffy eyes and dark circles from the very first application. So happy with this.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised. This product was way better than I expected. Started working from the first day I tried it. I could see a difference in puffiness and my small wrinkles that I am starting to develop from long college nights. You can even feel the difference! Will definitely be trying out more products from this line.</li>
