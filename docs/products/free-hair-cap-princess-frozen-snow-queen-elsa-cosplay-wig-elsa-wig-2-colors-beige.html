            <li>My daughter &amp; her kindergarten friends didn&#x27;t mind it &amp; she loved all the attention.</li>
            <li>This wig however, was a BEAUTIFUL, full wig and the adjustment straps made for a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>It was cute while it lasted!</li>
            <li>The quality of this wig was amazing for the price</li>
            <li>It kind if looks like a mullet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>will say the company is nice.</li>
            <li>I have worked with wigs in my line of business and can&#x27;t believe how great this is for such a great price!!!</li>
            <li>I liked the look of the wig.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase and think that it looks even better than the seller&#x27;s picture.</li>
            <li>It fits my 4 year old daughter wonderfully!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it was so cheap!</li>
            <li>like it&#x27;s probably better than the ones from the Halloween stores</li>
            <li>And the &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34; hair on the top isn&#x27;t shaped.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t look to great from the front</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s better ones out there</li>
            <li>Shipping originally said that it would arrive by Halloween and it did!</li>
            <li>She has dark brown hair and the wig covered her hair perfectly!!</li>
            <li>I am 29 and this thing barely fit me.</li>
            <li>but this barely fit me.</li>
            <li>I tried my hardest to get it to fit her head, and I even used a wig cap, but it just wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I did try it on, just to see if it would fit</li>
            <li>There are also adjustable clips inside to fit to size.</li>
            <li>We ordered it in the beige color and it&#x27;s a nice pale color, however not whitish, but still great....</li>
            <li>When I contacted them to return it they needed original packaging with address label to verify it was theirs, pictures of the product - what a hassle.</li>
            <li>This wig is perfect for a small child.</li>
            <li>She kind of has a big head :).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of Elsa&#x27;s wig but by far this was the best I found.</li>
            <li>It looks totally real and cute.</li>
            <li>great wig, and looks just like Elsa&#x27;s hair, it does not look cheap however, too heavy for my kids head.</li>
            <li>When I walked up in my wig and dress she was super stoked</li>
            <li>and they also responded to me super quick when I voiced my concern about shipping.</li>
            <li>Other than it being small, I thought it was good quality and would have worked out very nice as an Elsa wig!</li>
            <li>It is a very well made wig and looks just like Elsa&#x27;s hair!!</li>
            <li>It will get a lot of action in the years to come and was certainly a huge part of my drama queens ability to channel her &amp;#34;Elsa&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>but the back is really nice.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for helping make my daughter&#x27;s  costume a success!</li>
            <li>Not only did we receive this wig QUICKLY, but the quality is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>Good but kept pushing back my 8 year old&#x27;s forehead</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s by far much cuter than many of the wigs that are being sold.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what you see in the picture.</li>
            <li>I ordered 10/4 and it came 10/22, much faster than they had quoted!</li>
            <li>The flash on my camera makes it look more yellow than it is too!</li>
            <li>The wig pictured is exactly what I got.</li>
            <li>The package arrived in good condition - in a zip lock bag surrounded by cardboard and covered in a heavy duty plastic mailer.  </li>
            <li>, pretty much looks &amp;#34;nothing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>/&gt;The hair is nice and thick, and the braid (thin, and not &amp;#34;elsa-like&amp;#34; at the stores), was PERFECT!</li>
            <li>It fits perfect andI ordered some additional little snow flakes hair accessories from the same company for that final Elsa look.</li>
            <li>My daughter is 10 and it fits her really well.</li>
            <li>the shipping was much faster than they projected (got it the 17th</li>
            <li>The wig is also better quality than we expected.</li>
            <li>My daughter is 7 and is very petite.</li>
            <li>It was styled beautifully and only required a small bit of fluffing.</li>
            <li>Sizing was appropriate and fit (small) adult head.</li>
            <li>It was super yellow (I ordered beige)</li>
            <li>My daughter has a large head for a 5 year old.</li>
            <li>It is a good size for children&#x27;s smaller heads or a small adult&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>There are some spots in the back, where you can see the netting, but you could probably secure it with hairspray or pins, that&#x27;s the only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested in perfection I&#x27;d look for a different wig.</li>
            <li>Its cheaper to just keep it and let my 4 year old play with it to do hair.</li>
            <li>She is 5 yrs old and wore it with her Elsa costume trick or treating.  </li>
            <li>Did not fit my 6 year old daughter, I would think it might fit a 3 year old</li>
            <li>It is oddly comfortable for both my small 5 year olds head and and Adult woman</li>
            <li>The braid is really long and the style really looks like the character Elsa&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>It still beat out other higher priced wigs at party city.</li>
            <li>This item arrived much quicker than we expected.</li>
            <li>The shade is spot on (a light blonde), the hair was very soft and realistic, and the braid was thick enough and long enough to stick snowflake decorations in (I separately purchased bridal hair accessories and a snowflake pin to go with it).  </li>
            <li>the&lt;br /&gt;fit was a concern when I was buying, after reading several disappointed reviews about it being too small, it fit great and still has room for growth, my daughters head is about 21&amp;#34; and she is almost 6.</li>
            <li>After looking at, and walking away from the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; wig for kids at the stores because the quality was so very poor and to be honest, they wanted an arm and a leg for a child&#x27;s  wig, I went with a cos-play wig.</li>
            <li>Pretty heavy as well.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;wig&amp;#34; is white in color, not silky looking, and super hard to stay in place.  </li>

            <li> I read the other reviews to get some idea how this wig would do for my 6 year old granddaughter for her Elsa Halloween costume.  </li>
            <li> The pony tail is really long which I was worried about.</li>
            <li> I got the tan wig not the grey one.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old did not fit into the Elsa wig made by Disney.  </li>
            <li> The hair net is helpful, however, probably not high quality, but it does the job!</li>
            <li> I think it was just a little bit too big for her head.  </li>
            <li> I searched all over this site and read all the reviews of all the wigs to make sure I didn&#x27;t get a bad one.</li>
            <li> It also arrived way faster than I expected (the order indicated about a month</li>
            <li> It also came with pink blotches all over it.</li>
            <li> Arrived well before expected.</li>
            <li> We went through 4 other wigs from stores that were cheaply made, didn&#x27;t fit and just plain looked awful!</li>
            <li> We had several little &amp;#34;Elsas&amp;#34; pass us on trick-or-treating comment they wanted elsa hair, too!</li>
            <li> --it is too small to cover a child&#x27;s head properly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s size is a little big for a small kid.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for a friend&#x27;s rather tall child who had spent a lot of her allowance on an adult-size Elsa costume but was missing a wig.</li>
            <li> I have no reason to buy a second Elsa wig, but would recommend it to any other Frozen fanatic!</li>
            <li> Was very worried I wasn&#x27;t going to get the wig in time for some of my daughters costume parties (very difficult to track since it was coming from China).</li>
            <li> Size was too small even with the adjustable strap.</li>
            <li> , it was very small.</li>
            <li> but my family and I couldn&#x27;t help but laugh at how horrible it was.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My six year old daughter was very disappointed that her brown hair still shows all around the edges</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t seem to cover all of my daughter&#x27;s hair (even with the included hair cap)</li>
            <li> I hope this helps anyone confused by all the reviews, as I was!</li>
            <li> But alas!</li>
            <li> All in all very poorly designed!</li>
            <li> This is the worst wig-</li>
            <li> I will tell you that the tracks in the front of the wig are terrible.  </li>

            <li> Buy this one! I searched all over this site and read all the reviews of all the wigs to make sure I didn&#x27;t get a bad one. This wig is amazing! I can&#x27;t believe it was so cheap! Stop looking this is the best. It&#x27;s size is a little big for a small kid. My daughter is 10 and it fits her really well. She kind of has a big head :). The pony tail is really long which I was worried about. It is exactly what you see in the picture. It&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the shipping was much faster than they projected (got it the 17th and they estimated it would be delivered 28th-14th)</li>
            <li> Well it got the job done...I am 29 and this thing barely fit me. It was super yellow (I ordered beige), pretty much looks &amp;#34;nothing&amp;#34; like the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for Halloween my niece was Anna. When I walked up in my wig and dress she was super stoked so I guess I got the job done but my family and I couldn&#x27;t help but laugh at how horrible it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I recommend it??? Um I don&#x27;t know...like it&#x27;s probably better than the ones from the Halloween stores but this barely fit me. And the &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34; hair on the top isn&#x27;t shaped. It kind if looks like a mullet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say the company is nice. I was concerned about shipping but it got to me quicker than the estimated and they also responded to me super quick when I voiced my concern about shipping. I ordered on the 8th got it on the 25th (est was 25-2nd).</li>
            <li> Good but kept pushing back my 8 year old&#x27;s forehead so you could see the net. Overall, I kept stepping in to fix it. She got lots of compliments. Perfect Elsa hair</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;wig&amp;#34; is white in color, not silky looking, and super hard to stay in place.  Pretty heavy as well.</li>
            <li> great wig, and looks just like Elsa&#x27;s hair, it does not look cheap however, too heavy for my kids head. She&#x27;s 6. maybe for someone who  is 8-12.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a large head for a 5 year old. She was Elsa for Halloween. Not only did we receive this wig QUICKLY, but the quality is FANTASTIC! After looking at, and walking away from the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; wig for kids at the stores because the quality was so very poor and to be honest, they wanted an arm and a leg for a child&#x27;s  wig, I went with a cos-play wig. Best. Decision. Ever!&lt;br /&gt;The hair is nice and thick, and the braid (thin, and not &amp;#34;elsa-like&amp;#34; at the stores), was PERFECT! We had several little &amp;#34;Elsas&amp;#34; pass us on trick-or-treating comment they wanted elsa hair, too! Thank you so much for helping make my daughter&#x27;s  costume a success! Will probably be getting the Anna wig, soon.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for a friend&#x27;s rather tall child who had spent a lot of her allowance on an adult-size Elsa costume but was missing a wig. I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase and think that it looks even better than the seller&#x27;s picture. The shade is spot on (a light blonde), the hair was very soft and realistic, and the braid was thick enough and long enough to stick snowflake decorations in (I separately purchased bridal hair accessories and a snowflake pin to go with it).  The package arrived in good condition - in a zip lock bag surrounded by cardboard and covered in a heavy duty plastic mailer.  It also arrived way faster than I expected (the order indicated about a month but I got it in a week).  I have no reason to buy a second Elsa wig, but would recommend it to any other Frozen fanatic!</li>
            <li> It looks totally real and cute. I would buy it instantly. IT IS THE  BEST FROZEN WIG IN THE WORD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Choose the Beige option. It was the perfect color.</li>
            <li> This is the worst wig- it does not fit me as an adult or my 4 year old. I do not know who it was made for. It also came with pink blotches all over it. When I contacted them to return it they needed original packaging with address label to verify it was theirs, pictures of the product - what a hassle. Then they are making me pay for return shipping to Beijing- WHAT A HASSLE. Its cheaper to just keep it and let my 4 year old play with it to do hair. WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> It was well made and arrived before needed time frame thank you</li>
            <li> We went through 4 other wigs from stores that were cheaply made, didn&#x27;t fit and just plain looked awful! This wig however, was a BEAUTIFUL, full wig and the adjustment straps made for a perfect fit. It fits my 4 year old daughter wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Very pleased!!!! This item arrived much quicker than we expected. The wig is also better quality than we expected. I have worked with wigs in my line of business and can&#x27;t believe how great this is for such a great price!!!</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews to get some idea how this wig would do for my 6 year old granddaughter for her Elsa Halloween costume.  It is a beautiful wig for this use. I got the tan wig not the grey one. It is a good size for children&#x27;s smaller heads or a small adult&#x27;s. The braid is really long and the style really looks like the character Elsa&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> for the price it looked and worked great</li>
            <li> I liked the look of the wig.  It is definitely made for a child&#x27;s head.  The only issue was trying to keep it on my daughters head.  We tried adjusting the inner straps, but it kept sliding off.  I think it was just a little bit too big for her head.  She is 5 yrs old and wore it with her Elsa costume trick or treating.  It is a very well made wig and looks just like Elsa&#x27;s hair!!</li>
            <li> My 7 year old did not fit into the Elsa wig made by Disney.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of Elsa&#x27;s wig but by far this was the best I found. It fits perfect andI ordered some additional little snow flakes hair accessories from the same company for that final Elsa look.</li>
            <li> Love the hair, beautiful color can&#x27;t wait to wear it for Halloween and birthday party!</li>
            <li> Good Princess Elsa wig. Sizing was appropriate and fit (small) adult head. Perfect for dress-up, princess costumes, or Halloween.</li>
            <li> For the price I can&#x27;t complain. I will tell you that the tracks in the front of the wig are terrible.  It really doesn&#x27;t look to great from the front but the back is really nice. My daughter &amp; her kindergarten friends didn&#x27;t mind it &amp; she loved all the attention. If you&#x27;re interested in perfection I&#x27;d look for a different wig. It still beat out other higher priced wigs at party city.</li>
            <li> Size was too small even with the adjustable strap. Also the way it was packaged, bent/created a callick in the braid so it would not lay the way it should be. All in all very poorly designed! There&#x27;s better ones out there</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my daughters Elsa costume-this was a HIT. Shipping originally said that it would arrive by Halloween and it did! It is oddly comfortable for both my small 5 year olds head and and Adult woman too- this is Cosplay quality. It was styled beautifully and only required a small bit of fluffing. It will get a lot of action in the years to come and was certainly a huge part of my drama queens ability to channel her &amp;#34;Elsa&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Did not fit my 6 year old daughter, I would think it might fit a 3 year old, it was very small. I tried my hardest to get it to fit her head, and I even used a wig cap, but it just wouldn&#x27;t. Other than it being small, I thought it was good quality and would have worked out very nice as an Elsa wig!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m posting this for all the Moms out there that were guessing which one of these to buy! I ordered 10/4 and it came 10/22, much faster than they had quoted! We ordered it in the beige color and it&#x27;s a nice pale color, however not whitish, but still great....the&lt;br /&gt;fit was a concern when I was buying, after reading several disappointed reviews about it being too small, it fit great and still has room for growth, my daughters head is about 21&amp;#34; and she is almost 6. I did try it on, just to see if it would fit and it did. There are also adjustable clips inside to fit to size. The hair net is helpful, however, probably not high quality, but it does the job! There are some spots in the back, where you can see the netting, but you could probably secure it with hairspray or pins, that&#x27;s the only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars! I hope this helps anyone confused by all the reviews, as I was! The flash on my camera makes it look more yellow than it is too! My daughter beamed when she saw herself in it!</li>
            <li> My six year old daughter was very disappointed that her brown hair still shows all around the edges--it is too small to cover a child&#x27;s head properly.</li>
            <li> The wig lasted a couple uses, but then started falling apart. It was cute while it lasted!</li>
            <li> Was very worried I wasn&#x27;t going to get the wig in time for some of my daughters costume parties (very difficult to track since it was coming from China). But alas! It did come today after a longer wait than I anticipated but was within the estimated arrival time. So all is well and my daughter is ecstatic. I&#x27;m a little disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t seem to cover all of my daughter&#x27;s hair (even with the included hair cap) but I think we can make it work. And it&#x27;s by far much cuter than many of the wigs that are being sold. And my daughter loves it!!!!!</li>
            <li> The quality of this wig was amazing for the price and I got the wig just in time for Halloween. This wig is perfect for a small child. My daughter is 7 and is very petite. She has dark brown hair and the wig covered her hair perfectly!! The wig pictured is exactly what I got.</li>
            <li> Great quality!! Arrived well before expected.</li>
