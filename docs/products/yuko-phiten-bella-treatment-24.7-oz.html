            <li>Love the product, the hair stay shyness and smell the best!</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest to use this as a leave in-no good.</li>
            <li>I am 54 and that day, for the 1st time in my life,  I loved my hair.  </li>
            <li>Another good thing is I did not get the &amp;#34;tub&amp;#34; as shown in the picture.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a good treatment for curly hair; I use it every time I wash my hair now.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never looked so good.  </li>
            <li>Yes because it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>LOVED THE WAY HAIR FEELS</li>
            <li>Now, I can go 48 to 72 hours between shampoos and still have great, healthy looking curls.  </li>
            <li>I sound just like a company shill with my brilliant marketing slogan.  </li>
            <li>This is my very favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>I would pay a lot more for this if I had to, but it&#x27;s a great price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I love this product and so do my girls!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love the conditioner!</li>
            <li>Works amazing</li>
            <li>This conditioner is amazing.</li>
            <li>It is amazing at getting tangles out - you can literally run your hands through your hair when you are done using.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product because of the rave reviews on Amazon, but honestly, this product isn&#x27;t any better than a good conditioner.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own pump now.</li>
            <li>This is really nice stuff.</li>
            <li>It is very pricey, but the results are great!</li>
            <li>but it feels nice at every use.</li>
            <li>Loves it, my hair looks silky and nice after using it.</li>
            <li>I love honest people.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>It is by far the best conditioner ever.  </li>
            <li>but I found another more suitable for me.</li>
            <li>Great price for large tub.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be able to tell immediately.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve recommeneded this product to many people as a result.  </li>
            <li>I suggest getting the biggest bottle (it&#x27;s actually more like a tub) because you will want to lather this on.</li>
            <li>I fell in love.  </li>
            <li>Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>This was just ok.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>My hair feels healthy now.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much more manageable after I use this.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and</li>
            <li>I can only afford to use it for part of the year which is during the summer when I bleach my hair so it works out perfect that way :)</li>
            <li>and I have used it every since and the people who have done my hair comment on what healthy hair I have.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair troublesome hair smooth...but need to wash a bit more often as it leaves it abit oilmen.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff, as it makes my hair much more manageable when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Thought I would love this stuff, always used Macadamia Treatment but thought could save some money with this.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I wanted nice healthy smooth hair.</li>
            <li>I think this is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I have Yuko treated hair and my hair has never been better.</li>
            <li>I have been Yuko-ing my hair for years, but after using the treatment WITH the shampoo, I have been getting so many more compliments.</li>
            <li>With this it stays nice and soft and curly, smooth!!!</li>
            <li>That is good right?</li>
            <li>Excellent detangler for long hair.</li>
            <li>i love this haircare line, i just wish the pricing were better and that the products were more widely available.</li>
            <li>A wonderful conditioner for dry hair.</li>
            <li>Best ever for dry ends.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this conditioner for years and  find it the best out there for dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it on the hair close to my scalp, but will run my hands lightly over the top after working conditioner through my ends.</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes comb out EASY.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I typed easy.  </li>
            <li>I have the perfect 80s hair - curly dry frizzy hair that no products has ever been able to control or calm.  </li>
            <li>i love phiten haircare products they all smell really great and leave your hair feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>Works well and delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>The jar was shrink-wrapped in plastic, but I strongly suspect that water was added.</li>
            <li>I have really fine, curly, colored, straightened hair.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my fine hair shiny and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>The whole afternoon I kept on touching my extremely soft and shiny hair and people even commented on how beautiful my hair looked.  </li>
            <li>My curls are now smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I makes my chemically treated hair shiny, smooth, silky.  </li>
            <li>what genuine Phi-Ten Bella Treatment conditioner is like.</li>
            <li>Awesome and really gets your hair back into shape!!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product, but it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>I am even more so pleased by the new design of the bottle, as it comes with</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great conditioner as long as you wash it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought Phi-Ten Bella treatment many times and it is a very thick, rich conditioner, which is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Nothing special</li>
            <li>however my friends have used this and state that it really controls the frizz problem that so many have.</li>
            <li>and this really helps keep it healthy.</li>
            <li>I have shiny, mostly straight, mostly well behaved hair.</li>
            <li>But, since I can&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll just speak...with relative dignity about how good this was for my hair.</li>
            <li>But, since I can&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll just speak...with relative dignity about how good this was for my hair.</li>
            <li>not bad,</li>
            <li>This is THE BEST TREATMENT I&#x27;ve found to help heal my over processed, stressed, thin, fine, damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>A great hair stylist I had in LA used this product exclusively in her salon and when I requested a jar she said only certain salons carry it.</li>
            <li>my hair looks tremendously healthier as compared to before</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use frizz serum or my flat iron...not completely smooth but still does the trick; I love it!</li>
            <li>and I am glad to be able to finally find it on Amazon.com</li>
            <li>It feels soft, tangle free and smooth!</li>
            <li>And everyone noticed the next day that my hair looked amazing.  </li>
            <li>I rarely use products anymore.  </li>
            <li>and it is completely worth it.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner made my hair soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>So it is perfect for your everyday hair, but when you really need help you can&#x27;t really count on it.</li>
            <li>If I do any extra styling, it looks amazing whereas there is nothing I can do to make my hair look right without it.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff for my dry hair and not expensive.</li>
            <li>Arrived super fast!</li>
            <li>my naturally dry, frizzy, split ends smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>If I dare to use a moisturizing conditioner, even if I limit it to my ends, my hair becomes more shiny, and more limp.</li>
            <li>It is very reasonably priced for the quality and would recommend it for all hair types.</li>
            <li>Firstly, I did not receive what is pictured here.</li>
            <li>&quot; results consistently-</li>
            <li>But start with the 8 ounce tube first and see it if works for you before springing for the 24ounce one.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have been buying this from my salon for years at a higher price.</li>
            <li>If I had only known how amazing this conditioner was, I probably would&#x27;ve saved hundreds of dollars from professional stylists.  </li>
            <li>I have long healthy color treated hair which I like to care of.</li>
            <li>I think most people w/ dry hair would like this product.</li>
            <li>Usually, I am only happy with the conditioner that comes with my box of hair dye and since a few years ago, I feel like the formula has changed</li>
            <li>and it it dries really well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this treatment!  </li>
            <li>I  don&#x27;t recommend things until I really see that they are exceptional\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>My Dermatologist here in Thailand really likes this product.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really like the fragrance--sort of earthy, clay-like.</li>
            <li>I dye my hair very often and now after using this product</li>
            <li>While this product works really, really well, it inflamed the excema on my face and body.</li>
            <li>I bought some for my granddaughters who also have curly hair and it makes their hair soft and the knots comb right out.  </li>
            <li>Other conditioners just sit on your hair, this one really penetrates and keeps it healthy.  </li>
            <li>But start with the 8 ounce tube first and see it if works for you before springing for the 24ounce one.acle\\&quot; or \\&quot;Holy Grail\\&quot; and you think they are being a little... over the top because</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, my hair were so soft that I kept on rinsing them thinking I didn&#x27;t wash it off.  </li>
            <li>The jar that this company shipped to me is okay, but it seems watered down</li>
            <li>It actually changes your hair to make it smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>keeps my hair soft, easier to comb when wet, and more tangle-free when it dries.</li>
            <li>highly highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Each morning, I spritz my curls with water to dampen and run a little more PHITEN BELLA through the curls to refresh them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You know when women rave about something as a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; or \\&quot;Holy Grail\\&quot; and you think they are being a little... over the top because I mean...it is just a beauty product?</li>
            <li>Hair is so soft!!</li>
            <li>how healthy my hair becomes after using it just a few times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for 10 years now and I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>So I know that great conditioner is hard to notice and even harder to find.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt phenomanally soft after using this!  </li>
            <li>Make my hair soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>And probably a bit better than my usual conditioner.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and leaves hair soft, silky, and shiny without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>I kind of dried out my hair with the John Frieda lightening spray but one use of this conditioner, my ends doesn&#x27;t feel as dry anymore.</li>
            <li>the jar is quite large and you dont need to use a ton, so the price is actually not *</li>
            <li>My hairdresser used this as a leave in conditioner on my naturally curly hair when she tried to convince me</li>
            <li>I frequently hear compliments of how \\&quot;shiny\\&quot; my hair is.</li>
            <li>I have reviewed nearly all of my amazon purchases from electric drills to bubble bath.  </li>
            <li>I used this conditioner and was so amazed that I could save so much money and finally know what to buy from now on instead of trying everything.  </li>
            <li>I found this totally by accident looking for something else, and nothing in the name really said what it was for, so I took a chance</li>
            <li>If there was some way of ensuring the friends I have teased over the years for gushing over products couldn&#x27;t use this review against me, I&#x27;d display the excitement of a 12 year old fan in a J.B concert.</li>

            <li>It is the only thing that works to make my husbands waist long super curly hair, look like...</li>
            <li>It detangles and leaves my hair super soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>yet it&#x27;s light enough that it leaves no residue that can weight hair down and cause flakes.  </li>
            <li>I used this product for about a month and my hair is completely back to normal.  </li>
            <li>The phitobella is the only thing that makes it look calm and styled without doing anything to my hair but letting it dry!  </li>
            <li>This product is very gentle on my hair and it does not cause my hair to fall out as much as other products do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dry and I straighten it very often.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner for my coarse, thick hair.</li>
            <li>Anyone with fine curly hair knows how hard it is to comb your hair out after washing it without creating mats on accident.  </li>
            <li>and the hair was nice and smooth, but I&#x27;ve done the tragic mistake of trying to go red hair</li>
            <li>At first glance it seems pricey, but you use only a tiny bit, so it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>a lot of my hair fell off and what was left on my head was completely fried.</li>
            <li>After much frustration when I relocated I searched on amazon in desperation to find it due to the way it just leaves</li>
            <li>When super shiny hair is limp and flat, it has a tendency to look greasy.</li>
            <li>and I use hot tools everyday.</li>
            <li>When my hair was normal it did what I expected, I was using it twice a week</li>
            <li>I should just let it do its thing and air-dry naturally instead of the 30 minute blow dry</li>
            <li>I have occasionally used other conditioners (at the gym if I forgot my own) and the difference is truly dramatic.</li>

            <li> Now, I can go 48 to 72 hours between shampoos and still have great, healthy looking curls.  </li>
            <li> I sound just like a company shill with my brilliant marketing slogan.  </li>
            <li> This is my very favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> I would pay a lot more for this if I had to, but it&#x27;s a great price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I love this product and so do my girls!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love the conditioner!</li>
            <li> Works amazing</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing.</li>
            <li> It is amazing at getting tangles out - you can literally run your hands through your hair when you are done using.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of the rave reviews on Amazon, but honestly, this product isn&#x27;t any better than a good conditioner.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own pump now.</li>
            <li> This is really nice stuff.</li>
            <li> It is very pricey, but the results are great!</li>
            <li> but it feels nice at every use.</li>
            <li> Loves it, my hair looks silky and nice after using it.</li>
            <li> I love honest people.  </li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> It is by far the best conditioner ever.  </li>
            <li> but I found another more suitable for me.</li>
            <li> Great price for large tub.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be able to tell immediately.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve recommeneded this product to many people as a result.  </li>
            <li> I suggest getting the biggest bottle (it&#x27;s actually more like a tub) because you will want to lather this on.</li>
            <li> I fell in love.  </li>
            <li> Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> This was just ok.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> My hair feels healthy now.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much more manageable after I use this.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and</li>
            <li> I can only afford to use it for part of the year which is during the summer when I bleach my hair so it works out perfect that way :)</li>
            <li> and I have used it every since and the people who have done my hair comment on what healthy hair I have.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair troublesome hair smooth...but need to wash a bit more often as it leaves it abit oilmen.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff, as it makes my hair much more manageable when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Thought I would love this stuff, always used Macadamia Treatment but thought could save some money with this.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I wanted nice healthy smooth hair.</li>
            <li> I think this is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I have Yuko treated hair and my hair has never been better.</li>
            <li> I have been Yuko-ing my hair for years, but after using the treatment WITH the shampoo, I have been getting so many more compliments.</li>
            <li> With this it stays nice and soft and curly, smooth!!!</li>
            <li> That is good right?</li>
            <li> Excellent detangler for long hair.</li>
            <li> i love this haircare line, i just wish the pricing were better and that the products were more widely available.</li>
            <li> A wonderful conditioner for dry hair.</li>
            <li> Best ever for dry ends.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for years and  find it the best out there for dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it on the hair close to my scalp, but will run my hands lightly over the top after working conditioner through my ends.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes comb out EASY.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I typed easy.  </li>
            <li> I have the perfect 80s hair - curly dry frizzy hair that no products has ever been able to control or calm.  </li>
            <li> i love phiten haircare products they all smell really great and leave your hair feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> Works well and delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> The jar was shrink-wrapped in plastic, but I strongly suspect that water was added.</li>
            <li> I have really fine, curly, colored, straightened hair.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my fine hair shiny and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> The whole afternoon I kept on touching my extremely soft and shiny hair and people even commented on how beautiful my hair looked.  </li>
            <li> My curls are now smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I makes my chemically treated hair shiny, smooth, silky.  </li>
            <li> what genuine Phi-Ten Bella Treatment conditioner is like.</li>
            <li> Awesome and really gets your hair back into shape!!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product, but it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> I am even more so pleased by the new design of the bottle, as it comes with</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great conditioner as long as you wash it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought Phi-Ten Bella treatment many times and it is a very thick, rich conditioner, which is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Nothing special</li>
            <li> however my friends have used this and state that it really controls the frizz problem that so many have.</li>
            <li> and this really helps keep it healthy.</li>
            <li> I have shiny, mostly straight, mostly well behaved hair.</li>
            <li> But, since I can&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll just speak...with relative dignity about how good this was for my hair.</li>
            <li> But, since I can&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll just speak...with relative dignity about how good this was for my hair.</li>
            <li> not bad,</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST TREATMENT I&#x27;ve found to help heal my over processed, stressed, thin, fine, damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> A great hair stylist I had in LA used this product exclusively in her salon and when I requested a jar she said only certain salons carry it.</li>
            <li> my hair looks tremendously healthier as compared to before</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use frizz serum or my flat iron...not completely smooth but still does the trick; I love it!</li>
            <li> and I am glad to be able to finally find it on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> It feels soft, tangle free and smooth!</li>
            <li> And everyone noticed the next day that my hair looked amazing.  </li>
            <li> I rarely use products anymore.  </li>
            <li> and it is completely worth it.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner made my hair soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> So it is perfect for your everyday hair, but when you really need help you can&#x27;t really count on it.</li>
            <li> If I do any extra styling, it looks amazing whereas there is nothing I can do to make my hair look right without it.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff for my dry hair and not expensive.</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast!</li>
            <li> my naturally dry, frizzy, split ends smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> If I dare to use a moisturizing conditioner, even if I limit it to my ends, my hair becomes more shiny, and more limp.</li>
            <li> It is very reasonably priced for the quality and would recommend it for all hair types.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I did not receive what is pictured here.</li>
            <li> &quot; results consistently-</li>
            <li> But start with the 8 ounce tube first and see it if works for you before springing for the 24ounce one.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this from my salon for years at a higher price.</li>
            <li> If I had only known how amazing this conditioner was, I probably would&#x27;ve saved hundreds of dollars from professional stylists.  </li>
            <li> I have long healthy color treated hair which I like to care of.</li>
            <li> I think most people w/ dry hair would like this product.</li>
            <li> Usually, I am only happy with the conditioner that comes with my box of hair dye and since a few years ago, I feel like the formula has changed</li>
            <li> and it it dries really well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this treatment!  </li>
            <li> I  don&#x27;t recommend things until I really see that they are exceptional\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> My Dermatologist here in Thailand really likes this product.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really like the fragrance--sort of earthy, clay-like.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair very often and now after using this product</li>
            <li> While this product works really, really well, it inflamed the excema on my face and body.</li>
            <li> I bought some for my granddaughters who also have curly hair and it makes their hair soft and the knots comb right out.  </li>
            <li> Other conditioners just sit on your hair, this one really penetrates and keeps it healthy.  </li>
            <li> But start with the 8 ounce tube first and see it if works for you before springing for the 24ounce one.acle\\&quot; or \\&quot;Holy Grail\\&quot; and you think they are being a little... over the top because</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, my hair were so soft that I kept on rinsing them thinking I didn&#x27;t wash it off.  </li>
            <li> The jar that this company shipped to me is okay, but it seems watered down</li>
            <li> It actually changes your hair to make it smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> keeps my hair soft, easier to comb when wet, and more tangle-free when it dries.</li>
            <li> highly highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Each morning, I spritz my curls with water to dampen and run a little more PHITEN BELLA through the curls to refresh them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You know when women rave about something as a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; or \\&quot;Holy Grail\\&quot; and you think they are being a little... over the top because I mean...it is just a beauty product?</li>
            <li> Hair is so soft!!</li>
            <li> how healthy my hair becomes after using it just a few times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for 10 years now and I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> So I know that great conditioner is hard to notice and even harder to find.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt phenomanally soft after using this!  </li>
            <li> Make my hair soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> And probably a bit better than my usual conditioner.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and leaves hair soft, silky, and shiny without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> I kind of dried out my hair with the John Frieda lightening spray but one use of this conditioner, my ends doesn&#x27;t feel as dry anymore.</li>
            <li> the jar is quite large and you dont need to use a ton, so the price is actually not *</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this as a leave in conditioner on my naturally curly hair when she tried to convince me</li>
            <li> I frequently hear compliments of how \\&quot;shiny\\&quot; my hair is.</li>
            <li> I have reviewed nearly all of my amazon purchases from electric drills to bubble bath.  </li>
            <li> I used this conditioner and was so amazed that I could save so much money and finally know what to buy from now on instead of trying everything.  </li>
            <li> I found this totally by accident looking for something else, and nothing in the name really said what it was for, so I took a chance</li>
            <li> If there was some way of ensuring the friends I have teased over the years for gushing over products couldn&#x27;t use this review against me, I&#x27;d display the excitement of a 12 year old fan in a J.B concert.</li>
            <li> If there was some way of ensuring the friends I have teased over the years for gushing over products couldn&#x27;t use this review against me, I&#x27;d display the excitement of a 12 year old fan in a J.B concert.</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that works to make my husbands waist long super curly hair, look like...</li>
            <li> It detangles and leaves my hair super soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> yet it&#x27;s light enough that it leaves no residue that can weight hair down and cause flakes.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for about a month and my hair is completely back to normal.  </li>
            <li> The phitobella is the only thing that makes it look calm and styled without doing anything to my hair but letting it dry!  </li>
            <li> This product is very gentle on my hair and it does not cause my hair to fall out as much as other products do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry and I straighten it very often.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner for my coarse, thick hair.</li>
            <li> Anyone with fine curly hair knows how hard it is to comb your hair out after washing it without creating mats on accident.  </li>
            <li> and the hair was nice and smooth, but I&#x27;ve done the tragic mistake of trying to go red hair</li>
            <li> At first glance it seems pricey, but you use only a tiny bit, so it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> a lot of my hair fell off and what was left on my head was completely fried.</li>
            <li> After much frustration when I relocated I searched on amazon in desperation to find it due to the way it just leaves</li>
            <li> When super shiny hair is limp and flat, it has a tendency to look greasy.</li>
            <li> and I use hot tools everyday.</li>
            <li> When my hair was normal it did what I expected, I was using it twice a week</li>
            <li> I should just let it do its thing and air-dry naturally instead of the 30 minute blow dry</li>
            <li> I have occasionally used other conditioners (at the gym if I forgot my own) and the difference is truly dramatic.</li>
            <li> I would not necessarily recommend this for people with flat hair or people who are looking for volume.  </li>
            <li> I only wish they made extra strength because my hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to write a review from this product for a long time, but this week I finally had to do it.</li>
            <li> The tub lasts a really long time, even if you&#x27;re using it as your regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> I had the Yuko Japanese treatment 9 months ago and this product allows me to blow dry my hair without any additional products or flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes just put it on my ends for extra protection from hair straightening even when it is dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry, curly, coarse &amp; highlighted.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one that makes my wavy/frizzy hair smooth and shiny, and I&#x27;m one to buy expensive hair products (like Kerastase and Oribe).  </li>
            <li> I do try to apply pure coconut oil to my hair at least once a week.</li>
            <li> i have long hair and didnt want to cut a lot of it off, so i tried this conditioner somewhat out of desperation.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly, colored hair and this conditioner</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t repair the hair long term</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and my hair felt like I had burnt it with a candle ;( so I used this product twice to help bring my hair back to life, but it did not help as I expected.</li>
            <li> If your hair is dry and chemically damaged, this product is for you.  </li>
            <li> My hair does get exceptionally dry as I color treat/heat treat/abuse my hair</li>
            <li> I blow dry to dry not style on workdays (weekdays) and air dry on weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very dry and brittle hair due to dying it red and straightening it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just too normally for me, because my hair vey hard to management.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and no more split ends</li>
            <li> This product is above average quality, wash your hair, towel-dry it and apply the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Coloring my hair makes the ends so dry and this product worked miracles!</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit on the dry ends when in the shower and allow to soak while you wash then rinse out in order to get the desired look.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair greasy and my hair is very dry</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit of it.</li>
            <li> I received a tub and not a pump bottle which would be easier and what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not really.</li>
            <li> I recently had my hair highlighted and it felt completely dead and brittle.  </li>
            <li> Lush, thick, and intensified shine.</li>
            <li> But it makes hair a little flat.</li>
            <li> I really like scent, very subtle.</li>
            <li> A little amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Unless my hair is cut shoulder length, it has very little movement and moderately low body.</li>
            <li> I use every other day and my hair is not frizzy</li>
            <li> I have have tried conditioners galore in an effort to find something that balanced my hair out, including- putting volumizing conditioner on part of my hair and moisturizing conditioner on the other parts.</li>
            <li> I have always used this conditioner, but recently it has become hard to find.  </li>
            <li> * wash my hair daily because that makes my hair poofy but dull.</li>
            <li> For thick, coarse hair, nothing beats it!</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It usually looks like a squirrels nest going down his back after a few hours of sitting and rubbing his ponytail on a chair or couch.</li>
            <li> other heavy duty conditioners make my hair too greasy, but this doesnt do that at all.</li>
            <li> It only seems expensive, a jar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> but I still leave a little of it in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I leave it in for a few hours</li>
            <li> or* shiny and limp.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse hair, not too thick or thin.</li>
            <li> I just felt stupid, because my hair insisted on being full and dull *</li>
            <li> Even the instructions encourage you to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> Anyone who suspects me can easily see I rate things poorly when they are crap.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair and it helps tame it.</li>
            <li> If I use a volumizing conditioner, my hair gets poofy and dull.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in my late 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> While in the shower I use Suave tea therapy moisturizing conditioner to get the tangles out of my thick waist length hair.  </li>
            <li> I mean...</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> seriously.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is the price, its so pricey that I can&#x27;t get him to use it if he isn&#x27;t going anywhere!</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s now shinier, the split ends created by the idiot hair stylist are not noticeable, it&#x27;s smoother, etc), and i can walk out the door with it wet</li>
            <li> No more frizzy hair!!!</li>
            <li> (although yes, it is expensive).</li>
            <li> and I used some of the expensive stuff</li>
            <li> I am too lazy and just thinking about cold water in Chicago winters is horrifying.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t rinse with cold water or anything.</li>
            <li> Yeah, that bad.  </li>
            <li> too* terrible</li>
            <li> I bought some horrible overpriced conditioner just before getting a haircut at Plaid in Hollywood.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Works amazing</li>
            <li> I have really fine, curly, colored, straightened hair.  My grandmother called it \\&quot;the rats nest\\&quot;.  Yeah, that bad.  So I know that great conditioner is hard to notice and even harder to find.  This stuff is brilliant.  Anyone with fine curly hair knows how hard it is to comb your hair out after washing it without creating mats on accident.  This conditioner makes comb out EASY.  Yes, I typed easy.  Seriously.  It&#x27;s a godsend.  If you&#x27;re struggling to find a conditioner that you can feel makes a difference, try this product.  You&#x27;ll be able to tell immediately.   It lasts quite a good amount of time too!</li>
            <li> A wonderful conditioner for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have the perfect 80s hair - curly dry frizzy hair that no products has ever been able to control or calm.  After buying this product at the urging of my hairdresser I was a convert.  My curls are now smooth and shiny.  I can get a brush thru my hair after showering without pulling clumps.  I rarely use products anymore.  Life changer.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I did not receive what is pictured here. I received a tub and not a pump bottle which would be easier and what I expected. The only reason I ordered this product is because my long-time hair dresser uses this as deep conditioner for me. It&#x27;s a great conditioner as long as you wash it out. Sometimes I use a bit of wash-out conditioner as a leave in but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest to use this as a leave in-no good.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is recommended for people who have had the Yuko hair straightening process done.  A friend of mine had it done and started using this conditioner and raved about it.  I have not had my hair straightened at all and I started using the conditioner myself and I was amazed. I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner exclusively for about 3 years now and it is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  It actually changes your hair to make it smooth and soft.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair and I&#x27;ve recommeneded this product to many people as a result.  Other conditioners just sit on your hair, this one really penetrates and keeps it healthy.  It does have a steep price tag, but it is cheaper on Amazon than it is from the Yuko site and it is completely worth it.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this as a leave in conditioner on my naturally curly hair when she tried to convince me I should just let it do its thing and air-dry naturally instead of the 30 minute blow dry I have done for decades.   I am 54 and that day, for the 1st time in my life,  I loved my hair.  While in the shower I use Suave tea therapy moisturizing conditioner to get the tangles out of my thick waist length hair.  Then, after squeezing out the water I run about 2 pea sized amounts of PHITEN BELLA into my scalp.  Then, I divide my hair into about 4 sections and run a quarter sized amount of PHITEN BELLA through each section.  I leave it in my hair and just go about my day.  When it dries, I have the softest shiniest curls you have ever seen.  Each morning, I spritz my curls with water to dampen and run a little more PHITEN BELLA through the curls to refresh them.  Now, I can go 48 to 72 hours between shampoos and still have great, healthy looking curls.  It only seems expensive, a jar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> If your hair is dry and chemically damaged, this product is for you.  Awesome and really gets your hair back into shape!!</li>
            <li> best conditioner I have ever used. I am hooked for life.</li>
            <li> Excellent detangler for long hair. Really great product.</li>
            <li> not bad, but I found another more suitable for me. it&#x27;s just too normally for me, because my hair vey hard to management.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of the rave reviews on Amazon, but honestly, this product isn&#x27;t any better than a good conditioner.  I am always looking for the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product for my wavy frizzy hair and I guess the search goes on.  I really wanted to love this product, but it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> i got my hair japanese straightened for the second time, and the part that had been processed twice got rather damaged (the person who did it wasnt paying a ton of attention and broke off a lot of the ends of my hair as he was straightening it). i have long hair and didnt want to cut a lot of it off, so i tried this conditioner somewhat out of desperation. it&#x27;s great. seriously. other heavy duty conditioners make my hair too greasy, but this doesnt do that at all. my hair looks tremendously healthier as compared to before (it&#x27;s now shinier, the split ends created by the idiot hair stylist are not noticeable, it&#x27;s smoother, etc), and i can walk out the door with it wet and it it dries really well.  the jar is quite large and you dont need to use a ton, so the price is actually not *too* terrible (although yes, it is expensive).</li>
            <li> This product is very gentle on my hair and it does not cause my hair to fall out as much as other products do. It also prolongs the life of my Yuko Hair Straightening. I frequently hear compliments of how \\&quot;shiny\\&quot; my hair is. A little amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner! I have been using this for 12 yrs now and works well with the shampoo. Never need to switch to a different conditioner to rest and go back to make it work again as a lot of people do. My hair is soft and no more split ends and I use hot tools everyday.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing. I actually use it as a leave in. My hairstylist told me to rub the conditioner in my hair from the bottom to my ears AFTER i shower and leave it in. It will NOT make your hair look greasy. I sometimes just put it on my ends for extra protection from hair straightening even when it is dry. I suggest getting the biggest bottle (it&#x27;s actually more like a tub) because you will want to lather this on. I Yuko my hair, but I think that this product is great for everyone.</li>
            <li> This is the very best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  It seems to nourish my hair just enough to prevent split ends and that \\&quot;crispy\\&quot; feeling that damaged hair can have, yet it&#x27;s light enough that it leaves no residue that can weight hair down and cause flakes.  It leaves my fine hair shiny and bouncy.  At first glance it seems pricey, but you use only a tiny bit, so it lasts a long time.  I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for about ten years.</li>
            <li> This is the best every-day conditioner I have ever found.  I have long, curly, colored hair and this conditioner keeps my hair soft, easier to comb when wet, and more tangle-free when it dries.</li>
            <li> ADORE this conditioner!!  It smells fantastic and leaves hair soft, silky, and shiny without weighing it down.  Highly recommend this treatment!  [[ASIN:B002AQF3PO Yuko Phi-Ten bella Treatment 24.7 oz jar]]</li>
            <li> Best ever for dry ends.  NOTHING else compares.</li>
            <li> i love phiten haircare products they all smell really great and leave your hair feeling super soft. I dont know that the products are THAT helpful to repair damage, but i did notice faster hair growth with use of any of the hair care products. i love this haircare line, i just wish the pricing were better and that the products were more widely available. highly highly recommend</li>
            <li> Brilliant title to my review!  I know!  I sound just like a company shill with my brilliant marketing slogan.  I don&#x27;t care.  I have reviewed nearly all of my amazon purchases from electric drills to bubble bath.  Anyone who suspects me can easily see I rate things poorly when they are crap.  I bought some horrible overpriced conditioner just before getting a haircut at Plaid in Hollywood.  The stylist there sells this stuff exclusively.  I asked if he recommended a shampoo for brunettes and he said, \\&quot;No.  I  don&#x27;t recommend things until I really see that they are exceptional\\&quot;.  He was selling me conditioner and no shampoo.  I fell in love.  I love honest people.  I used this conditioner and was so amazed that I could save so much money and finally know what to buy from now on instead of trying everything.  Usually, I am only happy with the conditioner that comes with my box of hair dye and since a few years ago, I feel like the formula has changed and it&#x27;s not the same.  Regardless, this is the only thing I need to use.  I am running out and I used some of the expensive stuff and I am looking at myself in the mirror with my big poofy hair hating it.  The phitobella is the only thing that makes it look calm and styled without doing anything to my hair but letting it dry!  If I do any extra styling, it looks amazing whereas there is nothing I can do to make my hair look right without it.  Can&#x27;t polish a terd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!!!! I have very dry and brittle hair due to dying it red and straightening it. My friend me try it out and it&#x27;s amazing!!! I leave it in for a few hours and then I rinse it out but I still leave a little of it in my hair.  No more frizzy hair!!! And everyone noticed the next day that my hair looked amazing.  Another good thing is I did not get the &amp;#34;tub&amp;#34; as shown in the picture.  Mine has a pump on it so that&#x27;s a plus.  And it only took 2 days to receive my product!!</li>
            <li> I have not used this product. My Dermatologist here in Thailand really likes this product.  I have brought them 7 jars of this. They can not get it here.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my naturally curly hair and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  I bought some for my granddaughters who also have curly hair and it makes their hair soft and the knots comb right out.  They are 7 years and 5 years and they use it after swimming as a conditioner.  I&lt;br /&gt;love it for my hair and I&#x27;m in my late 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have been straightening my hair for the last 5 years.  I have always used this conditioner, but recently it has become hard to find.  It is the BEST conditioner out there.  It is worth every penny.  I makes my chemically treated hair shiny, smooth, silky.  I always got complements on my hair.  I never thought I would find it again.  I should have known I would find it on amazon.  Thank you amazon.  You rock!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best conditoner/treatments I have ever used!  Arrived super fast! Great packaging/no damage!  My hair felt phenomanally soft after using this!  I will always buy now!</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever. Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. Having tried others I seem to find my way back to this brand time after time. I am even more so pleased by the new design of the bottle, as it comes with it&#x27;s own pump now. One of my personal pet peeves is &amp;#34;build up&amp;#34; and this has virtually none. It is very reasonably priced for the quality and would recommend it for all hair types.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner for my coarse, thick hair. It detangles and leaves my hair super soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I have chemically treated hair and need a superpower conditioner. This was just ok. I haven&#x27;t found anything to beat Kevin Murphy&#x27;s Hydrate Me Rinse. My hair was a bit drier when using this.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse hair, not too thick or thin. It&#x27;s dry and I straighten it very often. I used this hoping for an improvement in my hair condition but I went through the entire jar with no difference noted.</li>
            <li> For thick, coarse hair, nothing beats it!</li>
            <li> Works well and delivered very quickly. I received two days after ordering.&lt;br /&gt;Really helps with frizzy hair. I use every other day and my hair is not frizzy&lt;br /&gt;Like it used to be.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good treatment for curly hair; I use it every time I wash my hair now.  Just a tiny bit, and don&#x27;t wash it out all the way. My hairdresser thinks my hair is in very good condition, so it must be working.  I&#x27;ve been using it for six months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought Phi-Ten Bella treatment many times and it is a very thick, rich conditioner, which is wonderful. The jar that this company shipped to me is okay, but it seems watered down and I will not buy from them again. The jar was shrink-wrapped in plastic, but I strongly suspect that water was added. I can&#x27;t prove it, but as I said, I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and this jar was definitely thinner, almost runny--that isn&#x27;t what genuine Phi-Ten Bella Treatment conditioner is like.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner for frizzy course hair ever!</li>
            <li> This is really nice stuff. It is the only thing that works to make my husbands waist long super curly hair, look like...well...hair!!! It usually looks like a squirrels nest going down his back after a few hours of sitting and rubbing his ponytail on a chair or couch. With this it stays nice and soft and curly, smooth!!! I found this totally by accident looking for something else, and nothing in the name really said what it was for, so I took a chance and I&#x27;m glad I did. The only bad thing is the price, its so pricey that I can&#x27;t get him to use it if he isn&#x27;t going anywhere! Frugal you know, ugh!</li>
            <li> This conditioner made my hair soft and smooth! I kind of dried out my hair with the John Frieda lightening spray but one use of this conditioner, my ends doesn&#x27;t feel as dry anymore. I use it twice a week. My hair feels healthy now. I would definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> Its the only conditioner that works on my hair.  I only wish they made extra strength because my hair is dry.  I think most people w/ dry hair would like this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much more manageable after I use this. I don&#x27;t have to use frizz serum or my flat iron...not completely smooth but still does the trick; I love it!</li>
            <li> The best hair conditioner ever!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. I have thick, curly hair and it helps tame it. Recommended by my hairstylist. Great price for large tub.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used.  The first time I tried it, my hair were so soft that I kept on rinsing them thinking I didn&#x27;t wash it off.  The whole afternoon I kept on touching my extremely soft and shiny hair and people even commented on how beautiful my hair looked.  I have occasionally used other conditioners (at the gym if I forgot my own) and the difference is truly dramatic. I have now been using it for about 3 years and I am glad to be able to finally find it on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Good stuff for my dry hair and not expensive. My hairs looks great after using this hair mask. I love it.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair greasy and my hair is very dry</li>
            <li> This is my very favorite conditioner. Love the smell and how healthy my hair becomes after using it just a few times. I can only afford to use it for part of the year which is during the summer when I bleach my hair so it works out perfect that way :)</li>
            <li> Make my hair soft and manageable! My hair loves it!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair mask/conditioner. I do not have frizzy hair however my friends have used this and state that it really controls the frizz problem that so many have. My hair does get exceptionally dry as I color treat/heat treat/abuse my hair and this really helps keep it healthy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for years and  find it the best out there for dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I started using this product almost 10 years ago, but always had problems finding it.  My hair was over processed and I had beautician use it and I have used it every since and the people who have done my hair comment on what healthy hair I have.  I can&#x27;t go without it!</li>
            <li> Love the product, the hair stay shyness and smell the best!</li>
            <li> A great hair stylist I had in LA used this product exclusively in her salon and when I requested a jar she said only certain salons carry it. After much frustration when I relocated I searched on amazon in desperation to find it due to the way it just leaves my naturally dry, frizzy, split ends smooth and healthy looking. You only need a little bit on the dry ends when in the shower and allow to soak while you wash then rinse out in order to get the desired look. I cannot be without this stuff! I only wish I could have discovered it earlier in my life. GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> I have shiny, mostly straight, mostly well behaved hair. That is good right? Not really. When super shiny hair is limp and flat, it has a tendency to look greasy. Unless my hair is cut shoulder length, it has very little movement and moderately low body. If I dare to use a moisturizing conditioner, even if I limit it to my ends, my hair becomes more shiny, and more limp. If I use a volumizing conditioner, my hair gets poofy and dull. I have have tried conditioners galore in an effort to find something that balanced my hair out, including- putting volumizing conditioner on part of my hair and moisturizing conditioner on the other parts. The results? I just felt stupid, because my hair insisted on being full and dull *or* shiny and limp. Not shiny and also bouncy. My hair turned its nose up on that dream of mine. I suppose that I should clarify that I do *not* wash my hair daily because that makes my hair poofy but dull. I wash every alternate day. I do not straighten or curl. I blow dry to dry not style on workdays (weekdays) and air dry on weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a conditioner, I use about a quarter sized amount alone, and work it through my hair.  I don&#x27;t use it on the hair close to my scalp, but will run my hands lightly over the top after working conditioner through my ends. It is *plenty*. Even the instructions encourage you to use a small amount. I don&#x27;t rinse with cold water or anything. I am too lazy and just thinking about cold water in Chicago winters is horrifying. On blow drying, I had shampoo commercial hair. Lush, thick, and intensified shine. These two attributes never co-exist in my hair. Ever. How the heck is this even possible?! It gave me the same \\&quot;bouncy but shiny\\&quot; results consistently- whether I used the clarifying shampoo I use once a month, my regular shampoo, or the tiny bottle of hotel shampoo I had to use once. It remained \\&quot;bouncy but shiny\\&quot; with air-drying as well as blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know when women rave about something as a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; or \\&quot;Holy Grail\\&quot; and you think they are being a little... over the top because I mean...it is just a beauty product? If there was some way of ensuring the friends I have teased over the years for gushing over products couldn&#x27;t use this review against me, I&#x27;d display the excitement of a 12 year old fan in a J.B concert. But, since I can&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll just speak...with relative dignity about how good this was for my hair. But start with the 8 ounce tube first and see it if works for you before springing for the 24ounce one.acle\\&quot; or \\&quot;Holy Grail\\&quot; and you think they are being a little... over the top because I mean...it is just a beauty product?

            <li> And probably a bit better than my usual conditioner. Leaves my hair troublesome hair smooth...but need to wash a bit more often as it leaves it abit oilmen.  Over all -  Like it!</li>
            <li> I love this product and so do my girls! Coloring my hair makes the ends so dry and this product worked miracles!</li>
            <li> I have used this for over a decade at the recommendation of my hair dresser, Chen Levi,  because of having my hair straightened: excellent.</li>
            <li> Simply awesome.. Hair is so soft!!</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, frizzy hair. I absolutely love this stuff, as it makes my hair much more manageable when I get out of the shower. It feels soft, tangle free and smooth!</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for years.  It is by far the best conditioner ever.  Seems to strengthen hair as well as add shine.  It is very pricey, but the results are great!</li>
            <li> Very nice feeling on hair.  Silky and shiney.  It doesn&#x27;t repair the hair long term but it feels nice at every use.</li>
            <li> Thought I would love this stuff, always used Macadamia Treatment but thought could save some money with this. It made my hair coarse, and when I went to salon my stylist wanted to know what I was using because I had a lot of build up in it.</li>
            <li> Nothing special and I don&#x27;t really like the fragrance--sort of earthy, clay-like.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner ever!!!!  I had the Yuko Japanese treatment 9 months ago and this product allows me to blow dry my hair without any additional products or flat iron.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Loves it, my hair looks silky and nice after using it. It also smells delicious! I dye my hair very often and now after using this product it looks healthier and shiny.</li>
            <li> I would not necessarily recommend this for people with flat hair or people who are looking for volume.  It is amazing at getting tangles out - you can literally run your hands through your hair when you are done using.  But it makes hair a little flat.</li>
            <li> The conditioner arrived in a pump bottle rather than the jar/tub pictured here, but actually it makes it easier to use.</li>
            <li> If I had only known how amazing this conditioner was, I probably would&#x27;ve saved hundreds of dollars from professional stylists.  I&#x27;ve used this product since 2002 &amp; I will never consider anything else.  My hair is dry, curly, coarse &amp; highlighted.  Phiten is the BEST!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to write a review from this product for a long time, but this week I finally had to do it. This product is above average quality, wash your hair, towel-dry it and apply the conditioner. I&#x27;ve done Brazilian blowout by myself but that was not the reason I got the product. I wanted nice healthy smooth hair. When my hair was normal it did what I expected, I was using it twice a week and the hair was nice and smooth, but I&#x27;ve done the tragic mistake of trying to go red hair and I used developer twice in a very short period of time, so a lot of my hair fell off and what was left on my head was completely fried. I have curly hair and my hair felt like I had burnt it with a candle ;( so I used this product twice to help bring my hair back to life, but it did not help as I expected. I tried Kerastase Masquintense the next day and \ if Yuko helped my hair 10%, Kerastase helped 40%. So it is perfect for your everyday hair, but when you really need help you can&#x27;t really count on it.</li>
            <li> While this product works really, really well, it inflamed the excema on my face and body. While looking for an ingredient on the ingredient list that might cause a flare-up, the label stated not to use this if you have excema. Wish i had known that before buying.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked so good.  I recently had my hair highlighted and it felt completely dead and brittle.  I used this product for about a month and my hair is completely back to normal.  I think this is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Wife bought this, with the shampoo and hair repair spray. She has tried it for about 2 weeks and LOVES IT!&lt;br /&gt; Her hair is thicker, shinier , stronger and can style easier, she has dumped her Pantine for this line of products.</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST TREATMENT I&#x27;ve found to help heal my over processed, stressed, thin, fine, damaged hair.  A friend told me about it and I&#x27;m on my second jar which lasts about 6 months.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Arrived as described. Thanks! A+++++++++</li>
            <li> Love the conditioner! I really like scent, very subtle. You only need a little bit of it. I accidentally ordered two but after one use thought of keeping both! Yes because it&#x27;s that good. I have long healthy color treated hair which I like to care of. I do try to apply pure coconut oil to my hair at least once a week. And this is my regular conditioner. It keeps it lite and shiny!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. The tub lasts a really long time, even if you&#x27;re using it as your regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have Yuko treated hair and my hair has never been better. I have been Yuko-ing my hair for years, but after using the treatment WITH the shampoo, I have been getting so many more compliments. ANDDDD its cheaper here than on the Yuko website! HOORAHHHH!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for 10 years now and I cannot live without it. It&#x27;s the only one that makes my wavy/frizzy hair smooth and shiny, and I&#x27;m one to buy expensive hair products (like Kerastase and Oribe).  I would pay a lot more for this if I had to, but it&#x27;s a great price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this from my salon for years at a higher price. So happy to find it here.</li>
            <li> LOVED THE WAY HAIR FEELS</li>
