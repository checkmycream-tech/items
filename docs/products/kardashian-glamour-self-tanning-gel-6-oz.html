    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Kardashian Glamour Self Tanning gel is an excellent product!</li>
            <li>This tanner is the best i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>GREAT SERVICE!!!</li>
            <li>it woeks perfectly, has pleasant odor &amp; the result is superb!  </li>
            <li>But the tan looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>beautiful color.  </li>
            <li>looks nothing like what I experienced.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>The color is nothing great either.  </li>
            <li>The color was great</li>
            <li>I was so happy to get this in the mail</li>
            <li>and I thought it would be good because I had read some reviews.</li>
            <li>its gotta be good.</li>
            <li>I THINK IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li>This gel is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>First time i put it on, it smelt wonderful.</li>
            <li>:) Almost like a polaroid!</li>
            <li>, I thought it was going to give me amazing coverage.</li>
            <li>There is no way to even get this stuff on your body effectively....</li>
            <li>The box the tube of gel comes in is very elegant and fancy looking, I love everything about it.</li>
            <li>Best for people without sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using sunless tanners for many years and this one washes away very easily, even from just a rinse.  </li>
            <li>It does smell nice, its not sticky, and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy the 3pack.</li>
            <li>I love, love how it applies on skin.</li>
            <li>I should have known better but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched over to using Nature&#x27;s Gate Glow Lotion and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I recieved this product and couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many self tanners before that always result in blotchy streaks but this one does not seem to do so.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get it again.  </li>
            <li>but it is bearable considering the results are beautiful and natural</li>
            <li>I am waiting for a special occasion to use the tanning gel, but as far as shipping and service goes it was great.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product and service.</li>
            <li>I have light olive skin that looks great with self-tanning, but this gel was a little orange.  </li>
            <li>so quickly-</li>
            <li>i ordered the kardashian self tanning lotion with high hopes, because they always are tan and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>It left my skin a beautiful naturally bronzed beauty Brown</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was exactly what I wanted and leaves a beautiful and very natural tan in the next 24 hrs as it develops on your skin.</li>
            <li>it was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I rarely have this problem with self tanners, as I have been using them for about 5 years but this one gave me welts and a rash.</li>
            <li>I received the same product as a gift several years ago and LOVED IT!</li>
            <li>this doesn’t feel right</li>
            <li>It leaked out of the bottle and flew everywhere, runs right through your fingers.</li>
            <li>Maybe Kim got the idea to make this runny product right after she was done filming her sex tape because that is the feeling this goo is comparable to.</li>
            <li>I just used for the first time I thought this would be a gel what came out was more a clear oil type of consistency.</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s clear, but very upset about the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li>It was also pretty sticky even an hour or two after I applied it.</li>
            <li>went on and absorbed fast.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>It smells funny to.</li>
            <li>but it was pure liquid.</li>
            <li>If you have made the mistake of buying this item--try to apply it to the area directly and do not put it on your hands first because it is so runny it will just slip right through.</li>
            <li>very dissappointed.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t streak too much.</li>
            <li>This worked very well.</li>
            <li>I guess you need to use the whole tube to see a difference.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very runny,</li>
            <li>It was straight oil.</li>
            <li>as it is branded with the high price-tag Kardashian name.  </li>
            <li>very self tanner scented and as far as the consistency-</li>
            <li>This is the most watery, sticky goo tanner I have ever wasted money on.</li>
            <li>It is very sticky after you put it on and does not dry fast at all and will leave you with a sticky goo residue feeling.</li>
            <li>They may carry $50,000 handbags but they sell cheap, foreign made products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would definitely by this again!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I was excited to use it, so i don’t what it said on the tin and took a shower, exfoliated my full body with an oil free exfoliator, towel dried my skin and added a small amount of moisturising lotion to dry areas like knees and elbows.</li>
            <li>leaves skin soft and sun kissed.</li>
            <li>I found some of this stuff at a discount store near me</li>
            <li>I have been using self tanner since I was about fourteen yrs old.</li>
            <li>Ive used this three times so far</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m going back to buy a few more to stock up.</li>
            <li>As one reviewer noted, you will need to reapply every other evening because the color fades but for $3, just stock up on the product, its well worth it.</li>
            <li>At first, I couldn&#x27;t smell the self-tanner smell like most other tanners, but it would eventually show up a few hours later.</li>
            <li>Smell is great but isn&#x27;t bad although it does leave you with that self tanner smell for days to follow.</li>
            <li>Thinking I purchased a defective product; I went so far as to purchase a 2nd tube.  </li>
            <li>I thought it may have been spoiled or expired or something, but apparently this is the consistency it is supposed to be.  </li>
            <li>, you just need to be careful when you first open product.</li>
            <li>This was either a bootleg refilled with something else or the formulation just got ruined, but the 1st time I bought this in store I loved it, worked great, so I order here &amp; its a terrible product that does not work.</li>
            <li>Even $3 was too much to spend on this mess.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Even $3 was too much to spend on this mess.  </li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t go on so thick (I tried it by itself the first time</li>
            <li> Once spraying my entire body I realised quickly that there was something wrong, there was no colour guide to the tan, there was no smell and there was no stickiness, I shrugged it off thinking maybe that was one of the perks to the tan (instant drying)</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> excuse my language</li>
            <li> I could not smell it, (Other tans you can smell before you even open the curtains, this one had nothing) and as suspected there was no coverage</li>
            <li> The only con on this product, the color does not stay long if you do not apply it every other day or two, and it will loose color all at once faster than a fade.</li>
            <li> I was able to achieve a faint color on certain, random body</li>
            <li> a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> Then after putting very loose clothing on and going to bed hoping it would develop over the next few hours, I woke up the next morning and knew the tan had not worked out!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the wateriness of the product it made a big mess.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if it has been sitting too long or what, but it went everywhere other than my body.</li>
            <li> I checked the reviews on here and am seeing similar experiences so that confirms that my experience was not unique.  </li>
            <li> TOTAL WASTE OF</li>
            <li> Does not get you super dark which i like because i dont want it to appear too fake.</li>
            <li> I had the exact same results: product POURED out like water, no color, awful smell, and left orange blotches on particular areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A total waste !</li>
            <li> Like other tanners I use it at night because it has a slight tanner smell.   </li>
            <li> It was real watery which made it difficult to apply, and it did not give me any color.</li>
            <li> But like other people have said, it&#x27;s nothing but watery mess.</li>
            <li> AND WHEN I GOT IT  WAS ALL WATERED DOWN ..</li>
            <li> however I do have Olive skin so not sure if it will turn Orange on other skin tones.</li>
            <li> So a lot of the product was wasted.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and I wasted about a 1/4 of the container with it spilling all over the floor.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a few days and it gave me no color at all.</li>
            <li> but after a few mins I thought &#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> HAD TROUBLE WITH IS ..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor, don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this.</li>
            <li> , it just dried and flaked off.  </li>
            <li> I am not going to be purchasing it again because of the long dry time and because it is a little too expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> It was an liquid, it didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;m still pale.</li>
            <li> The product had very little odor.  </li>
            <li> the information portion of the ad i read didn&#x27;t mention this small detail.  </li>
            <li> Love the color but smells horrible.</li>
            <li> and I took it out of the box anxious to get tanned, but</li>
            <li> the bad new.</li>
            <li> Comes out like olive oil which makes it REALLY hard to apply.</li>
            <li> i at least thought i would have some type of glow to my skin,  but nothing at all.</li>
            <li> it was such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> but it was too thick).</li>
            <li> The few areas that did color were orange leaving the other areas blotchy- appearing almost diseased as you see in Vitiligo.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!!</li>
            <li> Not good to waterery</li>
            <li> It smells horrible and created zero color after the first day.  </li>
            <li> glamor associated with the Kardashian name will rapidly deteriorate if they continue to nourish their empire by selling cheaply-made, poor quality products.</li>
            <li> The company did issue me a refund for the poor product</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the Kardashian&#x27;s put thier name on such crap.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try this product sorry The Kardashian Family not good at all.</li>
            <li> wrong.</li>
            <li> , maybe ill do another layer&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> so it was difficult to put on.  </li>
            <li> Did nothing to my skin color, smelled weird, watery consistency</li>
            <li> I did this for two weeks, and I was still unable to see any diffence in the color of my chest or belly in comparison to my sun tanned, sun exposed arms.  </li>
            <li> and I hate how pale I am.</li>
            <li> Very poor product  .</li>
            <li> so £18  down the pan on CRAP CRAP tan that I cant</li>
            <li> -Disappointing because I&#x27;m not a K-family/clan hater.  </li>
            <li> It will cost me the $3 in gas to return it to the store, so I&#x27;ll just chalk this up as a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> it was water consistency too watery to apply and smelled bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was defective or&lt;br /&gt;old, but it was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> But, it didn&#x27;t streak and the smell wasn&#x27;t the worst I have smelled.</li>
            <li> Dreadful.  </li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> This stuff was horrible!</li>
            <li> This is the worst self tanner that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The consistency is awful, it poured out as a liquid.  </li>
            <li> This smelled terrible and it didn&#x27;t even give me any color.</li>
            <li> Worst tanning product ever.</li>
            <li> but this was crap!  </li>
            <li> The smell is the worst....</li>

            <li> I did not like this product. It was real watery which made it difficult to apply, and it did not give me any color.</li>
            <li> This is suppose to be a \\&quot;gel\\&quot;.  It literally POURED out of the tube.  It smells horrible and created zero color after the first day.  I did not want to give up on the quality of the product so quickly- as it is branded with the high price-tag Kardashian name.  I tried this &#x27;self-tanner&#x27; over multiple days.  I was able to achieve a faint color on certain, random body parts- but not all. The few areas that did color were orange leaving the other areas blotchy- appearing almost diseased as you see in Vitiligo.  Yes, I properly exfoliated (and have been using self-tanners for over 20 years).  The tan the Kardashians appear to have on television looks nothing like what I experienced.  Thinking I purchased a defective product; I went so far as to purchase a 2nd tube.  I had the exact same results: product POURED out like water, no color, awful smell, and left orange blotches on particular areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen various Kardashian products in clearance bins over the year, now I understand why.  They obviously will put their name on anything for a $, regardless of the quality. -Disappointing because I&#x27;m not a K-family/clan hater.  They may carry $50,000 handbags but they sell cheap, foreign made products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glamor associated with the Kardashian name will rapidly deteriorate if they continue to nourish their empire by selling cheaply-made, poor quality products.</li>
            <li> Tan took about two days to develop. I am happy with the results. I didn&#x27;t like the wateriness of the product it made a big mess. So a lot of the product was wasted. Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product. I bought the item for 3 dollars at big lots it was well worth the money. i&#x27;m going back to buy a few more to stock up.</li>
            <li> Kardashian Glamour Self Tanning gel is an excellent product! it woeks perfectly, has pleasant odor &amp; the result is superb!  I hightly reccomend it for anyone!</li>
            <li> Comes out like olive oil which makes it REALLY hard to apply.</li>
            <li> the product is too watery.  after useing it for several days i still dont see any tan.  very dissappointed. i at least thought i would have some type of glow to my skin,  but nothing at all. Boo hoo</li>
            <li> I have been using sunless tanners for many years and this one washes away very easily, even from just a rinse.  The color is nothing great either.  I have light olive skin that looks great with self-tanning, but this gel was a little orange.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy the 3pack.</li>
            <li> This tanner is the best i&#x27;ve ever used. no orange, non oily and no streaks. Like other tanners I use it at night because it has a slight tanner smell.   leaves skin soft and sun kissed.</li>
            <li> This gel is pretty awesome. It didn&#x27;t streak too much. I used it by adding it to my usually daily lotion so it didn&#x27;t go on so thick (I tried it by itself the first time but it was too thick). This worked very well. At first, I couldn&#x27;t smell the self-tanner smell like most other tanners, but it would eventually show up a few hours later. It was also pretty sticky even an hour or two after I applied it. But, it didn&#x27;t streak and the smell wasn&#x27;t the worst I have smelled. I am not going to be purchasing it again because of the long dry time and because it is a little too expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> i ordered the kardashian self tanning lotion with high hopes, because they always are tan and healthy looking. i&#x27;m not a fan of them, but thought they would let their name be put only on a quality product.  outcome?  still not a fan, because wwhile the lotion initially gives an acceptable level of color, bathing or showering washes it away.  the information portion of the ad i read didn&#x27;t mention this small detail.  and when i contacted the seller, i was sort of blown off, and \\&quot;oh well\\&quot;ed about it.  i guess since my email, the seller claims to have added that minute detail.  i don&#x27;t know. i haven&#x27;t been back.  and don&#x27;t plan to.</li>
            <li> I found some of this stuff at a discount store near me and I thought it would be good because I had read some reviews. But like other people have said, it&#x27;s nothing but watery mess. I still tried to rub it on but no color appeared. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have been using self tanner since I was about fourteen yrs old. I am now 22. So by now i should be a pro??? wrong. I havent tanned since 07/11 in a tanning bed and I hate how pale I am. I orderd this product because its something a superstar is selling under her name its gotta be good. First time i put it on, it smelt wonderful. went on and absorbed fast. And within two hours i saw tan apearing. And throughout the day i tinted darker. The only con on this product, the color does not stay long if you do not apply it every other day or two, and it will loose color all at once faster than a fade. But the tan looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  I love, love how it applies on skin. beautiful color.  I was waiting to come cross a product like this.  I am staying with it.  No plans to change.</li>
            <li> Ive used this three times so far and I have noticed no difference. I guess you need to use the whole tube to see a difference. It smells funny to.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY! This was a complete waste of money.  This was not tanning lotion but rather oil and water mixed together! When I opened the bottle all the contents came gushing out.</li>
            <li> Dreadful.  I bought this on sale today at Big Lots for $3.  I should have known better but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It is in NO WAY a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; whatsoever.  It&#x27;s basically like pouring water into your hand and I wasted about a 1/4 of the container with it spilling all over the floor.  There is no way to even get this stuff on your body effectively....it&#x27;s oily water and smells like chemicals.  I checked the reviews on here and am seeing similar experiences so that confirms that my experience was not unique.  I thought it may have been spoiled or expired or something, but apparently this is the consistency it is supposed to be.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Even $3 was too much to spend on this mess.  It will cost me the $3 in gas to return it to the store, so I&#x27;ll just chalk this up as a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> Terrible. It was not a gel it was water consistency too watery to apply and smelled bad. The company did issue me a refund for the poor product</li>
            <li> Love the color but smells horrible.</li>
            <li> This stuff was horrible! I used it for a few days and it gave me no color at all. This is the worst self tanner that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I Bought the Kardashian Glamour SPRAY tan. Not only did it cost £18 and take 2 weeks to come to me, it does not give any colour what’s so ever!&lt;br /&gt;As soon I as I got it in the post I was excited to use it, so i don’t what it said on the tin and took a shower, exfoliated my full body with an oil free exfoliator, towel dried my skin and added a small amount of moisturising lotion to dry areas like knees and elbows. As this tan was £18 and a 360 degrees aerosol can, I thought it was going to give me amazing coverage. Once spraying my entire body I realised quickly that there was something wrong, there was no colour guide to the tan, there was no smell and there was no stickiness, I shrugged it off thinking maybe that was one of the perks to the tan (instant drying) but after a few mins I thought &#x27;&#x27;this doesn’t feel right, maybe ill do another layer&#x27;&#x27; Again this felt the same, it was just like spraying water on your skin. Then after putting very loose clothing on and going to bed hoping it would develop over the next few hours, I woke up the next morning and knew the tan had not worked out! I could not smell it, (Other tans you can smell before you even open the curtains, this one had nothing) and as suspected there was no coverage AT ALL!! There was no difference to my skin, I checked my tan line (where my pants where) and NOTHING!!!! so £18  down the pan on CRAP CRAP tan that I cant</li>
            <li> HAD TROUBLE WITH IS ..ONLY BECAUSE IT WAS SHIPPED TO HI AND WHEN I GOT IT  WAS ALL WATERED DOWN ..I THINK IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT BUT NOT TO SHIP</li>
            <li> This made me breakout. I rarely have this problem with self tanners, as I have been using them for about 5 years but this one gave me welts and a rash. It also made me itch constantly. The color was great and I love that it&#x27;s clear, but very upset about the condition of my skin. Best for people without sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very poor product  . Not good to waterery</li>
            <li> oily,greasy and gave no color. I can&#x27;t believe the Kardashian&#x27;s put thier name on such crap. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money</li>
            <li> The product arrived sealed and on time.  The consistency is awful, it poured out as a liquid.  The product had very little odor.  I did not notice any change of color on my skin after two days of applications.  I would not recommend or purchase this product.</li>
            <li> This smelled terrible and it didn&#x27;t even give me any color. I&#x27;ve switched over to using Nature&#x27;s Gate Glow Lotion and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a month ago at Big Lots as its being discontinued, I paid $3 vs $35. It left my skin a beautiful naturally bronzed beauty Brown however I do have Olive skin so not sure if it will turn Orange on other skin tones. I do not like the smell whatsoever- very self tanner scented and as far as the consistency- it&#x27;s very runny,water&#x27;y and liquid&#x27;y but it is bearable considering the results are beautiful and natural, you just need to be careful when you first open product. I found if you shake the tube, the gel will temporarily thicken a bit. As one reviewer noted, you will need to reapply every other evening because the color fades but for $3, just stock up on the product, its well worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this at outside of amazon for $5. I thought, why not? I&#x27;ll give it a try and hoped I wouldn&#x27;t turn a unnatural color. Well, as soon as I pulled the product out of the box I could tell it was to watery. The word &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; does not imply to this AT ALL! It was straight oil. I still gave it a try and it smelled like nail polish remover when I poured it in my hands but turned into a more weird tan smell as I rubbed it in. In the end, it did nothing. No color change at all. Worst tanning product ever. Do yourself a favor, don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this. It&#x27;s obvious the Kardashians are as un-talented in making self tanners as they are as celebrity&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product and couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;It was exactly what I wanted and leaves a beautiful and very natural tan in the next 24 hrs as it develops on your skin. :) Almost like a polaroid! Fabulous product and service. One of my tanners was damaged, I contacted Customer Serviceand they assured me they are sending a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely by this again!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many self tanners before that always result in blotchy streaks but this one does not seem to do so. Smell is great but isn&#x27;t bad although it does leave you with that self tanner smell for days to follow. Does not get you super dark which i like because i dont want it to appear too fake.</li>
            <li> The consistency was like water so it was difficult to put on.  Absolutely&lt;br /&gt;no change in skin tone, it just dried and flaked off.  I don&#x27;t know if it was defective or&lt;br /&gt;old, but it was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Kardashian Glamour Tan-Self Tanning Gel &amp; it was such a disappointment. It says it&#x27;s a Gel but it was pure liquid. It was the consistency of water with some oil in it. A total waste ! Not the product advertised. I want my money back !![[ASIN:B003N1YRWA Kardashian Glamour Self Tanning Gel 6 oz]]</li>
            <li> I received the same product as a gift several years ago and LOVED IT! I was very excited to get it again.  It arrived at my house and I took it out of the box anxious to get tanned, but that didn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liquid can rushing out. It is supposed to be a gel, not water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it has been sitting too long or what, but it went everywhere other than my body.</li>
            <li> Not a fan! This is the most watery, sticky goo tanner I have ever wasted money on. I got it for $3 bucks and now it makes sense why it was discounted and they are practically trying to give it away. It leaked out of the bottle and flew everywhere, runs right through your fingers. If you have made the mistake of buying this item--try to apply it to the area directly and do not put it on your hands first because it is so runny it will just slip right through. It is very sticky after you put it on and does not dry fast at all and will leave you with a sticky goo residue feeling. Maybe Kim got the idea to make this runny product right after she was done filming her sex tape because that is the feeling this goo is comparable to.</li>
            <li> I am waiting for a special occasion to use the tanning gel, but as far as shipping and service goes it was great. I got this product close to week BEFORE its estimated delivery. The box the tube of gel comes in is very elegant and fancy looking, I love everything about it. I can&#x27;t wait to use this! GREAT SERVICE!!!</li>
            <li> I just used for the first time I thought this would be a gel what came out was more a clear oil type of consistency. I have yet to see if it will brown my legs I am waiting on that</li>
            <li> excuse my language but this was crap!  a complete waste of money! it was all watery and could not even apply</li>
            <li> I was so happy to get this in the mail but when I received it, it wasn&#x27;t an gel. It was an liquid, it didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;m still pale. Don&#x27;t try this product sorry The Kardashian Family not good at all. The smell is the worst....💔</li>
            <li> This was either a bootleg refilled with something else or the formulation just got ruined, but the 1st time I bought this in store I loved it, worked great, so I order here &amp; its a terrible product that does not work.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Gordman&#x27;s for like $5 so I guess this is a lesson. Did nothing to my skin color, smelled weird, watery consistency so it would get all over the ground, just all around a horrible product. What the heck Kardashians!?</li>
            <li> This was literally like vinegar smelling water! Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!! As soon as I opened the seal, it became water!</li>
            <li> It does smell nice, its not sticky, and easy to apply., NOw the bad new. I could not see where this made my skin change at all.  I showered, and applied this liquid.  got dressed for the day.  I did this for two weeks, and I was still unable to see any diffence in the color of my chest or belly in comparison to my sun tanned, sun exposed arms.  I still look like I have a farmers tan.  Now what?  I would not recommend this product,</li>
