            <li>/&gt;Although she loved the functionality of a wallet case my wife has returned to a stronger stand alone case as most wallet cases don&#x27;t seem to advertise phone protection and we didn&#x27;t want to take that chance.</li>

            <li>Love it use all the time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to carry a purse any more when I&#x27;m out and about running errands or going shopping or for anything</li>

            <li>As soon as I placed my drivers license and credit card inside the slots to the right of my phone the inside seams split open...doesn&#x27;t appear the sewing of that seam was done very well.</li>
            <li>The case is really fancy looking</li>
            <li>I like it, nothing&#x27;s broken and its a pretty good price.</li>
            <li>To me the protection offered by the case is one of the most important features and this product failed miserably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Great deal! Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Fell apart immediately, before I could even put my phone in it. I had to superglue it back together.</li>
            <li> Beautiful!!! I love it!!</li>
            <li> I love this one it fix my phone</li>
            <li> The case came in on the designated dates. The case is really fancy looking and I&#x27;ve had people tell me that it&#x27;s really nice. I like it, nothing&#x27;s broken and its a pretty good price. My cards fit the slots and the bills fit inside as well.</li>
            <li> Practical and great. I use it daily</li>
            <li> Love it use all the time. I don&#x27;t have to carry a purse any more when I&#x27;m out and about running errands or going shopping or for anything or anywhere I&#x27;m not dressing up. Everything I need in one place. The most important thing is very durable and I still have my gleam. I&#x27;ve had others that were not very durable. The greatest.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd wallet I purchased like this. The 1st one was great! The 2nd one started falling apart in the third day :-(</li>
            <li> My wife bought this case for her iPhone because it is a great price and very fashionable. It works great in fact, the phone fit securely and the wallet fit her most important cards comfortably. This is why I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars besides what happened below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be brief: this case does not protect well. We have a toddler who dropped the phone from about and a half feet which is a rather short distance. To our surprise on opening the phone case we were welcomed to a shattered screen. To me the protection offered by the case is one of the most important features and this product failed miserably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although she loved the functionality of a wallet case my wife has returned to a stronger stand alone case as most wallet cases don&#x27;t seem to advertise phone protection and we didn&#x27;t want to take that chance. If this isn&#x27;t important to you or you don&#x27;t have kids this could be a great case.</li>
            <li> Good item perfect fir my wife</li>
            <li> Absolutely love! Shipped faster than what was quoted!!</li>
            <li> It was the wrong size</li>

            <li> I love this case . Fits perfect . Great buy.</li>
            <li> Love it! I get a lot of compliments on it. Several people asked me where I got it. And of course I tell them!!</li>
