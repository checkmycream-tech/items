            <li> They&#x27;re not too fancy that you can&#x27;t use them everyday, but fancy enough to dress yourself up!</li>
            <li> I was also extremely upset to see a sticker on the box that says suggested retail is $48.00.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH THE MONEY</li>
            <li> Even if you used this everyday it would take you awhile to finish all the bottles.</li>
            <li> I know there small</li>
            <li> then the small test sizes.</li>

            <li> Perfect Christmas gift for teenagers who get tired of one scent quickly. Price was better than anything in the stores</li>
            <li> Great sampler if you want to try before you buy a big bottle. Be careful, they don&#x27;t spray. You have to use the old &amp;#34;finger over the top, turn upside down&amp;#34; trick.</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING.. I love that I could buy all 4 and not pay 180.00 a bottle. I know there small but they are perfect. I love them all. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> LOVE me some Coach perfume! This is a great sampler set, makes for a great gift for someone who has everything!</li>
            <li> I love this set! All of them are great scents. It is nice to have the classic scents with the newer scents. The only thing I dont love is the tiny bottles and the fact that they do not spray. It is very easy to spill these while opening.</li>
            <li> smells nice and I think every guy should buy this package for their wife and they will have a great Christmas like me.</li>
            <li> This item was shipped to me in a timely manner, the problem came when I opened the plastic USPS bag it came in to see a dented, abused gift set. All the perfumes were fine but the box didn&#x27;t look presentable. I was also extremely upset to see a sticker on the box that says suggested retail is $48.00. I paid $20.00 over suggested retail and then another $5.00 for shipping. I feel I got completely ripped off by this seller. But I guess I&#x27;m stupid one for buying it.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a good product if you know what you are buying. NOTE: the bottles inside the package are not very big but they are larger then the small test sizes. Even if you used this everyday it would take you awhile to finish all the bottles. They all smell really good. Perfect gift for a girlfriend or wife.</li>
            <li> Great gift for my mother she loves coach perfume and just the right size for her to use and have a selection. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Very nice for a little gift. Wish the bottles of perfume were a little larger. Gift to the wife and she loves it, she loves coach.</li>
            <li> The fragrances are amazing!! This is my first coach fragrance experience and I am totally SOLD!! Coach took their time and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter. The sizes are small but they are great for try on this way you are not investing a lot of money in a scent that you may not like.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my daughter for last minute Christmas gift.  Very prompt delivery, the item was as described and she loved it.  I would order from them again.</li>
            <li> Great gift get, able to use a different fragrance for different occasions. Some to set others in the right mood.</li>
            <li> I got this on sale before xmas and was so happy I did. Each one has it&#x27;s own unique sweet smelling scent. All scents last for hours and hours. Everyone always tells me how good I smell. Def worth getting.</li>
            <li> She loved it I did not see it.  I love to be able to send gifs and not have to shop.</li>
            <li> The smell are all great and it came in just a couple of days. However, the price tag was left on the box and it said it was sell at $38.95. NOT WORTH THE MONEY</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The size of each bottle is larger than what the picture shows. The pricing is great for this item.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these gift sets for holiday gift giving. The products are miniature but offer a great variety of scents.  Scents in package are fresh and modern.  The bottles are not spray but with an open top for dabbing on skin.  Delivery was quick and in perfect condition.  Highly recommend for travel or if you enjoy variety with a pretty presentation of bottles.</li>
            <li> I bought this to sample the Coach collection and was primarily trying to see which of the Poppy lines would be best on me. I ended up loving each fragrance and the bottles are not only adorable, but they hold quite a bit of product. This set will last we a while!</li>
            <li> I love the mix of perfumes in here and they all smell amazing! They&#x27;re not too fancy that you can&#x27;t use them everyday, but fancy enough to dress yourself up!</li>
