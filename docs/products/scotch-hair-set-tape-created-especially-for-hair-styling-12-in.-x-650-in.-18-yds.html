            <li>AWESOME</li>
            <li>I was very happy to see that I could use it again, but.....  </li>
            <li>This is the BEST and withstands blow dryers with a diffuser</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product before from you and always found the product as advertised, and the service excellent.  </li>

            <li>It appears to be hypo-allergenic and makes a great bandage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great instead of Scotch Tape and you can write on it.</li>
            <li>A great product.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t know what most people use the tape for, but I use it for needlepoint.  </li>

            <li>and I found my tape in a drawer but needed to buy more.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair tape.  </li>
            <li>Hair dressers (buticians) would rather have you come in more often then to tell you that hair tape holds your hair over night, even if you are like me, a tossy turny sleeper.  </li>
            <li>WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET</li>
            <li>Try it, you will love it.</li>

            <li>I have been using it for YEARS and love it.  </li>

            <li>i&#x27;m so glad i was able to find this tape.</li>
            <li>I have been a fan of this hair set tape for many years.  </li>
            <li>I will be using it for many more years.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue, it&#x27;s easy to use and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li>Sticks to zippers and fabric, yet easily removed when project is done.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this tape since I was a teenager in the 1970s because I have a strong cowlick in front</li>
            <li>it works brilliantly at keeping bangs in place whilst they dry.</li>
            <li>It is great for holding hair in place while it dries, especially if you have an area that just doesn&#x27;t want to stay where you put it.</li>
            <li>and I liked it so much that I wanted to keep purchasing it.</li>
            <li>Of course, I know I will need to continue keeping the tape on it over night, but man is it worth it!    </li>
            <li>I am in shock right now!  </li>
            <li>Easy to remind you when you first prepared or opened any food item.</li>
            <li>I had a couple of rolls from years ago and they didn&#x27;t lose their mild adhesive.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with my purchase and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>Excellent for taping down a wild cowlick.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>The pink hair tape, which I&#x27;ve been using for decades, is not as good as it used to be.  </li>
            <li>So glad to find a place to buy it as our local store stopped having it available.  </li>
            <li>When I would look in the mirror, it was the first thing I noticed.    </li>
            <li>There are many uses for this tape - only one of which is hair placement and anchoring.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t put face cream on first.</li>
            <li>it arrived promptly, &amp; was exactly what i ordered.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for stocking it for us.</li>
            <li>This tape works very well.</li>
            <li>Has woman&#x27;s hair changed so much that they no longer care about \\&quot;fly-away\\&quot; hair?  </li>
            <li>and I have to tell you that Scotch brand is easily 10x better than the other pink tape out there for consumers.</li>
            <li>It also prevents the moustache hair from becoming unruly due to the CPAP face mask sliding around during the night and rumpling the moustache hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay if the humidity is high.</li>
            <li>I simply tore off a piece that was a little longer than the wrinkle, and laid it right on top.  </li>
            <li>Great product, but price is ridiculous!!  </li>
            <li>Last night was the first time I used it, and I am amazed.  </li>
            <li>I first used this tape awhile back</li>
            <li>A dab of gel, and a little bit of tape control it fine.  </li>
            <li>I am 39 years old and have had a vertical wrinkle between my eyes since I was 32.  </li>
            <li>This item was just like in the old days.</li>
            <li>The wrinkle is barely visible now.  </li>
            <li>The news is good and bad.  </li>

            <li> And it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed, but still glad I found it to try again!</li>
            <li> when I blow dry.</li>
            <li> , it comes double half the time.  </li>
            <li> Next morning, frown lines are less deep and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s so thin yet strong, you hardly notice you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> My only negative is that it rips the hair if you&#x27;re not very careful taking it out.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find  the Scotch Pink Hair Tape  to be as sticky  </li>
            <li> I prefer that my hair curls toward my face in the front, so I wet my hair a bit, and tape it in a curl towards my face.  </li>
            <li> However, I discovered that it has a lot of other uses.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly, and because I have a million cow licks, it goes every which way.  </li>
            <li> and my bangs don&#x27;t stay down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it to hold down unruly eyebrows during the night.</li>
            <li> I always have little wisps of hair that need taped down while my hair is drying.  </li>
            <li> Those damn curls on the side of my head won&#x27;t stay down unless I put this tape on while I am driving to work!  </li>
            <li> Years ago I used this in lieu of bobby pins to fix damp hair in place as it dried.  </li>
            <li> as  it was a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to tape away my frown wrinkles, but they seemed even worse the next morning.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want the stiff frownies, but maybe that&#x27;s what makes them work</li>
            <li> I was wary of trying this hair set tape, fearing it would cause loss of individual strands of hair upon removal and might not adhere to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Humidity is hard on any hairstyle.</li>
            <li> Why is it so hard to get?  </li>
            <li> Why is this tape so hard to get?  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen it in grocery or drug stores for at least a dozen years.  </li>
            <li> I seriously thought about Botox, but</li>
            <li> I know, weird, but it works.</li>
            <li> It sometimes tears when unreeling and, worst</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product works well for men with moustaches who need to use a CPAP machine for breathing at night.  The tape placed over the moustache and onto the face produces a smoother seal than if it is not used.  It also prevents the moustache hair from becoming unruly due to the CPAP face mask sliding around during the night and rumpling the moustache hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what most people use the tape for, but I use it for needlepoint.  It is wonderful for keeping threads out of the way when you are working on another part of your project.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue, it&#x27;s easy to use and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I am in shock right now!  I am 39 years old and have had a vertical wrinkle between my eyes since I was 32.  I used all kinds of wrinkle creams, but it kept getting deeper and longer.  When I would look in the mirror, it was the first thing I noticed.    I seriously thought about Botox, but then I read somewhere that you can use hair setting tape on your wrinkles over night when you sleep.  Last night was the first time I used it, and I am amazed.  I simply tore off a piece that was a little longer than the wrinkle, and laid it right on top.  It didn&#x27;t bother me at all.    The wrinkle is barely visible now.  Of course, I know I will need to continue keeping the tape on it over night, but man is it worth it!    I&#x27;m guessing since I sleep on my side, that my face \\&quot;squishes\\&quot; when I sleep causing the vertical wrinkle.  The tape probably works by keeping my skin in place while I&#x27;m sleeping.    AWESOME</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I looked on Amazon for Scotch Hair Tape!  I haven&#x27;t seen it in grocery or drug stores for at least a dozen years.  This works wonders for sewing in zippers!  Sticks to zippers and fabric, yet easily removed when project is done.  Also, works great to mark leftovers with a date when you store them in plastic ware. Easy to remind you when you first prepared or opened any food item. Doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue- just be sure to remove tape before putting item in the dishwasher.</li>
            <li> Years ago I used this in lieu of bobby pins to fix damp hair in place as it dried.  I was very happy to see that I could use it again, but.....  It doesn&#x27;t hold as well this time around. I wind up with it on the pillow and not on my hair as often as not.  I am disappointed, but still glad I found it to try again!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandmother because she couldn&#x27;t find it anymore where she lives. But I guess she likes it and it works for her.</li>
            <li> The pink hair tape, which I&#x27;ve been using for decades, is not as good as it used to be.  It sometimes tears when unreeling and, worst, it comes double half the time.  However, I need it so I put up with it.  A Klemme, Basking Ridge, NJ</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair set tape for years and years.  I always have little wisps of hair that need taped down while my hair is drying.  My hair is curly, and because I have a million cow licks, it goes every which way.  A dab of gel, and a little bit of tape control it fine.  Once in a while, when it&#x27;s real humid outside, I use it to plaster my bangs down while they dry.  I can&#x27;t find the stuff in stores anywhere, so I&#x27;m glad I found a site on Amazon to order it from, because I intend to use this stuff forever.</li>
            <li> MY GRANDMA CAN&#x27;T FIND THIS ANYWHERE , WALGREEN&#x27;S QUIT ORDERING IT . SHE IS VERY PLEASED WITH TAPE , NOW SHE DOESN&#x27;T HAVE TO USE REGULAR TAPE.</li>
            <li> I love this tape--enough to pay postage to have it sent to me by mail.  It helps me control the shape of my hair--especially around the face--  when I blow dry. I have been using it for years and will perish if they  ever stop making it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find  the Scotch Pink Hair Tape  to be as sticky  as  it was a few years ago. Wonder if they are using a different formula?</li>
            <li> Works great for holding your hair in place while sleeping.  Not too sticky so can pull off without pulling out hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tape since I was a teenager in the 1970s because I have a strong cowlick in front and my bangs don&#x27;t stay down.  I grew out my bangs for about 15 years but just cut them again and I found my tape in a drawer but needed to buy more.  This is the BEST and withstands blow dryers with a diffuser and I can sleep with my bangs taped as well.  Thanks Amazon for stocking it for us.</li>
            <li> This tape works very well. I had looked for it all over the place and couldn&#x27;t find it. It is great for holding hair in place while it dries, especially if you have an area that just doesn&#x27;t want to stay where you put it. The tape holds it while it dries and it then stays put. It doesn&#x27;t stay if the humidity is high. Humidity is hard on any hairstyle.</li>
            <li> There are many uses for this tape - only one of which is hair placement and anchoring. I am in the beauty business and I have to tell you that Scotch brand is easily 10x better than the other pink tape out there for consumers. Another way to use Hair Set Tape is to discourage frown lines! After using an astringent tape up and back away from the frown lines. Think Spock eyebrows. Overnight, your muscles are discouraged from coming together over your nose bridge. Next morning, frown lines are less deep and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Great product, but price is ridiculous!!  $15 + dollars for 1 roll of tape!! Not acceptable!</li>
            <li> I love this hair tape.  Why is it so hard to get?  It was in every drug store, dime store and convenience store in the 50&#x27;s.  It was also inexpensive.  Has woman&#x27;s hair changed so much that they no longer care about \\&quot;fly-away\\&quot; hair?  Let me think.  Oh, yes.  Hair dressers (buticians) would rather have you come in more often then to tell you that hair tape holds your hair over night, even if you are like me, a tossy turny sleeper.  Get this tape.  Fashion your hair the way you would like it to look in the morning, then tape it in place.  It only takes a little.  I tape a piece (a strip) across my bangs, another across the back of my head above my neck, and another on either side of my face.  I prefer that my hair curls toward my face in the front, so I wet my hair a bit, and tape it in a curl towards my face.  So  WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET \\&quot;HAIR TAPE\\&quot; BACK ON THE STORE SHELVES.  (I hope.)  Try it, you will love it.</li>
            <li> glad that I found some hair tape.  It can&#x27;t be found in stores.  My only negative is that it rips the hair if you&#x27;re not very careful taking it out.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before from you and always found the product as advertised, and the service excellent.  This time was no exception.  I shall continue to buy in the future.</li>
            <li> Gosh, I remember this from back in the day. Good for holding those &amp;#34;spit curls&amp;#34; through the night so I&#x27;m told. I&#x27;m using it to hold down unruly eyebrows during the night. I know, weird, but it works. Just don&#x27;t put face cream on first. ;o)</li>
            <li> It is just as good as I remember from years ago. Will order it again and recommend to others also.</li>
            <li> Why is this tape so hard to get?  I have been using it for YEARS and love it.  Those damn curls on the side of my head won&#x27;t stay down unless I put this tape on while I am driving to work!  Love this tape.</li>
            <li> I was wary of trying this hair set tape, fearing it would cause loss of individual strands of hair upon removal and might not adhere to my skin.  The news is good and bad.  The tape adheres to my skin most of the time though there is one moisturizer that renders it completely useless.  And, while I do lose one or two strands of hair each time I remove the tape, it does serve the purpose of creating a curve in the shorter hair at my cheekbones which I could not achieve otherwise.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve used this tape mostly for my hair. However, I discovered that it has a lot of other uses. When I couldn&#x27;t find it any more in a store, I ordered it on line. It appears to be hypo-allergenic and makes a great bandage. Because it&#x27;s so thin yet strong, you hardly notice you&#x27;re using it. It&#x27;s also quite waterproof so it doesn&#x27;t come off until you want to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrap it around a sore toe or finger from a paper cut to protect it. It&#x27;s great instead of Scotch Tape and you can write on it. There are literally hundreds of things you could cuse it for. And it lasts a long time. I had a couple of rolls from years ago and they didn&#x27;t lose their mild adhesive. I&#x27;m so glad that 3M is still making it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P Fox (Author of \\&quot;Let Me Count the Ways, Letters of Friendship, Love and Deception\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> it arrived promptly, &amp; was exactly what i ordered. i&#x27;m so glad i was able to find this tape. it works brilliantly at keeping bangs in place whilst they dry.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think they made this anymore.  Keeps my side hair from going bonkers during sleep</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> So glad to find a place to buy it as our local store stopped having it available.  A great product.</li>
            <li> This item was just like in the old days. Knew what I wanted and got it. Now I can look like a 1940&#x27;s Hollywood siren.</li>
            <li> i have used this tape for years, then it couldnt be found at any local stores. was glad to find it herfe at a great price</li>
            <li> Excellent for taping down a wild cowlick.</li>
            <li> I first used this tape awhile back and I liked it so much that I wanted to keep purchasing it.</li>
            <li> The item was received just as described. I am very satisfied with my purchase and will definitely buy again. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I was hoping to tape away my frown wrinkles, but they seemed even worse the next morning.  I sure wish it had worked for me!  I didn&#x27;t want the stiff frownies, but maybe that&#x27;s what makes them work (haven&#x27;t tried them).</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of this hair set tape for many years.  It is so nice to be able to order it and have it delivered, instead of having to find a store with it on the shelf.  The tape works well for me , as it holds my hair in place while it dries.  I will be using it for many more years.</li>
            <li> Have used this hair tape for a number of years and was happy to find it again through Amazon.  Good tape for holding some curls at night in my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have used hair tape before and this stuff was not only pricy but didn&#x27;t stick at all</li>
