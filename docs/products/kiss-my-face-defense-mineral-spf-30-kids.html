    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Its perfect!</li>
            <li>The wonderful non-irritating formulation even takes it a step forward and gives the skin some of the \\&quot;good stuff\\</li>
            <li>The search for a great kiddo sunblock continues...</li>
            <li>Like another user, I also found that it got clumpy/gritty, didn&#x27;t spread and just wasn&#x27;t very effective.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how it is good for 40 minutes in the water.  </li>
            <li>It is eco-friendly and non-toxic, and the price and quantity is a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works good, make sure you don&#x27;t apply in the sun/heat.</li>
            <li>I have tried lots and lots and am looking for the absolute perfect one if there is one.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter how warm it is.</li>
            <li>It is nice lotion coming out of the tube as you are rubbing it in</li>
            <li>Glad to have a great product that is safe for my children.</li>
            <li>I picked this up based on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s 2012 Sunscreen list with a #2 rating, but wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>I like that most of the ingredients are safe for humans but when water hits this stuff it does not stand a chance !</li>
            <li>It also sweats off easily, we went to the zoo on a warm but not humid day</li>
            <li>Make sure you shake before apply to skin.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t a problem any more.  </li>
            <li>Now kids probably won&#x27;t care but adults may want a more invisible sunscreen with a more elegant finish.</li>
            <li>While it may work and be healthier than most sunblocks it just doesn&#x27;t spread on the skin.</li>
            <li>sits on top then flakes off.</li>
            <li>One star for trying to make a safe healthy sunscreen for kids.</li>
            <li>and I love the many products this company sell.</li>
            <li>If you try to rub in it more, it flakes off</li>
            <li>This sunblock is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I like this stuff, a good first sunscreen for my baby.</li>
            <li>My son is allergic to most chemical sunscreens so this product is a great natural solution for our family.</li>
            <li>This is a great natural sunscreen!</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is really not the best.  </li>
            <li>It provides good protection, but if you don&#x27;t rub it in fast, you get lots of clumps.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply on the skin.</li>
            <li>As she started to sweat in the sun (she sweats easily)</li>
            <li>Luckily my toddler kept her hat on and was mostly under her stroller&#x27;s sun shade</li>
            <li>i applied in the cool shade, rubbed in fine.</li>
            <li>We headed to the pool, she went under water, and when she came out, her face was bright white and patchy.  </li>
            <li>It immediately dries a bright white</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many and this one leaves an unusual amount of whitish residue...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very dissapointed with this sunscreen, a sunscreen should be able to spread on like a lotion evenly to the body.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have read the reviews on here first!  </li>
            <li>Natural and safe for  </li>
            <li>it came right off.  </li>
            <li>It is the first natural sunscreen I have tried, so hopefully the others are better.  </li>
            <li>but I was able to rub in the cream without residue left on my skin.</li>
            <li>my daughters first leg</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, not the case.</li>
            <li>We much preferred Badger, Alba Botanica or All</li>
            <li>The 2013 list will be coming out very soon...</li>
            <li>It does appear to protect well from the sun and my 5 year old daughter loves the colorful packaging.</li>
            <li>Rubbing sunscreen in fast on the skin of a wiggly toddler is no mean feat!</li>
            <li>This sunscreen surprised me because is it not greasy at all and rubs right in.</li>
            <li>The product has to be fresh prior purchase.</li>
            <li>This is not too white as far as physical sunscreens go, but there are definitely better options out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this for sensitive skin EXCEPT for the rubbing needed to be done to make this absorb into skin</li>
            <li>I think it worked fine as far as blocking the sun, but I&#x27;ve only used it once because it is so sticky and white when we put it on.</li>
            <li>I usually buy Alba Botanica and I will be make sure that I always have some on hand.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen takes some trial and error and some patience to learn how to rub it in, it is not greasy and it &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34; on the skin, which seemed nice at first but makes applying it to a squirmy toddler difficult.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, super difficult to apply, it cakes easily, doesn&#x27;t smooth out, and definitely does NOT dry clear.</li>
            <li>I just bought this because of its active ingredients and was excited to use it on my 3 month old son...</li>
            <li>It sits on top of the skin and creates a white, streaky mess.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my six-year old daughter based on a recommendation from one of the Don&#x27;t Go to the Cosmetics Counter without me books.  </li>
            <li>Any mineral sunscreen ( I won&#x27;t use the word \\&quot;natural\\&quot; because what is done to these minerals to make them into a skin care product is anything but natural) can leave a whitish tint on the skin.  </li>
            <li>may cause redness to sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Buy Alba Botanicals mineral for kids or Garden Goddess as they apply so much nicer and evenly and don&#x27;t wash away in the water instantly.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money or time.</li>
            <li>and then you can&#x27;t rub it in without completely rubbing it off.  </li>
            <li>After a little bit of water play, it came right off!</li>
            <li>But we spent the first month or so having a heck of a time getting it to rub in.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t need to rub it in too hard and it spreads easily.    </li>
            <li>its super streaky/ chalky, flaky and messy.</li>
            <li>I only tried her face, saw what a joke it was and switched to our old stand by for the rest of her skin.  </li>
            <li>This was the email I sent to the company: I purchased your All Natural Kids Mineral Sunscreen last weekend when I was taking my daughter to camp for a week.  </li>
            <li>After trying to use it three times and apply to small areas and rub in quickly with no luck at all, I threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very rare to find a sunscreen claiming to be natural that doesn&#x27;t include fragrance or irritating fragrant plant oils.</li>
            <li>The lotion was a little thicker than I expected and doesn&#x27;t rub into the skin easily so there is a white residue left on skin and clothes.</li>
            <li>the second leg i did in the hot sun and the stuff instantly gummed up and just clupmed up in a rubbery mess.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was looking forward to try Kiss my Face sunblock lotion for my kids, but I was very dissapointed in the fact that it was not easy to spread and it washed immediately off when got into water.  </li>
            <li> It was ridiculous, and when I tried to rub it in, it washed right off.  </li>
            <li> It covers well and as long as you rub it in as soon as you apply it, there is no white residue.</li>
            <li> We put this on - let it dry, as soon as we got in the water, whether it was the pool or the ocean -</li>
            <li> It has Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide which make the white color and if the sunscreen lay on the shelves for months in the store with weak air conditioner and gets older and dry then the problem with the flake off happens.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this sunblock, advertised as &amp;#34;dries clear&amp;#34; would be less messy than other eco-friendly sunblocks for kiddos.</li>
            <li> but when I applied it on him it was super thick and while I was rubbing it on it was turning into small particles!</li>
            <li> It does dry to a less greasy finish.</li>
            <li> One of the very few sunblocks out there that my baby is not allergic to but it leaves her completely white streaked!</li>
            <li> Active ingredients:  Titanium Dioxide 6%  Zinc Oxide</li>
            <li> This one is really hard to put on - it doesn&#x27;t rub in well and always leaves a white film.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say it went straight to the trash.</li>
            <li> it started to run down her face and the clumps began to appear again.</li>
            <li> I had to run and get a towel to wipe off the mess before it got in her eyes.  </li>
            <li> You also have a few seconds to vigorously rub it in or it will not rub in AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this lotion.</li>
            <li> Not easy to use at all.</li>
            <li> It left a white smear everywhere and was impossible to rub in.</li>
            <li> when applied heavily it was a little hard to rub in sometimes</li>
            <li> It is so hard to rub in, and while trying to rub it in, it clumped up in little balls all over my toddler.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with it at all and will probably end up throwing it out.</li>
            <li> but Target didn&#x27;t have it and got this one instead, what a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I put this on my children and myself this past weekend.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised with the bad reviews</li>
            <li> This product is too thick.  </li>
            <li> My kids the usually don&#x27;t mind sunscreen run away when they see this one!</li>
            <li> This product is thick, very hard to rub in, and did not work to prevent sunburn.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to do with little ones as they complain &amp;#34;mommy</li>
            <li> At least we know if we missed a spot!</li>
            <li> Very hard to spread and pills.</li>
            <li> This one is chalky and needs to be rubbed in while in the shade or it is impossible to spread onto skin remotely evenly.  </li>
            <li> Worst natural mineral sunblock i have tried!  </li>
            <li> This was definitely one of the worst lotions I ever tried.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to spread.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in the quality of this product and the price makes it even worse!  </li>
            <li> I found this product very difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> This was impossible to rub into skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this here, but after a bad experience, thought I&#x27;d see what others had to say about this product.  </li>
            <li> It is too bad</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the worst sunscreen I have ever tried on my kids.  </li>
            <li> This was the worst titanium sunscreen i have ever tried.</li>
            <li> works well but terrible</li>
            <li> This was a terrible product!</li>

            <li> One of the very few sunblocks out there that my baby is not allergic to but it leaves her completely white streaked! At least we know if we missed a spot!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my six-year old daughter based on a recommendation from one of the Don&#x27;t Go to the Cosmetics Counter without me books.  Obviously this product was only recommended based on its ingredients, and was never used.  It doesn&#x27;t rub in.  My daughter&#x27;s face was completely white, and when trying to rub it in, it began to get grainy and piled up.  I only tried her face, saw what a joke it was and switched to our old stand by for the rest of her skin.  I figured I would leave what I had rubbed in on her face. We headed to the pool, she went under water, and when she came out, her face was bright white and patchy.  My husband thought she had been rubbed in lard.  It was ridiculous, and when I tried to rub it in, it washed right off.  It&#x27;s going straight in the trash, a waste of twelve dollars.</li>
            <li> I was surprised with the bad reviews but I was able to rub in the cream without residue left on my skin. It has Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide which make the white color and if the sunscreen lay on the shelves for months in the store with weak air conditioner and gets older and dry then the problem with the flake off happens. The product has to be fresh prior purchase. Make sure you shake before apply to skin. Its perfect!</li>
            <li> It is indeed natural and not mixed like the other products I&#x27;ve seen.    Active ingredients:  Titanium Dioxide 6%  Zinc Oxide 6%    It is easy to apply on the skin. Didn&#x27;t need to rub it in too hard and it spreads easily.    BUT, it is not water proof. I took my daughter to the pool after applying this sunblock and I could see it wash away the moment we went into the water.    Bottom line, I would definitely recommend using this sunblock for outdoors but not for swimming.</li>
            <li> works good, make sure you don&#x27;t apply in the sun/heat. my daughters first leg i applied in the cool shade, rubbed in fine. the second leg i did in the hot sun and the stuff instantly gummed up and just clupmed up in a rubbery mess. i basically had to pick those parts off of her...</li>
            <li> This is the worst sunscreen I have ever tried on my kids.  It does not rub in!  It goes on your body as a white paste and then as you try to rub it in, it becomes all clumpy and gummy.  I had to use a towel to wipe off all the sticky residue and start over with another sunscreen.   I would not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen surprised me because is it not greasy at all and rubs right in. It does leave a bit of a white cast though. I keep it in my car for my arms, hands and neck. It&#x27;s also unscented, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural sunscreen! It covers well and as long as you rub it in as soon as you apply it, there is no white residue. My son is allergic to most chemical sunscreens so this product is a great natural solution for our family.</li>
            <li> Gets all clumpy if you try to spread it. This was the worst titanium sunscreen i have ever tried.</li>
            <li> This product is too thick.  It clumps and it doesn&#x27;t seem to rub fully into the skin. My kids the usually don&#x27;t mind sunscreen run away when they see this one!</li>
            <li> This sunblock is pretty good.  But we spent the first month or so having a heck of a time getting it to rub in.  And then all of a sudden the viscosity got way lower and it wasn&#x27;t a problem any more.  Guess there was some setting from it sitting on the shelf for a while.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to try Kiss my Face sunblock lotion for my kids, but I was very dissapointed in the fact that it was not easy to spread and it washed immediately off when got into water.  Besides, while applying the lotion and afterwards, it would all clump up into tiny particles, almost like peeling off.  This was definitely one of the worst lotions I ever tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very rare to find a sunscreen claiming to be natural that doesn&#x27;t include fragrance or irritating fragrant plant oils. This is the exception.  The wonderful non-irritating formulation even takes it a step forward and gives the skin some of the \\&quot;good stuff\\&quot; it needs.  Any mineral sunscreen ( I won&#x27;t use the word \\&quot;natural\\&quot; because what is done to these minerals to make them into a skin care product is anything but natural) can leave a whitish tint on the skin.  I&#x27;ve tried many and this one leaves an unusual amount of whitish residue...it&#x27;s as if someone rubbed chalk on the skin. Now kids probably won&#x27;t care but adults may want a more invisible sunscreen with a more elegant finish. I&#x27;d highly recommend this for sensitive skin EXCEPT for the rubbing needed to be done to make this absorb into skin may cause redness to sensitive skin.  Definitely NOT for oily or acne prone skin. And definitely NOT just for kids...that&#x27;s a marketing gimmick.</li>
            <li> Worst natural mineral sunblock i have tried!  I have tried lots and lots and am looking for the absolute perfect one if there is one.  This one is chalky and needs to be rubbed in while in the shade or it is impossible to spread onto skin remotely evenly.  You also have a few seconds to vigorously rub it in or it will not rub in AT ALL. Difficult to do with little ones as they complain &amp;#34;mommy that hurts!!!&amp;#34;. No matter what, it leaves chalky smears all over your skin.  Once water touches your skin, it literally washes away.  I don&#x27;t see how it is good for 40 minutes in the water.  I did not use for my kids while swimming because of this. Thankfully i tried it out on a day when no water activities were planned.  DO NOT BUY.  Buy Alba Botanicals mineral for kids or Garden Goddess as they apply so much nicer and evenly and don&#x27;t wash away in the water instantly.</li>
            <li> This was impossible to rub into skin. I think it worked fine as far as blocking the sun, but I&#x27;ve only used it once because it is so sticky and white when we put it on.</li>
            <li> While it may work and be healthier than most sunblocks it just doesn&#x27;t spread on the skin. It doesn&#x27;t matter how warm it is.</li>
            <li> I found this product very difficult to apply.  It sits on top of the skin and creates a white, streaky mess.  Once in the water the product comes off in chunks.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this sunblock, advertised as &amp;#34;dries clear&amp;#34; would be less messy than other eco-friendly sunblocks for kiddos. Unfortunately, not the case. It is eco-friendly and non-toxic, and the price and quantity is a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, super difficult to apply, it cakes easily, doesn&#x27;t smooth out, and definitely does NOT dry clear. Not easy to use at all. The search for a great kiddo sunblock continues...</li>
            <li> I wish I would have read the reviews on here first!  It is so hard to rub in, and while trying to rub it in, it clumped up in little balls all over my toddler. As she started to sweat in the sun (she sweats easily) it started to run down her face and the clumps began to appear again. After a little bit of water play, it came right off! The water made it drip away. I had to run and get a towel to wipe off the mess before it got in her eyes.  Needless to say it went straight to the trash.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money or time. this stuff is junk. It is nice lotion coming out of the tube as you are rubbing it in it dries a become tacky. Does not penetrate skin sits on top then flakes off. Defiantly not water proof. One star for trying to make a safe healthy sunscreen for kids.</li>
            <li> works well but terrible feel on the skin. its super streaky/ chalky, flaky and messy. i would recommend only using it on your nose like an old-school life guard</li>
            <li> This was a terrible product! It left a white smear everywhere and was impossible to rub in. I am not pleased with it at all and will probably end up throwing it out.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen takes some trial and error and some patience to learn how to rub it in, it is not greasy and it &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34; on the skin, which seemed nice at first but makes applying it to a squirmy toddler difficult. If you reapply over an area that already has sunscreen it will gum up and rub off. It also sweats off easily, we went to the zoo on a warm but not humid day, I did not feel sweaty at any point but nonetheless the sunscreen on my arms and neck wore off, leaving me with quite a sunburn on my neck. Luckily my toddler kept her hat on and was mostly under her stroller&#x27;s sun shade so she did not get burned. This is not too white as far as physical sunscreens go, but there are definitely better options out there.</li>
            <li> Very hard to spread and pills.</li>
            <li> Glad to have a great product that is safe for my children. Arrived on time and I love the many products this company sell. Natural and safe for  all the family not just the kids.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff, a good first sunscreen for my baby. It goes on a bit greasy but this actually makes application to a wriggling baby a bit easier. It does dry to a less greasy finish.</li>
            <li> I like that most of the ingredients are safe for humans but when water hits this stuff it does not stand a chance !</li>
            <li> It provides good protection, but if you don&#x27;t rub it in fast, you get lots of clumps. Rubbing sunscreen in fast on the skin of a wiggly toddler is no mean feat!</li>
            <li> I just bought this because of its active ingredients and was excited to use it on my 3 month old son...but when I applied it on him it was super thick and while I was rubbing it on it was turning into small particles! So I had to dust a lot of particles off of him, while a lot was still on him.  I&#x27;m very dissapointed with this sunscreen, a sunscreen should be able to spread on like a lotion evenly to the body. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this lotion. I&#x27;m going to order Blue Lizard online, that was the one I was looking for but Target didn&#x27;t have it and got this one instead, what a waste of money!</li>
            <li> We put this on - let it dry, as soon as we got in the water, whether it was the pool or the ocean - it came right off.  It was difficult to spread.</li>
            <li> I picked this up based on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s 2012 Sunscreen list with a #2 rating, but wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it. Like another user, I also found that it got clumpy/gritty, didn&#x27;t spread and just wasn&#x27;t very effective. We much preferred Badger, Alba Botanica or All Terrain brands over this. The 2013 list will be coming out very soon...hope companies keep improving. [...]</li>
            <li> Blends in well and hopefully contains no harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> I always prefer to use a non toxic and biodegradable product like this one. when applied heavily it was a little hard to rub in sometimes</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is really not the best.  It is the first natural sunscreen I have tried, so hopefully the others are better.  This one is really hard to put on - it doesn&#x27;t rub in well and always leaves a white film.  If you try to rub in it more, it flakes off and then you look like you are covered in dandruff.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this here, but after a bad experience, thought I&#x27;d see what others had to say about this product.  I&#x27;ve been using mineral sunscreens on my children for a couple of years now.  I thought I&#x27;d try this one.  I put this on my children and myself this past weekend.  We were at the pool and a splash pad for an hour and-a-half and I applied twice.  We all ended up with burns on our shoulders and backs.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This does not run in at all.  It immediately dries a bright white and then you can&#x27;t rub it in without completely rubbing it off.  After trying to use it three times and apply to small areas and rub in quickly with no luck at all, I threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly. The lotion was a little thicker than I expected and doesn&#x27;t rub into the skin easily so there is a white residue left on skin and clothes. It does appear to protect well from the sun and my 5 year old daughter loves the colorful packaging.</li>
            <li> This product is thick, very hard to rub in, and did not work to prevent sunburn.  Would not recommend ever.</li>
            <li> This was the email I sent to the company: I purchased your All Natural Kids Mineral Sunscreen last weekend when I was taking my daughter to camp for a week.  As we were waiting to check in, I applied the sunscreen and immediately noticed that as I rubbed it in, the consistency went from liquid to a gummy texture and it appeared to be peeling off her skin.  I am so disappointed in the quality of this product and the price makes it even worse!  $15 for a bottle of sunscreen that will not protect my daughter from the sun.  I usually buy Alba Botanica and I will be make sure that I always have some on hand.  It is too bad I did not see the Amazon reviews for your product before purchasing it.  I would rather spray my kids with regular, chemical laden sunscreen, because I know it works!  If I can find my receipt, I will take it to the store for a refund.</li>
