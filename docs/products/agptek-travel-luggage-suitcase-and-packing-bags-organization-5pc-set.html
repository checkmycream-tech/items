    <ol>
            <li>Great help in organizing stuff for travel!</li>
            <li>Was $9.99 when I purchased and was the best priced item of its type.</li>
            <li>One of the best products I have ever, ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Wonderful.</li>
            <li>for the price this works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It really great</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>Good One for the price...</li>
            <li>its all good now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Although the item that I received matched the listing description and would have been perfect for packing two months  worth of clothes for a toddler,</li>
            <li>The bag in the picture with toiletry items on the top and brushes on the bottom...is not so great...</li>
            <li>Nice item..</li>
            <li>they seem very cheap.</li>
            <li>Super cute, unique design with great inserts/pockets for sorting items when packing.</li>
            <li>Worked fantastic!.  </li>
            <li>It is a shame that we will not be able to use these packing cubes.  </li>
            <li>The size and color are great and it would have made packing for our trip so much easier and organized.</li>
            <li>These are good quality packing bags, and were useful for keeping clothing together so it could be easily found.</li>
            <li>Cheap material,  but</li>
            <li>Great for travel, especially on a cruise.</li>
            <li>Thin light weight nylon material, works perfect for what I need.</li>
            <li>The zipper split as soon as I zipped &amp; unzipped the first cube, without anything in it!  </li>
            <li>The material is ok but at least is good for what I need it.</li>
            <li>I loved the bright blue color and at least in the pictures, it looked well made</li>
            <li>and i believe if you put very much in each one of these the zipper may bust out.</li>
            <li>but it helped keep my clothes separate and organize during my trip and they are cute, they come in different sizes</li>
            <li>Of course I knew they were all the same color when I placed the order, and my one request is that the bags would each be a different color so that when you need to find the bag that has your socks, it&#x27;s more easily located in the depths of a suitcase.</li>
            <li>Nothing LARGE about these bags in the large.</li>
            <li>Made packing so much easier and kept things organized throughout a 25 day trip to Italy.</li>
            <li>but actually it is very flimsy</li>
            <li>I fear that that it is going to come apart very soon.</li>
            <li>but the material is very think</li>
            <li>they dont seem very well made.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive these bags as were planning to use them for an international trip.  </li>
            <li>I was able to pack enough clothes for a week and a half in a carry-on suit case.</li>

            <li> Although the product is well worth the affordable price tag, I am unable to rate the actual set that I received any higher as I am not able to use it due to its condition upon receipt.</li>
            <li> (shirts, shorts, capris, dresses and swimwear) with room to spare.&lt;br /&gt;I packed quite a bit of items into one of these, and while zipping closed</li>
            <li> I was careful to pull the zipper shut as I zippped so as to not rip the stitches or material.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even get a chance to open the other bags included in the set because there was a large cut on the largest bag that was about 4 inches that rendered the product useless.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is going to stand even one trip without the actual fabric tearing up or the stitching coming apart.</li>
            <li> the largest bag is 2 sided, you can put clothes on one side, zip it and flip to the other side that also has a mesh front.  </li>
            <li> One bag has dividers for socks or little cosmetic items.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Crap , do not waste money</li>
            <li> I used a bag for washing delicate items while we were away and unfortunately learned (after the fact) that there is a lining on the inside of the bags which flakes off and coated all the clothes that were in that washing load.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed when this arrived.</li>
            <li> unfortunately the item that we received was damaged.</li>
            <li> and although I have not used it yet, I am almost afraid to!</li>

            <li> Great help in organizing stuff for travel! üëç</li>
            <li> Cheap material,  but the bags are still useable.  Will hold children&#x27;s under garments, toiletries, and maybe some shoes.</li>
            <li> Crap , do not waste money</li>
            <li> returned it.  Nothing LARGE about these bags in the large.</li>

            <li> Nice item.. Thank you</li>
            <li> Does not have structure, they are just like bags but it helped keep my clothes separate and organize during my trip and they are cute, they come in different sizes</li>
            <li> One of the best products I have ever, ever purchased. Great for travel, especially on a cruise. Wonderful.</li>
            <li> Thin light weight nylon material, works perfect for what I need.</li>

Of course I knew they were all the same color when I placed the order, and my one request is that the bags would each be a different color so that when you need to find the bag that has your socks, it&#x27;s more easily located in the depths of a suitcase. I used a bag for washing delicate items while we were away and unfortunately learned (after the fact) that there is a lining on the inside of the bags which flakes off and coated all the clothes that were in that washing load. But since this isn&#x27;t how they are designed to be used, I can&#x27;t ding the product for that. Zippers held up well.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive these bags as were planning to use them for an international trip.  Although the item that I received matched the listing description and would have been perfect for packing two months  worth of clothes for a toddler, unfortunately the item that we received was damaged.

            <li> Good One for the price... I would recommend it</li>
            <li> they seem very cheap. I understand they are a low price but the material is very think and i believe if you put very much in each one of these the zipper may bust out. they dont seem very well made.</li>
            <li> I was able to pack enough clothes for a week and a half in a carry-on suit case. It really great</li>
            <li> The material is ok but at least is good for what I need it.</li>
            <li> for the price this works perfectly.  2 zippers on ea. bag. some have mesh on one side, but not all ofhtem.  the largest bag is 2 sided, you can put clothes on one side, zip it and flip to the other side that also has a mesh front.  One bag has dividers for socks or little cosmetic items.  The bag in the picture with toiletry items on the top and brushes on the bottom...is not so great...there is no seam or stitching between these two compartments and the stuff slides together...but I sewed a seam so its all good now.&lt;br /&gt;I have packed ladies summer clothes for 7-10 days in these. (shirts, shorts, capris, dresses and swimwear) with room to spare.&lt;br /&gt;I packed quite a bit of items into one of these, and while zipping closed I was careful to pull the zipper shut as I zippped so as to not rip the stitches or material. Now my luggage is all organized and I won&#x27;t have nightmares of my luggage exploding and all my underwear laying everywhere in baggage claim. LOL</li>
            <li> Very flimsy. The zipper split as soon as I zipped &amp; unzipped the first cube, without anything in it!  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
