            <li>I just got my harp seal in the mail today, pretty fast shipping considering where it came from ðŸ˜Š, perfect size for my purse , adorable packaging , smells good to me a very clean green smell</li>
            <li>super cute and</li>
            <li>Super adorable.</li>
            <li>I have never used lotion so moisturizing and light before.</li>
            <li>Beautiful container, small enough for a purse and smells delicious.</li>
            <li>Personally, I enjoy the tea tree smell, but that factor is up to preference.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product (and part of the proceeds go to an animal</li>
            <li>This is such a great mini lotion to carry around.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless - it is cute and the lotion smells so good and softens my dry hands.</li>
            <li>This lotion works and actually smells nice!</li>
            <li>of course it fits perfectly even in my small crossbody bag</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s travek friendly.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about the lotion.</li>
            <li>I think these are so sweet</li>
            <li>the lotion is nice and smells good but its really small</li>
            <li>So I bought this like two weeks ago it came here super fast!!</li>
            <li>The packaging is super cute and the lotion leaves my hands very soft.</li>
            <li>I love the green tea scent, very refreshing.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;d be nice if they had re-fills because I don&#x27;t think I have the heart to throw away the cute item; however, I&#x27;m interested in trying the other creams too ^_^</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s small but super adorable and packaging is amazing</li>
            <li>but I will reuse this vessel and put more of my other favorite philosophy creams in it to carry with me in my purse.</li>
            <li>Although you get a tiny amount of cream in the package, it is worth every penny (and the packaging is super cute).</li>
            <li>Small size, great for purse.  </li>
            <li>i wish it was bigger and contained more of the creme</li>
            <li>I only wish there was more product in each animal.</li>
            <li>Scent is good not my fave out of the 4 Missing U Handcream line</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order more, because all the little animal containers for lotion - there are 4 different ones - are adorable.</li>
            <li>The shipment was fast, as per the confirmation.</li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t really appeal to me.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing though.</li>
            <li>Nice pale scent.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for summer and winter.</li>
            <li>This makes your skin really soft.</li>

            <li>Absorbs almost instantly and leaves my hands very moisturized and soft with long lasting effect.</li>

            <li> I have looked into other cosmetic companies to see if they carry something like this, but if so, I haven&#x27;t found one.</li>
            <li> Love the packaging though disappointed with the lotion.</li>
            <li> a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I get comments every time I pull my little seal out of my bag and use it.</li>
            <li> you could keep in your purse and whip out when you need a little moisture on your hands through the day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my palms slick, so I can still write with a pen after I apply it.</li>
            <li> the only disadvantage one can see that it is very small :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a five star product, and you really can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>

            <li> This lotion works and actually smells nice!</li>
            <li> Seller shipped the item very quickly. The item itself is great. Very cute of course it fits perfectly even in my small crossbody bag so it&#x27;s travek friendly. Scent is good not my fave out of the 4 Missing U Handcream line but I like it overall.</li>
            <li> Hand cream feels good leaves my hands soft and is so cute</li>
            <li> This lotion is absolutely amazing. I have never used lotion so moisturizing and light before. No greasyness what-so-ever. Absorbs almost instantly and leaves my hands very moisturized and soft with long lasting effect. a little goes a very long way. I would love to purchase more.</li>
            <li> It smells so good. The package is adorable - although a bit inconvenient. It would be a better package if it was a flip top and you could squeeze the product out. Nevertheless - it is cute and the lotion smells so good and softens my dry hands. I get comments every time I pull my little seal out of my bag and use it. All my friends want one.</li>
            <li> Nice pale scent.  Cute container.  Small size, great for purse.  Can put your own cream in it after you use it all up.</li>
            <li> Beautiful container, small enough for a purse and smells delicious. It was a gift and I enjoyed it a lot!</li>
            <li> This was smaller than I expected. i wish it was bigger and contained more of the creme but i was not dissappointed. I think it&#x27;s something cute you could keep in your purse and whip out when you need a little moisture on your hands through the day. Its just enough. It smells AMAZING, almost like a perfume. I will definitly by another one. It&#x27;d be nice if they had re-fills because I don&#x27;t think I have the heart to throw away the cute item; however, I&#x27;m interested in trying the other creams too ^_^</li>
            <li> This is a very cute container for hand lotion. I have looked into other cosmetic companies to see if they carry something like this, but if so, I haven&#x27;t found one. I have given these as gifts. The recipients are always more than pleased to receive these presents. I&#x27;ve been told that the lotion smells wonderful and feels good too. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order more, because all the little animal containers for lotion - there are 4 different ones - are adorable.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my sister and she liked it. It arrived well and on ahead of time. She likes the smell and how it feels. It has a leafy sort of scent. The packaging is really cute and so is the seal.</li>
            <li> This makes your skin really soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. Although you get a tiny amount of cream in the package, it is worth every penny (and the packaging is super cute). My hands have never felt smoother after using this cream and I have also noticed my nails looking healthier and longer. Personally, I enjoy the tea tree smell, but that factor is up to preference. Overall, great product (and part of the proceeds go to an animal fund)- I only wish there was more product in each animal.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, although not what I was expecting, and feels amazing on my hands and wrists, and in the cutest container ever! I love it!</li>
            <li> Super adorable. I love the green tea scent, very refreshing. The cream itself isnt incredibly thick, but very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Very nice hand cream, you can feel the immeduiate effect as you use it. The shipment was fast, as per the confirmation. the only disadvantage one can see that it is very small :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing on my dad&#x27;s account. This is such a great mini lotion to carry around. It smells faint, but really good. It doesn&#x27;t leave my palms slick, so I can still write with a pen after I apply it. It&#x27;s a five star product, and you really can&#x27;t go wrong with it. It&#x27;s a bit pricey in stores, so online is the way to go if you want to save $. Highly recommend for summer and winter.</li>
            <li> This is the cutest thing I&#x27;ve ever seen. Who doesn&#x27;t want an egg sized seal full of lotion!?</li>
            <li> I thought it would smell much better then it did. The smell doesn&#x27;t really appeal to me. It is very moisturizing though.</li>
            <li> This thing is sooooooooo TINY !!!!! But its still soooooooo cute.  The smell is leafy if you like that kind of smell, its ok.  Its soo tiny that its not as big as my palm its a bit smaller and I thought it would be bigger but its soooo tiny. but i love it</li>
            <li> The packaging is super cute and the lotion leaves my hands very soft. It&#x27;s got a bit of an earthy scent but that&#x27;s as was described. Overall, I love it!</li>
            <li> I just got my harp seal in the mail today, pretty fast shipping considering where it came from ðŸ˜Š, perfect size for my purse , adorable packaging , smells good to me a very clean green smell and it makes your hands so soft .it came with a sample of another product also which was nice. I think these are so sweet, I have the peach panda on the way too , I want them all soooo cute !  happy customer ! ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> So cute! Love Etude House items!</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s so cute and he smells excellent!</li>
            <li> Love the packaging though disappointed with the lotion. I could have sworn they put an American off brand lotion in it. Nothing special about the lotion.</li>
            <li> Arrived as listed. :)</li>
