            <li>This is a nice quality tote--large enough to fill with beach supplies for an end-of-school year gift for teacher.</li>

            <li>Shipping was FAST!</li>
            <li>The bag is very spacious but would be a bit better if it had internal compartments/dividers.</li>
            <li>It also appears to be very sturdy, and I believe it will last her many years through her teaching years.</li>
            <li>it will fit a regular size laptop well enough (up to 15&amp;#34; screen or so), but don&#x27;t expect to be able to pack everything a teacher may need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>The bag is very sturdy and durable.  </li>
            <li>Also, enjoy a bag that has a zipper pocket inside and outside.</li>
            <li>This bag was a lot bigger than I thought it would be, but that&#x27;s great because teachers usually carry a lot of stuff!</li>
            <li>I purchased a few more for my teacher friends.</li>
            <li>, she turned around with a big smile and said \\&quot;I</li>
            <li>It still looks new after using it all year.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my son&#x27;s significant other for her birthday.</li>
            <li>agree.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a small bag...</li>
            <li>Teachers these days almost have to carry their classrooms with them, at least many of their supplies and equipment.</li>

            <li> The bag also allows you to organize other accessories.</li>
            <li> As a result, I was forced to find a different bag.</li>
            <li> However, half way through the school year, the black coating on the inside of the bag began to flake off.</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> The bag holds heavy materials without tearing.  </li>
            <li> I see now, they are not available.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked at how sturdy the bag is.</li>

            <li> Item was just how described, was a great price and was shipped promptly... my sons teacher was thrilled when she opened the gift..</li>
            <li> Very nice!!  I brought this for my daughter to use for school. She likes it, hopefully she will use it.</li>
            <li> Used for a teachers appreciation gift. Nice and sturdy</li>
            <li> I bought this bag for a Teacher for the last day of school Gift.  It&#x27;s a really nice bag and makes a good gift.</li>
            <li> I bought this to carry work/lunch/purse from home to school. Initially, I was very pleased. It was large, had separate pockets and carried everything I could need with room leftover. However, half way through the school year, the black coating on the inside of the bag began to flake off. It got all over everything and was tracked all through my house. As a result, I was forced to find a different bag.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for an aspiring teacher.  I was expecting compartments inside the bag, but it&#x27;s very nice and sturdy for the price. I think she will love it.  I am filling it with cute teacher supplies.  I would probably order from this company again!</li>
            <li> Today was the first day of classes and I wore my &amp;#34;I Teach&amp;#34; bag. I was pleased that I was able to fit all of the things I needed for class today (two binders, two books, pencil case, etc.) as well as my breakfast and lunch. The bag is very spacious but would be a bit better if it had internal compartments/dividers. Overall I really like the bag and would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my teacher wife as a present. She uses it every day to haul stuff back and forth to school. That said, it&#x27;s not built to carry more than a couple of notebooks or some papers to grade. Anything heavy like a couple of thick books or two reams of paper would be too much for the flimsy handles. They look nice, but are just edge stitched so pull apart under load.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my teacher sister in law! Great quality, size and color.</li>
            <li> This bag is perfect for books because it is very strong carrying books and other items. The bag also allows you to organize other accessories.</li>
            <li> Very nice tote for Teachers, can fit a lot of things. I only wish it had a side pocket for a water bottle.</li>
            <li> Purchased this tote as a gift for my daughter&#x27;s 6th grade ELA teacher. She loved it!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, great price, made a great teacher appreciation gift!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This bag was a lot bigger than I thought it would be, but that&#x27;s great because teachers usually carry a lot of stuff! It has durable adjustable straps, an outside compartment, and an inside compartment where you can hide things like your phone or personal items. I would highly recommend this as a gift or as an everyday bag for a teacher.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter who began her 1st year teaching. She absolutely loved it! She loved that it was spacious and even had room to carry her work laptop! It gets the stamp of approval from a NYC 4th grade teacher!</li>
            <li> Super cute bag!  I gave these as teacher gifts, and they loved them!  The bag seemed very durable. Had a lot of room in them.</li>
            <li> Love this bag! I purchased it for carrying text books and teacher manuals and it has really held up. No rips or tears and I use it everyday. I even put my laptop and lunch in their with all the books and it is very sturdy and reliable</li>
            <li> Perfect Teacher gift. We bough this and put a bunch of school supplies and gift cards in it for our daughters teacher&#x27;s Christmas Gift:)</li>
            <li> Very nice and sturdy bag. Holds a lot.</li>
            <li> Good tote for teachers, lots of pockets for storing all the stuff you need. &amp;#34;Jumbo&amp;#34; is a bit misleading. it will fit a regular size laptop well enough (up to 15&amp;#34; screen or so), but don&#x27;t expect to be able to pack everything a teacher may need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels well put together and definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this as part of a graduation gift for my daughter who just graduated from college. It is big and roomy enough to carry all her teaching supplies. It also appears to be very sturdy, and I believe it will last her many years through her teaching years.</li>
            <li> Great quality and a big hit with the teachers!</li>
            <li> The bag is very sturdy and durable.  I carry all of my stuff back and forth to school in it.</li>
            <li> great gift for my daughter-in-law</li>
            <li> This bag truly holds everything I need. I can fit a 2inch binder filled with papers. I have room for 2 notepads. There is plenty space for pens, pencils, highlighters, markers, sticky notes, etc. I have used this bag for a 4 night trip so you know there is space. I love ‚ù§ this bag!</li>
            <li> Excellent fast service. The tote bag was everything I expected and more!!  I love it.</li>
            <li> My wife loved this. Good large sized back of excellent quality. Teachers these days almost have to carry their classrooms with them, at least many of their supplies and equipment. This is a great 2nd tote when everything doesn&#x27;t fit in one.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how sturdy the bag is. It seems very durable! It is a perfect bag for carrying extra items or lunch in. Or even just a weekend bag.</li>
            <li> This tote was purchased as a gift for my son&#x27;s kindergarten teacher. Amazon shipped the tote very securely, and the quality of the material appeared quite durable, but keep in mind I am not using this tote. The tote is very spacious, and my son&#x27;s teacher loved the bag. She actually choked up after reading the words. I would recommend this bag.</li>
            <li> a large tote that you can put all your supplies in.</li>
            <li> Great to have a bag that is large enough for all my teacher stuff.  Also, enjoy a bag that has a zipper pocket inside and outside.</li>
            <li> My favorite hook bag for school papers, etc...</li>
            <li> The bag holds heavy materials without tearing.  The pockets are large and hold many materials. The strap is sturdy and durable and adjustable.</li>
            <li> I saw this bag and I knew I HAD to get it for my daughters Pre-School Teacher.  I gave it to her on the last day of class, she loved it!  I noticed she read it on her own, she turned around with a big smile and said \\&quot;I agree.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a small bag...it&#x27;s quite spacious!  Material is great. It also has an elastic strap inside so it can hold two pens/pencils.  Shipping was FAST! I&#x27;m glad I ordered it ahead of time.  I see now, they are not available.  I am very glad I purchased this item.</li>
            <li> Perfect. I like the big outside pocket for my ID and keys. And the inside is big enough for my lunch box and school papers. The adjustable straps are a plus!</li>
