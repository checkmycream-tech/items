            <li>The grip, when it does work, is very secure and sturdy.</li>
            <li>It holds well to my granite counter top.  </li>
            <li>It works great thanks</li>
            <li>I wish the head would mount on with a better grip.  </li>
            <li>Suctions easily to many surfaces.</li>
            <li>Like many things it&#x27;s made in China.</li>
            <li>This works out so much better than the clamp style that I purchased before.  </li>
            <li>Height makes styling perfect for units 18 inches long.</li>
            <li>so far so good, nice sturdy product.</li>
            <li>Other than it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>Works easily on my coffee table.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>

            <li>Very satisfied so far.</li>
            <li>I have one from the same manufacturer and neither are of any good to me.</li>
            <li>Seller ships faster and product is true and on point.</li>
            <li>If it would suction on other surfaces too it would be a great buy.</li>
            <li>I use it to practice new hair styles while watching tv :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about it...  </li>
            <li>and for its price totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the old ones they give you in school.</li>
            <li>It should only be placed on very smooth, clean surfaces such as a counter top, too.</li>
            <li>but overall I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The tilting mechanism is a real bonus for styling!</li>
            <li>Exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li>Suction on vanity top is rock solid.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and move around to different locations.</li>
            <li>and this stand makes it much easier.  </li>
            <li>Very displeased with this.</li>
            <li>if you pull even just a little bit too many times it pops off.</li>
            <li>Good not great.</li>
            <li>New Jersey</li>
            <li>i was completely expecting it to not keep its hold to my desk</li>
            <li>Amazon had matched this up with the Mehron Professional Make-up &amp; Face Painting Student Practice Head that I was purchasing, so I bought both.  </li>
            <li>I had no issues putting the two pieces together and feel like it is worth the money spent on it.</li>

            <li> but if I walk away for a while it tends to loose it&#x27;s grip.</li>
            <li> I cleaned and sanitized table and wet the bottom of the stand where the rubber suction cup is.</li>
            <li> Not really a bit deal as I can just suction it again.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I have to fix this about 6 times in less then a minute.</li>
            <li> Holds down tight.</li>
            <li> The suction on this manikin holder will hold tight on ceramic tile but not so well on my polished wood desk.  </li>
            <li> Also, it does not fit all Styrofoam heads.</li>
            <li> The suction holds tight!</li>
            <li> It it a little hard to assemble.</li>
            <li> I have to press down really hard to get manikin head adjusted on it and hard to remove manikin head.</li>
            <li> The mannequin head is kinda hard to keep on this</li>
            <li> The base is no good if it doesn&#x27;t suction, the whole purpose of me purchasing it is to anchor my wig heads so that i could curl my units.  </li>

            <li> it is frustrating because it will not stay put</li>

    <ol>
            <li> i dnt like it ineed my money back</li>
            <li> This product is very handy when working with my wigs.  I have alopecia and have worn wigs for 30 years.  Sometimes I need to dye my own wig to get the shade that I like and this stand makes it much easier.  It holds well to my granite counter top.  I have nothing but good things to say about this stand.</li>
            <li> It works great thanks</li>
            <li> Clamp-style holders don&#x27;t work for me, very happy to find this alternative!  Works great, keeps my hair piece secure so I can style it.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good not great. U have to keep reattaching to the table girls didn&#x27;t mind though. Great for kids. New Jersey</li>
            <li> Works easily on my coffee table. I use it to practice new hair styles while watching tv :)</li>
            <li> The suction works great. It it a little hard to assemble. I have to press down really hard to get manikin head adjusted on it and hard to remove manikin head. Other than it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> My 12yr.old granddaughter is very happy with the base. Along with &#x27;Lexi&#x27;. She&#x27;s braiding &amp; doing different styles all the time. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay suctioned to anything. Head doesn&#x27;t stay on it. I have one from the same manufacturer and neither are of any good to me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stick the best. But it works.  I&#x27;m not crazy about it...  if you pull even just a little bit too many times it pops off.</li>
            <li> The suction on this manikin holder will hold tight on ceramic tile but not so well on my polished wood desk.  It holds the [[ASIN:B002ZNJI9O Celebrity Alison Cosmetology Protein Fiber Hair Cutting Manikin, 26-28 Inch]] tilted in any direction and the tension is adjustable, but the manikin head falls off the holder the minute I pull up on the hair.  I wish the head would mount on with a better grip.  Other than that, it works.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and move around to different locations. Holds down tight. It works well! I would recommend to anyone buying a wig.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t figured out how to use it yet.</li>
            <li> Suctions easily to many surfaces. The handle secures so well that styling is worry free. Height makes styling perfect for units 18 inches long.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this mannequin holder. I used it for my state board practical examination and it may have caused me to fail. The stand would not stay stuck on table. I cleaned and sanitized table and wet the bottom of the stand where the rubber suction cup is. It popped off every 20 min. I will not be recommending this to my fellow cosmetologists.</li>
            <li> does not stay in place</li>
            <li> Works well...a little difficult to remove...but it does the job....</li>
            <li> This is perfect. My manakin goes nowhere when I practice doing her hair. Great for at home work n hey my niece loves to do hair n the fact that the manakin head doesn&#x27;t move when she&#x27;s doing her hair is a plus.</li>
            <li> I used this base for my wig head only twice.  The third time I went to use it to place my wig head on it for curling my unit the suction base / handle would not suction.  The base is no good if it doesn&#x27;t suction, the whole purpose of me purchasing it is to anchor my wig heads so that i could curl my units.  I&#x27;m disappointed that I have to return this one and wait on another one from a different seller.  Oh, lets not forget I have to wait to receive my refund and take a trip to the UPS store to return it.  Bad Quality Product.</li>
            <li> This gets the job done. I have no problem with it suctioning to my desk but if I walk away for a while it tends to loose it&#x27;s grip. Not really a bit deal as I can just suction it again. The grip, when it does work, is very secure and sturdy. I had no issues putting the two pieces together and feel like it is worth the money spent on it.</li>
            <li> The suction on this only lasts for about 8 hours.  Also, it does not fit all Styrofoam heads. Like many things it&#x27;s made in China.</li>
            <li> The mannequin head is kinda hard to keep on this but overall I am pleased with my purchase. The suction holds tight!</li>
            <li> This is a terrific piece of equipment. The suction works just fine. Like all suction devices, the gasket (seal) needs to be kept clean and grease free. It should only be placed on very smooth, clean surfaces such as a counter top, too. Would definitely buy again! The tilting mechanism is a real bonus for styling!</li>
            <li> i was completely expecting it to not keep its hold to my desk but it was amazing. amazing product. and for its price totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li> Works very good..I like it better than the old ones they give you in school.</li>
            <li> Amazon had matched this up with the Mehron Professional Make-up &amp; Face Painting Student Practice Head that I was purchasing, so I bought both.  This suction base manikin holder is NOT compatible with the practice head as Amazon suggested.  The suction base seems to be a great tool, but I am only rating it 2 stars because it does not give you any indication as to what heads it is compatible with.</li>
            <li> This did not suction to any surface, not even a glass table.</li>
            <li> does not stick to surfaces good at all !!!</li>
            <li> Great product and quick shipping</li>
            <li> The idea of this contraption is great. Unfortunately the suction that attaches the stand to the table does not hold in place longer than a few minutes and you have to keep re-attaching the stand to the table! This makes the job longer because you have to keep stopping to reattach and adjust the stand. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I wish I had gotten a clamp to hold my mannequin head on because this suction base manikin holder totally sucks. I have to fix this about 6 times in less then a minute. And keep fixing it a hundred times just to get a hairstyle done. Very displeased with this.</li>
            <li> it is frustrating because it will not stay put</li>
            <li> the suction does not work i should have returned it</li>
            <li> This works out so much better than the clamp style that I purchased before.  Stays put on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Lost suction Co. said it was beyond return period bummer!</li>
            <li> Does the job perfect. It has a Secure  hold. No complaints. Arrived on time. Easy to use. I would get again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and wanted. I like that you can adjust the angle. Suction on vanity top is rock solid. Seems well built and works great for my purposes. Very satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> Suction does not work!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stays on a glass surface only. If it would suction on other surfaces too it would be a great buy.</li>
            <li> Moves smoothly. Easily adjust to any angle and tightens to stay in place. Very strong suction.</li>
            <li> so far so good, nice sturdy product.</li>
            <li> just what the wig ordered, holds the head in place so it can be syled</li>
            <li> Seller ships faster and product is true and on point.</li>
            <li> My foam wighead slides on easily, and this holder allows me to style my wig.&lt;br /&gt;There was a review that said that it was difficult to assemble-I don&#x27;t know what that was about-it comes in 2 pieces which go together easily. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
