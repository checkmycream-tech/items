            <li>This perfume smells good but the problem is that the scent is extremely strong.</li>

            <li>I am glad that Amazon has this great cologne in stock, and the price is just right.</li>

            <li>Pay attention and do the right thing in good faith....destry@frontiernet.net</li>
            <li>I had enjoyed this cologne many, many years ago and had not seen it available in any retail establishments for quite some time.</li>
            <li>Amazon.com has the same size bottle for a very good prize.  </li>
            <li>Photo is great - but this bottle we recieved has turned (old??)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad its still available from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with whole experience.</li>
            <li>When I first smelled this wonderful scent, it was meeting my future hubby!</li>
            <li>In my own opinion I rate this product very high</li>
            <li>Spain  or at  Duty Free Airport Stores.</li>
            <li>is saying much - I sometimes mix it with Kenzo just to give it my own twist but</li>
            <li>I will happily purchase from them again in the future.</li>
            <li>In all I am happy with the purchase because I can&#x27;t seem to find this locally.</li>
            <li>I just replaced it with the one from my old bottle and was good to go.</li>
            <li>The bottle isn&#x27;t as nice as the older ones, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Always liked this light classic sent.  </li>
            <li>Didnt smell like the original.  </li>
            <li>This is a great cologne and a true classic but more for nights since it last maybe 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li>Very, very happy with price and ease of ordering this hard to find scent.</li>
            <li>Its hard to find in Mexico, exquisitive scent for men and a perfect gift for my dad.</li>
            <li>Good overall experience</li>
            <li>Cool, clean and crisp.</li>
            <li>My husband has been using this scent for a good many years which we usually bought in Florida.</li>
            <li>either way it is a great manly scent when used in small amounts.</li>
            <li>The aroma is pleasant and long lasting, products sold off by Cheesbourough Ponds but maintains the original qualities.</li>
            <li>Just a sharp, clean, pleasantly chemical scent that goes a long way with just a quick spritz.</li>
            <li>At first I read the reviews online for this cologne</li>
            <li>Thanks Lagerfeld, I&#x27;m Photo-genic for now!</li>
            <li>I collect more than I wear cologne so for me to be comfortable using this everyday</li>
            <li>I overdid it at first because of all of the sneezing I inflicted and the wilted crops left in my wake, but when judiciously applied can have a good effect, better to smell too good than too bad!</li>
            <li>Have used Lagerfeld Photo for many years, tried a new scent and we&#x27;re going back to Photo.  </li>
            <li>I am hesitant to say how much I like it, and how much others compliment it, because I like it so much.</li>
            <li>My husband likes this cologne - me, not so much</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and the smell is very off.  </li>
            <li>Very versatile.</li>
            <li>Very helpful with issues</li>
            <li>and I will definitely buy more when I get near the end of this bottle.</li>
            <li>A note to the male of the species - when you&#x27;re picked up on by cashier girls and waitresses, you should feel special, but when you&#x27;re picked up on by a bank teller, who knows how much money you have and wants to be with you anyway....</li>
            <li>I get more compliments when I wear Photo than when I wear other colognes.</li>
            <li>And since the shipping was super fast, I will no longer even look for it locally.</li>
            <li>I have only been wearing it for a couple of days and so far everything seems fine.</li>
            <li>There are other colognes by other makers  that are far superior.  </li>
            <li>It goes on strong but within a half hour it mellows out</li>
            <li>You do not need to spray much to get the effect and you can smell subtle and sexy without making people tear up in your wake.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s off the market, for the most part, and can be hard to find other than on the Internet, where it&#x27;s readily available.</li>
            <li>but once it goes on your skin, it releases a very soft masculine scent that you can wear every day.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this its hard to find</li>
            <li>But to my surprise, it was much cheaper than I ever paid before locally!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to run across it again after a spur of the moment search here on Amazon.       </li>
            <li>He is also a professional photographer, so that may be why he likes it.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 bottles of this garbage because it said old formula( which I noticed you removed from the description 2 days ago).</li>
            <li>Mostly good for casual use or evenings out with friends.</li>
            <li>I am having a little concern right now because you really cannot smell it very well after only about 4 hours of wear.</li>
            <li>Not sweet or fruity like most colognes, the scent is musky with a hint of the Far East, deep and mysterious.</li>
            <li>Classic Cologne that takes me back...</li>
            <li>A Little sweet for me.</li>
            <li>I do wish that they offered a travel size of this scent so that my husband could pack it in his travel back, as this large of size is much to big to pack.</li>
            <li>; I settled on Photo - what can I say, Germans generally do things well, and Herr Lagerfeld is no exception!</li>
            <li>Only problem was plastic ring on top was broken.</li>
            <li>Recently I resolved to improve my appearance, my manners, and my SMELL - personally, the combination of motor oil, coal-tar solvents and gunpowder residue is my preferred aroma, but taking quick and choppy baby steps toward the easiest of those goals to reach, for some reason I thought...</li>
            <li>I remember the scent lasting much longer with other bottles I have ordered before.</li>
            <li>The scent&#x27;s disappear rapidly  and are certainly not long lasting.  </li>
            <li>I totally love this cologne and it is one of my husband&#x27;s favorites, but it is a little hard to find.</li>
            <li>For any other special occasions, I&#x27;d make a different choice only because of personal preferrence (and the fact that I do have other choices - can you say cologne lover!!).</li>

            <li> Not sweet or fruity like most colognes, the scent is musky with a hint of the Far East, deep and mysterious.</li>
            <li> Classic Cologne that takes me back...</li>
            <li> A Little sweet for me.</li>
            <li> I do wish that they offered a travel size of this scent so that my husband could pack it in his travel back, as this large of size is much to big to pack.</li>
            <li> ; I settled on Photo - what can I say, Germans generally do things well, and Herr Lagerfeld is no exception!</li>
            <li> Only problem was plastic ring on top was broken.</li>
            <li> Recently I resolved to improve my appearance, my manners, and my SMELL - personally, the combination of motor oil, coal-tar solvents and gunpowder residue is my preferred aroma, but taking quick and choppy baby steps toward the easiest of those goals to reach, for some reason I thought...</li>
            <li> I remember the scent lasting much longer with other bottles I have ordered before.</li>
            <li> The scent&#x27;s disappear rapidly  and are certainly not long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I totally love this cologne and it is one of my husband&#x27;s favorites, but it is a little hard to find.</li>
            <li> For any other special occasions, I&#x27;d make a different choice only because of personal preferrence (and the fact that I do have other choices - can you say cologne lover!!).</li>
            <li> I have two small bottles of the real stuff from years ago.</li>
            <li> My husband does not recommend it because the fixer does not last long and have to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Este</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Besides the fact that I&#x27;m a photographer and like the name, it&#x27;s pretty subtle, which I like, and have been using for about 30 years.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this product  for a long time,girls compliment me  on this cologne often.</li>
            <li> This cologne will not wow you if you are sniffing at it from the nozzle of the bottle</li>
            <li> This fragrance remains one of my favorites, still has that mellow smell, not loud, but stays with you all day, with continue to use and purchase from amazon.</li>
            <li> None of the colognes come close to how long this lasts.</li>
            <li> Be careful it doesn&#x27;t take much of it to last all day and all night.</li>
            <li> did not have the same scent as when I bought it in other stores like BURDINE&#x27;S from the US or at El Corte Ingles from Madrid,</li>
            <li> The packaging is a little different for this size compared to the last size I purchased, but it&#x27;s a legit bottle.</li>
            <li> But not last long a few hours alone.</li>
            <li> Other than that it was delivered on time, and well packed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;May be due to cost ?</li>
            <li> Been using it since 1988, and wont replace it with any other (ask my wife) :</li>
            <li> guys forget about all other colognes.</li>
            <li> Well I am updating my previous review.</li>
            <li> Have ordered this from amazon years ago, and was fine, but this last bottle we ordered was horrible.</li>
            <li> Now it seems like something  is missing in both and Photo and the Clasic.  </li>
            <li> Not easy to find in Cleveland.</li>
            <li> I usually make cologne choices based on the intended occasion, and this one I would give a thumbs up for &#x27;every day&#x27; use.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to describe the fragrance except what it is not.  </li>
            <li> I been using photo , for the past 25 yrs.</li>
            <li> So they didnt complain :/</li>
            <li> I have been buying this brand for my husband for the past 20 years</li>
            <li> This cologne has a very sentimental meaning to me.</li>
            <li> This is the same crap as the &amp;#34;non-old formula. ....</li>
            <li> Deceitful, misrepresentation, false hopes of once was this product.</li>
            <li> and I must say that I was a bit skeptical, however, after placing my order, and compliments must go out to Amazon for the on-time delivery</li>
            <li> And receive wrong item</li>
            <li> Not what I rtemember, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a great cologne and a true classic but more for nights since it last maybe 3-4 hours. Other than that it was delivered on time, and well packed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne spray for years. It&#x27;s off the market, for the most part, and can be hard to find other than on the Internet, where it&#x27;s readily available. I am hesitant to say how much I like it, and how much others compliment it, because I like it so much.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this product  for a long time,girls compliment me  on this cologne often. Found it on  Amazon!</li>
            <li> Lagerfeld Spray bought here did not have the same scent as when I bought it in other stores like BURDINE&#x27;S from the US or at El Corte Ingles from Madrid, Spain  or at  Duty Free Airport Stores. Lagerfeld Spray had practically no scent  with a predominant alcohol smell.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this cologne - me, not so much but it was received promptly and in good shape.</li>
            <li> I totally love this cologne and it is one of my husband&#x27;s favorites, but it is a little hard to find. I am glad that Amazon has this great cologne in stock, and the price is just right.</li>
            <li> Photo by Karl Lagerfeld for Men, Eau De Toilette Spray 4.2 Ounces:  My husband has been using this scent for a good many years which we usually bought in Florida. Amazon.com has the same size bottle for a very good prize.  It was a pleasure dealing with Amazon.com and receiving the order in good time.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Fast shipping. Recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Good overall experience</li>
            <li> My husband enjoys this scent, and I love the smell on him.  Have used Lagerfeld Photo for many years, tried a new scent and we&#x27;re going back to Photo.  I do wish that they offered a travel size of this scent so that my husband could pack it in his travel back, as this large of size is much to big to pack.</li>
            <li> This cologne will not wow you if you are sniffing at it from the nozzle of the bottle but once it goes on your skin, it releases a very soft masculine scent that you can wear every day. I usually make cologne choices based on the intended occasion, and this one I would give a thumbs up for &#x27;every day&#x27; use. You do not need to spray much to get the effect and you can smell subtle and sexy without making people tear up in your wake. For any other special occasions, I&#x27;d make a different choice only because of personal preferrence (and the fact that I do have other choices - can you say cologne lover!!). I collect more than I wear cologne so for me to be comfortable using this everyday is saying much - I sometimes mix it with Kenzo just to give it my own twist but either way it is a great manly scent when used in small amounts.</li>
            <li> Smells great on my husband.he won&#x27;t wear anything else</li>
            <li> I have used Lagerfeld Photo for years and love it. I was extremely happy to find it still available. Service from this supplier was quick and the product arrived in good condition. I couldn&#x27;t have asked for better! I will happily purchase from them again in the future.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to describe the fragrance except what it is not.  No sweetness, floral or citrus characteristics.  Just a sharp, clean, pleasantly chemical scent that goes a long way with just a quick spritz.</li>
            <li> The aroma is pleasant and long lasting, products sold off by Cheesbourough Ponds but maintains the original qualities. Cheapened the packaging but not the price&lt;br /&gt; still a good product</li>
            <li> I bought this item thru Amazon, simply because I could no longer find it locally. But to my surprise, it was much cheaper than I ever paid before locally! And since the shipping was super fast, I will no longer even look for it locally. I will continue to shop Amazon instead.</li>
            <li> Great cologne, great price, fast shipping. The bottle isn&#x27;t as nice as the older ones, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I had enjoyed this cologne many, many years ago and had not seen it available in any retail establishments for quite some time. I was pleasantly surprised to run across it again after a spur of the moment search here on Amazon.       It was just as I remembered. Cool, clean and crisp. Mostly good for casual use or evenings out with friends. All in all, it is a great scent to me and I will definitely buy more when I get near the end of this bottle.</li>
            <li> Buy it all the time; good value.</li>
            <li> Photo is great - but this bottle we recieved has turned (old??) and the smell is very off.  Have ordered this from amazon years ago, and was fine, but this last bottle we ordered was horrible.</li>
            <li> Husband&#x27;s favorite cologne</li>
            <li> Used Lagerfeld many years ago and loved it.  Now it seems like something  is missing in both and Photo and the Clasic.  The scent&#x27;s disappear rapidly  and are certainly not long lasting.  There are other colognes by other makers  that are far superior.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> This fragrance will satisfy the most finicky of olefactory glands. Not sweet or fruity like most colognes, the scent is musky with a hint of the Far East, deep and mysterious.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my father who says it is his favorite cologne. He is also a professional photographer, so that may be why he likes it. In all I am happy with the purchase because I can&#x27;t seem to find this locally.</li>
            <li> I turn heads when people are passing by ! Ummmmmm ! What he&#x27;s wearing? Great smell for the price . I recommended to every day use !</li>
            <li> Excellent cologne.  Very light fragrance that is perfect for day or evening.  Very versatile. This is also an amazing price.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments when I wear Photo than when I wear other colognes. Lagerfeld makes the best colognes that I &#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> my husband&#x27;s favorite scent</li>
            <li> Besides the fact that I&#x27;m a photographer and like the name, it&#x27;s pretty subtle, which I like, and have been using for about 30 years.</li>
            <li> At first I read the reviews online for this cologne and I must say that I was a bit skeptical, however, after placing my order, and compliments must go out to Amazon for the on-time delivery, I found out that this for me was a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent lasts all day and you also get the compliments which you look for in a good cologne.</li>
            <li> Nice cologne. A Little sweet for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because in your description you claimed it was the &amp;#34;old formula&amp;#34;. This is the same crap as the &amp;#34;non-old formula. ....no fragrance longevity....alcoholic presence that can make you choke when first sprayed....however a fleeting aroma of what it used to smell like. I know the difference! I have two small bottles of the real stuff from years ago. I bought 3 bottles of this garbage because it said old formula( which I noticed you removed from the description 2 days ago). Deceitful, misrepresentation, false hopes of once was this product. Many reviews state this as well. Pay attention and do the right thing in good faith....destry@frontiernet.net</li>
            <li> Perfect.  The product was much larger than I&lt;br /&gt;expected for that price. Very pleased with whole experience.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne and I buy it for him every year for Christmas. He hadn&#x27;t worn it in years but remembered it as a scent that earned him many compliments. I went online to find it and he wears it all the time.</li>
            <li> Buenos dias, el dia de hoy me tome la molestia para calificar esta compra, la cual cumplio con los parametros que esperabamos. Quedamos conforme con la compra, gracias.</li>
            <li> Very Nice product no complaints ! I have been wearing it since 1982</li>
            <li> good product, at a great price.  good product, at a great price.  good product, at a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Photo by Karl Lagerfeld for decades. I&#x27;m glad its still available from Amazon. Only problem was plastic ring on top was broken. I just replaced it with the one from my old bottle and was good to go.</li>
            <li> Great scent, never over-powering.</li>
            <li> Received on time and is a Mozart for the nostrils. This has always been a wonderful fragrance to its loyal followers.</li>
            <li> Very good price for this cologne. I have only been wearing it for a couple of days and so far everything seems fine. I am having a little concern right now because you really cannot smell it very well after only about 4 hours of wear. I remember the scent lasting much longer with other bottles I have ordered before. I will keep everybody up to date if the scent does not last longer. Well I am updating my previous review. I have been wearing this for a couple of weeks and have stopped wearing it. I would ask people can they smell it an hour after I put it on and they nor me could smell a trace of the scent. I think this is counterfeit or out of date, will not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Does not smell the same anymore I used to get lots of complements on the way I smelled but something has changed&lt;br /&gt;May be due to cost ?</li>
            <li> Very, very happy with price and ease of ordering this hard to find scent. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Very helpful with issues</li>
            <li> This fragrance remains one of my favorites, still has that mellow smell, not loud, but stays with you all day, with continue to use and purchase from amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this cologn. Purchased for my husband</li>
            <li> I been using photo , for the past 25 yrs. In my own opinion I rate this product very high Lao I&#x27;m very satisfied .</li>
            <li> So glad I found this its hard to find and my dad loves it!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful masculine scent. I purchased as a valentine gift for my husband, and he gets brownie points every time he wears it.</li>
            <li> This cologne has a very sentimental meaning to me. When I first smelled this wonderful scent, it was meeting my future hubby! We are now gonna celebrate 17 blissful yrs. I credit this scent, for our &amp;#34;special nights&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li> Alright, as always. Thx.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells good but the problem is that the scent is extremely strong. I&#x27;ll give it to my husband. But not last long a few hours alone. My husband does not recommend it because the fixer does not last long and have to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Este perfume huele rico pero el problema que la aroma es muy extremadamente fuerte. Yo se lo regale a mi esposo. Pero no dura mucho solos unas cuantas horas.  Mi esposo no lo recomienda ya que el fijador no dura mucho y el tiene que volver a usarlo.</li>
            <li> Not what I rtemember, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> My #1 cologne!!! I love the wonderful smell of it, and I&#x27;m always being complimented!!!</li>
            <li> the fragrance is delicious, it&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> Smells great on me and really all the ladies i know love it. great scent for anyone who like to smell sexy</li>
            <li> Its hard to find in Mexico, exquisitive scent for men and a perfect gift for my dad. I love it!</li>
            <li> Recently I resolved to improve my appearance, my manners, and my SMELL - personally, the combination of motor oil, coal-tar solvents and gunpowder residue is my preferred aroma, but taking quick and choppy baby steps toward the easiest of those goals to reach, for some reason I thought...&amp;#34;German!&amp;#34; I settled on Photo - what can I say, Germans generally do things well, and Herr Lagerfeld is no exception! I know I overdid it at first because of all of the sneezing I inflicted and the wilted crops left in my wake, but when judiciously applied can have a good effect, better to smell too good than too bad! A note to the male of the species - when you&#x27;re picked up on by cashier girls and waitresses, you should feel special, but when you&#x27;re picked up on by a bank teller, who knows how much money you have and wants to be with you anyway....Thanks Lagerfeld, I&#x27;m Photo-genic for now!</li>
            <li> excelente producto muy buen vendedor . 100% recomendado, cumplio con lo acordado en la compra.</li>
            <li> Perfect item!!! Great service.</li>
            <li> Didnt smell like the original.  More of a stale smell. And receive wrong item so i just gave it away as a gift. So they didnt complain :/</li>
            <li> Classic Cologne that takes me back...&lt;br /&gt;I have always loved the catchy smell.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you sweetheart for this great Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Exactly how I remember it and at a great price. The packaging is a little different for this size compared to the last size I purchased, but it&#x27;s a legit bottle. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I could not find this anywhere in stores and I liked it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I went to Amazon and it was stocked and as I remember, was much&lt;br /&gt;more affordable than the last time I bought it.</li>
            <li> This scent is legendary,  you make a statement every time</li>
            <li> I have been buying this brand for my husband for the past 20 years and I love it! He likes it too!</li>
            <li> Horrible. The scent doesn&#x27;t last long. It seems to be counterfeit. I want my money back.</li>
            <li> Great. Have being using for 15 years.</li>
            <li> Watered-down Crap...never buy this</li>
            <li> Always liked this light classic sent.  All my girls like even more.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; excellent product!</li>
            <li> Perfume very beautiful and good quality, I hope that my son has a good performance with the girls and make many success and get better satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Been using it since 1988, and wont replace it with any other (ask my wife) :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frank M</li>
            <li> I have used Photo for years.Lot&#x27;s of good comments.Not easy to find in Cleveland. The price is great, baught two for th price&lt;br /&gt;of one here in town.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2THMZR7DZD5AI]]OK guys forget about all other colognes. If a woman doesn&#x27;t like this it is because she doesn&#x27;t have a nose.  Now and then over the years i try different colognes just for a change. None of the colognes come close to how long this lasts. Be careful it doesn&#x27;t take much of it to last all day and all night. It goes on strong but within a half hour it mellows out and I don&#x27;t smell it but everyone else does.</li>
