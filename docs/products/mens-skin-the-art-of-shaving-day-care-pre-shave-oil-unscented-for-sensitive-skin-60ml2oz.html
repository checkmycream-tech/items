            <li>/&gt;This is by far the best - it preps my skin perfectly for the shave.</li>
            <li>This is a good oil.</li>
            <li>the product is great, and it works even better in a sauna.</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I prefer the lavender oil as it is more pleasant</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice but overpriced.</li>
            <li>when you&#x27;re done, it washes off the face very easily and does not leave an oily residue.  </li>
            <li>The result is no razor burns, and a VERY smooth skin.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure why I do that anymore</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure why I do that anymore</li>
            <li>If you shave, you will love this oil.</li>
            <li>but this oil makes it more bearable</li>
            <li>And on top of that, I did not get a close, smooth shave!  </li>
            <li>Great price and arrived fast.</li>
            <li>Give it a shot and you will see a pretty good difference in your skins</li>
            <li>It works best if you clean your face first and are shaving with hot water.</li>
            <li>It is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shave I experience is enjoyable and compared to shaving cream, I like being able to watch the blade move over the exact whiskers and area that I am shaving.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Both shaving oils work very well, and provide an effective, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>and she likes the smooth face and that just ends up working out well for both of</li>
            <li>and she likes the smooth face and that just ends up working out well for both of</li>
            <li>It costs more, but worth the price.</li>
            <li>I also use a brush to lather the shave cream and the after shave to get smooth skin.</li>
            <li>The oil goes on smooth and will not leave a film on your face.</li>
            <li>and my face remains smooth and moist all day.  </li>
            <li>I never heard of such a thing, but I have to say it absolutely makes for the best shave ever.  </li>
            <li>but I prefer Truehill &amp; Fit&#x27;s cream that you can apply by hand because it is unscented and has a mild antiseptic.  </li>
            <li>the razor gets oily and hairs stick inside, water wont clean the razor, had to use soap, what a mess!&lt;br /&gt;i might use this oil for massage or something else</li>
            <li>I take clean shaving seriously!ðŸ˜¶</li>
            <li>But, more importantly, it really does make for a significantly smoother shave.</li>
            <li>This is essential to a good shave with the Art of Shaving</li>
            <li>It takes time to find all the right ingredients for a great shave--you must find the blade that works with your facial hair, the right soap, brush, but the oil has made the biggest difference for me.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my bikini area &amp; it has made a tremendous difference.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for pre-shave oil for a while and used MANY products (depilatory to high end).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these products and highly recommend them all.</li>
            <li>I was hooked the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>My brother-in-law introduced me to Art of Shaving shave cream, which I have found to be better than anything I ever used in 40 years of shaving my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing to complain about as it comes to the useful quality of this product.</li>
            <li>It has a mild, eucalyptus-like smell that I like and when I rub it in, I really can see that the whiskers have been raised up.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and my face and neck used to be easily irritated or nicked when I used shaving gels.</li>
            <li>Take a hot shower&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using this product to enhance my daily shaving chore.</li>
            <li>I shave in the shower daily and it takes me 10-15 more seconds to apply this oil, so it is also not something that extends your shaving routine in any way.</li>
            <li>The shave that I get is closer and the most important thing to me, I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of shaving creams but always got a little redness and some razor burn.  </li>
            <li>Needed this and the Art of Shaving website had this for a very high price.  </li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s a huge fan and says it makes a big difference in the way his face feels.</li>
            <li>and I have to shave everyday and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t really need it when I use the pre-shave oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; that doesn&#x27;t really work, this is basically that glide strip but applied on your whole face and it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also found out that my skin really likes oils and when I use this product I don&#x27;t get rashes from shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Not cheap,but very quality products.</li>
            <li>Using this with the shaving cream - highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Packages came very neatly wrapped (glass bottles).</li>
            <li>I threw away 2 brand new blades!  </li>
            <li>There are better, and less costly, alternatives out there for a pre-shave oil.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of high end products.</li>
            <li>But, you have to remember that you&#x27;re getting 3.5 oz, compared to the little droppers that you get from most companies.</li>
            <li>This shaving oil makes for smooth shaving with minimal nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>He has sensitive skin and a lot of fast growing hair.  </li>
            <li>so you need to be a little more diligent about keeping the blade area from getting clogged up by rinsing it a little more frequently while you are shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>(This is sold as a pre-shave oil, but no other products are really needed.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I first tried it about 3 years ago, and won&#x27;t go back to the shaving cream in a can.  </li>
            <li>Recently, I checked reviews and found this product to be slightly higher rated.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my husband with sensitive skin~</li>
            <li>My fiancee has odor-induced asthma and can&#x27;t be near me if I use this product.</li>
            <li>Another one of my least favorite preshaves.</li>
            <li>One review below used the word &amp;#34;gamechanger&amp;#34; and I would also go so far as to use that word.&lt;br</li>
            <li>when I change the blade, I put the D/E razor in 90% Isopropyl alcohol or just rub it with a paper towel with alcohol on it and that removes any trace of old whiskers and oil residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>when I change the blade, I put the D/E razor in 90% Isopropyl alcohol or just rub it with a paper towel with alcohol on it and that removes any trace of old whiskers and oil residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Does not clog your pores or give you zits, leaves skin feeling soft all day.</li>
            <li>I visited one of The Art of Shaving stores, and the gal that helped me gave me a few free samples of this oil...</li>
            <li>The oil protects while it promotes smoother action from the blades.  </li>
            <li>I had read reviews that warned about the oil being too thick and clogging up blades, but there were more reviews raving about the oil</li>
            <li>First, a few drops on both sides of the face and the shaving areas, rubbing the oil in a little bit, having only prepared the face by washing with warm water.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this (and a similar British one) for years now - an absolute must for anyone with sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Even though it is not actually unscented, the scent is very pleasing (just mild sandalwood), and does not trigger my usual allergic reaction to perfumes.</li>
            <li>Sometimes shaving cream obscures minor contours and smaller hairs that get missed but with this oil, I can watch exactly what I&#x27;m doing</li>
            <li>I switched to this product because I developed allergies from the other more common products that you find in Rite Aid.</li>
            <li>Very sensitive and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Using the pre shave oil gives a better, less iritating shave, plain and simple.</li>

            <li> This oil does what it is supposed to. But it is supposed to be unscented and it smells a bit like cloves, which i don&#x27;t care for. It also goes on very thick. There are better, and less costly, alternatives out there for a pre-shave oil. But if you purchase this, mix it with a little water on your hand and it will go on easier.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband with sensitive skin~ he loves it! He hasn&#x27;t had any razor burns using this great product! Highly recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s a huge fan and says it makes a big difference in the way his face feels. I agree.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but overpriced.</li>
            <li> Using the pre shave oil gives a better, less iritating shave, plain and simple. There may be a less expensive product but so far I haven&#x27;t found something that works the same and costs less. Stick with this. Use a good after shave balm and you will feel great.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing my son can use to shave and not be irriated and all red.  Very sensitive and dry skin.  Perfect  for him and has used for several years.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Not at all unscented.  My fiancee has odor-induced asthma and can&#x27;t be near me if I use this product.</li>
            <li> Another one of my least favorite preshaves. Entirely too sticky for me... It leaves a nasty ring of shaved hair around the sink after the water drains, even when using a little bit. I prefer something between the runny splashes out there... and this glue product.</li>
            <li> My brother-in-law introduced me to Art of Shaving shave cream, which I have found to be better than anything I ever used in 40 years of shaving my sensitive skin.  Through that introduction I discovered the Pre Shave Oil.  I never heard of such a thing, but I have to say it absolutely makes for the best shave ever.  I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as some, to say I would shave using only it, but I will say I may not have to use the expensive AoS shave cream to get a close shave without irritating my skin as long as I apply the Pre Shave Oil first.</li>
            <li> This is essential to a good shave with the Art of Shaving shave cream.  I first tried it about 3 years ago, and won&#x27;t go back to the shaving cream in a can.  This little bottle lasts a long time, as you only need a few drops (about a dime-sized dollop in the palm of your hand).  I&#x27;m a customer for life.</li>
            <li> Needed this and the Art of Shaving website had this for a very high price.  This was way cheaper.  Service was great.</li>
            <li> 5 stars because this changed my D/E shaving routine for the better.  One review below used the word &amp;#34;gamechanger&amp;#34; and I would also go so far as to use that word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did a little research on this before I bought it to see if you could use it without shaving cream.  And you definitely can.  Although Art of Shaving will probably say you should use their shaving cream, you don&#x27;t need to, in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaving cream is not soap but I prefer Truehill &amp; Fit&#x27;s cream that you can apply by hand because it is unscented and has a mild antiseptic.  However, I don&#x27;t really need it when I use the pre-shave oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil does a number of things for me.  First, a few drops on both sides of the face and the shaving areas, rubbing the oil in a little bit, having only prepared the face by washing with warm water.  It has a mild, eucalyptus-like smell that I like and when I rub it in, I really can see that the whiskers have been raised up.  Now, without shaving cream, I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ever shaved with one of those old-fashioned razor cartridges like they sell at Wal-Mart that comes with a &amp;#34;glide strip&amp;#34; that doesn&#x27;t really work, this is basically that glide strip but applied on your whole face and it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave I experience is enjoyable and compared to shaving cream, I like being able to watch the blade move over the exact whiskers and area that I am shaving.  Sometimes shaving cream obscures minor contours and smaller hairs that get missed but with this oil, I can watch exactly what I&#x27;m doing and there is no cream in the way.  The shave that I get is closer and the most important thing to me, I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of shaving creams but always got a little redness and some razor burn.  I have not been getting redness or razor burn since starting to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then when you&#x27;re done, it washes off the face very easily and does not leave an oily residue.  It does leave the face feeling moist and I like that.  But not like oily or greasy moist.  So that is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, I still apply a little Proraso after-shave.  I&#x27;m not even sure why I do that anymore except that I like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I have noticed and I don&#x27;t consider this a big drawback compared to the benefit, is that the whiskers and shaving oil can clog up your blade a little bit so you need to be a little more diligent about keeping the blade area from getting clogged up by rinsing it a little more frequently while you are shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every few shaves, about when I change the blade, I put the D/E razor in 90% Isopropyl alcohol or just rub it with a paper towel with alcohol on it and that removes any trace of old whiskers and oil residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to put off shaving when I used Mach 3 cartridges, basically because they were making me go broke so I would try to go as long as I could without shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I look forward to shaving.  And the benefit is that my wife never did like my scruff and she likes the smooth face and that just ends up working out well for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find myself now watching TV or walking around seeing guys with horrendous goatees and facial hair  ... and I want to shave it off ...st and I like that.  But not like oily or greasy moist.  So that is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, I still apply a little Proraso after-shave.  I&#x27;m not even sure why I do that anymore except that I like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I have noticed and I don&#x27;t consider this a big drawback compared to the benefit, is that the whiskers and shaving oil can clog up your blade a little bit so you need to be a little more diligent about keeping the blade area from getting clogged up by rinsing it a little more frequently while you are shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every few shaves, about when I change the blade, I put the D/E razor in 90% Isopropyl alcohol or just rub it with a paper towel with alcohol on it and that removes any trace of old whiskers and oil residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to put off shaving when I used Mach 3 cartridges, basically because they were making me go broke so I would try to go as long as I could without shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I look forward to shaving.

            <li> I switched to this product because I developed allergies from the other more common products that you find in Rite Aid. I also found out that my skin really likes oils and when I use this product I don&#x27;t get rashes from shaving.&lt;br /&gt; So since I started using this product no allergies and no rashes! I am happy!!</li>
            <li> This stuff makes the biggest difference in the world! Use it with the Art of Shaving soap (not the cream), and their after shave balm, and kiss razor burn and ingrown hairs goodbye! It costs more, but worth the price.</li>
            <li> One of those life-changing products for the man in your life!  This is a staple on our &amp;#34;Dad&#x27;s Gift List,&amp;#34; so we can keep him stocked year-&#x27;round.</li>
            <li> I have used the sample trial to determine if I would like the product and here I am purchasing a larger bottle. Once I took the time to actually look into the art of shaving (not the brand but actually shaving) I noticed a huge difference. As males we tend to at time disregard the part of taking care of the skin and stuff like that. Give it a shot and you will see a pretty good difference in your skins health.&lt;br /&gt;Easy -&lt;br /&gt;1) Take a hot shower&lt;br /&gt;2) Apply the oil to the facial area that will be shaved.&lt;br /&gt;3) Lather (I use a shaving soap vs. gel in a can)&lt;br /&gt;4) Shave (short strokes) with the grain.&lt;br /&gt;5) Lather&lt;br /&gt;6) Shave against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;7) Wash face with cold water&lt;br /&gt;8) Apply after shave balm (The Art of Shaving has an actual product too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Done.</li>
            <li> Have been using this (and a similar British one) for years now - an absolute must for anyone with sensitive skin! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is a good oil. There is nothing to complain about as it comes to the useful quality of this product. The unscented scent is a little odd, and certainly not unscented. I prefer the lavender oil as it is more pleasant smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing about this oil is that it&#x27;s expensive. But, you have to remember that you&#x27;re getting 3.5 oz, compared to the little droppers that you get from most companies. You only need to press on a little. It works best if you clean your face first and are shaving with hot water.</li>
            <li> the product is great, and it works even better in a sauna. i&#x27;ve been using it every single time i shave</li>
            <li> Never had a closer shave!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the Art of saving product. Not cheap,but very quality products. I have a very heavy beard, and a very sensitive skin,&lt;br /&gt;so this oil help to achive a great shave.</li>
            <li> the razor gets oily and hairs stick inside, water wont clean the razor, had to use soap, what a mess!&lt;br /&gt;i might use this oil for massage or something else</li>
            <li> This stuff right here...is awesome.</li>
            <li> using for many years...develops a softness to my beard which carries over during the day...recommended it very highly for those wishing to create a great shave</li>
            <li> I really love these products! I take clean shaving seriously!ðŸ˜¶</li>
            <li> Lets my DE razor glide my tough beard with ease!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I wanted to find something unscented and this stuff was great.  I have been using it for about two weeks and I have to shave everyday and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> This shaving oil makes for smooth shaving with minimal nicks and cuts.  I have been using this product for 2 years and get the closest smoothest shave.  I also use a brush to lather the shave cream and the after shave to get smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Ordered it as a gift and my son-in-law loves it.</li>
            <li> Art of Shaving is the only product I use to shave with. The oil goes on smooth and will not leave a film on your face. Makes my razor glide with ease.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for pre-shave oil for a while and used MANY products (depilatory to high end).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best - it preps my skin perfectly for the shave. I love these products and highly recommend them all.</li>
            <li> I like it..it just does not seem to last very long on the skin...maybe it is just me.  I would recommend if needed, but I will try somethin else.</li>
            <li> The oil does seem to help avoid cutting my face, but it&#x27;s next to impossible to get off my hands.  I also bought the &amp;#34;scent less&amp;#34; oil, but it has plenty of scent.  Fortunately it&#x27;s pleasant.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I love it!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this product to enhance my daily shaving chore. It has also allowed me to prolong the replacement of my Schick disposable razers. I now can use one for over 30 days!!!!</li>
            <li> Best shaving oil I have used, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of high end products. Does not clog your pores or give you zits, leaves skin feeling soft all day.</li>
            <li> Seems like something you don&#x27;t need, but it DOES make a difference! I visited one of The Art of Shaving stores, and the gal that helped me gave me a few free samples of this oil... I was hooked the first time I used it! Even though it is not actually unscented, the scent is very pleasing (just mild sandalwood), and does not trigger my usual allergic reaction to perfumes. But, more importantly, it really does make for a significantly smoother shave. I shave in the shower daily and it takes me 10-15 more seconds to apply this oil, so it is also not something that extends your shaving routine in any way. The result is no razor burns, and a VERY smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to shaving oil in 1995, and have used it ever since. I have sensitive skin, and my face and neck used to be easily irritated or nicked when I used shaving gels. I shave in the shower, and only use shaving oil. (This is sold as a pre-shave oil, but no other products are really needed.&lt;br /&gt;For the last several years, I used shaving oil from Pacific Shaving Company purchased through Amazon. Recently, I checked reviews and found this product to be slightly higher rated. So I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;Big mistake. Both shaving oils work very well, and provide an effective, comfortable shave.The advantage for the Pacific Shaving Company 2 ounce bottle is the ability to measure out drops from their plastic bottle. I used 5-6 drops per shave and my last bottle lasted over 9 months. The Art of Shaving bottle requires you to pour \\&quot;some\\&quot; into your hand. I&#x27;m hoping this 2 ounce bottle will last 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;At that point, I&#x27;ll switch back to the Pacific Shaving Company product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my bikini area &amp; it has made a tremendous difference.  Using this with the shaving cream - highly recommended!</li>
            <li> If you shave, you will love this oil.</li>
            <li> This oil makes for the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  It takes time to find all the right ingredients for a great shave--you must find the blade that works with your facial hair, the right soap, brush, but the oil has made the biggest difference for me.</li>
            <li> This is all the difference for a great shave.  I can&#x27;t stand shaving but this oil makes it more bearable and my face remains smooth and moist all day.  The oil protects while it promotes smoother action from the blades.  This is a game changer for me.</li>
            <li> It seems that I cannot avoid cutting myself when I shave but this product definitely minimizes the self induced carnage.  It is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I received The product sooner than expected. Packages came very neatly wrapped (glass bottles). I will be ordering this product again soon.</li>
            <li> Extremely thick!!  I bought this to shave my bikini line after reading an article that recommended it.  Big mistake!!  It was so thick that it  immediately gunked up the brand new blades of my razor!  I threw away 2 brand new blades!  And on top of that, I did not get a close, smooth shave!  I had read reviews that warned about the oil being too thick and clogging up blades, but there were more reviews raving about the oil so I went with the  majority.  My mistake.  My husband tried it on his face and had the same result...clogged blades and a worse shave than if he had shaved using just water like he normally does when in a hurry.  I didn&#x27;t even bother returning the product for a refund, I just tossed it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Great price and arrived fast.</li>
            <li> I buy this every few months for my hubby.  He has sensitive skin and a lot of fast growing hair.  He shaves his face and head several times a week.  He loves this product.</li>
