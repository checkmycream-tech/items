            <li>I love the eyebrow shapers they really help you get a perfect eye brow!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent powder with a soft texture.  </li>
            <li>It looked very good in high definition photographs.</li>
            <li>it looks more of a grayish color</li>
            <li>Love the color of this brow makeup.</li>
            <li>I need a product that somehow makes the powder stays on the brows better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li>My first powder eye brow and Loved this :)</li>
            <li>both aren&#x27;t that easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love this powder and it comes with a great brush and 3 terrific stencils.</li>
            <li>Product is it wears off very quickly.</li>
            <li>Yes, I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>this product is so worth its value!</li>
            <li>It was an okay product didn&#x27;t really do the job for me, but it will have to do.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a good alternate....</li>
            <li>i will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li>Not really that good to me.</li>
            <li>Great make-up but just not dark enough for my brows.</li>
            <li>It also stays on all day and is easy to apply, and looks natural.</li>
            <li>It works great for my light complexion with dark blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Plan to but more in the upcoming future.</li>
            <li>the packaging originally made me think this product was from the early 90s.</li>
            <li>the powder doesn&#x27;t really stay on and the brush is not a helpful tool at all.</li>
            <li>It came earlier than I expected it to, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>So I saw this low price item and went for it for it being my first</li>
            <li>the brush is super cheap worse than the one I got at the $.99 store</li>
            <li>It leaves my eyebrows professional</li>
            <li>I think the brush is fine, suited to what it is used for, the bristles should be short and stiff and they are.</li>
            <li>I just really wish I can return this and get my money back completely&#x27;s a waste do not waste your money!!!!</li>
            <li>The brush was too soft to allow the brow powder to actually help define my brow.</li>

            <li> I can see it lasting a long time as well.  </li>

            <li> a little goes a long way which helps make this product last.</li>
            <li> The brush is too big, unless you like a really heavy brows!</li>
            <li> I have never filled in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Brush was a little thick and hard but work  well enough, also the stencils were a little to thick for my eyebrows</li>
            <li> what I wanted but, just for me, a little difficult to open</li>
            <li> This was the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever bought on Amazon so far is extremely tiny</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this</li>
            <li> In addition the eyebrow strips/stencils were WAY too thin for anyone in 2013.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with eyebrows</li>
            <li> I like the three stencils it came with but slightly awkward when trying to apply the powder.</li>

            <li> The product arrive on time which was great. Also, the brown was a perfect color to my brow color, and fills in ok. However, it does take a few coats of applying to get a complete fill of the brow. The brow brush is light weight and great for applying the brow powder. I like the three stencils it came with but slightly awkward when trying to apply the powder.</li>
            <li> Just perfect! Obsessed with eyebrows and this makes the perfect finish</li>
            <li> what I wanted but, just for me, a little difficult to open BUT BUT I am happy.</li>
            <li> the only thing i didnt like was the brush. I love the eyebrow shapers they really help you get a perfect eye brow!</li>
            <li> Not really that good to me. Needed to be darker for my skintone</li>
            <li> Works good. Brush was a little thick and hard but work  well enough, also the stencils were a little to thick for my eyebrows but I knew that from the reviews. I also bought a different brand one with stencils both aren&#x27;t that easy to use. But I just want to try it and for the price its a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder was the best out of the 3 I bought.</li>
            <li> This was the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever bought on Amazon so far is extremely tiny the brush is super cheap worse than the one I got at the $.99 store I just really wish I can return this and get my money back completely&#x27;s a waste do not waste your money!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this it looks more of a grayish color</li>
            <li> Love it! Plan to but more in the upcoming future. I will recommend this to my family and friends to use</li>
            <li> My wife likes this product and has no complaints.</li>
            <li> A great product , good price.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent powder with a soft texture.  Fills in my eye brows beautifully.  I can see it lasting a long time as well.  I bought it for my college graduation photos.  It looked very good in high definition photographs.</li>
            <li> My first powder eye brow and Loved this :)</li>
            <li> I have never filled in my eyebrows. So I saw this low price item and went for it for it being my first every eyebrows filler don&#x27;t like it the powder doesn&#x27;t really stay on and the brush is not a helpful tool at all.</li>
            <li> It was an okay product didn&#x27;t really do the job for me, but it will have to do.</li>
            <li> Yes, I enjoy using it. It came earlier than I expected it to, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> Love the color of this brow makeup. It works great for my light complexion with dark blonde hair. It also stays on all day and is easy to apply, and looks natural. The brush is too big, unless you like a really heavy brows! I use a different, stuffer, brow brush and like my results.</li>
            <li> I love this powder and it comes with a great brush and 3 terrific stencils. Product is it wears off very quickly. It is like putting eye shadow on your brows.In all fairness I do rub my eyebrows so that might add to the problem. I need a product that somehow makes the powder stays on the brows better. This does look nice when you put it on and the color is quite good.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  Very similar to the Maybelline brow powder they no longer make.  I think the brush is fine, suited to what it is used for, the bristles should be short and stiff and they are.</li>
            <li> Exactly the perfect brown color I wanted. The price is just soooo good and works awesome.. It leaves my eyebrows professional</li>
            <li> Great make-up but just not dark enough for my brows.</li>
            <li> this product is so worth its value! a little goes a long way which helps make this product last. i will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> I actually only bought this kit for the brush, but when i go it, I decided to use all of the products. The brush was too soft to allow the brow powder to actually help define my brow. In addition the eyebrow strips/stencils were WAY too thin for anyone in 2013. the packaging originally made me think this product was from the early 90s. When I saw the stencils I KNEW this couldnt have been created in the last decade. DO NOT BUY! This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I used to use brand name brow correctors $20+.  This is so much better!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok... rather use the gel type instead, but it&#x27;s a good alternate....</li>
