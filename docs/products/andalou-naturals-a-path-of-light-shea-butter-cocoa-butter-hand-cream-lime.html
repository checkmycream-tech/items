            <li>I found this on the EWG database, and have been very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>but I am realy happy with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s the good news.  </li>
            <li>I have loved every Andalou product I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>I love Andalou Naturals!</li>
            <li>If you really love lavendar, this is for you!</li>
            <li>Moisturizing power is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice scent that is not overly fragrant.  </li>
            <li>This formula moisturizes well and soaks in nicely.  </li>
            <li>Its really rich and creamy, and feel great on my hands.</li>
            <li>The lavender scent is too strong for me, but the cream is good quality.</li>
            <li>Very good all-around super-moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>Nice fresh lavender scent, not greasy or sticky, good price.</li>
            <li>I have a baby and a toddler, and I&#x27;m washing my hands probably twenty times a day or more.  </li>
            <li>I came across this product on Skindeep Safe Cosmetics web site.</li>
            <li>All the ingredients in this product are 100% safe.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I usually love everything by Andalou</li>
            <li>and I normally love lavendar....</li>
            <li>And no nasty chemicals!  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and it&#x27;s not too greasy at all.</li>
            <li>so all I can say is so far so good!</li>
            <li>I love this one just as much, and it even has a better smell!  </li>
            <li>Texture, smell, price, ingredients are all super!</li>
            <li>It is a great lotion and makes your hands feel super soft.</li>
            <li>The smell is lovely and my hands feel very moisturized after using it.  </li>
            <li>this really smells of lavender - lovely.  </li>
            <li>best hand cream so far as long as I remember to put it on !!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you want a light lotion and all-natural is a high priority, this may be a good choice.  </li>
            <li>No oily residual feeling, or feeling that it wasn&#x27;t absorbed.  </li>
            <li>I have since bought several other products from this company and have been happy with them all!</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer for hands and a delicate Lavendar smell.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant, though not overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s better than the vast majority of lotions available on Amazon, especially at this price</li>
            <li>Plus, I really like the smell.</li>
            <li>I tried another lotion that isn&#x27;t nearly as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and featured lots of no-doubt questionable ingredients, and it was much more effective at moisturizing my hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had previously been using the l&#x27;Occitane hand cream which I love</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li>It really helps with dry skin and absorbs quickly so hands don&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>This stuff is nice and thick and stays with you.  </li>
            <li>I am always trying natural products, especially moisturizers, and many are too flowery or doesn&#x27;t keep my skin moist for very long.  </li>
            <li>I generally check the ewg dot org / skindeep for information on beauty products, and this product rates a 1 from 0 to 9, where 0 is least hazardous.  </li>
            <li>I am a hand lotion fanatic always looking for one that smells good and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I like that this is a natural product and has a low toxicity rating from EWG.org.</li>
            <li>This lotion is super thick and creamy, moisturizes skin deeply, and leaves skin feeling like silk.  </li>
            <li>The bad news is that I haven&#x27;t found it very effective for dry skin on my hands.  </li>

            <li> Amazing!!!!!  This lotion is super thick and creamy, moisturizes skin deeply, and leaves skin feeling like silk.  The lavender scent is superb, too!!  I will continue to buy this.  I have loved every Andalou product I&#x27;ve tried-- so thankful there is such a high-quality vegan and cruelty-free product line, not to mention that their products deliver results!!  HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
            <li> Got this when Pharmaca is on sale. Texture, smell, price, ingredients are all super! And support local business: they&#x27;re from San Francisco Bay Area</li>
            <li> I ordered this tube of cream so I could keep it in my handbag. It is a great lotion and makes your hands feel super soft. The fragrance is a tad lighter than the lotion but I am realy happy with it.</li>

            <li> Love the smell and it&#x27;s not too greasy at all. I am a hand lotion fanatic always looking for one that smells good and lasts a long time.  I&#x27;ve found it and added it to my subscribe and save order.</li>
            <li> this really smells of lavender - lovely.  Its really rich and creamy, and feel great on my hands. No oily residual feeling, or feeling that it wasn&#x27;t absorbed.  I like that it is 85% organic too</li>
