            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>I am duly impressed to the point where I am returning to the fold and resuming my position as a H &amp; S</li>
            <li>All In 1 product is the best one we have tried in terms of effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>Gets rid of dandruff and leaves hair looking great.</li>
            <li>I think it was great to find this shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>the ingredients in this will take care of that great need.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent and has come a ong way from the stigma of being a &amp;#34;medicated&amp;#34; shampoo.  </li>
            <li>pleasant but not too perfumy in all the varieties I&#x27;ve tried&lt;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it states it is just for men; everyone in my family used it with good results.</li>
            <li>Thus, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li>It produces a good lather, which I like, and it does get rid of the flakes.</li>
            <li>He liked the scent, too, so it was good for both of us.</li>
            <li>My husband uses Head and Shoulders shampoo all the time, but this one smells so much better than the minty ones!  </li>
            <li>The fragrance of this shampoo is mild &amp; pleasant, the dandruff medication works great too.</li>
            <li>and Shoulders is amazing.</li>
            <li>shampoo plus conditioner is nice.  </li>
            <li>nice to run your fingers through</li>
            <li>Nice shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Over all, this is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>and sometimes it gives it a nice shine.  </li>
            <li>He never uses conditioner, so it&#x27;s nice that it is an all in one to include conditioner ...</li>
            <li>Head and Shoulders products provide a nice break for him in between these tarry treatments.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice dandruff-control solution.</li>
            <li>It also makes a nice lather without every feeling overly</li>
            <li>This All-In-1 version of Head and Shoulders is perfect for my husband, who doesn&#x27;t normally use conditioner.</li>
            <li>I was most impressed by the light, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>This &#x27;Head &amp; Shoulders for Men&#x27; 2-in-1 shampoo does a great job cleansing the hair (lathers up quickly and strips out grease/product effectively) and surprisingly provides a nice conditioned finish that feels and looks great once your hair is properly dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At times I was able to get this product for under $3, which is even cheaper than subscribe &amp; save.</li>
            <li>What more can I ask for?</li>
            <li>more can a guy ask for?</li>
            <li>It is a lovely mix of cedar and pine.  </li>
            <li>This is my son&#x27;s favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that is because of the touch of conditioner in this</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love about Head and Shoulders?</li>
            <li>My son has been using Head and Shoulders shampoo for many years.</li>
            <li>I like that it does not have the medicinal smell that many medicated shampoos have.</li>
            <li>I would say this smells more like soap, an unscented one.</li>
            <li>Overall a good all purpose shampoo/conditioner with a pleasant scent geared specifically for Men.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply to get complete coverage and has a very mild and pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>The Total Care All-in-1 for Men provides the perfect balance of clean and conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The most important factor in choosing a shampoo to him is that it doesn&#x27;t burn his eyes.</li>
            <li>improved version does a great job, My hair feels clean and fresh and the price is right.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, the suds are normal, it&#x27;s easy to wash out and the bottle is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It has a strong medicinal, chemical-like odor.  </li>
            <li>Hair smells nice and lathers pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Head and Shoulders is the best dandruff shampoo, hands down.</li>
            <li>(it says for men, but I believe it would be fine for ladies, too.)</li>
            <li>and I have been dandruff free ever since I started.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on my hair for the sake of writing this review and the light manly scent lasted for hours.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s all included in one wash, and his hair is looking great with no extra effort.</li>
            <li>I noticed my hair seemed much fuller after shampooing, but the downside is it seemed to cause a kind of &amp;#34;flyaway&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>As far as H&amp;S goes, this is good stuff.</li>
            <li>This one isn&#x27;t a great deviation from any of their other products and works well to control dandruff with a nice, fresh clean scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pleasant scent and light enough that it shouldn&#x27;t clash with colognes.</li>
            <li>And I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;Had the opportunity to try this full bottle</li>
            <li>The shampoo makes the hair soft to the touch and smooth, He is OK with the smell.</li>
            <li>Without having the heavy medicine smell of many competitor brand dandruff shampoos, Head and shoulders provides a very nice lather, clean feel, and nice results regarding dry scalp.</li>
            <li>It has a gentle smell, but makes the hair smell very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>This all-in-one package goes a long way to fixing this problem, both getting rid of the dandruff and also conditioning in one application, though it&#x27;s not quite as good as a separate conditioning wash.</li>
            <li>this Head and Shoulders shampoo is great for moisturizing down to the roots.</li>
            <li>For someone who experiences regular dandruff, this is an excellent long term solution.  </li>
            <li>I really like the scent on this package which is fresh and not overwhelming, and the bottle is also the perfect size to throw in a gym bag too.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!!!</li>
            <li>and he likes that it isn&#x27;t an overly strong fragrance, just enough and a refreshing</li>
            <li>This particular All-in-One has a rich lather, fresh scent, and rinses clean.</li>
            <li>I sometimes get dandruff and have trouble so it was great to have a product that cleans my hair, takes care of my dandruff and conditions too.</li>
            <li>far as the dandruff aspect of this goes, it is as effective as good old regular Head and Shoulders, it just leaves his hair a bit softer he says.  </li>
            <li>Of course it is aimed at men who , like me, rarely add conditioner to their hair.</li>
            <li>have used it myself when I inadvertently forgot to make sure my regular shampoo was in the shower before getting in and it worked pretty good at leaving my hair full yet tangle free and my hair is a bit past my shoulders and baby fine.</li>
            <li>So this one gets 4 stars for being good and holding me over between the other stuff, but not five - not going to make the switch permanently.</li>
            <li>I am going to be ordering the Classic Clean again and dumping this out.  </li>
            <li>I must admit that I am very brand loyal to Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a Head &amp; Shoulders variety that was both shampoo and conditioner, for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He said that guys care about their appearance as much as girls, they just need things streamlined for them to use and this does it all!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair with a soft and smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>This one smells better than most, but it has too much conditioner and leaves my hair feeling heavy and almost oily.  </li>
            <li>We have tried so many different shampoos for him, even a prescription one!</li>
            <li>My husband has been a fan of the brand for years, and he particularly likes the all-in-one formula for those quick summer showers on his shorter hair.</li>
            <li>While still providing the clean you&#x27;ve come to expect from Head and Shoulders, the conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft, without feeling oily.</li>
            <li>Not only will this shampoo give you a super clean head</li>
            <li>One thing I didn’t like about the regular Head and Shoulders was the smell, but this one doesn’t have that strong smell.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasing scent (a little cleaner smelling, maybe citrus blend of some kind?)</li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference in the softness in my hair when I use it.  </li>
            <li>We both really like it and will continue to buy &amp; use it.</li>
            <li>I noticed it made my hair much softer</li>
            <li>I use it for that reason to this very day.</li>
            <li>He still likes the clinical strength better as far as the way his hair feels afterward, but tells me this is a close second.</li>
            <li>The good news here is that we now have a decent all in one product that you can use every day or at least 3 times a week.</li>
            <li>It is much, much more palatable than other dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li>I was a H &amp; S user for quite a while but gave it up when I found other brands that had more features.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been users of Head and Shoulders for years, big fans of how clean the shampoo gets our hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>The active ingredient will have more time to work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything special about this specific version/scent, it just works.  </li>
            <li>For those of us that use H&amp;S to control flakey , dry scalps, this is a nice change up from the traditional stuff.</li>
            <li>but I always end up coming back to the tried and true number one that is Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li>All-In-1 smells better than most, and that&#x27;s reason enough to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions recommend using at least twice per week.</li>
            <li>I have a full head of hair which is longer, so perhaps this would not be the case for people with really short hair.  </li>
            <li>Prior to this, I was using Neutrogena T/Gel, which has a very strong medicinal smell that clings for a long time.</li>
            <li>I once had in an older home.  </li>
            <li>Head and Shoulders is effective on mild to moderate dandruff, but comes with different active ingredients.</li>
            <li>With this new All-in-1 Fresh Scent, he noticed immediately that his hair was much silkier than when he uses just the regular Head and Shoulders shampoo.  </li>
            <li>; is what I use most often in the travel size because it&#x27;s what I can find and it does do well for a few weeks at a time at least.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So for what it&#x27;s worth, I wouldn&#x27;t say this needs to be exclusively labelled as for &amp;#34;Men&amp;#34; only!</li>
            <li>/&gt;-bottles don&#x27;t leak (watery shampoo) and are easy to open and use up almost entirely with ability to control dispensing&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually use the Head and Shoulders Classic Clean but got this for cheap on Amazon recently.  </li>
            <li>no other choice really.  </li>
            <li>works, and hair feels conditioned and very soft after using it.</li>
            <li>The scent is very masculine, like a cologne or aftershave.</li>
            <li>It is super dry!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, let me say, I personally really like Head and Shoulders in general because&lt;</li>
            <li>product looks like many other dandruff shampoos, the blue liquid.</li>
            <li>his hair is so soft!  </li>
            <li>But this is the first time that i tried their Men&#x27;s Total care All in One Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner product.</li>
            <li>most standard Head &amp; Shoulders products the active ingredient with this one is 1% Pyrithione Zinc.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment as to the relative strengths of the ingredients, but certainly Head &amp; Shoulders</li>
            <li>My problem with the old Head and Shoulders</li>
            <li>And unless you go coal tar (which I do about once a week), the most common formulations on the market are pyrithione zinc or selenium</li>
            <li>His hair has also felt fairly soft and not dried</li>
            <li>I &amp;#34;previously&amp;#34; tried a frequent use men&#x27;s version and it did not work compared to this one.</li>
            <li>but since my hair is really short I really don&#x27;t see or feel a difference from the standard Head and Shoulders that I normally use.</li>
            <li>can tell you that Head and Shoulders does a good job with sweaty, dirty hair and this new conditioner leaves it soft.</li>
            <li>What a nice change from other heavily scented men&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard sometimes finding something that has the dandruff medication without a strong fragrance or smell.</li>
            <li>Once the entire routine is complete, then rinse.</li>
            <li>It has had a dandruff feature previously but this is the first time that I have used it with the conditioner included along with the dandruff remover.</li>
            <li>And it smells very clean, unlike other dandruff shampoos he tried that had a harsh medicine smell!</li>
            <li>My beef with 2-in-1 type shampoos is that the conditioner aspect typically leaves much to be desired</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I must admit that I am very brand loyal to Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a Head &amp; Shoulders variety that was both shampoo and conditioner, for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He said that guys care about their appearance as much as girls, they just need things streamlined for them to use and this does it all!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It leaves the hair with a soft and smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> This one smells better than most, but it has too much conditioner and leaves my hair feeling heavy and almost oily.  </li>
            <li> We have tried so many different shampoos for him, even a prescription one!</li>
            <li> My husband has been a fan of the brand for years, and he particularly likes the all-in-one formula for those quick summer showers on his shorter hair.</li>
            <li> While still providing the clean you&#x27;ve come to expect from Head and Shoulders, the conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft, without feeling oily.</li>
            <li> Not only will this shampoo give you a super clean head</li>
            <li> One thing I didn’t like about the regular Head and Shoulders was the smell, but this one doesn’t have that strong smell.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasing scent (a little cleaner smelling, maybe citrus blend of some kind?)</li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference in the softness in my hair when I use it.  </li>
            <li> We both really like it and will continue to buy &amp; use it.</li>
            <li> I noticed it made my hair much softer</li>
            <li> I use it for that reason to this very day.</li>
            <li> He still likes the clinical strength better as far as the way his hair feels afterward, but tells me this is a close second.</li>
            <li> The good news here is that we now have a decent all in one product that you can use every day or at least 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> It is much, much more palatable than other dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> I was a H &amp; S user for quite a while but gave it up when I found other brands that had more features.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been users of Head and Shoulders for years, big fans of how clean the shampoo gets our hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient will have more time to work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything special about this specific version/scent, it just works.  </li>
            <li> For those of us that use H&amp;S to control flakey , dry scalps, this is a nice change up from the traditional stuff.</li>
            <li> but I always end up coming back to the tried and true number one that is Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> All-In-1 smells better than most, and that&#x27;s reason enough to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions recommend using at least twice per week.</li>
            <li> I have a full head of hair which is longer, so perhaps this would not be the case for people with really short hair.  </li>
            <li> Prior to this, I was using Neutrogena T/Gel, which has a very strong medicinal smell that clings for a long time.</li>
            <li> I once had in an older home.  </li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders is effective on mild to moderate dandruff, but comes with different active ingredients.</li>
            <li> With this new All-in-1 Fresh Scent, he noticed immediately that his hair was much silkier than when he uses just the regular Head and Shoulders shampoo.  </li>
            <li> ; is what I use most often in the travel size because it&#x27;s what I can find and it does do well for a few weeks at a time at least.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So for what it&#x27;s worth, I wouldn&#x27;t say this needs to be exclusively labelled as for &amp;#34;Men&amp;#34; only!</li>
            <li> /&gt;-bottles don&#x27;t leak (watery shampoo) and are easy to open and use up almost entirely with ability to control dispensing&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually use the Head and Shoulders Classic Clean but got this for cheap on Amazon recently.  </li>
            <li> no other choice really.  </li>
            <li> works, and hair feels conditioned and very soft after using it.</li>
            <li> The scent is very masculine, like a cologne or aftershave.</li>
            <li> It is super dry!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, let me say, I personally really like Head and Shoulders in general because&lt;</li>
            <li> product looks like many other dandruff shampoos, the blue liquid.</li>
            <li> his hair is so soft!  </li>
            <li> But this is the first time that i tried their Men&#x27;s Total care All in One Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner product.</li>
            <li> most standard Head &amp; Shoulders products the active ingredient with this one is 1% Pyrithione Zinc.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment as to the relative strengths of the ingredients, but certainly Head &amp; Shoulders</li>
            <li> My problem with the old Head and Shoulders</li>
            <li> And unless you go coal tar (which I do about once a week), the most common formulations on the market are pyrithione zinc or selenium</li>
            <li> His hair has also felt fairly soft and not dried</li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;previously&amp;#34; tried a frequent use men&#x27;s version and it did not work compared to this one.</li>
            <li> but since my hair is really short I really don&#x27;t see or feel a difference from the standard Head and Shoulders that I normally use.</li>
            <li> can tell you that Head and Shoulders does a good job with sweaty, dirty hair and this new conditioner leaves it soft.</li>
            <li> What a nice change from other heavily scented men&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard sometimes finding something that has the dandruff medication without a strong fragrance or smell.</li>
            <li> Once the entire routine is complete, then rinse.</li>
            <li> It has had a dandruff feature previously but this is the first time that I have used it with the conditioner included along with the dandruff remover.</li>
            <li> And it smells very clean, unlike other dandruff shampoos he tried that had a harsh medicine smell!</li>
            <li> My beef with 2-in-1 type shampoos is that the conditioner aspect typically leaves much to be desired</li>
            <li> With the conditioner built in, it takes the normal two step process and breaks it down into one simple application.</li>
            <li> The packaging is all dark blues and white, making it clear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the regular Heads &amp; Shoulders product for a long time - it definitely works but can leave your hair dry, requiring a conditioner rinse to restore the hair.</li>
            <li> I noticed you only need to use a very small amount--it really foams up quite a bit</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders has been a staple in my family for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> (Sometimes I use the Head and Shoulders conditioner with this ... especially if I have been rough on my hair</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve switched to other brands before, but we&#x27;ve always come back to Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders has been around a long time because it works!</li>
            <li> I have dry scalp and</li>
            <li> but he does have dry hair.</li>
            <li> In a matter of days my dry scalp was cured.  </li>
            <li> So, for me at least, it&#x27;s back to the selenium sulfide formula in the blue bottle.  </li>
            <li> one small complaint is that the lid can be tricky to close completely so some leakage occurred when initially using the product.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember other shampoo &amp; conditioners instructing this.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other brand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of Head and Shoulders products, including other 2-in-1&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> For long term use, I know eventually we will have to switch back to a stronger product in order to combat the terrible scalp problems he experiences, but this Head and Shoulders product will most likely keep those flakes and scaly patches away for at least a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s why it works to keep dandruff down, but I wish it smelled musky or peppermint-like.</li>
            <li> He used it on his beard and his beard felt less abrasive.  </li>
            <li> and it feels like there is a slight amount of conditioner in the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Because you can get by with using a little at a time, this product should last a long time, and it is not that expensive.  </li>
            <li> As a child, I recall my father using it every single day (his thick, jet-black hair was always flake-free).</li>
            <li> My son suffers from a myriad of scalp problems that require frequent use of those tarry shampoos that leave his hair dry, brittle, and lackluster.  </li>
            <li> I use Head &amp; Shoulders everyday</li>
            <li> it was that it dried out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I know it&#x27;s cleaning my hair, it almost doesn&#x27;t feel like it because it&#x27;s so heavy.</li>
            <li> So, even though it is supposed to have a conditioner it is as well, it doesn&#x27;t seem to tame the hair well.  </li>
            <li> His hair is very thick and curly, and he wears it fairly long.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s also lazy about using conditioner, which makes these all-in-1 shampoos</li>
            <li> That is a combination hard to beat.</li>
            <li> After a day of working outside in the heat your hair is sweaty and dirty.</li>
            <li> It lathers well, though it&#x27;s not overly thick or concentrated.</li>
            <li> My husband suffers from very dry, itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> He has a longer style haircut and very thick hair with a lot of body, I am so envious as mine is thin and limp!</li>
            <li> I have tried may different scents of the shampoo and none of them have been bad.  </li>
            <li> It has also given him soft silky hair without those nasty medicinal scents.  </li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t bad, the shampoo/conditioner lotion feels thick and creamy; it thoroughly cleaned my hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Gets rid of dandruff and leaves hair looking great.</li>
            <li> I use Head &amp; Shoulders everyday and I have been dandruff free ever since I started.  There doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything special about this specific version/scent, it just works.  I have tried may different scents of the shampoo and none of them have been bad.  My advice is to check Amazon&#x27;s coupons and deals because there will be sales on Head &amp; Shoulders every once in a while.  At times I was able to get this product for under $3, which is even cheaper than subscribe &amp; save.</li>
            <li> I have dry scalp and this Head and Shoulders shampoo is great for moisturizing down to the roots. I have tried other brands but I always end up coming back to the tried and true number one that is Head and Shoulders. With the conditioner built in, it takes the normal two step process and breaks it down into one simple application. It has a pleasant scent and has come a ong way from the stigma of being a &amp;#34;medicated&amp;#34; shampoo.  Time saver, money saver, and no flakes! What more can I ask for?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the regular Heads &amp; Shoulders product for a long time - it definitely works but can leave your hair dry, requiring a conditioner rinse to restore the hair. This all-in-one package goes a long way to fixing this problem, both getting rid of the dandruff and also conditioning in one application, though it&#x27;s not quite as good as a separate conditioning wash. I really like the scent on this package which is fresh and not overwhelming, and the bottle is also the perfect size to throw in a gym bag too.</li>
            <li> I chose Head and Shoulders for Men Total Care All-in-1 for my husband. He doesn&#x27;t have dandruff but he does have dry hair. It is super dry! Some shampoos just make it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is review is based on his comments. The most important factor in choosing a shampoo to him is that it doesn&#x27;t burn his eyes. This one passes that test. The shampoo makes the hair soft to the touch and smooth, He is OK with the smell. He also likes that he doesn&#x27;t have to use a separate bottle for conditioner.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has dandruff knows the frustration of flakes that come and go without rhyme or reason. Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried numerous shampoos. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a Head &amp; Shoulders variety that was both shampoo and conditioner, for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, I noticed the scent. It is much, much more palatable than other dandruff shampoos. Prior to this, I was using Neutrogena T/Gel, which has a very strong medicinal smell that clings for a long time. I can&#x27;t comment as to the relative strengths of the ingredients, but certainly Head &amp; Shoulders Total Care All-In-1 smells better than most, and that&#x27;s reason enough to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions recommend using at least twice per week. I sampled the 14.2 oz bottle, which I expect to last several months with semi-monthly usage. The packaging is all dark blues and white, making it clear this is a men&#x27;s product rather than unisex. Furthermore, there is a 100 percent guarantee from corporate owners, Procter &amp; Gamble, that this product will leave you &amp;#34;flake free.&amp;#34; If it doesn&#x27;t work, simply call them up (1-800-723-9569) and a check will be mailed to you for the amount paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more can a guy ask for?</li>
            <li> My husband has been using regular Head and Shoulders shampoo for decades.  With this new All-in-1 Fresh Scent, he noticed immediately that his hair was much silkier than when he uses just the regular Head and Shoulders shampoo.  He used it on his beard and his beard felt less abrasive.  As with all H&amp;S products, it helps keep his dandruff under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I noticed was the scent.  It is a lovely mix of cedar and pine.  It reminded me of cedar closet I once had in an older home.  He liked the scent, too, so it was good for both of us.</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders is effective on mild to moderate dandruff, but comes with different active ingredients. My husband has a preference for zinc pyrithione shampoos that feel and work like non-medicated shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works, and hair feels conditioned and very soft after using it. The scent is very masculine, like a cologne or aftershave. I tried it on my hair for the sake of writing this review and the light manly scent lasted for hours. It&#x27;s a pleasant scent and light enough that it shouldn&#x27;t clash with colognes.</li>
            <li> The shampoo works well to control the flakes but since my hair is really short I really don&#x27;t see or feel a difference from the standard Head and Shoulders that I normally use. The smell is pleasant, the suds are normal, it&#x27;s easy to wash out and the bottle is easy to use.</li>
            <li> We have used Head and Shoulders Dandruff shampoo for years.  My family uses it because we work outside in the heat.  After a day of working outside in the heat your hair is sweaty and dirty. My problem with the old Head and Shoulders it was that it dried out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo plus conditioner is nice.  I can really tell a difference in the softness in my hair when I use it.  One thing I didn’t like about the regular Head and Shoulders was the smell, but this one doesn’t have that strong smell.  It is a lighter smell.&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you that Head and Shoulders does a good job with sweaty, dirty hair and this new conditioner leaves it soft.</li>
            <li> I have to use a dandruff shampoo personally...no other choice really.  And unless you go coal tar (which I do about once a week), the most common formulations on the market are pyrithione zinc or selenium sulfide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I go with &amp;#34;Head and Shoulders clinical strength&amp;#34; in the blue bottle - I know the selenium sulfide works well for me.  But the &amp;#34;head and shoulders men&amp;#34; is what I use most often in the travel size because it&#x27;s what I can find and it does do well for a few weeks at a time at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had the opportunity to try this full bottle so I thought I&#x27;d try it for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let me say, I personally really like Head and Shoulders in general because&lt;br /&gt;-decent smell.  pleasant but not too perfumy in all the varieties I&#x27;ve tried&lt;br /&gt;-bottles don&#x27;t leak (watery shampoo) and are easy to open and use up almost entirely with ability to control dispensing&lt;br /&gt;-good lather and texture&lt;br /&gt;-good clean hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head and shoulders men (unlike clinical strength) also includes conditioner, so no need to go for a separate one - and the conditioner does work well - hair comes out silky...nice to run your fingers through (and yes, I&#x27;m female, but trust me guys you want hair that others like to run their fingers through too!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good lather as mentioned, rinses out well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If pyrithione zinc works well for you, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it...but after a month, I&#x27;m starting to get itchy dandruff.  So, for me at least, it&#x27;s back to the selenium sulfide formula in the blue bottle.  So this one gets 4 stars for being good and holding me over between the other stuff, but not five - not going to make the switch permanently.</li>
            <li> This product does the job. It has reduced my husband&#x27;s dandruff levels noticeably. His hair has also felt fairly soft and not dried out.&lt;br /&gt;The product looks like many other dandruff shampoos, the blue liquid. It&#x27;s not too runny and not too smelly.&lt;br /&gt;His one small complaint is that the lid can be tricky to close completely so some leakage occurred when initially using the product.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo and conditioner. I sometimes get dandruff and have trouble so it was great to have a product that cleans my hair, takes care of my dandruff and conditions too. I think it was great to find this shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t bad, the shampoo/conditioner lotion feels thick and creamy; it thoroughly cleaned my hair. As for dandruff, time will tell but Head and Shoulders has always worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why three stars? I just don&#x27;t like the scent.  It has a strong medicinal, chemical-like odor.  Maybe that&#x27;s why it works to keep dandruff down, but I wish it smelled musky or peppermint-like. As it is, I&#x27;ll use it but I&#x27;ll be looking for different scented products after this.</li>
            <li> You get a lot of product in this bottle; shampoo, conditioner and dandruff control.  Hair smells nice and lathers pretty well.  Over all, this is a nice product.  The bottle directs you to shake well.  Which I keep forgetting to do.  I don&#x27;t remember other shampoo &amp; conditioners instructing this.</li>
            <li> This is my son&#x27;s favorite shampoo. He has a longer style haircut and very thick hair with a lot of body, I am so envious as mine is thin and limp! He said that guys care about their appearance as much as girls, they just need things streamlined for them to use and this does it all! In one swipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; He say he can do in 5 minutes what girls take 1/2 an hour in the shower to do and he likes that it isn&#x27;t an overly strong fragrance, just enough and a refreshing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the dandruff aspect of this goes, it is as effective as good old regular Head and Shoulders, it just leaves his hair a bit softer he says.  I&#x27;m sure that is because of the touch of conditioner in this formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it myself when I inadvertently forgot to make sure my regular shampoo was in the shower before getting in and it worked pretty good at leaving my hair full yet tangle free and my hair is a bit past my shoulders and baby fine. So for what it&#x27;s worth, I wouldn&#x27;t say this needs to be exclusively labelled as for &amp;#34;Men&amp;#34; only!</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband and he loves it. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Itchy scalp??  Even when you do not see dandruff does your scalp itch and you just have to scratch?  The Head and Shoulders Shampoo and Conditioner is just what you are needing to stop the ITCH.  Not only will this shampoo give you a super clean head it will stop that itchy scalp that is driving you bonkers and embarrasses you to no end.  Now you won&#x27;t have to scratch in public or private...the ingredients in this will take care of that great need.  I got mine from Amazon and you can get yours tonight and stop that scratching!!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love about Head and Shoulders? I&#x27;ve been a fan of their shampoo for over 30 years. The Total Care All-in-1 for Men provides the perfect balance of clean and conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some people consider Head and Shoulders to be &amp;#34;harsh&amp;#34;, and this shampoo should address that. While still providing the clean you&#x27;ve come to expect from Head and Shoulders, the conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft, without feeling oily. And it has a great scent!</li>
            <li> Not only does my husband use this all-in-1 product, I like to use it as well. Some women&#x27;s shampoos &amp; hair products are so overpowering with scent end up with a headache after using them. Since I need something for dandruff it&#x27;s hard sometimes finding something that has the dandruff medication without a strong fragrance or smell. The fragrance of this shampoo is mild &amp; pleasant, the dandruff medication works great too. We both really like it and will continue to buy &amp; use it.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been users of Head and Shoulders for years, big fans of how clean the shampoo gets our hair and scalp. We&#x27;ve switched to other brands before, but we&#x27;ve always come back to Head and Shoulders. This All-In-1 version of Head and Shoulders is perfect for my husband, who doesn&#x27;t normally use conditioner. Now it&#x27;s all included in one wash, and his hair is looking great with no extra effort.</li>
            <li> My beef with 2-in-1 type shampoos is that the conditioner aspect typically leaves much to be desired and I still have to rely on a separate conditioner to achieve a proper finish thus defeating the purpose of an all in one type product. This &#x27;Head &amp; Shoulders for Men&#x27; 2-in-1 shampoo does a great job cleansing the hair (lathers up quickly and strips out grease/product effectively) and surprisingly provides a nice conditioned finish that feels and looks great once your hair is properly dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most standard Head &amp; Shoulders products the active ingredient with this one is 1% Pyrithione Zinc. Overall a good all purpose shampoo/conditioner with a pleasant scent geared specifically for Men.</li>
            <li> I have been using this about two or three times a week.  Seems to control the dandruff.  I noticed it made my hair much softer and sometimes it gives it a nice shine.  It works well with longer hair.  I don&#x27;t know why it states it is just for men; everyone in my family used it with good results. I noticed my hair seemed much fuller after shampooing, but the downside is it seemed to cause a kind of &amp;#34;flyaway&amp;#34; effect.  So, even though it is supposed to have a conditioner it is as well, it doesn&#x27;t seem to tame the hair well.  I have a full head of hair which is longer, so perhaps this would not be the case for people with really short hair.  It seems to do what it is supposed to do.  Doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all.  I noticed you only need to use a very small amount--it really foams up quite a bit so don&#x27;t put a lot in your hair or you will be rinsing it out for some time.  Because you can get by with using a little at a time, this product should last a long time, and it is not that expensive.  Thus, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> Works great! In a matter of days my dry scalp was cured.  I &amp;#34;previously&amp;#34; tried a frequent use men&#x27;s version and it did not work compared to this one.</li>
            <li> Only shampoo that I use.  I won&#x27;t use any other brand.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I usually use the Head and Shoulders Classic Clean but got this for cheap on Amazon recently.  Not a fan of the scent.  I am going to be ordering the Classic Clean again and dumping this out.  The smell from this sticks around all day.</li>
            <li> I was a H &amp; S user for quite a while but gave it up when I found other brands that had more features. Well, H &amp; S has joined the club and has come up with a winner. It is very easy to apply to get complete coverage and has a very mild and pleasant fragrance. It has had a dandruff feature previously but this is the first time that I have used it with the conditioner included along with the dandruff remover. It leaves the hair with a soft and smooth feeling. I am duly impressed to the point where I am returning to the fold and resuming my position as a H &amp; S user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This improved version does a great job, My hair feels clean and fresh and the price is right. That is a combination hard to beat. I am a believer and recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As far as H&amp;S goes, this is good stuff. For those of us that use H&amp;S to control flakey , dry scalps, this is a nice change up from the traditional stuff. Of course it is aimed at men who , like me, rarely add conditioner to their hair. The good news here is that we now have a decent all in one product that you can use every day or at least 3 times a week. It has a pleasing scent (a little cleaner smelling, maybe citrus blend of some kind?) and it feels like there is a slight amount of conditioner in the shampoo. Otherwise, it is the same as their regular product.</li>
            <li> My husband uses Head and Shoulders shampoo all the time, but this one smells so much better than the minty ones!  Works well to keep the flakes away.  He never uses conditioner, so it&#x27;s nice that it is an all in one to include conditioner ... his hair is so soft!  Definitely will buy again!</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders has been a staple in my family for as long as I can remember. As a child, I recall my father using it every single day (his thick, jet-black hair was always flake-free). And I remember mom using it to get that &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling after days of conditioners, glosses, hairsprays, etc. I use it for that reason to this very day. This particular All-in-One has a rich lather, fresh scent, and rinses clean. (Sometimes I use the Head and Shoulders conditioner with this ... especially if I have been rough on my hair recently).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bit of advice, if you are picking this up for the flake-free aspect, an episode of The Doctors mentioned that one can apply this shampoo, lather up, and then let it sit as one continues the rest of one&#x27;s shower routine. Once the entire routine is complete, then rinse. The active ingredient will have more time to work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Head and Shoulders is amazing. If you have never used it, you must give it a try!</li>
            <li> My son has been using Head and Shoulders shampoo for many years. His hair is very thick and curly, and he wears it fairly long. He&#x27;s also lazy about using conditioner, which makes these all-in-1 shampoos a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one doesn&#x27;t have quite as medicinal a scent as the others. It lathers well, though it&#x27;s not overly thick or concentrated. He normally uses the clinical strength (dark blue bottle), not because of dandruff problems with the regular strength but because it seems to leave his hair softer. He still likes the clinical strength better as far as the way his hair feels afterward, but tells me this is a close second.</li>
            <li> My son suffers from a myriad of scalp problems that require frequent use of those tarry shampoos that leave his hair dry, brittle, and lackluster.  Head and Shoulders products provide a nice break for him in between these tarry treatments.  This Total Care All In 1 product is the best one we have tried in terms of effectiveness.  It has also given him soft silky hair without those nasty medicinal scents.  For long term use, I know eventually we will have to switch back to a stronger product in order to combat the terrible scalp problems he experiences, but this Head and Shoulders product will most likely keep those flakes and scaly patches away for at least a couple of weeks.  For someone who experiences regular dandruff, this is an excellent long term solution.  I was most impressed by the light, fresh scent.  What a nice change from other heavily scented men&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of Head and Shoulders products, including other 2-in-1&#x27;s.  This one smells better than most, but it has too much conditioner and leaves my hair feeling heavy and almost oily.  While I know it&#x27;s cleaning my hair, it almost doesn&#x27;t feel like it because it&#x27;s so heavy.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I am very brand loyal to Head and Shoulders. But this is the first time that i tried their Men&#x27;s Total care All in One Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner product. And I was not disappointed. Without having the heavy medicine smell of many competitor brand dandruff shampoos, Head and shoulders provides a very nice lather, clean feel, and nice results regarding dry scalp. I have been using this product for about a month now and don&#x27;t see changing back to the regular Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> My husband suffers from very dry, itchy scalp. We have tried so many different shampoos for him, even a prescription one! He gave this a try and this is the only one that has ever done the trick! And it smells very clean, unlike other dandruff shampoos he tried that had a harsh medicine smell! I highly recommend this!!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice dandruff-control solution. My husband has been a fan of the brand for years, and he particularly likes the all-in-one formula for those quick summer showers on his shorter hair. This one isn&#x27;t a great deviation from any of their other products and works well to control dandruff with a nice, fresh clean scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering. It also makes a nice lather without every feeling overly chemically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this will continue to be a staple in our shower!</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders is the best dandruff shampoo, hands down. I like that it does not have the medicinal smell that many medicated shampoos have. I would say this smells more like soap, an unscented one. It has a gentle smell, but makes the hair smell very clean and fresh. (it says for men, but I believe it would be fine for ladies, too.) It produces a good lather, which I like, and it does get rid of the flakes. Head and Shoulders has been around a long time because it works!</li>
