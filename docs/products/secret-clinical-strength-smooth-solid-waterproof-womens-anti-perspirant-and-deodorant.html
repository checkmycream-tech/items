            <li>It&#x27;s a good deodorant for me</li>

            <li>This product is AMAZING if you have issues with underarm sweating.</li>
            <li>At the price, I&#x27;m gonna be some kind of pissed off if it irritates...AAARRRGGGHHH.</li>
            <li>and I laid around in my pajamas until 5 pm without reapplying deodorant or taking a shower and still no smell of any kind.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot of this product to be effective.</li>
            <li>But I find it so effective, I&#x27;m going to keep using it.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and not too strong.</li>
            <li>Great price on Amazon and prime eligble makes it super for me.</li>
            <li>I work around people all day in close proximity, so I am all about purchasing something that is a superior product, but I really don&#x27;t think this is that great.  </li>
            <li>Best deodorant in the clinical strengths by far.</li>
            <li>BY FAR THE BEST DEODORANT EVER!!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is by far the best antiperspirant deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>Best Antiperspirant &amp; deodorant by far.</li>
            <li>Best deodorant I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>This is easy on the skin and effective as well.</li>
            <li>A great fresh scent that isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>Not only does this work the very best, but a deodorant that does not come off in the swimming pool.  </li>
            <li>I Would just like to know how many is in the unit before ordering</li>
            <li>This is the only deodorant I find works the best for me!</li>
            <li>And this is such a great deal that can&#x27;t be found anywhere else!</li>
            <li>Better to get Speed Stick which is</li>
            <li>i have repurchased this and will continue to do so until i find something better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>IM IN LOVE</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it truly is waterproof.</li>
            <li>I still buy it on a monthly basis :)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I decided to see about subscribe and save with amazon because the store I buy  most of my groceries doesn&#x27;t carry Mitchum anyway</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay,  </li>
            <li>I actually love the product.</li>
            <li>I know you can pull your minds together and make something a bit more</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>This product works better than anything I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work better then the gel version.</li>
            <li>I do put it on more than once a day though.  </li>
            <li>Most deodorants and antiperspirants couldn&#x27;t do that for me.</li>
            <li>I love the waterproof feature.  </li>
            <li>This smells great and works great if used as it states (put on before going to bed).Many mornings I still use a small amount again just to make sure!</li>
            <li>Best thing I ever did as I work long hours and don&#x27;t feel sweaty at all.</li>
            <li>I am a sales rep who is running all day long and this has been the best deodorant I have tried.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve tried lots of brands, Secret is my favorite, when they came up with the Clinical, loved it even more, but the Waterproof is the best!</li>
            <li>For a woman, I tend to sweat more than most, but thanks to this amazing product</li>
            <li>Nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad deodorant, but it does not work as well as described!</li>
            <li>It makes my life easy and saves me time and money.</li>
            <li>I used to have to use strong mens deodorant to help keep me from smelling like onions by the end of the day....</li>
            <li>The deodorant itself works fine.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is great, its so waterproof that I can feel the barrier in the shower the next morning, and I don&#x27;t mind it because I do not want to be stinky!  </li>
            <li>This just keeps you stink free, period.</li>
            <li>Very fresh scent and works</li>
            <li>VERY effective; I&#x27;ll definitely return to it when we can throw lots of money away on toiletries.</li>
            <li>I think I found a new favorite!</li>
            <li>and i run around and get sweaty but my armpits stay fresh!</li>
            <li>Like the fresh scent too!</li>
            <li>Pretty sure your deodorant is supposed to prevent sweat, not cause it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even need to re apply, I stay fresh all day!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>me and my daughters, both athletes and sweating all the time, just love that it keeps us dry and fresh and smelling good all the time.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased, and this size is perfect because it&#x27;s bigger than the usual size that&#x27;s in store.</li>
            <li>Gentle, sure, uh huh).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells nice and basically works like Old Spice from the closest pharmacy/grocery store.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant so much.</li>
            <li>Ive tried many &amp;#34;super&amp;#34; formulas of the higher strength and the Secret seems to be the best of all of them - I wont hesitate to purchase it again!</li>
            <li>I have consistently struggled to find a deodorant that keeps me free from smell and withstands all day.  </li>
            <li>, I not only smell wonderful, I stay dry too!</li>
            <li>the scent of this is masculine but also fresh, it&#x27;s a light scent, so it&#x27;s not overpowering like axe or girly like some cheap body spray.</li>
            <li>Much prefer the light and fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I woke up the next day and there was no smell of any kind.</li>
            <li>i rarely sweat or smell</li>
            <li>and this honestly compares to a regular deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m only talking about my own experience.  </li>
            <li>It truly does keep me drier and smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li>and I like the Powder Fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>and I still smell fresh after an 8 hour shift.</li>
            <li>If you are a woman looking for a strong deodorant I highly suggest purchasing men&#x27;s deodorant.  </li>
            <li>However, I was looking for something stronger on those super hot &amp; humid days.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the fact that the price is right and</li>
            <li>Something to note:  don&#x27;t put it on and then run out the door because it takes some time to absorb, I would say right after you get out of the shower so it can do</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the higher price tag.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t leave my skin irritated but my skin kind of turned dry but nothing drastic.</li>
            <li>Loved seeing it on Amazon for a couple bucks less than the stores.</li>
            <li>About the only deodrant that truly works for me and keeps me fresh and clean feeling all day!</li>
            <li>They are packaging it up to look like you&#x27;re getting more than you actually are.</li>
            <li>it works well, even in hot humid weather when i&#x27;m at an amusement park all day.</li>
            <li>The waterproof version is so much better than the regular version of this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that resilient ;)</li>
            <li>I needed more than regular) and see what happens.</li>
            <li>The hot flashes and hormonal change did a number of me.</li>
            <li>Even on hot days it works.</li>
            <li>May work better than a regular deodorant but not what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>love it, i don&#x27;t need to use it everyday, but once I use it, its effect could last for 2 days, and smell really good.</li>
            <li>Actually made me sweat more if you can believe that.</li>
            <li>I have noticed it does not work as well as I thought it did when I first started using it though...</li>
            <li>Exactly.  </li>
            <li>when i went out on the boat, went all day at cedar point and even in a hot tub.</li>
            <li>it did get weaker after the hot tub..</li>
            <li>It sometimes gets hot at my job</li>
            <li>It really is waterproof!</li>
            <li>This is my first deodorant and antiperspirant product, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>It works better than regular deodarant.</li>
            <li>I just recently switched and I love this deoderant.  </li>
            <li>I have since signed up to get this on a subscription basis, my first time using this service via Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is the only deodorant I buy any more.</li>
            <li>Ironically, I sweat everywhere but under my arms now in the hot weather :) Now if they only had something to use all over your body....</li>
            <li>It was the only deodorant that worked ok for me.</li>
            <li>I know I sweat a lot already, but the new office space was so warm and with nerves mixed in, I was pretty embarrassed.</li>
            <li>With this--she applies it in the morning--and while she does keep an extra one with her in her backpack, she rarely if ever reapplies it---and she still smells fine at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other brands, but they are not as effective.  </li>
            <li>Secret Clinical Strength has proven the most effective for me.</li>
            <li>Good value for the same item I have gotten in the local retail stores for years!</li>
            <li>Worth the higher price than others and works way better than other brands&#x27; clinical strengths.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the product package and removed the sticky tape on the top, the product looked completely dry and cracked on the surface.  </li>
            <li>One day I couldn&#x27;t find it, so I used an old deodorant and quickly remembered why I love this deodorant so much, its the only one I have found that works.</li>
            <li>I live a stressfull life in a hot place, so i used to have a lot of problems til i tried this!</li>
            <li>Also, it looked that over 1/3 of the container on top is empty, so I returned my first order for a replacement.  </li>
            <li>It keeps me dry and confident.  </li>
            <li>It looks like a large deodorant stick, but</li>
            <li>The one down fall with the smooth solid is that it will leave the white residue on your clothes, so I make sure to hand wash the underarms after taking them off and that seems to remove it for the most part before throwing the clothes in the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And nice to get it a little cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li>If you have a problem with heavy perspiration, especially in the summer/hot months, this is great.  </li>
            <li>I literally ruined shirts from sweating so much; this never happens anymore.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>This Antiperspirant really works.  </li>
            <li>but it costs 3x as much.  </li>
            <li>I really perspire under stress and this product does work for me...</li>
            <li>pricey for how much you get</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s thing while you finish getting ready.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would find anything to keep me from sweating so much</li>
            <li>It was really out of control.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a real lifesaver, helping me avoid embarrassment and clothing stains.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thanks for putting it on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>I really put this stuff to the test though</li>
            <li>This really does what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>This is an absolute miracle---and the delight of those of us around her.      </li>
            <li>My real problem is with the dispenser.</li>
            <li>And I really like not having to apply before I get dressed.</li>
            <li>and delivery was fast as always....</li>
            <li>This product works very well...........</li>
            <li>The company also uses responsible business practices according to goodguide.com.</li>
            <li>, you should really try a stronger deodorant.&amp;#34;  The soul of tact, that one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even my non-tactful husband remarked that I smelled much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has really worked well for me.</li>
            <li>This deoderant really works with controlling under arm odor.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews on this product, I was really hoping this deodorant would be the solution to my chronic sweating problem.</li>
            <li>I was very smelly, and very damp.</li>
            <li>really-</li>
            <li>It really works for girls who sweat a lot.</li>
            <li>I really like</li>
            <li>The waterproof formula is the only kind that will work on me and is still working the next morning when I shower and reapply.</li>
            <li>i live in a hot climate</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a sweating person in general until getting pregnant.  </li>
            <li>Although it does work better than other deodorants, I will still sweat through anything with sleeves.</li>
            <li>I am a secret user for so long and it is the best in the market for me, until i discover clinical strength.</li>
            <li>I did extensive research online before purchasing this product and seems lots of other pregnant women were OK with it.  </li>
            <li>On an average day, I have to use a towel around the bottom to give me the grip I need to be able to move the product through the dispenser.</li>
            <li>All good antiperspirants contain aluminum, which is NOT good.  </li>
            <li>I sweat much more than the average person.</li>
            <li>I really love this product and would never consider to buy any other products!</li>
            <li>Trying something new and really like the product.  </li>
            <li>Keeps me dry and odor free all day.</li>
            <li>The only tip I have is to be sure to scrub your under arms in the shower, because since it&#x27;s waterproof, it will definitely stay on and leave a film.</li>
            <li>Prior to discovering this, we had tried many brands, applying it multiple times a day---all to no avail.  </li>
            <li>the only thing that worked for this post pregnant lady.</li>
            <li>Finally a deodorant worthy of praise.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like this one.</li>
            <li>but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any particular &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; about this.</li>
            <li>Have not seen any particular strength in preventing sweating that deserves a &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; label</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is a little strong (at first).</li>
            <li>My 12 year old daughter has a very strong odor and sweating problem--and it doesn&#x27;t help that she is very active.  </li>
            <li>but I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rated highly in terms of the safety of its ingredients, too.  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying about 10 different deodorants to try, and secret clinical waterproof was by far the most effective.</li>
            <li>Just wish it smelled a little better.</li>
            <li>I perspire (a little) more than is normal</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t stay wet.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally use this type of deodorant.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just as much as my normal bar.</li>
            <li>I decided that since Secret has always had a good reputation I will try the clinical strength (b/c</li>
            <li>I live in the South, and I&#x27;m a stress-sweater.</li>
            <li>I started a new job and sweated like a pig.</li>
            <li>It last all day and during hot and humid days too.</li>
            <li>I am unable to use regular deodorant and this is the next best thing to a prescription.</li>
            <li>First time trying the solid version of this product.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It keeps me dry and easy enough to come off in the shower.</li>
            <li>it is the only brand and type I found to ensure My underarms stay dry and odor free</li>
            <li>I like the large size of this item and that I save an extra 15% through subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>A little water is OK and it still works well later in the day.</li>
            <li>the mechanism you turn to push out the product is sometimes hard to turn, though in the more recent products I&#x27;ve purchased, it hasn&#x27;t been so much of a problem, and</li>
            <li>i perspire often (like cold sweat) and i&#x27;m happy to have this product in my life.</li>
            <li>I struggled for years with hormone issues and standard deodorants not doing much for me.</li>
            <li>I have been a faithful user of the product for my adult life.</li>
            <li>It does not need to be used daily unless you really scrub your underarms in the shower.  </li>
            <li>My 16 year old daughter has now started using it and loves it .</li>
            <li>Welp, when you spend nearly 15 dollars on it, I guess it has a lot of expectations.  </li>
            <li>Texture is soft and not heavy.</li>
            <li>It is somewhat water-proof, so lasts quite a long time -- I use it in the morning, and can go much of the next day if I don&#x27;t take another shower first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>You really need to shop around, either locally or on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it hasn&#x27;t given me a problem.</li>
            <li>I rather than use much effort on something so simple.</li>
            <li>I see a lot of people have been surprised at the quantity of product they get.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth the extra money to start using on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only cheaper than what you buy in store if you subscribe and save: worth the extra money to get the quality product I need!!!</li>
            <li>Good stuff--too expensive</li>
            <li>The odor protection is good but other than that it sucks.</li>
            <li>I then bought the exact same stick from Wal Mart and went back and forth with each one for 4 days..</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find this solid to be particularly stronger.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise, the second one came exactly the same -</li>
            <li>I feel like the price is too high for the amount of product included; this is why I only give it five stars.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and invisible but be careful as it still can leave white streaks if you don your outfit too fast while it is not fully dry.</li>
            <li>Overall it was a negative one, although Amazon handled return and replacement pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>Can leave those white stains every once in a while (if you put too much on), but it is the only deodorant that will work for me.</li>
            <li>I have tried soooo many clinical strength deodorants, this is the only one I&#x27;ve found lately that works.</li>
            <li>I was surprised one day last week when I felt wet in the underarm area, but it was a highly hot and humid day in the south.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t work any better than the regular Secret deoderant I normally buy</li>
            <li>Keeps you fresh &amp; dry all day long.</li>
            <li>it is only about half full.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, especially if you have the same problems.</li>
            <li>im a 49 yr old female btw</li>
            <li>This is the only deodorant that keeps me presentable and professional.</li>
            <li>This fixed my problem, simple as that.</li>
            <li>(apparently, I am allergic to Dove.  </li>
            <li>Apparently something about nursing changes your body chemistry.  </li>
            <li>Certainly not a good choice if you are concerned about your health as it is super high in aluminum.  </li>
            <li>it looks like you&#x27;re getting your money&#x27;s worth and your getting only half.  </li>
            <li>As an American from a cooler climate, when we moved to Shanghai, China my body was in shock at the high heat and steamy humidity of the long summers.  </li>
            <li>I noticed early after starting to use the stick that arrived that I could &amp;#34;smell through it&amp;#34; on days that I wasn&#x27;t doing anything extra: just work and home.</li>
            <li>Secret clinical strength is one of the only brands that work for me, and the Waterproof  is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>My problem FINALLY has a solution, no more ruined shirts, specially the white ones!</li>
            <li>This is expensive compared to regular strength--but we use less and have better results so it is worth EVERY penny.</li>
            <li>this was a GREAT PRICE but the cap pushes up when i twist the product, so as the content moved up, so does the lid that is holding the content together :(.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now and it works just as well now as it did when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the best, the only thing that is bad is the container is so small.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to use regular secret, but not anymore as it does not protect me all day long, so I switched to clinical strength.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, it should have worked at least a little better during the summer months.  </li>

            <li> The scent is pleasant and not too strong.</li>
            <li> Great price on Amazon and prime eligble makes it super for me.</li>
            <li> I work around people all day in close proximity, so I am all about purchasing something that is a superior product, but I really don&#x27;t think this is that great.  </li>
            <li> Best deodorant in the clinical strengths by far.</li>
            <li> BY FAR THE BEST DEODORANT EVER!!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is by far the best antiperspirant deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used</li>

            <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> This is easy on the skin and effective as well.</li>
            <li> A great fresh scent that isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> Not only does this work the very best, but a deodorant that does not come off in the swimming pool.  </li>
            <li> I Would just like to know how many is in the unit before ordering</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I find works the best for me!</li>
            <li> And this is such a great deal that can&#x27;t be found anywhere else!</li>
            <li> Better to get Speed Stick which is</li>
            <li> i have repurchased this and will continue to do so until i find something better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li> OK.  </li>
            <li> IM IN LOVE</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it truly is waterproof.</li>
            <li> I still buy it on a monthly basis :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I decided to see about subscribe and save with amazon because the store I buy  most of my groceries doesn&#x27;t carry Mitchum anyway</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay,  </li>
            <li> I actually love the product.</li>
            <li> I know you can pull your minds together and make something a bit more</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> This product works better than anything I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work better then the gel version.</li>
            <li> I do put it on more than once a day though.  </li>
            <li> Most deodorants and antiperspirants couldn&#x27;t do that for me.</li>
            <li> I love the waterproof feature.  </li>
            <li> This smells great and works great if used as it states (put on before going to bed).Many mornings I still use a small amount again just to make sure!</li>
            <li> Best thing I ever did as I work long hours and don&#x27;t feel sweaty at all.</li>
            <li> I am a sales rep who is running all day long and this has been the best deodorant I have tried.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve tried lots of brands, Secret is my favorite, when they came up with the Clinical, loved it even more, but the Waterproof is the best!</li>
            <li> For a woman, I tend to sweat more than most, but thanks to this amazing product</li>
            <li> Nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad deodorant, but it does not work as well as described!</li>
            <li> It makes my life easy and saves me time and money.</li>
            <li> I used to have to use strong mens deodorant to help keep me from smelling like onions by the end of the day....</li>
            <li> The deodorant itself works fine.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is great, its so waterproof that I can feel the barrier in the shower the next morning, and I don&#x27;t mind it because I do not want to be stinky!  </li>
            <li> This just keeps you stink free, period.</li>
            <li> Very fresh scent and works</li>
            <li> VERY effective; I&#x27;ll definitely return to it when we can throw lots of money away on toiletries.</li>
            <li> I think I found a new favorite!</li>
            <li> and i run around and get sweaty but my armpits stay fresh!</li>
            <li> Like the fresh scent too!</li>
            <li> Pretty sure your deodorant is supposed to prevent sweat, not cause it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even need to re apply, I stay fresh all day!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> me and my daughters, both athletes and sweating all the time, just love that it keeps us dry and fresh and smelling good all the time.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased, and this size is perfect because it&#x27;s bigger than the usual size that&#x27;s in store.</li>
            <li> Gentle, sure, uh huh).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells nice and basically works like Old Spice from the closest pharmacy/grocery store.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant so much.</li>
            <li> Ive tried many &amp;#34;super&amp;#34; formulas of the higher strength and the Secret seems to be the best of all of them - I wont hesitate to purchase it again!</li>
            <li> I have consistently struggled to find a deodorant that keeps me free from smell and withstands all day.  </li>
            <li> , I not only smell wonderful, I stay dry too!</li>
            <li> the scent of this is masculine but also fresh, it&#x27;s a light scent, so it&#x27;s not overpowering like axe or girly like some cheap body spray.</li>
            <li> Much prefer the light and fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I woke up the next day and there was no smell of any kind.</li>
            <li> i rarely sweat or smell</li>
            <li> and this honestly compares to a regular deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;m only talking about my own experience.  </li>
            <li> It truly does keep me drier and smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li> and I like the Powder Fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> and I still smell fresh after an 8 hour shift.</li>
            <li> If you are a woman looking for a strong deodorant I highly suggest purchasing men&#x27;s deodorant.  </li>
            <li> However, I was looking for something stronger on those super hot &amp; humid days.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the fact that the price is right and</li>
            <li> Something to note:  don&#x27;t put it on and then run out the door because it takes some time to absorb, I would say right after you get out of the shower so it can do</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the higher price tag.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t leave my skin irritated but my skin kind of turned dry but nothing drastic.</li>
            <li> Loved seeing it on Amazon for a couple bucks less than the stores.</li>
            <li> About the only deodrant that truly works for me and keeps me fresh and clean feeling all day!</li>
            <li> They are packaging it up to look like you&#x27;re getting more than you actually are.</li>
            <li> it works well, even in hot humid weather when i&#x27;m at an amusement park all day.</li>
            <li> The waterproof version is so much better than the regular version of this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that resilient ;)</li>
            <li> I needed more than regular) and see what happens.</li>
            <li> The hot flashes and hormonal change did a number of me.</li>
            <li> Even on hot days it works.</li>
            <li> May work better than a regular deodorant but not what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> love it, i don&#x27;t need to use it everyday, but once I use it, its effect could last for 2 days, and smell really good.</li>
            <li> Actually made me sweat more if you can believe that.</li>
            <li> I have noticed it does not work as well as I thought it did when I first started using it though...</li>
            <li> Exactly.  </li>
            <li> when i went out on the boat, went all day at cedar point and even in a hot tub.</li>
            <li> it did get weaker after the hot tub..</li>
            <li> It sometimes gets hot at my job</li>
            <li> It really is waterproof!</li>
            <li> This is my first deodorant and antiperspirant product, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> It works better than regular deodarant.</li>
            <li> I just recently switched and I love this deoderant.  </li>
            <li> I have since signed up to get this on a subscription basis, my first time using this service via Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I buy any more.</li>
            <li> Ironically, I sweat everywhere but under my arms now in the hot weather :) Now if they only had something to use all over your body....</li>
            <li> It was the only deodorant that worked ok for me.</li>
            <li> I know I sweat a lot already, but the new office space was so warm and with nerves mixed in, I was pretty embarrassed.</li>
            <li> With this--she applies it in the morning--and while she does keep an extra one with her in her backpack, she rarely if ever reapplies it---and she still smells fine at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, but they are not as effective.  </li>
            <li> Secret Clinical Strength has proven the most effective for me.</li>
            <li> Good value for the same item I have gotten in the local retail stores for years!</li>
            <li> Worth the higher price than others and works way better than other brands&#x27; clinical strengths.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the product package and removed the sticky tape on the top, the product looked completely dry and cracked on the surface.  </li>
            <li> One day I couldn&#x27;t find it, so I used an old deodorant and quickly remembered why I love this deodorant so much, its the only one I have found that works.</li>
            <li> I live a stressfull life in a hot place, so i used to have a lot of problems til i tried this!</li>
            <li> Also, it looked that over 1/3 of the container on top is empty, so I returned my first order for a replacement.  </li>
            <li> It keeps me dry and confident.  </li>
            <li> It looks like a large deodorant stick, but</li>
            <li> The one down fall with the smooth solid is that it will leave the white residue on your clothes, so I make sure to hand wash the underarms after taking them off and that seems to remove it for the most part before throwing the clothes in the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And nice to get it a little cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> If you have a problem with heavy perspiration, especially in the summer/hot months, this is great.  </li>
            <li> I literally ruined shirts from sweating so much; this never happens anymore.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> This Antiperspirant really works.  </li>
            <li> but it costs 3x as much.  </li>
            <li> I really perspire under stress and this product does work for me...</li>
            <li> pricey for how much you get</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thing while you finish getting ready.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would find anything to keep me from sweating so much</li>
            <li> It was really out of control.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a real lifesaver, helping me avoid embarrassment and clothing stains.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thanks for putting it on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> I really put this stuff to the test though</li>
            <li> This really does what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> This is an absolute miracle---and the delight of those of us around her.      </li>
            <li> My real problem is with the dispenser.</li>
            <li> And I really like not having to apply before I get dressed.</li>
            <li> and delivery was fast as always....</li>
            <li> This product works very well...........</li>
            <li> The company also uses responsible business practices according to goodguide.com.</li>
            <li> , you should really try a stronger deodorant.&amp;#34;  The soul of tact, that one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even my non-tactful husband remarked that I smelled much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has really worked well for me.</li>
            <li> This deoderant really works with controlling under arm odor.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on this product, I was really hoping this deodorant would be the solution to my chronic sweating problem.</li>
            <li> I was very smelly, and very damp.</li>
            <li> really-</li>
            <li> It really works for girls who sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> I really like</li>
            <li> The waterproof formula is the only kind that will work on me and is still working the next morning when I shower and reapply.</li>
            <li> i live in a hot climate</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a sweating person in general until getting pregnant.  </li>
            <li> Although it does work better than other deodorants, I will still sweat through anything with sleeves.</li>
            <li> I am a secret user for so long and it is the best in the market for me, until i discover clinical strength.</li>
            <li> I did extensive research online before purchasing this product and seems lots of other pregnant women were OK with it.  </li>
            <li> On an average day, I have to use a towel around the bottom to give me the grip I need to be able to move the product through the dispenser.</li>
            <li> All good antiperspirants contain aluminum, which is NOT good.  </li>
            <li> I sweat much more than the average person.</li>
            <li> I really love this product and would never consider to buy any other products!</li>
            <li> Trying something new and really like the product.  </li>
            <li> Keeps me dry and odor free all day.</li>
            <li> The only tip I have is to be sure to scrub your under arms in the shower, because since it&#x27;s waterproof, it will definitely stay on and leave a film.</li>
            <li> Prior to discovering this, we had tried many brands, applying it multiple times a day---all to no avail.  </li>
            <li> the only thing that worked for this post pregnant lady.</li>
            <li> Finally a deodorant worthy of praise.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like this one.</li>
            <li> but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any particular &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; about this.</li>
            <li> Have not seen any particular strength in preventing sweating that deserves a &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; label</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is a little strong (at first).</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter has a very strong odor and sweating problem--and it doesn&#x27;t help that she is very active.  </li>
            <li> but I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rated highly in terms of the safety of its ingredients, too.  </li>
            <li> I ended up buying about 10 different deodorants to try, and secret clinical waterproof was by far the most effective.</li>
            <li> Just wish it smelled a little better.</li>
            <li> I perspire (a little) more than is normal</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t stay wet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use this type of deodorant.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just as much as my normal bar.</li>
            <li> I decided that since Secret has always had a good reputation I will try the clinical strength (b/c</li>
            <li> I live in the South, and I&#x27;m a stress-sweater.</li>
            <li> I started a new job and sweated like a pig.</li>
            <li> It last all day and during hot and humid days too.</li>
            <li> I am unable to use regular deodorant and this is the next best thing to a prescription.</li>
            <li> First time trying the solid version of this product.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry and easy enough to come off in the shower.</li>
            <li> it is the only brand and type I found to ensure My underarms stay dry and odor free</li>
            <li> I like the large size of this item and that I save an extra 15% through subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> A little water is OK and it still works well later in the day.</li>
            <li> the mechanism you turn to push out the product is sometimes hard to turn, though in the more recent products I&#x27;ve purchased, it hasn&#x27;t been so much of a problem, and</li>
            <li> i perspire often (like cold sweat) and i&#x27;m happy to have this product in my life.</li>
            <li> I struggled for years with hormone issues and standard deodorants not doing much for me.</li>
            <li> I have been a faithful user of the product for my adult life.</li>
            <li> It does not need to be used daily unless you really scrub your underarms in the shower.  </li>
            <li> My 16 year old daughter has now started using it and loves it .</li>
            <li> Welp, when you spend nearly 15 dollars on it, I guess it has a lot of expectations.  </li>
            <li> Texture is soft and not heavy.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat water-proof, so lasts quite a long time -- I use it in the morning, and can go much of the next day if I don&#x27;t take another shower first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li> You really need to shop around, either locally or on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it hasn&#x27;t given me a problem.</li>
            <li> I rather than use much effort on something so simple.</li>
            <li> I see a lot of people have been surprised at the quantity of product they get.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth the extra money to start using on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only cheaper than what you buy in store if you subscribe and save: worth the extra money to get the quality product I need!!!</li>
            <li> Good stuff--too expensive</li>
            <li> The odor protection is good but other than that it sucks.</li>
            <li> I then bought the exact same stick from Wal Mart and went back and forth with each one for 4 days..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this solid to be particularly stronger.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise, the second one came exactly the same -</li>
            <li> I feel like the price is too high for the amount of product included; this is why I only give it five stars.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and invisible but be careful as it still can leave white streaks if you don your outfit too fast while it is not fully dry.</li>
            <li> Overall it was a negative one, although Amazon handled return and replacement pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> Can leave those white stains every once in a while (if you put too much on), but it is the only deodorant that will work for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried soooo many clinical strength deodorants, this is the only one I&#x27;ve found lately that works.</li>
            <li> I was surprised one day last week when I felt wet in the underarm area, but it was a highly hot and humid day in the south.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work any better than the regular Secret deoderant I normally buy</li>
            <li> Keeps you fresh &amp; dry all day long.</li>
            <li> it is only about half full.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, especially if you have the same problems.</li>
            <li> im a 49 yr old female btw</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant that keeps me presentable and professional.</li>
            <li> This fixed my problem, simple as that.</li>
            <li> (apparently, I am allergic to Dove.  </li>
            <li> Apparently something about nursing changes your body chemistry.  </li>
            <li> Certainly not a good choice if you are concerned about your health as it is super high in aluminum.  </li>
            <li> it looks like you&#x27;re getting your money&#x27;s worth and your getting only half.  </li>
            <li> As an American from a cooler climate, when we moved to Shanghai, China my body was in shock at the high heat and steamy humidity of the long summers.  </li>
            <li> I noticed early after starting to use the stick that arrived that I could &amp;#34;smell through it&amp;#34; on days that I wasn&#x27;t doing anything extra: just work and home.</li>
            <li> Secret clinical strength is one of the only brands that work for me, and the Waterproof  is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> My problem FINALLY has a solution, no more ruined shirts, specially the white ones!</li>
            <li> This is expensive compared to regular strength--but we use less and have better results so it is worth EVERY penny.</li>
            <li> this was a GREAT PRICE but the cap pushes up when i twist the product, so as the content moved up, so does the lid that is holding the content together :(.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now and it works just as well now as it did when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best, the only thing that is bad is the container is so small.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to use regular secret, but not anymore as it does not protect me all day long, so I switched to clinical strength.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, it should have worked at least a little better during the summer months.  </li>
            <li> I purchase this for my daughter who has tried other clinical strength deodorants and natural deodorants.  </li>
            <li> It is very strong for me! :-(</li>
            <li> this really does help with excessive sweating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the clinical strength Secret for a few months now, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only gripe I have with this product, which has always been a gripe, is that every single one I have ever used has a problem with the turning mechanism.</li>
            <li> I had been encountering some issues with the &#x27;coverage&#x27; of deodorants and became frustrated with trying every kind on the shelf.  </li>
            <li> Hope they keep making it for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> Maybe people didn&#x27;t realize they were literally buying a small size and not the normal size</li>
            <li> If I have a choice, I will never go back to any other deodorant, ever.</li>
            <li> With this product, I use it once in the morning, and I am dry all day long!</li>
            <li> Does keep me dry and not stinky though.</li>
            <li> Smells fab and keeps me dry all day.</li>
            <li> I have been using Secret Clinical Strength for years, and it really is the only clinical strength deodorant that works for me.  </li>
            <li> Goes on wet and stays wet the entire day.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim figuring it would never live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for seven years, and I have had no problem with underarm moisture that whole time (save for when I tried something natural to avoid the aluminum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note to a few people who have reviewed this product poorly</li>
            <li> I thought maybe the product was supposed to be only filling half of the container and looked dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li> Keeps me dry all day!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just one less thing to worry about in the daily rituals.</li>
            <li> Did not like it my cloth damage and become white and make my underarm black</li>
            <li> Ordered this product based on previous reviews via Prime and 2 days later I am working without any sweat showing!</li>
            <li> I sweat terribly and can&#x27;t stand the idea of having BO lol..</li>
            <li> Total waste.</li>
            <li> I was using waterproof regularly (for everyday use) and perhaps that&#x27;s why.  </li>
            <li> The Secret brand is the only one that actually keeps me dry all day long.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the pricey side, but I&#x27;ll keep buying this as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> The one that arrived from here was NOT up to par with the other I purchased in store.</li>
            <li> , i would reapply just like any other deodorant, but it did hold up in the water.</li>
            <li> It was the first team the deodorant seemed to fail me.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with excessive perspiration all of my life, and the only way for me to deal with it was to keep reapplying deodorant throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> For some reason with other antiperspirants they seem to lose effectiveness after a while.</li>
            <li> I wish Amazon carried this in other scents or even an unscented version to change things up once in awhile.</li>
            <li> but I will still be trying other products.</li>
            <li> It worked as well as my regular, lesser priced, Secret deodorant.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a wet mess, which gets all over my clothes.  </li>
            <li> it is really hard for me to find a deodorant that actually works.</li>
            <li> Average stinky, probably.  </li>
            <li> My dirty clothes even still smell fresh.</li>
            <li> I would pick her up from sports/school and have to keep the windows rolled down in the car.  </li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about applying deodorant morning and night - as the directions indicate - but one or the other is sufficient for me.  </li>
            <li> (hopefully something with less chemicals).</li>
            <li> I ended up throwing away half of the tube because I couldn&#x27;t stand struggling every day to put on deodorant.</li>
            <li> But seriously, I felt compelled to write a review to back up the legitimacy of how well this product works.</li>
            <li> The deoderant is suppose to control under arm wetness but that part is not true.</li>
            <li> It was just a little weaker was all.</li>
            <li> I apply it in the morning whenever I forget, and just use a little.</li>
            <li> and I had started to notice that I was getting a little funky by the end of the day at work.</li>
            <li> thought about taking away a star for how little they give you, but in the end I decided to leave it.  </li>
            <li> It works for a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Have used it fore a little over two years.</li>
            <li> Prior to Secret Clinical Strength</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot, and tend to start smelling just a few hours after I shower.</li>
            <li> I do a heavy spin class followed by weight training and never have time throughout the day to reapply deodorant.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give myself a few weeks of testing before I committed to a review, but I have to say...</li>
            <li> This is one of the few deodorants that doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling paranoid all day that it stopped working.</li>
            <li> Will stain clothing if you perspire heavily though.</li>
            <li> I use this during the summer everyday.</li>
            <li> While this deodorant works well, Secret tests on animals, so I&#x27;m switching to a different (cruelty-free) brand like Kiss my Face.</li>
            <li> Just one downside, it is not available in the Philippines</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to turn the knob to use it-something is defective about it, but I could not find an easy way to contact Secret to get a refund.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little expensive for deodorant, but it is the only deodorant that works for me.</li>
            <li> After much disappointment with other deodorant/antiperspirants I tried this product and haven&#x27;t gone back to others  since......</li>
            <li> No more ruined shirts and embarrassing</li>
            <li> I hated to go outside because within an instant I had wet marks on any shirt I wore.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how since the product arrived packaged and sealed</li>
            <li> not sure what else you need from a deodorant.  </li>
            <li> A lil too small, but product is fab</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> This allows it to absorb, and you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems with the product having a perpetually slick texture.</li>
            <li> Recommend it if you are a heavy sweater!</li>
            <li> Unable to find this item locally.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t sweat excessively</li>
            <li> this is a hard working deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Even cheaper than Walmart, and that&#x27;s hard to do sometimes.</li>
            <li> i tried everything because i do tend to sweat a lot and hate that i cant wear certain shirts because of it...</li>
            <li> at least the one I received didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I feel like I must reapply at least once if not twice during the day.</li>
            <li> Back to wearing nothing but sleeveless tops and black t-shirts :(</li>
            <li> The dial on the bottom, at some point or other, gets jammed so badly</li>
            <li> Seriously folks, when I have sticky armpits, it just feels icky.  </li>
            <li> I never liked the smell of the Secret deodorants until I found this one.</li>
            <li> I needed something a little stronger than regular deodorant for the awful &amp;#34;stress sweat:.  </li>
            <li> This product has really made a difference, even in the worst extremes of temperature.  </li>
            <li> I use any Secret Clinical Strength now including the Waterproof (if I go to the pool or beach).</li>
            <li> Secret Clinical Strength, does what an antiperspirant is supposed to.</li>
            <li> Then, I purchased and applied secret clinical deodorant (waterproof).</li>
            <li> The combination of dial soap and secret cured my hormonal stench.</li>
            <li> The Secret Clinical Strength is all I use now and have for a couple years.</li>
            <li> I found this product Secret Clinical Strength Waterproof</li>
            <li> Just what you would expect from the Secret brand.</li>
            <li> practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that hiccup, I do recommend Secret&#x27;s Clinical Strength deodorant for anyone with embarrassing/distracting/irritating underarm moisture.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the Secret clinical strength deodorant.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the non waterproof type since this type is hard to get out of clothing washed in cold water.  </li>
            <li> It has that faint, feminine Secret odor which I like.  </li>
            <li> so i think ill try something stronger if there is any.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really weird.</li>
            <li> Forget the deodorants that smell weird when your sweat mixes with the perfumes in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 43-year-old woman, so can&#x27;t imagine how difficult this would be for a senior citizen or someone with arthritis.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too expensive.  </li>
            <li> This stuff sucks!!!</li>
            <li> I am taking estradiol( hormone replacement therapy) also, and it still was crazy.</li>
            <li> But was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> However, in the summer, I sweat so bad.  </li>
            <li> On bad days, I&#x27;ve had to have my husband do it.</li>
            <li> It was painful.      </li>
            <li> I never smelled bad!</li>
            <li> Smells awful.</li>
            <li> My body odor(post hysterectomy) after a night of night sweats was horrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> CAUSED A TERRIBLE RASH</li>
            <li> I have never been a terribly stinky person.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this stuff is the best</li>
            <li> I stopped using this it made lumps under my arms ive been having problems every since</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in love with the chemicals that are used in these commercial brands of antiperspirant/deodorant, but I&#x27;m a stinky girl, unfortunately, and it&#x27;s the only way. Secret Clinical Strength has proven the most effective for me. Until one of those &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; &amp;#34;chemical free&amp;#34; companies come up with the miracle cure for b.o., this is my weapon of choice.</li>
            <li> Great smell. Bigger size than at the store</li>
            <li> I have been using Secret Clinical Strength for years, and it really is the only clinical strength deodorant that works for me.  I have tried other brands, but they are not as effective.  The Secret brand is the only one that actually keeps me dry all day long.  Prior to Secret Clinical Strength I literally ruined shirts from sweating so much; this never happens anymore.  Not to mention the fact that the price is right and the ease of having it shipped to me makes it all the better!</li>
            <li> This deodorant is really great. I struggled for years with hormone issues and standard deodorants not doing much for me. I thought I&#x27;d have to go on a pill and run to doctors, but I tried this instead and had instant results. No more ruined shirts and embarrassing situations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the extra money to start using on a daily basis. The one down fall with the smooth solid is that it will leave the white residue on your clothes, so I make sure to hand wash the underarms after taking them off and that seems to remove it for the most part before throwing the clothes in the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s absolutely great. Highly recommended, especially if you have the same problems.</li>
            <li> As an American from a cooler climate, when we moved to Shanghai, China my body was in shock at the high heat and steamy humidity of the long summers.  I hated to go outside because within an instant I had wet marks on any shirt I wore.  This product has really made a difference, even in the worst extremes of temperature.  Because it is pricey I only use it in the summer but I highly recommend it.  You must put it on at night before you go to bed for it to work properly.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work. Save your money.  Total waste.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant in the clinical strengths by far.</li>
            <li> Great price! The only deodorant that I use.</li>
            <li> Best Antiperspirant I have ever used.  Keeps me dry and odor free all day.</li>
            <li> Not only does this work the very best, but a deodorant that does not come off in the swimming pool.  How good is that??????  This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> This is great deodorant and Amazon has a much better price than the stores.</li>
            <li> This Antiperspirant really works.  I have tried a lot of products over the years and this is the only one that works 100% - 100% of the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how since the product arrived packaged and sealed BUT it just doesn&#x27;t work like the ones I buy at Wal Mart: at least the one I received didn&#x27;t. I have been a faithful user of the product for my adult life. I sweat terribly and can&#x27;t stand the idea of having BO lol.. I noticed early after starting to use the stick that arrived that I could &amp;#34;smell through it&amp;#34; on days that I wasn&#x27;t doing anything extra: just work and home. I then bought the exact same stick from Wal Mart and went back and forth with each one for 4 days.. The one that arrived from here was NOT up to par with the other I purchased in store. Proceed with caution!! It&#x27;s only cheaper than what you buy in store if you subscribe and save: worth the extra money to get the quality product I need!!!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work any better than the regular Secret deoderant I normally buy but it costs 3x as much.  Not only that, it&#x27;s a wet mess, which gets all over my clothes.  And for some reason you&#x27;re supposed to put it on at bed time?</li>
            <li> I get a friend to purchase it every tine she travels but I&#x27;ve never ordered it before. Its the best!!!!! Wonderful problem solver. I Would just like to know how many is in the unit before ordering</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I find works the best for me! And this is such a great deal that can&#x27;t be found anywhere else!</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife and she loves it and swears that she won&#x27;t go a day without it. I am probably going to subscribe to monthly delivery of this and save a trip to the local target! Exceptional product!</li>
            <li> Smells awful. Better to get Speed Stick which is&lt;br /&gt;not gooey and does not stain clothes yellow.</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; subtley scented... not sure what else you need from a deodorant.  Great price on Amazon and prime eligble makes it super for me.</li>
            <li> the size of the bottle is misleading...it looks like you&#x27;re getting your money&#x27;s worth and your getting only half.  They are packaging it up to look like you&#x27;re getting more than you actually are.</li>
            <li> What I received is not what is pictured on this item&#x27;s page. The ingredients are different. I bought this specifically for the ingredients listed BECAUSE they work and didn&#x27;t irritate. At the price, I&#x27;m gonna be some kind of pissed off if it irritates...AAARRRGGGHHH.</li>
            <li> Great product, great value.  Delivered before date promised.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I perspire (a little) more than is normal, I&#x27;ve tried lots of brands, Secret is my favorite, when they came up with the Clinical, loved it even more, but the Waterproof is the best! I don&#x27;t necessarily use it because I&#x27;m in the water, I think it just stays in place much better!! My problem FINALLY has a solution, no more ruined shirts, specially the white ones!</li>
            <li> this stuff is great! it works well, even in hot humid weather when i&#x27;m at an amusement park all day. although it doesn&#x27;t cover me 100%, i find that this is the best clinical drugstore product. i perspire often (like cold sweat) and i&#x27;m happy to have this product in my life. the scent of this is masculine but also fresh, it&#x27;s a light scent, so it&#x27;s not overpowering like axe or girly like some cheap body spray. it didn&#x27;t leave my skin irritated but my skin kind of turned dry but nothing drastic. i have repurchased this and will continue to do so until i find something better (hopefully something with less chemicals).</li>
            <li> The waterproof version is so much better than the regular version of this product. The only thing that works for me in the summer!</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot, and tend to start smelling just a few hours after I shower. I have consistently struggled to find a deodorant that keeps me free from smell and withstands all day.  I do a heavy spin class followed by weight training and never have time throughout the day to reapply deodorant. This deodorant is perfect! It lasts all day, and has a very beautiful smell, like a light fragrance of peonies. It not only lasts through my morning and afternoon, but also through my gym workout through the evening. YAY!! I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased, and this size is perfect because it&#x27;s bigger than the usual size that&#x27;s in store. The consistency is a liquid powder form that becomes invisible just after you apply.  The only tip I have is to be sure to scrub your under arms in the shower, because since it&#x27;s waterproof, it will definitely stay on and leave a film. It&#x27;s that resilient ;)</li>
            <li> this really does help with excessive sweating. one of the only ones.</li>
            <li> this had a wonderful smell but i didnt stop sweat.i cant say that it is not good.guess all things dont work for everybody....i live in a hot climate so i think ill try something stronger if there is any.</li>
            <li> I really perspire under stress and this product does work for me...&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere without it &amp; it also controls odor.</li>
            <li> Controls wetness and odor, and I used to sweat a lot!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad deodorant, but it does not work as well as described!</li>
            <li> pricey for how much you get</li>
            <li> I wanted to give myself a few weeks of testing before I committed to a review, but I have to say...it is great!  Follow the instructions on the box and use it both before you go to bed and when you wake up and you&#x27;re good to go!  Something to note:  don&#x27;t put it on and then run out the door because it takes some time to absorb, I would say right after you get out of the shower so it can do it&#x27;s thing while you finish getting ready.  I don&#x27;t have to watch what I wear anymore for fear of underarm wetness; it&#x27;s a great feeling!</li>
            <li> This is the best brand I&#x27;ve ever used.  It does not need to be used daily unless you really scrub your underarms in the shower.  A little water is OK and it still works well later in the day.</li>
            <li> Seriously folks, when I have sticky armpits, it just feels icky.  This stuff works for me.  It&#x27;s just one less thing to worry about in the daily rituals.</li>
            <li> I had been encountering some issues with the &#x27;coverage&#x27; of deodorants and became frustrated with trying every kind on the shelf.  I decided that since Secret has always had a good reputation I will try the clinical strength (b/c I needed more than regular) and see what happens. It&#x27;s fantastic!  I use any Secret Clinical Strength now including the Waterproof (if I go to the pool or beach).</li>
            <li> Excellent product.   This works great. I didn&#x27;t think I would find anything to keep me from sweating so much but this did.</li>
            <li> A lil too small, but product is fab</li>
            <li> Secret Clinical Strength, does what an antiperspirant is supposed to. The fact that I get a 2.6 box for about the same price as a 1.6 box locally, makes it a no-brainer.</li>
            <li> My body odor(post hysterectomy) after a night of night sweats was horrible. I am taking estradiol( hormone replacement therapy) also, and it still was crazy. The hot flashes and hormonal change did a number of me. I was stinky like a lumberjack in the mornings. My mom commented on my odor also. It was really out of control. I tried all kinds of deodorants, taking showers twice a day. Nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;I solved the problem. I started showering with dial soap, which kills bacteria. Bacteria is what makes sweat smell... Then, I purchased and applied secret clinical deodorant (waterproof). I tested it. I took a shower the night before with dial and applied the deodorant before bed. I woke up the next day and there was no smell of any kind. Furthermore, I had a rest day and I laid around in my pajamas until 5 pm without reapplying deodorant or taking a shower and still no smell of any kind. It worked for hours, survived the night sweats and laying around the house for hours. The combination of dial soap and secret cured my hormonal stench. I purchased mine at walmart for @ $ 8.00.... This stuff is the best, the only thing that is bad is the container is so small.</li>
            <li> I really love this product and would never consider to buy any other products! I have tried many products but none as excellent as this one.</li>
            <li> Good stuff--too expensive</li>
            <li> The Secret Clinical Strength is all I use now and have for a couple years. It&#x27;s been a real lifesaver, helping me avoid embarrassment and clothing stains. Loved seeing it on Amazon for a couple bucks less than the stores.</li>
            <li> This deoderant works well and smells good.  Even on hot days it works. I would recommend trying it if you want a good deo.</li>
            <li> OK.  Bought it for prom and probably won&#x27;t use it again. Certainly not a good choice if you are concerned about your health as it is super high in aluminum.  Didn&#x27;t stop sweating or odor. May work better than a regular deodorant but not what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> BY FAR THE BEST DEODORANT EVER!!!!! IM IN LOVE SMELLS SO GOOD ALMOST LIKE GUY DEODORANT! WILL ONLY BUT THIS NOW ON NEVER MAKES U SMELL GROSS</li>
            <li> love it, i don&#x27;t need to use it everyday, but once I use it, its effect could last for 2 days, and smell really good. Good</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING if you have issues with underarm sweating. I have used it for years and will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the non waterproof type since this type is hard to get out of clothing washed in cold water.  It still works but it&#x27;s just a pain to get out of your clothing.</li>
            <li> it is really hard for me to find a deodorant that actually works. i tried everything because i do tend to sweat a lot and hate that i cant wear certain shirts because of it... but honestly this is MAGIC!!!!</li>
            <li> I now buy all of my cleaning and household products from Amazon. It makes my life easy and saves me time and money.</li>
            <li> Good value for the same item I have gotten in the local retail stores for years! I Will buy again.</li>
            <li> love this stuff!! works awesome!  i rarely sweat or smell but when i get nervous sweat, i stink!! this stuff smells like NOTHING and continues to smell like nothing...and neither do i...im a 49 yr old female btw and it works great when i exercise too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with body odor ever since having my kids.  This is the only deodorant that works for me now.  I love the fact that it truly is waterproof.</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks!!! My daughter does dance and sweats a lot. I found this and gave it to her so she could try it. The anti perspirant part doesn&#x27;t do anything! She said she still sweats the EXACT same amount she usually does. The odor protection is good but other than that it sucks. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Works great- I use this all summer</li>
            <li> I used to be able to use regular secret, but not anymore as it does not protect me all day long, so I switched to clinical strength.  Best thing I ever did as I work long hours and don&#x27;t feel sweaty at all. a lit too pricy, but it all depends on what your needs are.</li>
            <li> This smells great and works great if used as it states (put on before going to bed).Many mornings I still use a small amount again just to make sure!</li>
            <li> Actually made me sweat more if you can believe that. Goes on wet and stays wet the entire day. Terrible product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this solid to be particularly stronger.  I was using waterproof regularly (for everyday use) and perhaps that&#x27;s why.  Regardless, it should have worked at least a little better during the summer months.  It worked as well as my regular, lesser priced, Secret deodorant.  However, I was looking for something stronger on those super hot &amp; humid days.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years...I have noticed it does not work as well as I thought it did when I first started using it though...I still buy it on a monthly basis :)</li>
            <li> Something liquid keeps shooting out each time I try and use this product. It&#x27;s really weird. I have this on subscribe and save, but am considering not getting it anymore because of the mysterious liquid. Does keep me dry and not stinky though.</li>
            <li> Only deodorant I will use.  I sweat A LOT.  I used to have to use strong mens deodorant to help keep me from smelling like onions by the end of the day.... and WHAT is feminine at all about smelling like a dude (or onions?)?  Exactly.  This deodorant is great, its so waterproof that I can feel the barrier in the shower the next morning, and I don&#x27;t mind it because I do not want to be stinky!  I love this stuff.  Subscribe and save will help big time with the price, but if you sweat like I do, you wont mind the price at all!</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this antiperspirant for the past 5 years and it is the only product she trusts in the hot Phoenix summers.  She applies the product at bedtime as recommended and has never had any issues with stains on clothing.</li>
            <li> This is the best antipresperant/deodorant I have ever used! I had tried a lot of differentvtypes to control my body odor and nothing has worked like this. I only have to use once a day, compared to others i had to use a lot two to four times a day. I live a stressfull life in a hot place, so i used to have a lot of problems til i tried this! I highly recommend! This is a good deal, I checked in stores and it was about 12$ @ wal mart. Great deal, great product!!!</li>
            <li> Can leave those white stains every once in a while (if you put too much on), but it is the only deodorant that will work for me.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few deodorants that doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling paranoid all day that it stopped working. Thanks for putting it on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> Ive tried the gel deodorants in the summer because the solids melted, and nothing worked. I still stunk! I really put this stuff to the test though when i went out on the boat, went all day at cedar point and even in a hot tub. I never smelled bad! it did get weaker after the hot tub..so i wouldnt necessarily count on it after a day at the pool, i would reapply just like any other deodorant, but it did hold up in the water. It was just a little weaker was all. You can kinda tell how well its covering you by its smell, which is so wonderful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Mitchum.  I thought it was the best.  I decided to see about subscribe and save with amazon because the store I buy  most of my groceries doesn&#x27;t carry Mitchum anyway so wanted to see what Amazon carries.  I found this product Secret Clinical Strength Waterproof and I have to say it blows Mitchum out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best antiperspirant deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used and I am keeping this on subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> Works great! It last all day and during hot and humid days too. It sometimes gets hot at my job and i run around and get sweaty but my armpits stay fresh!</li>
            <li> It really is waterproof!</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to turn the knob to use it-something is defective about it, but I could not find an easy way to contact Secret to get a refund.</li>
            <li> I like the large size of this item and that I save an extra 15% through subscribe and save. I don&#x27;t have to think about re-ordering and email alerts give me plenty of time to adjust my order if need be. You don&#x27;t need a lot of this product to be effective.</li>
            <li> Once you try this you will never go back. Forget the deodorants that smell weird when your sweat mixes with the perfumes in it. This just keeps you stink free, period.</li>
            <li> This is brilliant. Smells fab and keeps me dry all day. My 16 year old daughter has now started using it and loves it .</li>
            <li> This product works great.  I put it on at night and, if needed, again in the morning.  Keeps me dry all day!  Like the fresh scent too!</li>
            <li> Eliminates odors generated by medication</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d see the day where I&#x27;m reviewing deodorant.  Welp, when you spend nearly 15 dollars on it, I guess it has a lot of expectations.  It&#x27;s okay,  I work around people all day in close proximity, so I am all about purchasing something that is a superior product, but I really don&#x27;t think this is that great.  I have hyperhydrosis as well and this honestly compares to a regular deodorant.  If you are a woman looking for a strong deodorant I highly suggest purchasing men&#x27;s deodorant.  There are a lot of scents out there these days that aren&#x27;t too manly! Plus, it will save you some cash!</li>
            <li> This really does what it says it will do.  I don&#x27;t normally use this type of deodorant.  However, in the summer, I sweat so bad.  Not while I&#x27;m using this product I don&#x27;t.  It truly works.  As a matter of fact, I don&#x27;t have to use it every day.  That&#x27;s how good it works.</li>
            <li> Just what you would expect from the Secret brand. The scent is pleasant and not too strong. Texture is soft and not heavy. Good.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter has a very strong odor and sweating problem--and it doesn&#x27;t help that she is very active.  Prior to discovering this, we had tried many brands, applying it multiple times a day---all to no avail.  I would pick her up from sports/school and have to keep the windows rolled down in the car.  It was painful.      With this--she applies it in the morning--and while she does keep an extra one with her in her backpack, she rarely if ever reapplies it---and she still smells fine at the end of the day.  This is an absolute miracle---and the delight of those of us around her.      This is expensive compared to regular strength--but we use less and have better results so it is worth EVERY penny.</li>
            <li> CAUSED A TERRIBLE RASH</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a sweating person in general until getting pregnant.  This is my first deodorant and antiperspirant product, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  When I first opened the product package and removed the sticky tape on the top, the product looked completely dry and cracked on the surface.  Also, it looked that over 1/3 of the container on top is empty, so I returned my first order for a replacement.  To my surprise, the second one came exactly the same - I thought maybe the product was supposed to be only filling half of the container and looked dry and cracked.  It took me lots of twists to finally get the solid to the surface.  Yes it stopped sweating and did its job.  However after 2 weeks use, my armpits felt itchy and my OB said I could be allergy.  So I stopped using the product, and the itch was gone.  I did extensive research online before purchasing this product and seems lots of other pregnant women were OK with it.  Anyway, I&#x27;m only talking about my own experience.  Overall it was a negative one, although Amazon handled return and replacement pretty quickly.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I actually love the product. I have been using it for seven years, and I have had no problem with underarm moisture that whole time (save for when I tried something natural to avoid the aluminum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note to a few people who have reviewed this product poorly: it is meant to be applied in the evening before you go to bed. This allows it to absorb, and you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems with the product having a perpetually slick texture. I apply it in the morning whenever I forget, and just use a little. A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only gripe I have with this product, which has always been a gripe, is that every single one I have ever used has a problem with the turning mechanism. The dial on the bottom, at some point or other, gets jammed so badly I just don&#x27;t have the hand/wrist strength to turn it at all. I have to bust out the pliers and tackle the dial with those when this problem occurs. If it isn&#x27;t obvious why this is a problem, I don&#x27;t always have pliers (why would I take them on a trip?), and basic principle: why the heck should a deodorant company make a product that actually requires the use of pliers to fully function? Come on, industrial designers and deodorant container engineers! I know you can pull your minds together and make something a bit more practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that hiccup, I do recommend Secret&#x27;s Clinical Strength deodorant for anyone with embarrassing/distracting/irritating underarm moisture. I&#x27;m not a doctor, so let that be known, but it has been a reliable staple in my daily routine for years.</li>
            <li> The deodorant itself works fine. I was surprised one day last week when I felt wet in the underarm area, but it was a highly hot and humid day in the south. It was the first team the deodorant seemed to fail me. My real problem is with the dispenser. I have carpal tunnel syndrome. On an average day, I have to use a towel around the bottom to give me the grip I need to be able to move the product through the dispenser. On bad days, I&#x27;ve had to have my husband do it. I&#x27;m a 43-year-old woman, so can&#x27;t imagine how difficult this would be for a senior citizen or someone with arthritis. I ended up throwing away half of the tube because I couldn&#x27;t stand struggling every day to put on deodorant. Pretty sure your deodorant is supposed to prevent sweat, not cause it.</li>
            <li> I needed something a little stronger than regular deodorant for the awful &amp;#34;stress sweat:.  This stuff works great.  I was a little concerned about applying deodorant morning and night - as the directions indicate - but one or the other is sufficient for me.  And I really like not having to apply before I get dressed.</li>
            <li> the only thing that worked for this post pregnant lady.</li>
            <li> Do as they say! this is a hard working deodorant.  Recommend it if you are a heavy sweater!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I am unable to use regular deodorant and this is the next best thing to a prescription.</li>
            <li> I live in the South, and I&#x27;m a stress-sweater. This is the only deodorant that keeps me presentable and professional.</li>
            <li> All good antiperspirants contain aluminum, which is NOT good.  However, nothing works as well as these.  Thank you.  Maureen</li>
            <li> best deodorant ever! It dries quickly and invisible but be careful as it still can leave white streaks if you don your outfit too fast while it is not fully dry. Ive tried many &amp;#34;super&amp;#34; formulas of the higher strength and the Secret seems to be the best of all of them - I wont hesitate to purchase it again!</li>
            <li> Only stuff that works for me. And nice to get it a little cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Does the job!! great product. .Comes from someone who sweats a lot.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Best Antiperspirant &amp; deodorant by far. Keeps you fresh &amp; dry all day long. I have tried them all &amp; this one works! Will stain clothing if you perspire heavily though.</li>
            <li> Finally a deodorant worthy of praise.  I bought this on a whim figuring it would never live up to the hype.  But was I wrong!  It truly does keep me drier and smelling fresh.  Hope they keep making it for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> Product is excellent but packaging doesn&#x27;t always work.  It won&#x27;t advance when the lever is turned and i end up throwing away before gone because i can&#x27;t get to it.</li>
            <li> Great product--works better than anything else on the market, and the waterproof feature works well--just as described!  I&#x27;ve been a fan of this product for years...</li>
            <li> The waterproof formula is the only kind that will work on me and is still working the next morning when I shower and reapply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the clinical strength Secret for a few months now, and I love it.  It keeps me dry and confident.  I have had issues with excessive perspiration all of my life, and the only way for me to deal with it was to keep reapplying deodorant throughout the day.  With this product, I use it once in the morning, and I am dry all day long!</li>
            <li> Product works. It is definitely worth the higher price tag. I am a sales rep who is running all day long and this has been the best deodorant I have tried. You will not be sorry. This is the only deodorant I will use now.</li>
            <li> It works better than regular deodarant.</li>
            <li> If I have a choice, I will never go back to any other deodorant, ever. I have always sweat a lot and I had started to notice that I was getting a little funky by the end of the day at work. I tried for months to fix my issue but still had embarrassing odors by noon-time. This fixed my problem, simple as that. I don&#x27;t even need to re apply, I stay fresh all day! One day I couldn&#x27;t find it, so I used an old deodorant and quickly remembered why I love this deodorant so much, its the only one I have found that works.</li>
            <li> Very effective and smells great. I have tried soooo many clinical strength deodorants, this is the only one I&#x27;ve found lately that works. Thank god!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good deodorant for me and I like the Powder Fresh scent.  It meets my expectations.  It is waterproof so I do take a bit of extra time in the shower to get rid of the residue.</li>
            <li> After much disappointment with other deodorant/antiperspirants I tried this product and haven&#x27;t gone back to others  since......it is the only brand and type I found to ensure My underarms stay dry and odor free ......and delivery was fast as always....</li>
            <li> I use this during the summer everyday. You never know when you are going to go to the beach, Lake house, or being swimming in a pool during the summer months!</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my daughter who has tried other clinical strength deodorants and natural deodorants.  She swears by this product.</li>
            <li> While this deodorant works well, Secret tests on animals, so I&#x27;m switching to a different (cruelty-free) brand like Kiss my Face.</li>
            <li> This product works better than anything I have ever tried.  For a woman, I tend to sweat more than most, but thanks to this amazing product, I not only smell wonderful, I stay dry too!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sweat AT ALL wearing this stuff! Even in the Florida heat, which is definitely saying something.  Smells great, goes on easily.  I think I found a new favorite!</li>
            <li> Body odor changes with age. This is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> No white marks.  No breakthrough BO. This product works very well...........I hightly recommend this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it and see the diference.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve found so far. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now and it works just as well now as it did when I first started using it. For some reason with other antiperspirants they seem to lose effectiveness after a while. I never liked the smell of the Secret deodorants until I found this one. A great fresh scent that isn&#x27;t too strong. It&#x27;s a little on the pricey side, but I&#x27;ll keep buying this as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective antiperspirant.  Its protection lasts well over 36hrs, &amp; it has a pleasant fragrance.  It&#x27;s rated highly in terms of the safety of its ingredients, too.  The company also uses responsible business practices according to goodguide.com.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Its the only brand I use!  I particularly like this one.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this item!!! You will not be dissapointed. Unable to find this item locally. Will reorder when necessary.</li>
            <li> I have never been a terribly stinky person.  Average stinky, probably.  I went for years using regular ol&#x27; deodorant, with only one issue since I hit puberty and started needing to wear it (apparently, I am allergic to Dove.  Gentle, sure, uh huh).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I had a baby.  Apparently something about nursing changes your body chemistry.  My husband turned to me one day and said, &amp;#34;You know, you should really try a stronger deodorant.&amp;#34;  The soul of tact, that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this.  It worked great!  Even my non-tactful husband remarked that I smelled much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought about taking away a star for how little they give you, but in the end I decided to leave it.  The stink mitigation worked, after all.</li>
            <li> Secret clinical strength is one of the only brands that work for me, and the Waterproof  is my favorite.  It keeps me dry and easy enough to come off in the shower.</li>
            <li> I just recently switched and I love this deoderant.  Goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t stay wet.</li>
            <li> First time trying the solid version of this product. It seems to work better then the gel version. It is invisible and pleasant smelling. Works all day</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little expensive for deodorant, but it is the only deodorant that works for me. The smell is great too!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know about any one else but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any particular &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; about this. It smells nice and basically works like Old Spice from the closest pharmacy/grocery store. Have not seen any particular strength in preventing sweating that deserves a &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; label</li>
            <li> Did not like it my cloth damage and become white and make my underarm black</li>
            <li> This works awesome! IF you can get it out of its container. There is a dial you turn to advance the product. I ordered it twice. On both containers, I had to use some sort of gripper to persuade the dial to turn. On the second container, I actually had to use pliers. I won&#x27;t be ordering again. It does work, and work well. But who needs the aggravation?</li>
            <li> Trying something new and really like the product.  I&#x27;ll continue to use the product.  Very fresh scent and works like it is supposed to</li>
            <li> I love this product! Smells good, no allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Stinks.....and only worked for about three quarters of the day for me...</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness! I love this deodorant so much. I started a new job and sweated like a pig. I know I sweat a lot already, but the new office space was so warm and with nerves mixed in, I was pretty embarrassed. Ordered this product based on previous reviews via Prime and 2 days later I am working without any sweat showing! Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a little strong (at first). I wish Amazon carried this in other scents or even an unscented version to change things up once in awhile. But seriously, I felt compelled to write a review to back up the legitimacy of how well this product works. It has really worked well for me. I have since signed up to get this on a subscription basis, my first time using this service via Amazon.</li>
            <li> If you have a problem with heavy perspiration, especially in the summer/hot months, this is great.  It is somewhat water-proof, so lasts quite a long time -- I use it in the morning, and can go much of the next day if I don&#x27;t take another shower first thing in the morning.  It has that faint, feminine Secret odor which I like.  The only two things I should point out are (1) the mechanism you turn to push out the product is sometimes hard to turn, though in the more recent products I&#x27;ve purchased, it hasn&#x27;t been so much of a problem, and (2) COST!  You really need to shop around, either locally or on Amazon.  But I find it so effective, I&#x27;m going to keep using it.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever. Stays on. Perfect if you sweat a lot day-to-day and don&#x27;t want pit stains. If you sweat you get it. Perfect for beach and pool too!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not like the fragrance. It is very strong for me! :-(</li>
            <li> This deoderant really works with controlling under arm odor. I put some on in the morning and it last all day. I still smell good after my work outs. The deoderant is suppose to control under arm wetness but that part is not true. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.</li>
            <li> Worth the higher price than others and works way better than other brands&#x27; clinical strengths. This is the only deodorant I buy any more.</li>
            <li> works great. Now even on the hottest humid days I don&#x27;t have the reapply halfway through the day</li>
            <li> Wow! I didn&#x27;t expect this to work so well. Ironically, I sweat everywhere but under my arms now in the hot weather :) Now if they only had something to use all over your body....</li>
            <li> It works for a little bit.  I have to reaaply about three times a day.  I wish that once is enough.  The scent is great and it doesn&#x27;t clump up but I will still be trying other products.</li>
            <li> About the only deodrant that truly works for me and keeps me fresh and clean feeling all day!</li>
            <li> I love this product and this is was a great price too!  Even cheaper than Walmart, and that&#x27;s hard to do sometimes.</li>
            <li> I like how it is waterproof and disappears almost instantly.  I do put it on more than once a day though.  It doesn&#x27;t last all day for me, but I like how it is moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Great product, but I had to stop buying it b/c it&#x27;s too expensive.  VERY effective; I&#x27;ll definitely return to it when we can throw lots of money away on toiletries.</li>
            <li> my friend introduced me to Clinical strength. I am a secret user for so long and it is the best in the market for me, until i discover clinical strength. me and my daughters, both athletes and sweating all the time, just love that it keeps us dry and fresh and smelling good all the time. it&#x27;s also good that the protection lasts for hours and hours.Just one downside, it is not available in the Philippines so I have to order online and asked my relative to ship it to me.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on this product, I was really hoping this deodorant would be the solution to my chronic sweating problem. Although it does work better than other deodorants, I will still sweat through anything with sleeves. Back to wearing nothing but sleeveless tops and black t-shirts :(</li>
            <li> I do foot patrols of parking lots in 100+ degree weather. The last time I checked the asphalt temperature it was 140 degrees F. So there&#x27;s my point of reference for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t sweat excessively and I still smell fresh after an 8 hour shift. Most deodorants and antiperspirants couldn&#x27;t do that for me. I have sensitive skin and it hasn&#x27;t given me a problem.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work at all. I reek when I wear it, and I&#x27;m not a smelly person. It&#x27;s like it makes me sweat even more!</li>
            <li> I have been using ban brand deodorant for years. It was the only deodorant that worked ok for me. I sweat much more than the average person. Out of nowhere my ban stopped working for me. I was very smelly, and very damp. I ended up buying about 10 different deodorants to try, and secret clinical waterproof was by far the most effective. When I put it on, it lasts the entire day. My dirty clothes even still smell fresh. The only downside to this deodorant is the amount that comes in the tube. It looks like a large deodorant stick, but really- it is only about half full. I used up the deodorant in a couple of weeks, despite only needing to apply it once per day. I feel like the price is too high for the amount of product included; this is why I only give it five stars.</li>
            <li> I have loved this product since it came out! It works, no sweat, no smell, nothing. It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> this was a GREAT PRICE but the cap pushes up when i twist the product, so as the content moved up, so does the lid that is holding the content together :(. I had to hold on to the lid, while twisting up so the lid doesnt pop out and the content squished out. I rather than use much effort on something so simple.</li>
            <li> Pricy but works. Just wish it smelled a little better. Much prefer the light and fresh scent.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the Secret clinical strength deodorant. It really works for girls who sweat a lot. Nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I see a lot of people have been surprised at the quantity of product they get. I got mine and it&#x27;s just as much as my normal bar. (Look at the net weights in photo). I saw there was 1.6 oz for sale. Maybe people didn&#x27;t realize they were literally buying a small size and not the normal size and that&#x27;s why they were upset?  So I recommend paying attention to the sizes.</li>
            <li> I love the waterproof feature.  I can swim and not fear losing protection.  This is easy on the skin and effective as well.</li>
            <li> I really like and I also think it is very good because my expectations MEETS would buy again&lt;br /&gt;pleased XO</li>
            <li> I feel like I must reapply at least once if not twice during the day. I shower in the morning so the plan to apply it before bed does not work since AI work out in the morning.</li>
            <li> The Best antipersperant ever. Have used it fore a little over two years. Nothing beats it.</li>
    </ol>
