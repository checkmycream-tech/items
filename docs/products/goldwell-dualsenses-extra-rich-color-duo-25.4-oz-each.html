            <li>Love the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>BEST DEEP CONDITIONER/HAIR MASQUE EVER CREATED.</li>
            <li>I am sooooooooo glad I invested in my shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is just always healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>I happen to really love this line of hair products.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair healthy.</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many of my friends and family converted to these products.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo &amp; conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The amazon price was better.</li>
            <li>I love Goldwell products, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this combo, and love it on my hair.</li>
            <li>Great product, great for over processed hair due to color &amp; heat.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft &amp; beautiful.  </li>
            <li>So far this shampoo is great.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice much of a sent to it and it feels good on my hair and&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love Goldwell products, keep my color treated hair looking fresh</li>
            <li>Its light with volume but the color is protected.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the way the shampoo lathers and it doesn&#x27;t feel like my hair is truly clean.</li>
            <li>Well this product isn&#x27;t as good, it doesn&#x27;t contain similar ingredients, and, it turned my hair into straw.  </li>
            <li>I like fragrances, even the more \\&quot;informal\\&quot; ones, but this stuff is just too much and doesn&#x27;t wear well.  </li>
            <li>it has good smell and big bottle</li>
            <li>Super quick shipping.</li>
            <li>This shampoo, after the first hour, starts to smell cheap and cloying.  </li>
            <li>This product comes highly recommended from my beautician because it&#x27;s complimentary to the coloring product she uses on my hair:)</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about this pair.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Their aloe-based shampoos and conditioners (most lately, the Color Definitions line) were simply the best in the business.  </li>
            <li>I love how this makes my hair feel; so soft and reduces the amount of frizz.</li>
            <li>I bought it last year, same size dispensers and it lasted a good 6 or 7 months!</li>
            <li>The extra rich is creamier &amp; you get a lot more lather from it.  </li>
            <li>Keeps your hair true to color, but doesnt moisturize as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that smooth, moisturizing feel that most other conditioners have.</li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo for a couple years now, both the regular and the rich; my hair gets dry in the summer and this shampoo makes my hair silky and shiny all year long; The smell is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner does not seem to make my hair soft and smooth at all.</li>
            <li>sure you purchase the matching 60 second conditioning treatment as well.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t re-purchase this is exact set</li>
            <li>Love thsee products, have been using for a long time</li>
            <li>I have had good luck with Goldwell in the past, so when I got my hair highlighted I thought I would give them a go again.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m willing to try other Goldwell products as well :)</li>
            <li>When I saw that this line had been discontinued recently, I nearly panicked, but then told myself that this was Goldwell, and surely their new stuff would be just as good, contain the same aloe base, and be great for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Although it may be a little more then what I want to spend, it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li>I find I still need a little extra oomph for the conditioner, but for daily use the set is perfect.</li>
            <li>fragerance is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love it, leaves my hair so soft and smells terrific!</li>
            <li>and this holds my bright violet red longer than any other shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;*****Make</li>
            <li>The shampoo definitely cleans my hair, and the conditioner really helps to keep the color in and makes my hair super shiny.</li>
            <li>Live this product!</li>
            <li>so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the way Joico makes my hair feel; however, the color dulls a bit with my (almost) daily cleansing.</li>
            <li>have mixed feelings about the Extra Rich Color Duo.</li>
            <li>This shampoo makes me hair shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>just isn&#x27;t the same as the extra rich.  </li>
            <li>my hair feeling clean, not weighed down.  </li>
            <li>So I switched back to the Curly Twist shampoo and my hair is much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thing is, I am accustomed to conditioners making hair feel soft and smooth--this conditioner does not do that.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I wrote this, and I&#x27;m stocking up on all the old line I can get on the internet.  </li>
            <li>I looked on Amazon and found I could buy the same product my hairdresser uses at really reduced prices ...</li>
            <li>The bottles i received must have either been old or not legitimate.</li>
            <li>It comes in a regular vs. extra rich version and unless you have very dry hair</li>
            <li>This product may have been too gentle on my hair- and seemed to dry it out.  </li>
            <li>More than double the volume that I usually get from my hairdresser for about the same price.</li>
            <li>You will never want to go back to the old store bought stuff!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and manageable and I definitely recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Prematurely grey headed early 30 year old male here, have to color my hair every 4 weeks.  </li>

            <li> Prematurely grey headed early 30 year old male here, have to color my hair every 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> First, the fragrance in this shampoo is just too strong and competes badly with any quality perfume one might wish to wear.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, my hair came out awful--</li>
            <li> The conditioner is not heavy and does not weigh my hair down!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so disappointed in a personal care product in my life, especially since this is a company I&#x27;ve come to value so much over the past many years.  </li>
            <li> So....I would order the other one next time.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, dry, color treated, curly hair.</li>
            <li> When I said above that it looked like straw, I mean it felt and looked dry and stuck out from my head in clumps.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is that I hold out the theoretical possibility that something could be worse than this stuff.</li>
            <li> In fact, I can&#x27;t detangle my hair in the shower with this conditioner, which seems odd, but there you</li>
            <li> So I am conflicted because the results are there, but I don&#x27;t have the satisfaction of running my fingers through my wet, slick, slippery locks while in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is my first Amazon product review, and I am motivated by severe disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I have tons of hair, it is thick and it is LONG!</li>
            <li> This product will last you at least 6 months!  </li>
            <li> However, it is a little heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> Locks your color down!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Joico Color Endure line for a few years.</li>
            <li> I wrote to Goldwell about my disappointment, but they didn&#x27;t seem particularly concerned about my opinion.  </li>
            <li> this is too thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> Plus, my color looks dull and washed out to boot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  </li>
            <li> My bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using goldwell for 10 years and the smell and quality of these bottles were bad</li>
            <li> I switched from their curly shampoo to this one, and was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I figured I did something unconsciously stupid, or my hair hadn&#x27;t \\&quot;adjusted\\&quot; or something.  </li>
            <li> just awful.</li>
            <li> AWFUL.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner. Packaging was unsatisfactory and the conditioner leaked in shipping.</li>
            <li> This product may have been too gentle on my hair- and seemed to dry it out.  I switched from their curly shampoo to this one, and was disappointed.  So I switched back to the Curly Twist shampoo and my hair is much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, a friend does like this shampoo/conditioner combo. It all depends on what your hair needs</li>
            <li> I have had good luck with Goldwell in the past, so when I got my hair highlighted I thought I would give them a go again. My bad. I am not crazy about this pair. I don&#x27;t like the way the shampoo lathers and it doesn&#x27;t feel like my hair is truly clean. The conditioner does not seem to make my hair soft and smooth at all. Will definitely not buy again.</li>
            <li> Goldwell is the best! I always come back to my reliable brand.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells unreal and is good for color treated hair. However, it is a little heavy for my hair. It comes in a regular vs. extra rich version and unless you have very dry hair this is too thick and heavy. So....I would order the other one next time.If it didnt smell so good i would give it away.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair. Look no further. I&#x27;ve tried every product out there (lots of hairdresser friends!) and this holds my bright violet red longer than any other shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;*****Make sure you purchase the matching 60 second conditioning treatment as well. BEST DEEP CONDITIONER/HAIR MASQUE EVER CREATED. Locks your color down!*****</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Joico Color Endure line for a few years. I LOVE the way Joico makes my hair feel; however, the color dulls a bit with my (almost) daily cleansing. Because I use Goldwell Topchic color, I figured I&#x27;d give the Goldwell shampoo/conditioner set a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mixed feelings about the Extra Rich Color Duo. The shampoo definitely cleans my hair, and the conditioner really helps to keep the color in and makes my hair super shiny. Thing is, I am accustomed to conditioners making hair feel soft and smooth--this conditioner does not do that. It doesn&#x27;t have that smooth, moisturizing feel that most other conditioners have. So I am conflicted because the results are there, but I don&#x27;t have the satisfaction of running my fingers through my wet, slick, slippery locks while in the shower. In fact, I can&#x27;t detangle my hair in the shower with this conditioner, which seems odd, but there you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 (five) stars for results: shiny, color-saturated, healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;-1 star for &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and tangled hair... weird</li>
            <li> Love thsee products, have been using for a long time</li>
            <li> I have tons of hair, it is thick and it is LONG! It used to always look fried. I am sooooooooo glad I invested in my shampoo. I don&#x27;t think i need to get trims as often. I love just taking a moment and smelling my gorgeous healthy locks.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised.  Love Goldwell products, keep my color treated hair looking fresh like I just got it done!  Super quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Great transaction!  Great product!</li>
            <li> Perfect pair of hair care products!!! The size and convenient pumps work great too. Great price for these products. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for years.  By far my favorite shampoo and conditioner.  My color stays great. My hair is just always healthy looking.  I happen to really love this line of hair products.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair healthy. Also can hold the color in the longest. Although it may be a little more then what I want to spend, it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this brand!!! This shampoo makes me hair shiny and soft! The conditioner is not heavy and does not weigh my hair down! I would buy this again but I&#x27;m willing to try other Goldwell products as well :)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s agreat pruduct i have been buying it for years i could nevber get the bigger sizes at the beuty salon where i go</li>
            <li> price is awesome. this shampoo and conditioner does wonders for my hair. My hair is very healthy but dyed, and this just transforms the feel of it. Its light with volume but the color is protected.</li>
            <li> So far this shampoo is great.  I don&#x27;t notice much of a sent to it and it feels good on my hair and&lt;br /&gt;leaves my hair feeling clean, not weighed down.  I&#x27;ve only been using this shampoo for a couple weeks&lt;br /&gt;but so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> This product will last you at least 6 months!  I love the shampoo and conditioner.  It leaves my hair soft and manageable and I definitely recommend this product.  I bought it last year, same size dispensers and it lasted a good 6 or 7 months! Happy Hair happy ME!</li>
            <li> Prematurely grey headed early 30 year old male here, have to color my hair every 4 weeks.  No sulfate shampoos and conditioners help me make it that last week.</li>
            <li> This is my first Amazon product review, and I am motivated by severe disappointment.  I have been a Goldwell product user since the mid-1990&#x27;s. Their aloe-based shampoos and conditioners (most lately, the Color Definitions line) were simply the best in the business.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many of my friends and family converted to these products.  When I saw that this line had been discontinued recently, I nearly panicked, but then told myself that this was Goldwell, and surely their new stuff would be just as good, contain the same aloe base, and be great for my hair.  Well this product isn&#x27;t as good, it doesn&#x27;t contain similar ingredients, and, it turned my hair into straw.  First, the fragrance in this shampoo is just too strong and competes badly with any quality perfume one might wish to wear.  This shampoo, after the first hour, starts to smell cheap and cloying.  I like fragrances, even the more \\&quot;informal\\&quot; ones, but this stuff is just too much and doesn&#x27;t wear well.  Most importantly, my hair came out awful--just awful. When I said above that it looked like straw, I mean it felt and looked dry and stuck out from my head in clumps.  IT. LOOKED. AWFUL.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I figured I did something unconsciously stupid, or my hair hadn&#x27;t \\&quot;adjusted\\&quot; or something.  I gave it a week.  I tried using different amounts, I tried using different temperatures of water and number of rinses.  I tried everything to make this work and it didn&#x27;t.  And I couldn&#x27;t get away from the smell.  Plus, my color looks dull and washed out to boot.  I&#x27;ve never been so disappointed in a personal care product in my life, especially since this is a company I&#x27;ve come to value so much over the past many years.  I wrote to Goldwell about my disappointment, but they didn&#x27;t seem particularly concerned about my opinion.  Therefore, I wrote this, and I&#x27;m stocking up on all the old line I can get on the internet.  The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is that I hold out the theoretical possibility that something could be worse than this stuff.</li>
            <li> Quality product and great price.  More than double the volume that I usually get from my hairdresser for about the same price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  My hairdresser recommended this brand.  I don&#x27;t know why.  The product is too light and watery to do much good.  My feels just like it does when I use Panteen.  I&#x27;m goi g back to Biolage.</li>
            <li> This prouct makes my hair feel so good.&lt;br /&gt;The fragerance is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone with brown or red color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;There is also one for blondes.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo &amp; conditioner.  I have tried the regular Goldwell Dualsenses &amp; it just isn&#x27;t the same as the extra rich.  The extra rich is creamier &amp; you get a lot more lather from it.  Makes my hair soft &amp; beautiful.  I also LOVE the way it smells!</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair true to color, but doesnt moisturize as much as I would like. I do have highlighted hair and its very fine.</li>
            <li> Great product, great for over processed hair due to color &amp; heat.  Amazon has the best price for this size.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a couple years now, both the regular and the rich; my hair gets dry in the summer and this shampoo makes my hair silky and shiny all year long; The smell is wonderful.  In my opinion, this shampoo is great and I would recommend it for any color treated hair type.  The value from Amazon for this product is superb as the salon price is much higher.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this was that it spilled all over the box when I received it...</li>
            <li> I like it it has good smell and big bottle you can use it one year</li>
            <li> This product comes highly recommended from my beautician because it&#x27;s complimentary to the coloring product she uses on my hair:)</li>
            <li> The shampoo &amp; conditioner work like they should however, the smell is not the same smell as when I purchase this product from my beautician.</li>
            <li> Arrived yesterday... very happy with this product... salon grade.. very nice.... they se this on my hair all the time at the salon and wanted to get that feeling at home.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, dry, color treated, curly hair. The stylist recommended this brand and I thought they smelled great. The amazon price was better. I find I still need a little extra oomph for the conditioner, but for daily use the set is perfect. I also don&#x27;t have any tangles after using the products. I won&#x27;t re-purchase this is exact set but I may try others in the line.</li>
            <li> Salon quality for sure! Perfect for colored hair. Changes the way you look a shampoo. You will never want to go back to the old store bought stuff!</li>
            <li> My Beverly Hills hairdresser uses this shampoo and conditioner and is happy to sell it to me at exhorbitant prices.  I looked on Amazon and found I could buy the same product my hairdresser uses at really reduced prices ... so guess where I buy my new (wonderful) shampoo and conditioner?</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price! I love how this makes my hair feel; so soft and reduces the amount of frizz.</li>
            <li> Gold well products are all I use!</li>
            <li> The bottles i received must have either been old or not legitimate. I&#x27;ve been using goldwell for 10 years and the smell and quality of these bottles were bad</li>
            <li> Have been using for years. Live this product!</li>
            <li> Works terrific on my hair!  I love it, leaves my hair so soft and smells terrific!</li>
            <li> I love Goldwell products, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this combo, and love it on my hair.</li>
