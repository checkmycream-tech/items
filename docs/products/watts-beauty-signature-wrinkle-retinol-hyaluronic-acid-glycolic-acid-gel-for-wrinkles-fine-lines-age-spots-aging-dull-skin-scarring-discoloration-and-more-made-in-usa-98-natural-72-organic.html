            <li>Very happy : )</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I was in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I did</li>
            <li>since I started using this product I have had compliments on my skin, that I have a healthy glow!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>First time buyer and was impressed with the results!</li>
            <li>Thanks for the wonderful products, I love them !</li>
            <li>Nice consistency.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid is a nice addition to any product-</li>
            <li>Another nice product by Watts Beauty.</li>
            <li>Direct 2U Wholesale is the best CS experience I have had on amazon.</li>
            <li>This product is very light, non-greasy &amp; refreshing.</li>
            <li>Love the way these products go on and disappear with no oily residue.  </li>
            <li>My skin is feeling better than before.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this serum.  </li>
            <li>For anything better you will need a prescription and pay a heck of a lot more.</li>
            <li>Ok product.</li>
            <li>So It is just OK.</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments.  </li>
            <li>I love this products.</li>
            <li>Another Watts product that I love.  </li>
            <li>These are extremely good, quality products at a very reasonable price -- much better than department store products.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any changes in my fine lines.</li>
            <li>I keep it in the fridge as it&#x27;s been hot this summer and the cool gel feels amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li>So pay attention to your cart when you check out, and if you arent sure how you react to a &#x27;proprietary herbal blend&#x27; maybe order 100% pure products instead.*Update, I contacted the seller and they replaced the item with the 100% hyluronic acid and the promotional argan oil...</li>
            <li>are just dehydration lines and they disappear fast with this product:)</li>
            <li>but I was so happy with the other product that I had to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>So glad I decided to try something new!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product &amp; will order more myself!</li>
            <li>this is becoming my new favourite!</li>
            <li>Not too perfumey (I am sensitive to many fragrance additives).  </li>
            <li>and I think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I use it under a daily moisturizer with sunscreen in the morning, but at night I use this and then use rose hip seed oil afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Just thought I&#x27;d let you know of this problem especially if there is someone reading this that does not know how really great your products are, so maybe your not selling as much of this particular product as you could be.</li>
            <li>Has made my face, neck and chest feel great and dark spots have really diminished.  </li>
            <li>Wow - this item is really good; same results as much higher priced products.  </li>
            <li>I also missed out on the free argan oil when ordered from Direct 2u Wholesale.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Watts is exactly what every woman is looking for....</li>
            <li>It is not magic, but it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough not to cause any redness or irritation, but after one use I felt a difference on my skin-smoother texture for sure.</li>
            <li>It helped to clear up my adult onset acne, and gives me a lovely glow.</li>
            <li>I wish I had ordered the Watts Beauty Signature 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum instead.</li>
            <li>It is not doing much for the discoloration.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered the hyaluronic acid before and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much difference in effectiveness between the two and the price on this</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see the difference.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think this did much for me.</li>
            <li>Really like it, absolute must for me.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t notice any difference or any gentle skin peel effects.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought other Watts beauty products  before and have been pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I like all of Watts products, but I don&#x27;t think this is better than other Watts serums.</li>
            <li>Skin is smooth, feels fresh and less wrinkles all around.</li>
            <li>Ill use one day and one night and should get great results come on and tey it with me</li>
            <li>After 2 1/2 months of using 1 tiny drop every morning and every night my eye wrinkles are pretty much gone.  </li>
            <li>Have not used it all yet, but am seeing and feeling improvement in the deep laugh lines.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several of their products, and all of them are very high quality.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement, course, I&#x27;m 73 years old</li>
            <li>The herbal blend listed as the primary ingredient must not work for me, I broke out after using this for a few days.</li>
            <li>I am 70 years young and use this twice daily.  </li>
            <li>62 yrs old and looking much younger.  </li>
            <li>(I am using the anti aging wrinkle serum 100% pure hydronic acid on rest of face and neck- see my other review)  </li>
            <li>I have tried hundreds of products over the last 13 years, starting at age 12 with adolescent acne &amp; now adult acne.</li>

            <li> A few friends have asked what I changed, so the results are showing.  </li>
            <li> but it was too late and empty.</li>
            <li> I was looking specifically for an &amp;#34;active&amp;#34; product- retinols or fruit acids and stumbled upon this little gem!</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I know this has to be wrong.</li>
            <li> It says ; results in painful peel, which has to be wrong.  </li>
            <li> This broke me out bad.</li>
            <li> Ill buy it again and again!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to run out!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other Watts beauty products  before and have been pleased with the results.  Haven&#x27;t had this one very long so I hesitate to give it 5 stars.  Love the way these products go on and disappear with no oily residue.  For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the gel. It is not doing much for the discoloration. I use it twice a day, Morning and night.</li>
            <li> it did diminish my appetite, but I did not lose any weight. my diet was excellent and I exercised 1 hr a day. s.s.</li>
            <li> Forgot what I paid. Never did reorder and my wrinkles are still there. It does soften your skin</li>
            <li> bought this as a night serum &amp; the vitamin c, arganine mix for day. they are great products &amp; do wonders for your skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is feeling better than before.</li>
            <li> 1st time using Watts.  Purchased due to other reviews. Hope this works!</li>
            <li> Havent tried it yet but I was so happy with the other product that I had to give it a try.  Great ingreidents in it . Ill use one day and one night and should get great results come on and tey it with me</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel re-vitalized</li>
            <li> This works as well as the $100 stuff.  Nice consistency. Not too perfumey (I am sensitive to many fragrance additives).  I am 48 and get compliments on my &amp;#34;radiant&amp;#34; complexion.  I am not used to such attention.  I intend to continue using Watts.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this serum.  Has made my face, neck and chest feel great and dark spots have really diminished.  Just ordered my second bottle!</li>
            <li> Dark spots appear to not be as dark after one bottle, so am continuing to use it. TINY bottle however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added 1 year later: About 60-70% reduction in brown spots. I used a heavy application twice a day, morning and night, for over a year and I think it is worth the price. This actually completely removed some skin cancer spots and partially removed others. It is not magic, but it works pretty good. For anything better you will need a prescription and pay a heck of a lot more.</li>
            <li> Somewhat pricey for the amount of product. I&#x27;ve ordered the hyaluronic acid before and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much difference in effectiveness between the two and the price on this is double. I&#x27;ll stick with the other in the future</li>
            <li> wonderful product and seller!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time.  Works well. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Ok product. Still waiting for results though.</li>
            <li> So glad I decided to try something new! I was looking specifically for an &amp;#34;active&amp;#34; product- retinols or fruit acids and stumbled upon this little gem! It is gentle enough not to cause any redness or irritation, but after one use I felt a difference on my skin-smoother texture for sure. Hyaluronic acid is a nice addition to any product- sometimes the lines you think are a sign of aging skin are just dehydration lines and they disappear fast with this product:) I wish I had ordered the larger bottle!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see the difference. It might be too minor that I can&#x27;t tell. I have freckles on my both cheeks and thought this will make them fade away. put on for a week, do not see the result as it promises.  So It is just OK.</li>
            <li> since I started using this product I have had compliments on my skin, that I have a healthy glow! this is becoming my new favourite!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think this did much for me. Maybe I&#x27;m hopeless but I didn&#x27;t see any change in my skin.</li>
            <li> After hearing about peptides on the Dr. Oz Show, I found this product on Amazon and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I&#x27;m very glad I did and I just ordered my second bottle.  I am 70 years young and use this twice daily.  My skin feels and appears tighter and is glowing. I have received many compliments.  I use it under a daily moisturizer with sunscreen in the morning, but at night I use this and then use rose hip seed oil afterwards.  I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have tried hundreds of products over the last 13 years, starting at age 12 with adolescent acne &amp; now adult acne. This product is very light, non-greasy &amp; refreshing. Within days my acne, redness, dryness &amp; scars began to fade. I definitely recommend this product &amp; will order more myself! I&#x27;m afraid to run out!!!</li>
            <li> 62 yrs old and looking much younger.  After 2 1/2 months of using 1 tiny drop every morning and every night my eye wrinkles are pretty much gone.  I had problems using it all over my face, and got pimples after only a day.  (I am using the anti aging wrinkle serum 100% pure hydronic acid on rest of face and neck- see my other review)  I could see actual changes in my eye wrinkles within a week.  A few friends have asked what I changed, so the results are showing.  I have used Neutrogina retinol cream in the past and prefer how this feels, particularly for the summer months.  I will repurchase and continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve been using this for a while, however, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything for my skin. I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement, course, I&#x27;m 73 years old and I have a lot of &amp;#34;sun damage&amp;#34; so I don&#x27;t think any skin cream would work for me.</li>
            <li> I love this products. It works, use it at night. Skin is smooth, feels fresh and less wrinkles all around. Really like it, absolute must for me.</li>
            <li> Wow - this item is really good; same results as much higher priced products.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> It says ; results in painful peel, which has to be wrong.  You need an editor to &#x27;re-Read the features&lt;br /&gt;Because I know this has to be wrong. Just thought I&#x27;d let you know of this problem especially if there is someone reading this that does not know how really great your products are, so maybe your not selling as much of this particular product as you could be. Thanks for the wonderful products, I love them !</li>
            <li> Another Watts product that I love.  I have tried several of their products, and all of them are very high quality.  I also use the hyaluronic acid serum and the Argangold argan oil. These are extremely good, quality products at a very reasonable price -- much better than department store products.</li>
            <li> do not see any evidence of change IN COMPLETION...NO CHANGE IN WRINKLES..I USE FAITHFULLY..</li>
            <li> The herbal blend listed as the primary ingredient must not work for me, I broke out after using this for a few days. I wish I had ordered the Watts Beauty Signature 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum instead. I also missed out on the free argan oil when ordered from Direct 2u Wholesale. So pay attention to your cart when you check out, and if you arent sure how you react to a &#x27;proprietary herbal blend&#x27; maybe order 100% pure products instead.*Update, I contacted the seller and they replaced the item with the 100% hyluronic acid and the promotional argan oil... Direct 2U Wholesale is the best CS experience I have had on amazon.</li>
            <li> Another nice product by Watts Beauty. Leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I keep it in the fridge as it&#x27;s been hot this summer and the cool gel feels amazing on my skin. I use it with their hyaluronic acid serum some nights and I put the Watts argan gold oil over it. I wake up with glowing, hydrated skin!  Very happy : )</li>
            <li> Honestly, I spent years and hundreds of $$ trying every natural skincare line imaginable. Watts is exactly what every woman is looking for....with bonus points for being non toxic!!! My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I was in my 20&#x27;s. It helped to clear up my adult onset acne, and gives me a lovely glow. Ill buy it again and again!!</li>
            <li> First time buyer and was impressed with the results! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like it and will buy it again. Have not used it all yet, but am seeing and feeling improvement in the deep laugh lines.  Pushing 70 and not much that I have tried helps like this does. Only been a few weeks, so will keep using it as I do see and feel a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I like all of Watts products, but I don&#x27;t think this is better than other Watts serums. Don&#x27;t notice any difference or any gentle skin peel effects.</li>
            <li> This broke me out bad. I thought at first my skin was going through a purge, but the breakouts only got worse over six months. I didn&#x27;t notice any changes in my fine lines. My skin was perfect before.</li>
            <li> No change. If I could, I&#x27;d have sent it back but it was too late and empty.</li>
